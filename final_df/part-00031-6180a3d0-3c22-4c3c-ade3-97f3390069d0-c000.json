You play as Yuri Lowell who is a former knight of the Empire.  Yuri not one of these lawful heroes either he plays the antihero that doesn't mind breaking the law for the greater good.I love how you learn your skills on this game, You learn them by equiping your weapons, your weapons will have usually three skills that can be learned by using the weapon for an x amount of battles.I also love they have an archer again.  Last few Tales of games have not had an Archer class character.  So I love having one on this one.The game's humor is where it always is with Tales of games.  You have the hothead Rita who will punch you in the face if you make her mad, you have the super sweet and naive Estelle, you have the perverted Raven the Great who always getting rejected it.  The scary cat Karol who probably scared of his own shadow.This is one of the best rpgs on the 360.  If you're a fan of Tales of you'll love it but, if you never played one this would be a great Tales of Game to get know what Tales of is all about.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2008"}

{"product_name":"B002ZJNWWC","description":"","reviewerName":"Jon","summary":"FUN, but WAY too short in one player campaign mode","reviewText":"This was a very realistic, fun game where it felt like you were a special ops person on a mission in Afghanistan.  The problem is it is WAY too short in regular campaign mode.I have played literally ALL of the Medal of Honor (\"MOH\") games made, from the PS1 to current.  I've always loved them all, except maybe Frontline, for either the replayability or multiplayer (the OLD \"multiplayer\" meaning with a buddy NEXT to you).  Some have been better than others but they've all had their high points that made worth paying the price.  MOH: Rising Sun, for example, was fairly short but when you played the split screen method with a friend next to you or the battle mode against each other, it was very fun.MOH for the PS3 may ROCK with online multiplayer.  I don't know.  I am an \"old school\" person in that I prefer to do the simple one player \"campaign modes\" on games or multiplayer with a friend in the same room as me.  To me regardless of how neat and fantastic a game's ONLINE features are, the regular features should be awesome and the primary focus of a video game designer, with the online features being a secondary as they can be updated later on anyways.Medal of Honor for the PS3 seemed like it was made to try and \"modernize\" all of the previous WW2 PS1 & PS2 editions to compete with the Call of Duty games.  It really does a good job in its authenticity and realism, but the problem is about 6-7 hours (give or take) after starting you're finished.  When I passed it it felt like it should've been at about the half-way point.  Seriously.  It was over and I was waiting through the credits, thinking MAYBE there would be another sequence, but there was not.This was REALLY frustrating, because it WAS a FUN GAME.  It was intense, well thought-out, great graphics, solid storyline and was exciting.I guess it is a \"personal preference\" thing as far as IF the online multiplayer gaming outweighs buying a game and playing it and having fun, but to me it felt like if there is a scale as to the importance of online multiplayer vs campaign one player, this would have been about 70% emphasis on online features to 30% actual one player campaign gameplay.To editorialize a little, since I have loved MOH games SO much the past decade, after playing this game I am frustrated that the future of gaming is emphasizing basically what the internet provided years prior in non-personal gaming where you fight with 12 year olds in other countries online like in World of Warcraft.  I'd rather pay for a game and be able to pop it into my system and play it and have it be worth the money without having to go online and engage with others.  I wish they'd come out with two versions of games like this: 1 where the single player game is stupid and short but online is awesome, and the other where if there is online it is minimal but the single players game is long and worth paying for a CD game.Bottom-line: if you like online gaming then look at other comments for feedback/reviews, but if you are like me in you like being able to sit down after a long week of work and just play a game then this one is not worth the money currently.  Disappointed considering all of the past MOH games I played, still own, and still play when my buddies are over.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2010"}

Huge exciting world that you can explore, interact with, and wreak havoc in. The characters are well crafted and voice acted, the missions are fun and have a nice mix of ridiculous video game fun and Sopranos realism.The complete collection is a great price for a massive amount of game content that will keep you occupied for a very long time. Each of the chapters boots individually and is in its own version of the city. Meaning that they do not add cars and characters to the base game, but instead build upon it in their own virtual versions of the game/city.If you bought and have played the base game, this is still a cheap and nice way to get the two expansions.

I know it's supposed to be a 'tournament' but I like the good old days of always fighting Blanka in the jungle, or Ryu on the temple roof, or Guile on the tarmac...-Rose is less awesome than SFA3... and she looks... odd...-irritating moves at times-no customizing the gameplay to turn of super moves, etc...-easy to unlock content-no ability to track your personal progress with cool stats like Soul CaliburDespite a few areas I found lacking, I love the retro look and feel to this game.

{"product_name":"B0009XEC02","description":"Third installment of the popular SRPG series.  First for the DS handheld.","reviewerName":"Christopher Barrett \"Evil Corgi\"","summary":"A super fun and addictive battle simulator ~","reviewText":"I am new to the Advance Wars series and just picked up a used copy of this game.  Of note... if you want to clear all save data (using DSI XL) then hold L, Select, and right on the control pad while STARTING the game and it will load up and ask to clear all data.  The instructions were written for the old DS system).Being new to this series, I have not had the opportunity to play the previous games and so the characters, story, and, well, everything is new.  The game makes a nice point of separating itself from previous games.  You really don't need all of the back story since most of the characters are treated as being new (they are new to your commanders at least), so you get to learn about them as you play.  Since this story is set in a distant land from the previous titles, you really don't need that connection of story lines.The campaign mode starts slow and the missions are rather easy at first.  You don't really need to read the manual, but it is nice to scan through.  Some of the tutorials are rather vague about what some units do or what they are effective against.Around the 8th mission or so things begin to get more interesting.  Despite being my first time playing AW, I was grabbing S rank on many of the first missions. Later missions I was regularly struggling to finish off the more persistent enemy COs.  There are later missions where you have a finite number of units and once they're gone, they're gone.  Other maps you can build and create units.  Again this is in Campaign mode).I also enjoyed that many of the maps require different tactics to win.  Not every map has the 'kill all enemies' victory requirement.  Some maps will have you taking out specific units, or capturing the enemy base, or destroying a particular fortress.The music changes based on what commanding officer is currently controlling the action.  Each ally and enemy has a unique score.  Some are more mellow, others more intense.  I like the variety though.  I could see many players choosing their favorite COs based on the music (I kind of did!).The enemy AI is actually pretty smart most of the time.  This makes for a good challenge, without the AI being 'cheap'.  Instead it seems the AI will select effective units to use against your units.  They don't seem to send infantry to attack your tank units too often...The real treat with this game is all of the amazing additional content.  There is the online wifi vs mode of course.  But there is a mode where you can battle the computer AI on a number of pre-made maps.  The best extra is the ability to create your own maps and then battle on those.  You get combat points to spend in the shop where you can buy extra maps and COs to use in these extra modes (as well as to change their clothes/hair color if you want).I have only been playing for about 8 to 10 hours so far (mission 18), but I plan to continue updating this review as I progress deeper into the game.  But so far I can see many happy hours spent playing.  And then I can't wait to open up my copy of AW4 Days of Ruin!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2011"}

But when a rival agency enters the scene it's war, and only the best man will be left standing.","reviewerName":"F0X H0UND","summary":"Agent 47 is back, and thatsa good thing.","reviewText":"Agent 47 is back in Blood Money, and like always, he is contracted to assassinate certain people for a variety of reasons. However, as the story progresses, 47's contract firm called The Agency is being killed one by one by a rival firm. So, if you couldn't guess, the last few missions revolve around unveiling and taking down this rouge group.Your main arsenal consists of a variety of customizable guns such as a handgun, shotgun, sniper rifle, SMG, and assault rifle which, like I said, can be customized by the money you earn throughout your missions. You can also pick up enemy guns and tools laying around and add that to your inventory if you wish. Besides the typical guns, you get to use 47's trusty fiber wire for strangling people, sedatives, poisions, remote mines and other nifty gadgets. You can also do some hand to hand which includes punching and headbutting your victims. Oh, and you can climb things and hop railings.In the spirit of the Hitman series, after you knock out/kill just about anyone, you can steal their uniforms. Most of the time you'll need a certain disguise to get close to one of your targets. So for instance lets say you have to get close to a secured wedding and the grrom, first you would need an invitation then from there kill a high ranking guard and take his outfit while disposing of his body. Disposing their bodies can include throwing them off a rail and out of sight, or hiding them in a dumpster of sorts.Now you would think with all these options you are basically forced to be stealthy. Think again. In Blood Money, IO Interactive decided to take a different approach and allow you to determine how to snag your targets in your own way.. be it sneak up and poision a cake so you kill them indirectly, or walk right up to them and plant a slug between their eyes. Its completley up to you, the only thing you have to worry about is armed security personell that will attack you.Which brings me to the next part of the review. There is a \"suspiscion meter\" in which people will see through your disguises. If your in the green, your okay, in the yellow your treading thin ice, and if your in the red... well then your probably not playing too stealthy anyway and enemies are firing upon you. What dissapointed me a little about this is the fact that it seems if you even breathe wrong the AI gets suspiscious.There aren't many flaws to be honest with the exception of the one I just mentioned. Actually I lied, there is one really annoying one and that is the save system. You have your actual saved game, then you have in-game saves which saves your progress in that particular mission. If you were to turn off the system or in some other way quit that mission, then your in-game is erased and you have to start that mission from scratch. Besides those two, the game runs really good...The graphics are pretty good for a multiplatform game. The enviroments look crisp and each character has their own identity, but there is one flaw. Why is everyone jacked out of their minds? I mean I killed a clown and stole his outfit to find out that he had harder abs then I do in real life... ITS A CLOWN FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! Haha, but yeah the graphics are pretty solid though certainly not the best the 360 can offer.The soundtrack is brilliant. Its mainly just classical music with some chorus chimes thrown in for good measure. It actually helps create mood and atmosphere for your entertainment. The guns sound appropriate (ex: handguns sound like handguns) but they sound far too weak. The Desert Eagle, a very powerful magnum, sounds like a 9mm which enraged me.The ending was ultimatley satisfying. Agent 47 is backstabbed by a woman named Diana (she was the lady who gives you all of your mission briefings on the laptop), and it is revealed that she is working for The Franchise - otherwise known as the \"other rival agency\". Anyway, skip ahead a bit and you see 47 laying on a bed of sorts about to be lowered into the ground when Diana comes and lays two Silverballer handguns on your chest and kiss you. She then turns and begins talking to the head of The Franchise. As the credits roll, a heartbeat is repeated and it appears 47 is about to wake up and basically millhouse The Franchise, so what must you do? If you swirl the analog stick a few times Agent 47 wakes up and begins wiping the floor with everyone around him. It was great.Overall, Hitman: Blood Money was a surprisingly fun game with alot of violent thrills and spills. I highly recommend it, though it would have been kind of cool if there was some sort of multiplayer on it... imagine a bunch of cloned 47's working together to pull of a HUGE assasination.. maybe even against The Franchise..hm.. anyway, buy this game if you haven't played it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2007"}

I was expecting a cool action/platformer with a few story segments. Instead, I was dropped straight into the first level with no explanation, and there was no break-up between levels, boss battles, and worlds. I was just so confused.

{"product_name":"B00005Y4Q1","description":"Unreal II: The Awakeningreturns to the fascinating futuristic setting ofUnreal, first visited in 1998. Since then we've had to content ourselves with the excellentUnreal Tournamentmultiplayer combat series. For this first true sequel Epic Games hired Legend Entertainment, who made a name for themselves with theUnreal: Return to Na Paliexpansion pack and the woefully underratedWheel of Timegame (based on the books by Robert Jordan). The result is fun and frantic, if a bit too short-lived.Unreal II's best feature is its lush graphics engine. It's state of the art. All the locations, which range from bizarre alien worlds to those based on the filmAlien, exude dynamic realism. Human and alien characters are well-animated and rendered, but have a cartoonish exaggeration that clashes with the realism of the architecture. The designers were undoubtedly shooting for a comic-book look, which explains why the women look like blow-up dolls with bare midriffs and the men have hulking muscles. The monsters, too, ripple with strength and menace. This style will please some, but is less effective than the more realistic styles employed by similar titles--although at least the art direction is consistent throughout the game.Unrealcast you as a prisoner who--through both good and bad luck--was freed from confinement, but marooned on an alien world. He goes on to become a sort of messiah figure to the four-armed natives, while other, scarier, natives want to kill him. It ends with a cliffhanger that this game does nothing to resolve. Now, you play as a new character who works for the Terran Colonial Authority. You're a space marshal on the ship Atlantis. You and your buxom partner, who looks more like an exotic dancer than a police woman, have to solve problems in a game only tenuously connected with the originalUnreal.Core gameplay and mission design are good, but uninspired. Legend has taken a conservative, almost minimalist approach. They've made a solid shooter that takes full advantage of Epic's state-of-the-art graphics engine, but did nothing to set the shooter apart from the crowd. One hopes thatUnreal II: The Awakeningawakens Epic to the fact thatUnrealis a genuinely interesting franchise that deserves more.--Andrew S.

The weapons are large and look strange with not so great effects. It's the future, futuristic weapons should be smaller with better effects. Powered by the latest version of the unreal engine the graphics are great with beautifull skies but there are no mirrors or cool reflective surfaces.

It takes fun zany ideas related to Heavy Metal and creates a fun world for you to explore,  hack and slash, drive and rock out on your guitar. It's everything I could possibly want in a video game.This game is story driven (as you probably know) with a great cast of characters (mostly of Heavy Metal culture). The story's fun and drives this game to the end. The world this game creates is also fun and beautiful to look at, in fact you can spend hours driving around looking at all the world's locations and fun in-jokes to Heavy Metal Pop-Culture.This game pretty much has three elements: your hacking guys up, driving around in your car (The Deuce!), and giving commands to units in a (VERY) simplified RTS game mechanic. While you can explore the world and chat up the locals, you can also upgrade and customize your car and weapons giving you a feeling of freedom you don't usually see in games these days. Even though these elements have been used in games before (and more complexly), they come together very well for this game making them feel unique and fun.With the gameplay being as fun as it is there were some missions that had me confused as to what to do. This wasn't a big deal and figuring out what to do can be just as fun I can see it frustrating some people. This is honestly my only complaint for the game as a whole.I have no idea why when there's a multi-platform game released that the PS3 gets the buggier version. While the XBOX 360 version of Brutal Legend is beautiful and smooth,  the game looks grainy and plays clunky on the PS3. Also I've noticed graphical shaking and blinking when the audio kicks in on the PS3 (and knocks some of the voices off synch). There's even the usual frequent pauses. I would've thought since the game has an install (that takes up 1.5GB of space!) it'd would run smoother...what the hell?!!So bottom line: this game's a must if you're a Metal music fan. If you have an XBOX 360 get that version. If you just have a PS3 the game's still fun but beware of graphical and control glitches (hopefully we'll get a patch soon!).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2009"}

If you are in a similar boat, perhaps you may find this review helpful because I'm sure this will be thumbed down due to the loyal fans of this game who subscribe to the same group-think.  Objectively, if they were to remove the lens of nostalgia, this game is nothing but average by today's standards.  The graphics are not very good, the gameplay and controls are archaic and frustrating--it is what it is and that is a cleaned up version of PS2 games.  But, you will hear all the arguments for this game, e.g., that this game is different, a thinking man's game if you will, or that it is comparable to art.  Well, too many games have come since that incorporate similar puzzle elements that it really isn't all that different; you will have experienced most of these puzzles if you game frequently.  The art argument really baffles me though. It must have been a pretty game for its time, but I wouldn't put it on a pedestal that it has been lifted upon.  You can expect a different art direction, but don't expect a walk through the Louvre or anything.  The reviews treating it as a Mona Lisa really are a kick in the pants.In conclusion, I understand that we hold certain memories sacrosanct, so if you're a fan of the game and add 2 stars to this, I won't argue with you.  If you haven't played this before and want to play a retro-game, then by all means try it for yourself.  I've realized that for myself, I'll keep my gaming memories as memories because replaying past games just tarnishes those memories.

Trying Zelda, I was baffled at why Link wasn't corresponding to my arm placement.  After being schooled in the gyration of the remote, I just learned you have to swing it and the game assumes what you're doing.Fast forward to 2009, and we have the MotionPlus accessory.  As already mentioned in one of my previous reviews, the MotionPlus adds what the remote should've had in the first place: near one-to-one sensitivity.  (After trying the PlayStation Move, I've found that that has better accuracy.)  I was ecstatic about this feature, and played such MotionPlus games as Wii Sports Resort quite often.  However, I found that the switching in and out of the MotionPlus and jacket became cumbersome, and soon opted for games that did not use the MotionPlus (the remote was a lot smaller and comfortable without it).Fast forward yet again, to 2010, and I recall hearing rumors about the MotionPlus being built in in some Nintendo patents from Japan.  Soon, Nintendo officially announced it, and I kept waiting for the North American release.  Well, here we are, and we finally have what should've been the Wii remote to begin with.They're exactly the same as the previous models, but with MotionPlus inside (cue the stamped reminder on the bottom front).  However, I noticed that the blue lights indicating the player are somewhat brighter.  Not sure if it's me, or if the lights just die out over time, but it was apparent when playing games in the dark.  The blue and pink Wii remotes still come with clear silicone jackets, but that's a personal gripe.So far, I noticed no difference in accuracy between this and the previous MotionPlus bundle.  If you're hard-pressed for money and don't mind switching the MotionPlus in and out of the jacket for various games, this isn't a necessity.  But if you have the choice, or need more controllers, this is a no-brainer.Oh, and yes, this model comes with the silicone jacket and batteries.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2010"}

The Power A feels almost like the Xbox but has a few drawbacks. The first one is that you have to connect a USB receiver to the PS3 which is so old school and not very reliable. I don't know why it isn't bluetooth like all the other controllers. Second is there is a texture on the grips that while feels nice, takes a bit getting used to. And Third, I felt a little lag in the overall controls, probably about 2 seconds but for some games that's fine but others that 2 seconds means your dead. Most of the buttons light up red but they aren't easy to make out because they are all the same color and if your a PS user you know that they all have designated colors so this will throw you off. (ex. square, triangle, circle, X.)Charging was fast but you have to keep your PS3 on for it to charge via the USB plug, it won't fit into most of those charger units.

During certain lunar eclipses the walls of Sheogh weaken and demons burst forth, plunging Ashan into war. And since the dawn of times, the demon legions have been repelled by the allies thanks to a powerful artifact known as the Blade of Binding.    Once again the armies of Sheogh are coming and the Blade will be wielded...     Your journey in the world of Might and Magic will be punctuated with riddles, extraordinary encounters and epic battles against creatures searching for some fresh hero blood. Your hero will travel thanks to a node system, so watch your step as some of these nodes might trigger special actions, hide terrifying traps or even legendary treasures such as forgotten artifacts or secret units.    To stand a chance against your enemies, your hero will have to equip magical artifacts and build up the most powerful army. Your army will be composed of Core, Elite and Champion units, each of them having specific sizes, strengths and abilities. It&#x2019;s up to you to choose wisely each of these units combined to the appropriate artifact and work out the best strategy to wipe out your enemies.

The biggest difference is the depth is far superior that PQ. Every single battle is different from the start, and if you lose and come back to the battle again, the game will give you a completely different setup, which is awesome. Basically, you roam the world, complete main and side quests, collect funds and resources, level-ups, and follow the story. It's all good clean fun.The only criticism that I have is one that many already expressed: you are not able to tell the level rating and the enemy types of your enemy before you engage in a battle. This can often lead to a lob-sided catastrophe if you end up with an enemy who is far superior than you, or you did not equip your troops appropriately. If there is going to be a sequel, this would be the only request that I make: let us preview the battle and prepare for it in advance so we don't end up fighting an unwinnable battle, or having to retreat and get penalized for it by losing gold/jewels.All in all, a great game for puzzler RPG fans!EDIT: 4/26/2011I just finished the game at (estimated) 95% completion.

Whether it was the anti-police sentiment of GTA 1, the mass-genocide potential of GTA III or the heavy drug use of Vice City, the entire series hasn't exactly distanced itself from controversy over the years. The concept of pushing the envelope to the point of cultural war is far from novel to the men and women behind these games, so your average gamer is by this point powering up each new GTA with a certain set of expectations. If you remain loyal the series today, you're expecting to be shocked by the vulgarity and humbling potential reality of it all. Bearing that in mind, there's no denying the fact that San Andreas, \"coffee\" or not, is Rockstar's most ambitiously adult-flavored outing yet.After a brief hiatus into semi-homage with the Scarface meets Miami Vice storyline of Vice City, San Andreas effectively brings the series back into the territory of wholly original storytelling. The saga begins as Carl \"CJ\" Johnson, the story's focus, returns home to the city of Los Santos to discover his mother in the ground and his friends and family on the losing end of a bitter gang war. His old running buddies resent him for leaving them to try his luck in Liberty City five years ago, the streets where he was raised have been overrun by drug dealers, his brother hasn't forgiven him for missing out on their mother's funeral and a corrupt police department is breathing down his neck, just waiting for him to make a mistake. In short, things could be better. Fortunately, despite their uncertainty in his loyalties, CJ's friends have no qualms about bringing him back up to speed in the gang's business and allowing him to prove himself through blood, sweat and tears, (or various, mission-based tasks, as it were) and the driving force of the story revolves around this struggle to regain CJ's previous level of respect among his peers while making things right around the homestead. The main characters of the story are rock solid, and Carl is easily the most realistically flawed lead in GTA history. He made some mistakes before the story began and he'll make a few more before it ends, but he never crosses that thick line between sympathetic hero and irredeemable monster, even after curb-stomping a few grandmas. I think it's the game's incredible comedic timing and dry wit that keep CJ appealing; whether it's his brother picking at his driving or his often-venomous conversations with random pedestrians, there's always time for a snide comment or sarcastic remark after a brutal hit and run.The setting, a dead ringer for early-'90s Los Angeles (with clones of San Francisco and Las Vegas playing supporting roles) is as much a player in the story as the individuals themselves. You can almost feel the weight of the town's imminent civil unrest pressing down on your shoulders throughout the early chapters, and as things build to a climax, that impending explosion just gets closer and closer to reality. There's an extremely angry tone to this game, even when compared to those that came before, and on the whole it feels much more mature (for lack of a better word) and true-to-life than its often-cheesy immediate predecessor. The feel of impending doom you're charged with throughout the game slowly, casually builds to a horrific boiling point that provides the backdrop for one of the most enjoyable, seat-of-your-pants final levels I've ever played. I never thought I'd play a game with a more rewarding, exciting, Hollywood action movie-style climax than I saw in the very first Halo, but if San Andreas doesn't surpass it, it undeniably comes extremely close.Unfortunately, while the storytelling elements of San Andreas have markedly improved in the years since Vice City, the actual gameplay experience has taken a hit or two. Don't hear me wrong, the open-ended style of gameplay that defined the previous titles in the series is still here in full effect. It's still a blast to jog around the city with a blunt object and beat random civilians into submission, or to stand in the middle of the street and look around as motorists become more and more frustrated with you for blocking their way. There just wasn't as much room for innovation here as there was between GTA3 and Vice City. The addition of motorcycles, airplanes and helicopters were substantial changes to the game, natural steps forward from what had been established before. This chapter's additions of bicycles, an intricate character customization system and a variety of level-based skill power-ups isn't quite the same, and often serves to aggravate rather than amuse. Instead of pulling up to a destruction derby or BMX race and trying your luck right away, for example, you must first spend hours building up your \"driving ability\" or \"biking ability.\" Some missions require you to gain some weight by eating a dozen fast food meals, while others ask you to lose some weight by running aimlessly on a treadmill for fifteen or twenty minutes. Playing a game shouldn't feel like work, and that's what a lot of the activities required to build your stats feel like.This was my first experience with the series on the Xbox (I own PS2 copies of the last two GTAs) and I found the translation of controls to be a little awkward, to say the least. Most of the buttons are a simple, literal masking of the PS2's functionality onto the Microsoft controller, such as the \"A\" button as a run / fire button or the \"X\" button for jumping. Where the box really loses ground is with its lack of a second \"L\" and \"R\" trigger, as well as the additional freedoms bestowed upon players with the right analog stick and the camera angle it controls. Where the L2 and R2 buttons gave players the freedom to easily look to the left, right and behind them while behind the wheel of an automobile, that same functionality is mapped to the Xbox's mysterious black and white buttons with disastrous results. On my Type-S controller, those particular buttons are so small and out of the way that I was almost immediately screaming for the return of my old Dual Shock. Performing a precise drive-by shooting, which is a necessity on several missions, is nearly impossible with these tiny buttons... and forget about looking behind you while you roam the highways of Los Santos.Where the series has really begun to show its age with this installment is in its graphics. Though the size of the map is just insanely large, close to three times the size of Vice City, the contents are almost identical visually. Though the old engine from GTA III has been tweaked to the very limits with this release, it's still that same old engine at heart. Player models don't exactly hold up when compared with similar games released within the same year. The variety of city buildings and wall decorations is still impressive, but the actual quality of those textures leaves a lot to be desired. After hearing almost endless praise about the differences between the last two games on PS2 and on Xbox, I was left feeling extremely underwhelmed after my first experience in San Andreas.Fortunately, the same shortcuts apparently taken with the visuals are not repeated in the audio department. The soundtrack to San Andreas, while not quite as awe-inspiring as that of Vice City, is still a behemoth of its own and does an outstanding job of setting the tone for an area and covering a wide range of genres, tastes and ethnicities. Hop into a car in the ghettos of Los Santos and you're likely to hear an excellent collection of the founding fathers of hip hop or the pioneers of gangsta rap. Steal a car in the forest-coated, far less populated towns well outside the city limits, and you're much more likely to hear some country. While the obvious focus is on rap and hip hop, there really is something for everyone here, and the collections showcased on each station are almost indisputable. The famed comedy of the on-air commercials, personalities and programming choices, while not quite up to the same level as the last two games, is still good for a laugh or two and far, far above the level of GTA's closest competitors. The sophomoric humor herein takes a step away from the sarcastic tone of previous games in favor of a slightly cheesier bathroom joke or two.Well, when push comes to shove, I can't say that I got all I was expecting out of this package. I intentionally waited for the Xbox release for this one, hoping to enjoy it in all its glory on what's quickly becoming the most desirable platform, but in the end I would've been better off just buying it on the PS2 in the first place. The Box offered little to no visual separation over previous titles on the Sony system, and what difference I did notice in load time was balanced out by an occasionally poor control scheme and horrible problems with invisible buildings. Despite some weak innovations in the gameplay, this is still a lot of fun to play and I'd recommend it just for the ongoing insanity of that final stage, but don't expect to be completely blown away, because this is hot-and-cold stuff.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2005"}
{"product_name":"B007VJ06Q6","description":"","reviewerName":"PM_SuperFreak","summary":"One of the best games on Vita; fun!","reviewText":"DC is a solid action RPG with a lot of depth in terms of customization. Character skills and weaponry are the main items that contribute to the overall depth of the game, which makes this game very addicting. Level design and artwork are great as well. One might argue that this game will get repetitive over time given that many side missions encourage you to revisit levels that you have already played, but this is entirely optional.  Every mission earns you XP which contributes to you leveling up, which in turn allows you to upgrade your skills with the skill points that are rewarded to you.Once you unlock online play, which takes place around the 5-hour mark in campaign mode, you have the optional to team up with others online which is a necessity if you wish to complete the plot in its entirety. While this seems like a forced way of making you play online, it generally works out well. This can be good or bad depending on what kind of player you get. It can get frustrating in cases if other players don't work towards the goal. For example, without giving away any spoiler, on one mission to retrieve a talisman, if all players don't work together, you cannot defeat the boss, which forces you to try again.Some players have reported frame rate issues especially when there is a lot of activity on the screen at one time. After about 12 hours of play, I have not yet seen anything noticeable yet either online or off.All in all, I really enjoyed this game, much more than I expected.

{"product_name":"B000MUW98O","description":"InBurnout Paradiseplayers are treated to a rarity in the video games universe: a complete reinvention of an established franchise that equals, if not betters any of the previous games in the series. Yes, this is a large claim, but one that can be explained in a single phrase: Next-Gen Freedom.Driver's heaven is a wide open worldIn Paradise City even cars can fly.View larger.Go for broke in 'Marked Man' Mode.View larger.Nothing is off limits, even head-on crashes.View larger.Start a race any time with 'Easy Drive.'View larger.Although theBurnoutseries&#146; over the top mobile action has been its calling card since it ignited audiences on the PS2 in 2001, and later on the first generation Xbox console,Burnout Paradiseis the first game in the series that has been designed specifically for play on Next Generation consoles. This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Ugur Galatali \"Legolord\"","summary":"It's still good.","reviewText":"Well, I got a little pissed when I heard that there was no crash mode anymore, or split screen multiplayer mode.  But after playing the game and spending hours on it with friends, I didn't really care for it much because the game is so much fun.I see people complaining about getting lost while racing, thus losing the race, like they haven't done so in real life.  This is an open world racer, you're not in kindergarten anymore, you won't see giant road signs telling you which way to go.  Instead you get a little pointer, use it.Also, another complaint is when you lose a race there is no retry option, well boo-hoo, I'm sure Hamilton wanted to retry the last race of the 2007 season when he lost the championship to Raikkonen in F1.  Point is, if you don't get to retry in real life you don't get to retry here, I like it, deal with it.A few words to fellow gamers, don't be a wuss and pause the game every ten seconds and go to map screen.  If you want to enjoy the game live the game, learn the roads, that's why you are paying $50+.  I too lost races making a wrong turn at the last intersection, don't make a fuss about it.  If you're gonna cry like a baby don't buy this game, go play Mario Cart Racer or something.As you can see I like this game, I highly enjoy it and recommend it to all true Burnout fans.  It's a different experience and I will be happy to see crash mode or offline multiplayer mode in the next installation but it is what it is now, enjoy it.*** UPDATE - March 2009 ***Company Support for this game is great, when I finished the game 100%, I thought I wouldn't go back, yet even the free content adds so much to the game. I rearly touch a bike game but I love it in this game.  Bikes are nicely balanced and easy to control.

The quests are the same  like \"Go kill 5 of these\" or \"Take this to person X\" (who is often only like ten feet away). The story is also forgettable. While there are about a half dozen different races and another half dozen classes, starting multiple characters is a chore since there is only one starter island and is very tedious.

It's always been a technically enjoyable game on a gameplay level and a funny and entertaining game on a story level.  Fable 3 is a bit more experimental than 1 & 2 and suffers a bit because of it.  But in all, it's still a great game.My biggest complaint with Fable 3 is the odd distribution of polish.  Some aspects of the game, like the combat, are highly polished.  Others look like they could have spent a few more months in the oven.  The game is often buggy and, in the case of multiplayer, just downright broken.  The game quite often suffers from framerate drops as well.The newest feature is the main menu, which is now a \"Sanctuary\" managed by Jeeves who is voiced by John Cleese.  This is a great new addition to the game and though could use some improvements (e.g. rental property management is very tedious) actually works extremely well.The combat has also been changed and improved in my opinion.  It's still one button for melee, one for ranged and one for magic.  You can hold the buttons for a more powerful flurry attack and if you time your attacks well, you can perform finish moves.  They've removed the Ogres as enemies, but now you will encounter \"hero\" enemies that prevent all the random enemy encounters from being merely a pushover.The treasure/loot still suffers from the same lack of variety as the previous games.  There's only 1 or 2 different weapons that make sense to use and the clothing sets are quite limited.  Treasure chests very rarely give interesting new weapons or clothing.  You can change your dog model, but there are only 2 different dogs to choose from: Lab or Collie.  For a Brit-made game, I am fully disappointed there is no Bulldog.The game world is larger but easier to get around with.  But there's no minimap (!!) -- making it very difficult to explore and determine where you've already been and where you need to go.  The golden path that is your compass is buggy and often doesn't show up.  The minimap that you can view in the Sanctuary is a caricature of the region and is in no way helpful as a detailed minimap.  This is quite upsetting.The quests are pretty fun, often funny and certainly diverse.  The second half of the game is you as king or queen.  I actually enjoyed this part of the game -- though there is certainly room for improvement.  I found it nice that when the game is completed, you are the hero king and everyone in Albion recognizes you that way.  It's like it is you enjoying the \"ever after\" part of \"they lived happily ever after\".In all, I found Fable 3 to be an interesting twist on the series if a bit too experimental and unpolished.  I look forward to Fable 4.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0042YM9GI","description":"","reviewerName":"JOHN SPANGLER \"Johnny Spang\"","summary":"Is it the Kinect game we've been waiting for?","reviewText":"Man, I was very excited about this game and I was even more pumped when I finally got my hands on it from Amazon!  Well. I played it for about an hour last night. First thing off the bat you're going to notice is that the interface of navigation in the menus is obtrusive and not user friendly. Definitely was missing Harmonix ease here. Dance Central did this so well. In the Experience, they use your Silhouette of your body and arms to navigate around. Looks very cool and creative on paper, but it just felt awkward to me. But once you get out of the menus it's pretty self explanatory.The Experience lets you check out some training videos which are near the realms of dumb and useless. The warmups consists of you stretching and moving your toes around. The people on these videos come off as laughable and not enjoyable to watch at all, they just come off as annoying and I don't think they really do anything for the game itself. The girl was nice to look at though. When you skip those videos, you can go directly to the training of the songs you want to practice. The game lets you practice the songs in multiple intervals. While this is very helpful in learning the songs and dance moves, but the problem is that you have to stop, go into a menu and choose what you want to do next. I want to keep moving, not stop and go into a menu please!!! Dance Central was perfect with this as you could go through a whole song and training without stopping.The dancing itself feels good and I felt like the Kinect sensor was doing the job right on this game. When I messed up, the game knew, when I danced well, the game knew. That's what makes it fun, perfecting Michael Jackson's moves. Mind you, this is Michael Jackson and many of these songs are directly from his videos and to say anyone can jump on in and get great grades, you're going to disappoint yourself. Michael Jackson The Experience is far more difficult than Dance Central IMO. I'm a huge fan of Michael, but some of the moves are really too much for me. There are different degrees of difficulties depending on the song you pick, but even on the easy ones, I felt a step behind trying to master the moves. The dance moves come up in the corner of the screen similar to what Dance Central did, but I still felt like I was playing catchup with the moves that seem to come at you at a frantic pace. My girlfriend quit playing out of frustration after only finishing 1/2 of Billy Jean. Your image on the screen looks pretty sweet and the silhouette makes you really feel like you're part of the game next to the other dancers. Again, the difficulty of this game may make an immediate impact for first time buyers and people who just aren't meant to dance. But if you're patient, there is tons of fun here for Michael Fans. The music is crisp and amazing to listen to and the dancing can be a good workout. Overall, I'm glad I got it, it's probably not the ultimate Michael Jackson Experience we all were expecting, but if you're a Kinect Owner, this is probably the best way to Experience, the Experience!  Now, Just Beat it and go get it!Note: I didn't try the singing with my microphone, nor do I plan too. I heard it works pretty well. Singing is not required to play the game, so dont' worry. You can use your XBOX Headphones MIC if you want to try. Other Microphones are available for the 360 which might give you better sound.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2011"}

Footprints will be left in mud, for example, but only until it rains and then they will wash away. Lara's shirt will also get wet, and she's more likely to lose her grip if she is standing on a slippery, rain-soaked ledge. When the sun comes out, her shirt will dry and the slippery surfaces regain their friction.In Underworld, Lara also has a lot more flexibility in how she makes her way through a level, as there is often more than one way to get from here to there. She can now climb walls with texture and rocky outcroppings to reach areas she previously wouldn't have been able to access.All of these additions have been made to give the game a non-linear, open feel. Players can interactive with the environment by doing things they find to be intuitive, and the game will respond in an appropriate way. When Lara interacts with trees, for example, she will push aside leaves using either one or two hands depending on whether or not she's holding something. These details give a lifelike, immersive sensation to the game.New Melee Combat SystemUnderworld introduces a new melee combat system that requires players to strategically strike with offensive, defensive, and evasive maneuvers. Lara can now attack enemies with different punches, kicks, knees, and other acrobatic onslaughts. Items lying on the ground, such as poles that were previously walked on, can be picked up and swung at enemies. Players can also perform a greater variety of actions with weapons; for example, Lara can now hold onto a ledge with one hand and fire a gun with the other.Realistic Enemy and Animal AIThe AI in Tomb Raider: Underworld has also taken a big step forward--both enemies and animals now make independent decisions based on their surroundings, employ ambush and squad tactics when fighting, and will retreat if deemed necessary.With updated graphics and a more immersive and realistic gameplay, Tomb Raider: Underworld will have both fans and newcomers excited about the newest installment in this popular video game-pinup franchise.Tomb Raider: Underworld is loaded with a new melee combat system, various weapons, and smarter AI for both enemies and animals.","reviewerName":"S.

Amazon's servers are incredibly slow from my experience.When the original debut trailer was first release everyone was in awe, including myself.  But this game deviated so far from that premise.  Rather than an emotional/riveting story, it is similar to Capcom's Dead Rising with cheesy voice acting to boot.  The game is an action-RPG in first person, similar to Fallout/Elder's Scroll series.There are four characters to choose from, they each have different stats but game-play is similar no matter who you choose. The game is melee based so you can pick blunt or bladed weapons and hack away.  There are also guns in the game but ammo is limited and shooting is the weakest link in the combat system.  All weapons can be upgraded with Mods found through out the game and comes with a durability factor.  Or I should say the lack of durability.  You will spend most of the time repairing them.  Who would have thought a lead pipe only last for 10 hits or so (a little exaggeration here, but you get my point).Combat control is very inaccurate and clunky.  While aiming/targeting specific areas of the body, the reticle will move to the torso.  Its basically a console port so auto-targeting is on. There are also a few bugs but I haven't encountered one that's a game breaker.  On the technical side, you'll notice occasionally textures are slow to load and other graphical bugs. I'm running this game on SLI Geforce 480 so no performance issues encountered.  Switch to setting to LAN (instead on Internet) if it keeps bugging you about someone wanting to join you session.Overall, the game is mediocre but if you enjoy killing zombies, don't pass it up.  Dismembering the undead is satisfying and very gory.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2011"}

I am not exactly a fan of the game publisher. I bought one game from them before and was disappointed. Instead of a game, this is more like a limited interactive graphic novel. There are very limited choices you can make and the story is very linear. It is a matter of an art of story telling. The story is touching and intense enough, the characters are masterfully crafted and the execution is splendid. It is almost like watching an anime, which I like. I really feel close to the characters, as if I am one of them. (Spoiler alert. Skip to next paragraph.)

{"product_name":"B004NRN5DU","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"Nishi","summary":"Hard single player game, Laggy multiplayer","reviewText":"I finally got around to playing the spiritual sequel to Demons Soul's and it's just as hard as the predecessor. With this game though I had a friend to play through the game with me, which is much more fun than soloing through it.Story:Like Demons Souls, this game only has a minor story. They have a few cut-scenes in the game, but not really that much. You can also do some side missions as well that may have lasting impacts later on in the game. Other than that the game doesn't really have the story and is more based on the gameplay and difficulty.Gameplay:Here is where the real game is at, and trying to master the fighting styles in this game can be quite fun. You have to dodge, block, and parry your way through the various enemies that pop up along the way. You level up based on how many Souls (Experience and currency) you collect and each stat you increase makes your soul level go up.Along with that if you play online and are a human you can get invaded at any time if you haven't killed that sections boss yet. You can also summon a friend to join your game to co-op with you (so in order to co-op you have to take a risk of being invaded). It makes for a really fun experience having to worry not only about the enemies, but human players as well.While on the subject of PVP, it is a bit disappointing since I ran into a bunch of lag and ended up being killed in ways I shouldn't have and have had my weapon hit the enemy but no damage was calculated. Also, the camera seems to mess with you a lot at times and can get annoying and move slow when you are trying to fight enemies you need to avoid. Summoning friends can get really annoying as well, since it fails all the time and takes a few times to connect, if you're lucky the sign shows up at all.Soundtrack:The soundtrack is pretty cool, especially the boss fights. Makes the boss fights even more epic, and even if you wipe to them over and over, at least you have a cool theme to go along with that. The opening theme has parts of the Demons Soul's theme in it so I really enjoyed that.Graphics:The graphics have improved over Demons Soul's from what I can tell and the enchanted animations look really well made and make you stand out. The enemies look quite unique in this game, and I didn't really find myself finding ones that looked the same (except for the very first ones). You go to so many different locations and they all look amazing. They did a great job in creating the setting in this game.Verdict:If you were planning on playing this by yourself I say pick this up. It's a great challenge that not many games have these days. New game+ is pretty hard though. If you're looking to PVP or co-op with a friend, rent it. I ran into so much frustration with this part of the game, so I can't recommend buying it if you just want to do those things. Overall it's a fun, challenging game that only some gamers would want to play.~Written Feb, 2012Positives:* Challenging game* Tons to do* Hard to get 100% achievement list* Great dark settingNegatives:* PVP lag* Co-op failed to connect a lot* Sometimes you have to fight the camera","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2012"}

Believe it or not, I carry my PS3 with me when I travel (to visit my friends or family). My carry-on baggage is heavy and I have received comments quite a few times from the people who work at the airport. Now with Vita, I can save big room and still be able to enjoy high quality games. That said, the vita is an amazing handheld. (Not a lot of people mentioned that)The sound quality is by far the best of all handhelds I have owned (including a few pads). I can use it as MP3 player while I travel (sound quality on par with any Sony Mp3 players).The vita has good potential to cross play games on different platforms. There are already two games (hustle king and Motorstorm RC) which allow you to play on either PS3 or Vita and keep all the saves. You buy one on PS3, you get a free copy on Vita, vice versa. So your progress will be cloud-saved on the PSN server and you can pick up easily if you decide to play on another platform console. I am not sure whether this is profitable for Sony to offer more such games. But definitely it's a huge step forward and I am interested to see how Sony is going with this. I will skip all the good things people have kept talking about here (high definition graphics, touch control, design , great launch games etc).I do have one complaint. I guess it is due to the underwhelming market of sale number. There aren't enough games for me to choose from. I could not get a copy of Shinobido 2 for example in any of my local stores. The only way is to order it from online (or download, but I prefer physical copies). I really hope PS vita will do well and more games are produced because trust me, this is a very solid and superb gaming device!! I am sorry to see Vita isn't having a great sale number at this moment. On the other hand, over priced products like the new IPAD gets million sales from a single launch day. Vita is a much better handheld when it comes to gaming and it's well balanced unlike those money sucking little devices produced by APPLE(I know some people will hit dislike because I say this, but I need to speak out). When it comes to choices between 1. being capable of doing a million ordinary things and \"capable of\" is all you can say,  and  2. doing one thing but doing it great. I choose the second one.If you enjoy games on different levels, do consider this portable device.

However, with duping (the ability to duplicate any item in-game), everything got just way too easy. You could beat Diablo without much of a thought as everybody had the most powerful of weapons.Diablo II was much more challenging as that bug has been resolved. The graphics were improved and the ability to learn only a certain number of skills added a real strategic portion to the game.The only bad thing that Blizzard should have resolved is what is known as a Baal run.  Baal is a new character in the expansion.  He throws four groups of minions at you to defeat and you end up getting a lot of experience.  If you don't kill Baal, you can do this over and over and over again racking up a lot of experience points.  Unfortunately, this makes leveling up and advancing waaaay to easy and took the challenge out of the game.  Now the only challenging thing is getting to Baal.  So if you are playing online on Battle.Net, you are playing against characters who did Baal runs for a couple of hours and are now more buff than imaginable.  Blizzard should have fixed this a long time ago.After playing for several years, I think I'm going to \"graduate\" to World of Warcraft (also by Blizzard) which I've noticed is quite similar in many ways.

Kids under the age of 12 may get scared by some of the creepier monsters, and there is quite a bit of blood and gore (although you can barely see it on the small GBA screen).If you can deal with those two things, however, I highly recommend that you get this game. I played the other two GBA Castlevania games, and this seems to be the best so far. It has a good plot (for a video game), it has over 300 special abilities to collect and trade with your fiends, er, friends using the GBA link cable, and it is a rare action/adventure/RPG/platformer game, which tends to add up to a good game. The gameplay is fun and action-packed, the RPG elements include multiple weapons, from pocket knives to lances to the traditional Castlevania rope to even a hammer for some reason, as well as various types of armor to increase your defense and power. It even has an element system (water beats fire monsters, etc.) It is a truly great game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-10-2003"}
{"product_name":"B002I0IIPY","description":"","reviewerName":"WhitWire Reviews \"Ryan\"","summary":"Welcome Back, Sega","reviewText":"After first hearing about Sonic's new game for the holiday season of 2010, I was not immediately impressed by it. After receiving Sonic Unleashed earlier that year, I thought this game would be just as the concept in Unleashed. However, buying the game and actually playing it would prove me wrong.The main story in this game takes place in Dr. Eggman's space amusement park. Eggman claims this amusement park to be built from a sense of remorse for his past misdeeds. However, Sonic knows better than to trust what Dr. Eggman says. As a result, he and his friend Tails investigate the space amusement park and discover that Eggman is trying to take control of aliens called Whisps. From then on, your job is to save the Whisps.Gameplay, I have to admit, is very fun and very replayable. To add to this fact, you can use a total of four different controller types: Wiimote with Nunchuk, Wiimote alone, Gamecube Controller, and Classic Controller. Whichever controller you choose, you still play Sonic Colors with the same type of concept.Sonic is the only playable character in this game. One of the first things I noticed was the fact that he had a double jump--something that I've only seen him with in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. To add to this, he has a boost gauge that can be filled up by collecting white whisps. This boost gauge, however, must be used carefully so that you don't run out of boost energy or send yourself flying to your death.Main gameplay aside, let's talk about the whisps. There are eight types of whisps. White whisps fill up your boost gauge, blue whisps can turn Sonic into a lazer, yellow whisps turn him into a drill that can dig underground, green whisps let him hover and perform the light-speed dash, pink whisps turn him into a spiky ball that can grip onto any surface and perform the spin dash, purple whisps turn him into a ravenous creature that destroys anything in its path, and orange whisps turn him into a rocket that lets him blast off into the sky. These whisps are the main gimics of Sonic Colors--and can help you to acheive medals which you can use in the \"Sonic Simulator\".The Sonic Simulator is a part of the game where you and a friend can make your way to the goal ring at the end. However, I prefer doing this alone--as doing it with a friend often results in many deaths. The reason for these deaths result in the fact that if you leave your friend behind or if you simply jump on them while they're already trying to jump to a platform, they will die. However, Sonic Simulator gives you the chance to gain the chaos emeralds and become Super Sonic in regular stages.Sonic Colors is a fantastic game--and it should be in every Sonic fan's library. Even non-Sonic fans will enjoy this for its classic storyline, multiple gimics, and intense platforming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2011"}

Graphically, it cannot compare to Halo 3, which in itself cannot compare as well to games released this year (Halo 3 is, of course, already 3 years old).  But Halo's topnotch story, voice acting and script leaves the original, almost 10 years old, as one of the best games of all time.

A friend had received the system for Christmas, and had already decided that the only game he'd be playing for the next six months was this one. A little cautious myself, I picked up the gigantic black controller with the clear bubble in its center, and embarked on the first of many four player fiascos. Truth be told, this is a very easy game to pick up on. Much like the N64's Goldeneye, it's quite simple to learn but nearly impossible to master. And, also as in Mr. Bond's Nintendo 64 excursion, there's really nothing I can say here to prepare you for the absolute madness which awaits you in the multiplayer mode.Perhaps the most notable feature of the multiplayer mode is the ability to customize your character. With the Box's hard drive allowing for an almost infinite number of saves, it doesn't take long for the list of names in your player select screen to become unwieldy. It's something that was previously reserved for online PC players; there's no more guessing about who just killed you or who's controlling the tank. It's printed, right there on your screen, in bold letters. In addition to that, there's the underspoken ability to create, tweak and save your own game types. If you're hooked on deathmatches with multiple vehicles, no radar and infinite grenades, you need only make that selection once. The system saves all the information, so you won't need to select all the same settings the next time you're hungry for a deathmatch. It's an enormous part of what makes Halo so good, but it's also something that's very easily overlooked.The single player, mission-based game is unbelievable. It amazes me how far the First Person Shooter has come since it took its first baby steps in the mid 90s, and Halo is currently the cream of the crop. You portray the \"Grand Master\", a legendary warrior cryogenically frozen and revived in Humanity's darkest hour. Players never see his face, but his deep voice quickly confirms both his identity and his authority. There's a REASON he's our last hope, and the experience heard in his voice misleads gamers into believing they're legends in and of their own right. It's a really cool feeling, to say the least.Unfortunately, for a game of such visual importance, the actual characters themselves aren't everything I'd hoped for. You'll endure a few cutscenes that probably shouldn't be there; eyes and lips move clunkily. The seams are showing. Make no mistake, the big names and faces in Halo don't give Final Fantasy X's cast a run for their money. The captain (one of the game's centerpiece characters) is emotionless, and difficult to form an emotional tie with... which takes away from the impact of later levels, when you race against time to save his life. Cortana, a computer-generated hologram, is obviously meant to be the most visually stunning character in the game... and even she falls short. The real stars of the show are the enemies, but they're afforded the luxury of being completely new designs.But while the character models aren't as incredible as I'd expected, the surrounding scenery alone makes up for it, and then some. You'll see individual blades of grass. You'll see the blood squirt momentarily out of an enemy, moments after you've shot him, and then pulse along the rhythm of his heartbeat. You'll hide behind individual leaves, or behind the thick mist accumulating beneath a waterfall. It's simply unbelievable.I'll again draw the comparison to Goldeneye when it comes to controls. There's no question, the system's controller was designed specifically with this game in mind. After a couple plays, you'll be jumping, tossing grenades, firing, ducking, and striking enemies with the butt of your rifle. For god's sake, there's a button devoted to turning on and off your flashlight... AND IT'S CLEAR. Xbox developers may as well have labeled it the 'flashlight button.' Add to that a built in rumble feature, dual analog sticks (emulating the feel of a PC Shooter, where players use the keyboard and the mouse) and easy-to-reach trigger buttons, and you've got a sweet control setup. I don't have a bad thing to say about it.Where the visuals of non-playable characters are lacking, the audio most definitely is not. There are hundreds of possible quotes from this game, more depending on which difficulty level you're playing under. That's right, the tougher your setting, the more mature the language surrounding you. They weren't kidding when they said things get more realistic on the hardest difficulty. The voice acting is on par with a major motion picture, with a few exceptions. The production is just incredible... everything is crystal clear, whether you're chatting in an echoing hallway or on the battlefield. Dolby Digital Surround is supported, and that too is top notch. Nothing can express the value of knowing which direction a rocket is coming from, especially when your back is turned.The largest gripe I have with Halo is its bizarre, seemingly random awarding of checkpoints. No lie, I've been in the middle of the firefight when the system has decided to save my progress. While it doesn't immediately affect me, it does serve as a point of intense frustration when I die further down the line. Instead of reappearing in relative saftey to attempt the task again, I'm dropped right back into that firefight. It gives the player an unfair handicap, and ALWAYS catches him / her by surprise. I'd have much rather had the option to assign my own checkpoints.What it all boils down to is this; Halo is worth buying an Xbox over. It's the end-all, be-all Microsoft desperately needed to put themselves onto the map as a force in the home console business. It's everything you've heard it is, and more.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2003"}

{"product_name":"B001E8VB3C","reviewerName":"Dredded Deuce \"Dredded Panthyr\"","summary":"Finally a GREAT Batman game and a great comic game.","reviewText":"My first impressions (5 hrs in)  **WARNING: THERE MAY BE SOME SPOILERS!!**Batman: Arkham Asylum has a deja vu feel to it. A creepy, yet happy feel to it. That \"I played this game not too long ago\" kind of feel. The last time I played a game about someone creeping thru a madhouse where death lurked at every corner, where the ambient sound made your spine tingle, where ads and voices made everything seem alright although quite clearly it was not...was Bioshock.Before you all get yourselves into a furor, Batman is NOT a Bioshock ripoff or should there ever be an apples to apples comparison but this game has so much depth and weight to it, this is the only other game that I can conjure up in my mind of the feel.For what it's worth, all the hype and delays of this game so far have been well worth the extra wait and it shows.  The game's opening sets the mood for the story that we all know about as far as the Joker luring Batman into Arkham Asylum to spring a trap and we later find out the Bane is the part of the key to this trap. The fact that so far having Paul Dini writing this macabre story really reflects on how polished this game plays. The mystery is set up, cops have betrayed each other in order to further the Joker's goals and a warden with political aspirations are all integral part of the Dark Knight's quest to find out what is going on inside Arkham and teh Joker's twisted brain.So how well does it play? So far it's pretty smooth in terms of playability and as you progress you can power up Batman's abilities and this is one place where it doesn't play like Bioshock....hehehe...In Bioshock where you had an elaborate setup to have to 'buy' certain abilities from vending machines, Batman's power up system is a straightforward system where you earn points through fighting. The fighting mechanics takes a little bit of getting used to as for rooms where you have to clear out thugs and hechies, you have to strategize your attacks and trust me, Rambo-ing thru a room is the quickest way to your death. This game makes a simplistic use of stealth abilities and it's to a point where instead of making it an overly complicated mmechanic as seen in some recent stealth wanna-be's released ** COFF COFF Velvet Assassin** , it organically fits right  into the game. As you play you learn how to glide, glide kick and hang to pick off enemies. The grapple gun is pretty easy to use and is a good way to get out of a sticky situation when you are surrounded and as an added stratagey I recommend that when surrounded and going to high ground keep moving because sometimes they can lose sight of you. I digress however...the fighting system helps you earn XP which in turn unlocks those abilities that I have discussed some of which gives you extra batarangs, more combo moves and better armor. As far as the fighting, this is oemthing else that is not bogged down in a complex system of button pushes altho it is wise to learn some good mechanics that helps you unlock better gear a lot quicker as you play.And of course you get a nice range of abilities that are persistent from the outset of the game which is needed to help you  solve certain puzzles. The detective mode is your best friend in finding out where the bad guys are, their condition as well as to helping you follow clues to progress through the game. Vocal cues from the voice actors will also let you know if you are going in the right direction.I really thank the fact that Eidos and the rest of the creators of this game really took the time out to make sure they got the voice actors from the cartoon to set this game up because it is indeed superb and this is definently a very mature version of the animated series. There are dead bodies that litter the hall in some places, there is gore, storng suggestive language and a very creepy hallucination scene in which Batman sees his dead parents in a morgue who talk to him. Arkham has a very oppesive feel to it much like Rapture did in Bioshock.They very easily could have taken the route of creating a Dark Knight Movie adaptation and put out a crappy game. but they didn't thankfully!Graphically, the game looks gorgeous and one thing I do applaud the creators for is that they didn't clutter up the game with needless HUD info so you get to enjoy the game and the HUDs that do pop up only pop up when needed. Anything that you can find out you can get when you push a button to see another screen. You do spend a lot of time exploring also because the Riddler has st up riddles for you to solve in many locations and they can distract you from your main quest to solve them. Also, there are many other unlockables and challenges that you will run across as you play as well as recordings of the Arkham patients as well as Dr. Arkham himself. Speaking of, as you explore, note the places that you could not initially could not get to because as you get better gear you can always go back and access earlier levels and collect what you couldn't get.As far as villains and bosses...well I like to take my time and enjoy agame and not run thru them so if my 4 to 5 hours may seem slow to some to reach this point, so be it...but so far I have run across the Scarecrow and had to escape a hallucination to defeat him (altho I think this was not the 'final' fight that I will have) then I fought Bane which reminded me of the countless boss fights in Wolverine, but done a little better. At present, I have found the Batcave and trying to track down Dr. Penny Young. Surprisingly when I saved and shut down for the night, my stats told me that I had only progressed thru 17% of the game, HA! This doens't feel like a 'longish' game but at the same time I would be a bit pissed if I ran right thru it and have a 'this was it?' kind of feeling. A slow burning game like this is what I need right now.Do I have any gripes on this game?  Not many. The henchies are a bit repetitive but they are of course your source of XP. I kind of wish the terrorized you similar to the denizens of Rapture, BUT this isn't that game now is it?  LOL. I also wish there were more things to grapple onto and swing on but then that is part of the puzzle in some places which is finding the right thing to swing to, pushing the right buttons and finding the right things to break and disarm.This is by far the best Batman game at present and hopefully this will set a bar to how superhero games should be made. I do think it will overshadow MUA II, altho I know I will be picking that one up as well, in terms of quality and story telling and draw. When I read the initial reviews I just knew some palms were greased for the reviews it has gotten. I was wrong...it earned those reviews and as Batman the Drak Knight set the bar for how to make a good superhero / crime movie, this will set a bar on how to make a good superhero/ survival horror/ action game.Make sure you do not miss this first entry into fall gaming as it starts off with a BANG!4.5 out of 5 stars","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2009"}
{"product_name":"B001T8S62Q","description":"","reviewerName":"Eagle Vision","summary":"Solid performer for a handheld console and it has a (limited) web browser","reviewText":"INTRODUCTION:I was getting this system, as an adult gamer, with the intention of playing games, and to use this as a browser for when I am away from home.  I do not play Game Boy Advance games, although my daughter does.  I have to warn parents looking into this system that there is no slot for Game Boy Advance (GBA, for short) or the Guitar Hero interface.  This system is by no means a major upgrade with the exception of being able to download games or take photographs.WHAT IS IN THE BOX:ConsoleTwo styliInstructionsPlugTaking this item out, I proceeded to protect the screen with a screen protector.  I purchased a DSi Starter Kit to give me cases for cartridges, extra styli and a carrying case.CONSTRUCTION:The Nintendo DSi comes in a matte finish with a smooth texture.  The touch screen measures 2.5 inches.  An internal microphone is placed in the center just under the top screen.  A rubber cover secures the port for the SD card.  A slot for the DS games is in the same spot, as previous generations.  Volume control is by a +/- switch, unlike the sliding volume switch of the DS phat.  An LED indicator notifies you that the WiFi radio is on.The keypad buttons feel firm not mushy.The power button also serves as a reset button.  This is convenient when switching from one cartridge to the next or when switching from the internet to the main menu.  The directional buttons, X, Y, A, B, and L, R are in the similar neighborhood as prior generations.The matte finish is fingerprint-proof but I have a feeling it is not scratch proof.  The screens are very glossy and may create a perceptible glare in bright lights or outdoor settings.  The case opens up to nearly flat.I was disappointed that the plug was not a matching black color.  It was more of a grayish white.SETUP:I set up the DSi with the pre-existing charge from the factory to enter my name, a phrase, the parental controls with a PIN, accessed my Club Nintendo account, and downloaded the Opera Browser.The DSi recognizes handwriting (not really \"Doctor's Handwriting\", like mine) or uses the keyboard.  The handwriting boxes give a choice of what you are trying to write but it is slow.  Typing is faster but cumbersome.Setting up the browser is hidden in the Tools Menu.  You can toggle the WiFi radio on or off.  When you set up the internet, it is a matter of choosing what type of encryption your router uses.  I use WEP so I entered the \"Hexadecimal\" key which was quite long - no paraphrasing is allowed.  Once my information was entered, it connected rather quickly.  When I logged into Club Nintendo, I had to read the `license agreement', agree and then the firmware was upgraded.  That took about 2-3 minutes and then the system had to be restarted.  As soon as the technicalities were completed, I was ready to download the Free Opera Browser.When you link your DSi account with the online Club Nintendo account, you get 160 coins that can be applied to acquiring products.BATTERY LIFEWhen compared to the DS, the battery life is less.  When you factor in the wireless capability, it is even shorter in life.  So, if you are not in a `hotspot' or have access to a wireless network, then shut it off to conserve battery life.THE CAMERAThe 0.3 megapixel cameras are toggled by the touchpad's `switch' button.  When you take a photograph, you can edit it with the various programs and save it to your album.  I find it fun to edit photos and allow morphing (from the adult perspective) and I will likely use my photo for an avatar for various websites.  For casual photography, this will not be too useful given the low resolution.  Its purpose is solely for entertainment and DSi-type photo-editing.Photos can be shared only 2 ways, wirelessly to other DSi units within 65 feet or by the SD/SDHC Card.  It cannot be emailed through your browser.No video can be recorded.SOUND QUALITYAAC is Advanced Audio Coding unlike the iPods which are MP-3 players (Motion Pictures Expert Group, Layer 3).  AAC is a lossy compression format, that some experts say may have better sound quality than an MP3.  To me, they sound virtually identical.  How do you convert to AAC?  If you use iTunes:Highlight the songs to convert (Control and Left Mouse Click)Click AdvancedSelect \"Create AAC Version\".I would recommend highlighting the song and renaming it \"Song A AAC\" so you can search for AAC version on iTunes, utilizing the finder bar.  I select/highlight the songs in iTunes, and then \"pasted\" them into my SDHC card.  The DSi automatically finds the `music' files but I was able to listen to the audio portion of my videos that I recorded from my HD Camcorder.Sound quality from native speakers is quite good and it has `stereo sound'.  Will I find myself using this as a music player?  Unlikely.  You can alter the music to play fast/slow or high/low pitch.  Another fun thing is to choose `visualizations' while listening to music - which can be toggled with the `ring on a  string icon'.  Lastly, there are `percussion effects' that are activated by your Left and Right keys: Clapping, tambourines, drums, Dog/cat sounds, etc.You can also record 10 second 'sound clips' which can be stored on a memory card.  It cannot be assigned to a photograph.SCREEN QUALITY / BRIGHTNESSDefault is on a setting of 4, which is brighter than the DS Phat (which is what my daughter uses).  The size of the screen is larger and the subjective quality of the graphics looks better to me.  I don't personally think it does anything for gameplay, aside from aesthetics.  However, I do like the larger screen.WEB BROWSING / PARENTAL CONTROLSDownload time of the browser was 2 minutes.With regards to a Wii Points card, if it is unused, it can be used in the DSi shop.  However, it cannot be transferred back to the Wii, so be careful.  There is not a lot in terms of choices of DSiWare to download, at this time.  You can have a maximum of 20,000 points on your account.  Points can be added by a pre-paid card or using a credit card ($10 for 1000 points, $20 for 2000 points and $50 for 5000 points).The choices are below (I chose none of them):500 pointsWariowareAqua200 pointsBird and BeansMaster of Illusion Express: Funny Face800 pointsBrain Age Express: MathLimitations of the browser:No Flash, Animations, Sound, Video, PDFs or anything requiring a plug-inVideo playbackUse of the browser:Like conventional browsers, you can set up your home page, add favorites or enter your URL.  There are shortcut keys like \"WWW\" or \".COM\" to make it less painful.  There is an overview setting or `column view' setting, as well as navigation or zoom view.  I was actually able to load my Amazon profile, although it took nearly 45 seconds.  I found that conventional websites can be viewed, albeit slowly, when compared to a PC.  It is about average for a handheld (like my old Palm Tungsten C PDA).  Realistically, you can check movie times, email, news and weather.  Beyond any of those functions, loading times of websites would make the tasks cumbersome.A bit of advice for you, do a Google search for \"Mobile Friendly\" websites that have limited graphics which are suited to browsing with items such as the DSi, Pocket PCs, Palms, or \"Smartphones\" (for example, eboogie, phonefavs or gahtan are a few sites that have that capability).  With sites like these, you can check a lot more information quickly and efficiently. Loading time is a fraction of the full featured sites.Parental controls:Parental controls can be set by a 4 digit PIN.  If you forget your PIN, you can get a `secret question' to unlock this unit.  This can control many parameters including the following:  Access to Nintendo DSi Exclusive and Compatible Software (ESRB Ratings), PictoChat, DS Download Play, Nintendo DSi Browser,  Nintendo DSi Shop, Photo Exchange, and User-Generated Content.  You don't want your child to download games, use the internet or chat, you can toggle what features to enable or disable.

This is not worth the $60 depreciation for trade in and you lose your ability to play Guitar Hero and other Game Boy Advance Games.If you don't have a gaming console, this is a solid platform to play games, listen to music (casual basis), make Avatars for your discussion groups/forums and use a somewhat functional web-browsing experience (especially, away from home, as in a free public \"Hotspot\").If you do casual surfing on the net for news, weather, or email, this can do this function fairly well (especially if you use PDA/Mobile Friendly websites).  This function, alone, is worth the $169 to me since it is like a little \"Netbook\" with regards to internet functions (no word processing or other PC functions).The larger screen and improved sound (compared to the 1st generation DS Phat), is up by leaps and bounds.  The future ability to download applications, will further secure its place in the pantheon of modern gaming.UPDATE 4/14/2009You cannot log onto Webkinz World (my daughter wanted to know).UPDATE 5/9/2009I tried using the WIFI on the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, FL and the network connection did not work (using internet set up).UPDATE:  5/12/2009Well, I finally found a game that I was interested in getting with my 'free points'.  I bought Real Soccer 2009 which is quite detailed.  The download took about 4 to 5 minutes.  I am glad I didn't settle for the other games, since they weren't inspiring.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2009"}
{"product_name":"B001T8S62Q","description":"","reviewerName":"Gearhead Mania","summary":"Update of the DS Lite, not necessarily a superior update","reviewText":"Nintendo DSi matte blueThe best way to describe this color is that it looks a lot like \"baby blue\" or the 2010-up Ford Mustang \"Grabber Blue\" color. The DSi as you probably already know is an update to the DS and DS Lite. There are some minor dimensional changes in the screen size and body size, as well as slight tweaks in the hardware that result in a reduced battery life compared to the DS Lite.In addition, the biggest changes are the addition of a microphone, 2 digital cameras (very low resolution), and a SD/SDHC slot that replaces the GameBoy Advance slot. Although you can utilize the 802.11 a/b/g Wi-Fi to browse the Internet using the Opera-based web browser, be aware that if your wireless router is set for WPA2 security that you won't be able to use the Nintendo DS Wi-Fi Connection feature in any of the games since they require a WEP passkey. That would mean downgrading your WiFi router security from WPA2 to WEP/WPA hybrid or just WEP.The digital cameras and microphone are worthless to me since I have no use for them. The quality is horrendous and taking a photo causes the DSi to make a very loud shutter sound, probably to prevent people from using it to take photographs of others in compromising positions or locations. Since the target demographic for the DSi are children, this makes some sense depending on how you lean politically.I purchased the DSi because I had some discounts at a local store that would bring the cost of the DSi close to the price of the DS Lite. I like to play Pokemon Platinum and later realized the GameBoy Advance slot would have been useful in capturing additional Pokemon. As-is, I cannot capture or transfer a large number of Pokemon without trading with someone else.I purchased an official Nintendo DS Pokemon Platinum carrying case and recommend the case to others. It has 2 internal elastic straps that keep the DS/DSi in place, while an external soft zippered pouch keeps your games safe. It fits in the pocket of a coat, making it ultra portable and stylish.Pros; Lightweight, compact, easy to take with on trips.Cons: I consider it a downgrade from the DS Lite in many respects: No GBA slot, reduced battery life, worthless microphone and digital cameras, useless SDHC slot unless you mess with the cheesy audio/photo editors.Overall: 4/5 starsRecommended Accessories:*Screen protector for the touch screen - any will suffice as long as it is easily replaceable. You will scratch up the protector if you play a lot of games that use the stylus.*Travel case - the genuine Nintendo DS zipper case I got from Wal-Mart was exactly what I needed and will work fine. Avoid bulky packs, but make sure it secures and cushions the DS/DSi and the games.UPDATE 2-5-2010:The DSi is still awesome. I heard the DSi XL is coming out and it has 93% larger screens. Let me tell you, the DSi and DS Lite are slick because you can easily fit them in most coat/windbreaker pockets so you can take them in the airport or onto planes to help pass the time. If they were any larger, it would be far more cumbersome to carry around. As-is, the DS Lite / DSi are awesome. The only way I'd improve the DSi is bring back the GBA slot, ensure all DS games were compatible with WPA/WPA2 for Wi-Fi Connection (and not just WEP), improve battery life, and get rid of the webcams/microphones.UPDATE 4-25-2010:My flights on Delta had free in-flight WiFi via Go Go, but I was unable to get it to work with my DSi. I looked at Go Go's website and there is a good possibility the DSi just isn't supported. I was able to find the access point but it couldn't get a connection for some reason.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2010"}

I never got into the whole \"tomb raider\" action/adventure thing but I picked this up cheap and gave it a tryStory 3.5/5The story was your typical \"follow the clues, dead end, wait no follow another clue, dead end etc. etc. etc....TREASURE!!\" story. But then again if you know anything about this series that is the general jist of the game. There were some twists and turns though and that kept me engaged. There were quite a few plot wholes though but I guess I shouldn't expect hollywood quality in a video game (why is it that every time I go through heck in this game to get somewhere, that dumb rich dude beats me to it? C'mon man). However, the story will keep you going and won't run dry.Characters 3.5/5Drake was a good main character. He got on my nerves at first but he grew on me. The rest of his comrades were the stereotypical co-stars. Girl that acts tough but needs Drake in the end. Old resourceful guy that somehow is immortal. The villains were your typical villains too. Nothing really bad but nothing outstanding either.Gameplay 4.5/5This is where the game really shines. The gameplay was really fun. From figuring out how to scale walls to jumping across chandeliers. It really kept you going. Only thing that wasn't perfect about it was the shooting. Wasn't really realistic but overall still great.Overall definitely worth a playthrough.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2011"}

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed a lot of my Skyrim game time, but I also enjoyed playing Venetica.  If I compare this to a Bethesda game, it is 2/5, if I compare it to average games, it's a 4/5.  What can I say, I just expected more.I anxiously awaited Skyrim, knowing it was going to be the game to end all games...  I was going to be lost for months searching in every nook and cranny of the game.  My family was going to disown me.  My clients would seek out someone else.  I was going to spend so much time IMMERSED in Skyrim!Didn't happen.I don't like Skyrim.  The place.  What good are these amazing graphics if I have to spend all this time looking at snow?  I just don't like the setting.  Is it wrong that I would have preferred to be somewhere a little warmer?  My husband kept on saying it wasn't all mountainous... this is true, he's absolutely right.  But SO MUCH of it was snowy mountain.  Half of the map was lackluster snow scenes- and yes, half of it was beautiful colorado-in-spring, but that wasn't enough for me.  It made me realize how varied Cyrodil was, it made me long for it and it's cultural diversity.  I also get motion sick.. lame, I know, but all that time traversing through the mountains trying to find my way to the path that was going to get me somewhere.. ughhhhh.  Just way too much snow for me.Plus, I had to work for these graphics.  For some reason they released it with a limitation on how much graphic information you could store, a 2gb limit.  It crashed ALL the time.  Saving was something I did every 5 minutes.. so I had to download mods, a 4gb mod.  I had to change some graphics settings because apparently they didn't work well without crashing.  My gaming rig is good, well over the recommended but I still crashed straight to my desktop frequently.  Even after doing the sound fix, crash-crash-crash.  So, someone else's mod did for me what Bethesda should have.SO many bothersome bugs.  Half of my quests still remain \"unfinished\" because they just neglected to drop off the list.  Some I cannot complete.  Others, I didn't have an option to decline and have no interest in doing them on a certain character, but I still have to see them.  Why can't I clear it out?  If I wasn't playing the PC version with all these fixes, would it be so much worse?Why are all these quests busywork? Fetch and find quests.  All the quests in oblivion, even the smallest of them seemed so much more meaningful. In Skyrim, it seems only the main quests -really- mean something and there just aren't enough of them.I was done with this game in 124 hours, as in all faction quests and all miscellaneous quests.  I think I was done in Oblivion at 300.  I know what you're saying- some games finish at 14 hours, I should be glad for all that sprawling gameplay.. I am.  Mostly.  I'm still disappointed because I didn't get what I was expecting.I expected DRAGON COMBAT to be the most exciting thrilling thing in the universe.  I'm fighting a dragon, right?  Why the -hell- is fighting a \"giant\" much more taxing?  I could kill Dragons in my sleep.  I kill them every time I fast travel (why!) and they were nothing, even at very low levels... nothing at high levels.  Giants or ice trolls totally are much more of a challenge.  Please explain.I complained at some point in my life playing Oblivion that I would have really enjoyed a spouse.  I take it back.  I don't want one.  It was much too simplified.  I've had roommates that give me more gratification than a Skyrim spouse.  I would have preferred to not have one at all- my quest to find the best spouse was terrible.  Why are there so few pickup lines in Skyrim?  Couldn't we of had some kind of significant dialogue?  Perhaps I could have had an -extra- quest to do for my lovely spouse?  Maybe just something that made him more than a store for when I went into town?Another thing that bothered me.. why am I so evil?  Everything is evil.  In Oblivion, the thieves guild was fun!  So much fun.  We stole from the rich and gave to the poor- I uncovered a dark secret and help a man I call friend reunite himself with his family... here, we steal from poor argonian shop owners.  We're the mafia.  Ugh.  I don't want to be the mafia!  I even have a politician backing me, an evil bitchy politician.Dark Brotherhood?  You lured me in with this story of this evil woman running the orphanage, and then a few quests later I'm killing a bride at her wedding.  Most of the characters are bothersome rather than endearing, and thanks to all the other guild lines I know my job is to progress the faction quest to the point where the top person dies.None of these factions are as interesting as they were in Morrowind or Oblivion.  They're so loosey goosey and disorganized that it makes me hate the cold climate of Skyrim even more.  They're still entertaining, especially when compared to the miscellaneous quests- but they just don't have the depth of the faction quests I'm used to in a Bethesda game.  Everything was a little expected.The one I enjoyed the most was the Civil war faction quest.  I enjoyed the battle of Whiterun- so big, so wonderful!  I felt like I was changing the world- the same feelings I got while doing almost -anything- in Oblivion.  Those feelings are kind of in short supply in Skyrim.  I'm pretty sure a lowly guard could take care of this Dragon problem- and I damn sure know he could handle the things that happen in the Bard's College.  Ask me if a guard could have handled the final thieves guild quest in Oblivion?  No. Effing. Way.Anyhow.  Those are my complaints.  I have more, but those are the ones that strike me as most important.I still played Skyrim, and I still enjoyed it... I just didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to.  Instead of losing months of my life, I dug a hole in my heart of expectation, one Skyrim couldn't fill.  I've had to fill it with so many little RPGs since then. :(Luckily, after Dragon Age 2 I stopped digging my mass effect 3 hole of expectation so maybe in a bit it will help satisfy my cravings for immersion.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2012"}

AC is an in depth and complicated story about an assassin who lived many years ago. The gameplay is somewhat monotonous but as you go along, you will have fun facing different foes and mixing up your strategy.It does take awhile for it to start to really get good. However, it pays off because you learn to fight better and you can take on swarms of enemies at a time. The most fun is not being stealthy, it's running through the crowd, killing your target in the open and drawing your sword as if to say \"Come on, take me if you can!\" I wouldn't recommend this behavior early on in the game, as your weapons are weaker and your abilities in combat are limited.The end of the game is easier than I thought it would be (when you fight your master) and the payoff is a cliffhanger buit I am definitely intrigued as to what happens next.My problems with the game are few but here they are anyway:After you solve it, there's no real replay value. You can replay memories but you can't go as if you already did what you had to do. You have to start over and re-assassinate your targets.Some people have mentioned this and it happened to me to. Every so often, the game would freeze and I'd have to shut the console down and restart the game. This however is only a minor annoyance, since I never had to go far to get to where I left off.That's about it for the gripes.In all, I enjoyed this game immensely.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00BMFIXKQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Quoad Toad","summary":"Surprisingly fun for those who like to explore","reviewText":"I wasn't expecting to like Assassin's Creed Black Flag given that I didn't like Assassin's Creed 3.  I'm very surprised at how much I am enjoying Black Flag.  I've been consistently playing for almost 3 weeks now and am still only about 70% done.  The world of Black Flag is huge and there are a huge number of side missions.  I find myself sailing around, just looting ships, investigating different locations, and exploring sunken vessels.  I love exploring new worlds in games and this is one of the most fun exploration games I have played.I was concerned that controlling the ship would be difficult, but it's easy.  It took me about an hour to master the fine art of sailing and pillaging other ships.  Once you visit one location, you can fast travel there with a click of a button.  You can also fast travel to any of your synchronized locations.For people who are sensitive to killing animals, you can avoid most of the hunting side missions since you can just buy the animals pelts from one of the many seaside stores.  There is one required mission where you have to skin two ocelots and two iguanas.  I was a little freaked out by this mission, but the camera cuts away so you don't have to see too much skinning.  (Note: I realize it's odd to be bothered by killing animals in games, but not people.  I know there are others like me and wanted to warn them.)The main story missions are fun, but aren't my main focus when I play.  They are a mix of stealth and open fighting.  The enemies don't spot you as easily as they did in Assassin's Creed III, which makes playing more fun.  There are also fewer missions where you're punished for not being stealthy.  Many missions push you towards stealthiness, but all out skirmishes aren't punished in the same way as previous iterations in the series.You play as Edward Kenway.  He's looking to make his fortune on the high seas and return to his wife a rich man.  He's not very sympathetic or interesting, but the real main &#34;character&#34; to me is the open world.Overall, Assassin's Creed IV is one of my favorite games of the year.  The open world is simply amazing and the game is far longer than most other games on the market.  It feels so great to come home from a tough day at work and just sail around tropical islands, pillaging and plundering.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2013"}

Or will you let the other studios make the investments, leaving you to jump on the bandwagon if the new technology becomes popular?Many of the things you've ever read or heard about Hollywood are right here inThe Movies- from stars having affairs and hitting the bottle to teams of genius filmmakers creating the box office hit of the year.

The final answer is: OH YEAH!!!!WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2006 takes a major step up from last year's SD vs Raw by amping up what they felt the gamers wanted amped up and removing a few things that were not too liked.  One major boost is to the graphics.  As before, each of the wrestlers looks so close to their real life counterparts you would almost swear that you were watching an actual WWE show.  The stars come out to their actual entrances (moves and music) but yes, there are a few who it seems the theme clearances couldn't be gained.  Nevertheless it really is a major difference.Also new to the game are a few new match types to take on.  The Bra and Panties match that we loved dearly (admit it guys...:)) has now become the Fulfill Your Fantasy match in which you have to fill a \"Fantasy Meter\" to win the match.  It is fun, seeing as you get to start a pillowfight or go old school and try to rip your opponent's clothes off...Also added to the match types is the Buried Alive match.  In this match you have to fight your way up to a point on the stage where a coffin awaits.  There you must toss your opponent into the coffin, close the lid and win by basically burying your opponent.  This is a match that gets fun dependent on which superstar you use to take the match.  What's more is that it is one of 100 (!!) match types to take on in the game.Other new features include an all new General Manager Mode where you take on the role of GM of either show and try to go through a year by setting up matches and shows to garner the biggest fan base, Superstar specific storylines that change dependent on choices made throughout the season, a new Locker Room where the trophies and accolades you win through your wrestling are stored, an amazing roster of several current and former WWE Superstars including the legendary Bret \"Hitman\" Hart (THANK YOU!!!), the ability to steal your opponent's taunts and finishers, a new Possum Pin where you can fake out and pin your opponent, voices for your own created characters, the chance to take on either the WWE or World Heavyweight Champion in Exhibition mode and more.The few drawbacks come with the commentary during your matches, which come from Jim Ross and Jerry \"the King\" Lawler from Raw and Michael Cole and Tazz from SmackDown which sound at times like it was forced for them to read.  Also, the WWE Championship belt in all modes is the current \"Spinner\" championship held by Raw's John Cena.  Yet periodically you see the old \"modernized\" WWE Championship and you won't get that one.But even with these flaws, WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2006 sets the bar high for any future WWE titles (it is unknown if this is the final WWE title for PS2 with the PS3 on the horizon) and sends Midway a little message as it begins to make the game for WWE's main rival TNA Total Nonstop Action Wrestling.  As the tagline says, get ready for the fight of your life!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2005"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E1JS","description":"","reviewerName":"CAKEMAN \"TYE JR\"","summary":"MORTAL KOMBAT: REMASTERED","reviewText":"Mortal Kombat is back...  When I first heard about this game I kind of paid no mind. Because of how crappy MK became over all the years, so I was just thinking another MK with the same boring stiff style.  Then I saw some videos and I LIKED it, then I played the demo and LOVED it, now I have the game and I'M IN LOVE with it.  This is the best MK by far, for the longest I said MK3 was the best but this here outdid it all, finally they returned to 3D graphics on a 2D plane.  MK now have 2-on-2 matches like Marvel vs. Capcom, Challenge Tower and Fatality Training (so no more excuses for not finishing your opponent).  MK has even slim down their roster from that crazy 63 fighters in MK: Armageddon to about 30 fighters now and if you got PS3 like me you get Kratos and I can't think of anyone more suited for MK than the God of War himself and what make it even better they didn't dull down Kratos' style... They even have sequences from the GoW games for him in matches but you can only use him in versus mode.  MK went back to their roots, one of my favorite things are: as you're taking and dealing damage the blood don't just squirt out onto the ground the fighters become bloody and disfigured.  Now my absolute favorite thing is the super combo gauge as you take and deal damage your combo gauge fills level 1-enhanced special attack, level 2-combo breaker and level 3 the best of all X-RAY attack: the camera goes in and will show an inside view of the fighter who is being attacked while bones and organs are broken and shattered.  The fatalities are all back to what they should be not that crap you got from MKvDC they brought the M-Rated worthy they introduced us to 18years ago.  Now for my review: GAMEPLAY 5stars: there is four attack buttons, 2D fighting style and finally the fighters are more loose and flexible not stiff like previous MK, that's why I like this so much, GRAPHICS 5stars: this game looks great the stages are so well designed and so are the fighters and by the way this is 3D compatible which really sets the graphics off and after playing this in 3D. I have to get a 3DTV for sure. STORY MODE 4stars: it becomes harder as the chapters progress and you get a chance to play with different fighters but no fatalities. ONLINE 5stars: take your skills online and compete against others and even watch fights as if you`re at the movies (you can even cheer and boo the fight)in King of the Hill, FIGHTERS 5stars: MK dramatically improved their roster by cutting it down.  If you ever liked MK get this game, if you thought about MK get this game, if you're looking for an M-Rated fighter get this game.  I wouldn't be surprised if this won Best Fighting Game... This is the best MK ever made. MORTAL KOMBAT 5STARS... FLAWLESS VICTORY!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2011"}

Combined with the sweeping vistas and evocative locales of Sera, where the story takes place,Gears of War 2offers jaw-dropping graphics that are made possible through advances in Unreal Engine 3.

Enough to make the game sell like hot cakes in 2006. With Gears of War 2 players will be finding a nice comfort zone between the original and enough new elements to make it a fully pledged sequel, and not just a simple rehash.Gears of War two is a science fiction based third person shooter.To begin with the game is more story driven, but still not enough to win any awards. Taking place ten months after we first took lead as Delta Squad leader SGT. Marcus Fenix, one can establish the locust have become relentless.  You'll soon me familiarized with the rather bleak apocalyptic wastelands of Sera, the first title brought as the setting. The locust are an underground dwelling menacing foe, who have brought destruction to cataclysmic proportions, in a war where death knows no boundaries. As Marcus you'll encounter a variety of new enemies along with new allies, in an attempt to bring an end to over a decade of war.New weapons, better AI, and a stronger lengthier campaign make replay value certain for offline goers. With the addition of bots for multiplayer, maybe even online vets will fine a reason to stray from online (or to confirm their seasoned 'skills'...). Online seems to be a bit rough right now, with players adjusting to some changes (shotgun has reduced range, chainsaw counters, and voting for what to play), but nothing a patch can't fix. The online though is still fierce, and still a blast to hack away at. Multiplayer also now gives way to 5vs5 matches, an additional player on each team, new tactics anyone?Speaking of tactics, the all new horde mode is one that will require the uttermost attention. Five players can embark on a fight for survival, against wave after wave after wave after wave of locust. To do so, plot communicate and lastly have fun! Waves do have cycles after a while, but definitely a worthwhile addition. Seeking to lead in commands or not, their is a spot readily open to anyone willing to bring down a gore fest. Maybe you'll enjoy the new variety of heavy boomer like enemy ready to tear your face off!Additional downloadable content (DLC), is already at the battle front. Five additional multiplayer maps are available free of charge with a redeemable code given inside (xbox live silver or gold is required). These maps are classic but altered restorations players have been having fire fights on for nearly two years. Famed 'Gridlock' makes an appearance, but in an aged 'nature has taken root' again look. 'Canals' has got a case of frostbite, and is available in every new copy of the game. While you may not of been an early bird, the limited edition featured gold plated weaponry. This will not change performance nor hinder it, this is merely for aesthetic value.Some of the new weapons are a fire spewing flame thrower, some new grenades (  in addition to smoke grenades having become more critical), and heavy weaponry. Heavy weapons can be carried in excess to already having your four weapon slot full. They slow you down, but are powerful. These include, mortars, and turrets.Turrets were originally a mounted only weapon (still available in some instances), but now can be carried...,but need constant cooling with the right button (rb, shoulder button). Mortars add a nice touch to long range battles, when one runs out of sniper ammo. That will really stir them up. The lancer still provides us with the perfect blend of range, ammo capacity, and awesome gruesome chainsaw action. Chainsaw 'duals' are now added to spice up fights.Boss battles aren't the most engaging, but get climactic. A variety of them will come your way, that a handful of acts to seclude them in. Five acts comprised of six or so chapters each give the option to insert yourself into favorable battles. The boss battles work in repetition, one you figure the plan of attack it's a cake walk. Having beat the game on two difficulties, it doesn't hold as too hard or too easy. Finding the sweet spot is crucial to avoid frustration. Achievements can be unlocked for lower difficulty completion upon beating the game on higher modes.Overall the physics, graphics, and sound are stellar. The game features a more colorful environment, but still rather gray and blue. Certain objects can now be destroyed, but nothing to really change the gameplay. Controls are excellent, some may find vehicular based movement to be a little redundant. Players can still grapple behind cover and sprint, along with a new ability to take locust as a means of shielding.What can I say, Gears two delivers. If you were looking into this title with high hopes, it has not let you down. When looking at the large catalog of games for this holiday season, rush to grab this title. One of the few worth the full price purchase. A title that has squeezed out every last drop of greatness, and turned it into a near flawless atmospheric shooter.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2008"}

So yes while it's fun to play the game especially with a friend or two I kinda wish Ubisoft would be able to make a new Naruto game as well as I felt that those games were just as good sometimes a little better in some areas for the Naruto fan out there  but anyway for the price this is going for right now I'd say it's worth getting either way.  Sadly though even with this falling into the Shippuden Arc I just couldn't get into the game as much as I did with the first one,  also with the games glitzy button controls bugs it made the gameplay annoying rather then entertaining.

{"product_name":"B0001X5YN4","reviewerName":"Vappour","summary":"Amazing","reviewText":"To begin, let me say that even though my copy of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. installed perfectly it absolutely would not launch at first.  Needless to say, I was pretty upset.  I sent an email to THQ support and received a reply in about two working days asking for more information about my system (DXDIAG).  After I sent the requested information, they replied in one day with several things to try.  The problem turned out to be that my soundcard drivers (X-FI) needed to be updated.  A simple process that completely fixed the problem.  THQ support turned out to be excellent (as long as you take the time to register the game).S.T.A.L.K.E.R. has since run almost perfectly with only a couple of bugs (i.e. some stuttering on certain missions and the door to the first \"trader\" which can only be forced open after a certain point in the game.)  The graphics are excellent, but I'm not sure they're on par with HL2 or Oblivion as some other reviewers have stated (it's probably just my machine).  The overall atmosphere is absolutely incredible (something like Fallout 2 translated to a FPS format).I especially like the strobe lightning effects during nighttime thunder storms and the often angry skies filled with dark clouds. There are radioactive \"anomolies\" everywhere.  Occasionally you'll see careless people, mutants or animals shot high into the air by these effects and then explode into a cloud of blood (or otherwise die badly).  Be very careful where you walk in the \"zone\" (on top of everything else)!!  Sometimes it gets too dark to even see three feet ahead at night without NV or a flashlight.  You quickly get the impression that you're not in a friendly place.The single player AI is among the most realistic I've found in any FPS.  You really have to effectively use cover, constantly move, strafe, lean and correctly plan your actions -- or you're \"dead\".  The NPC's are eagle-eyed dead shots with a decent bag of tricks who never run out of ammo.  It's also very important what kind of firearm and ammo you choose to carry.  The AK74 rifles (5.45 x 39mm -- even AP) don't seem all that effective IMHO.  As soon as I was able to acquire an assault rifle with a built-in 4x scope shooting the more powerful 5.56 x 45mm AP, things improved greatly (no trouble at all putting down enemies with headshots -- keeping the rifle strictly on semi-auto).  Using a scope made all the difference -- at least for me.  Trading in the ridiculous little inaccurate 9mm pistol you're given at the beginning for a .45 ACP (or finding an even better pistol that shoots rifle ammo) helps too. There are many interesting real-world weapons and ammo available in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. (for sale, on dead bodies, in marked \"stashes\", laying on the ground, as payment for jobs, etc.), and the game tries to reproduce their characteristics/effects accurately.  You'll find everything from .30 caliber sniper rifles to assault rifles to semi-auto shotguns to revolver type grenade launchers -- not to mention various pistols.  I even found a couple of RPG's (way too heavy to carry around but good for specific jobs).  The Vintar 9x39mm sniper rifle has got to be my favorite (I'd never heard of the 9x39mm cartridge before S.T.A.L.K.E.R., but it's very effective).  Be sure to USE your binoculars to scope out all areas before you visit.  They will make a big difference (like showing you exactly where friends, neutrals and enemies are).  If you find you're in over your head use the \"sprint\" key and just run away.  You'll take surprisingly little damage (hitting a moving target is difficult for NPC's too).Also, this is the first FPS I've played where you can often seriously wound your enemies rather than only kill them.  As they lay there moaning on the ground, you can walk up and finish them off with a knife, bullet or whatever.  Same thing with NPC's fighting on your \"side.\"  If they're wounded and you can give them a first aid kit, you'll have a new \"friend\" and an increased reputation (this can be very important).S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a hybrid FPS and RPG game that requires interacting with NPC's and making decisions (at least if you want to get the most out of it). Do you take that side mission for Duty General Veronin, Freedom Leader Lukash or the barkeep?  Do you help a particular faction, etc.?  Many people have agendas and are willing to hire you, and each side (except for bandits, mercs, etc.) can (and will) give you a good story about why you should help them.  But you always must remember both the up and down sides of any decision.  The wrong choice can turn out to be a real bummer in terms of the game.  (Enemies will actually come looking for you!)All in all, this game is truly an experience in another, if very depressing world.  I wish that there were small things like more subtitles to the frequent Russian that is spoken (the Russian sometimes seems to go on and on).  It doesn't help very much that I can't understand any of it, but I guess it does add to the overall atmosphere of the game. A truly great game, or rather game experience.  Well worth the wait.[Edit:  ***SPOILER ALERT***  The guy above who felt that finding the \"wishgranter\" machine near the end of the game finishes everything is completely wrong. This is only a \"false\" ending meant to throw you off.  Instead of going to the machine, you should, if you've played the game correctly, ignore it and instead use the lab door decoder to continue on and find the \"real\" (and very satisfying) ending(s) to the game where everything is finally explained. There are up to seven possible endings in S.T.A.L.K.E.R, but only the two that don't involve the \"wishgranter\" machine can be considered \"real\". (The best way of all IMO is to do a full save right when you enter the actual Chernobyl building near the end. Then you can go back and try the ending BOTH ways.)]Overall, I feel S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is in most respects better than the follow-the-dots, linear type shooters like HL2, F.E.A.R., or just about any FPS/RPG I've played in recent memory. There are no \"bullet-time\", slow motion, \"gravity\" guns or other gimmicks which give the player an edge.  Just hard straight-up fighting against NPC's who are as equal to you (equipment, weapons, skill) as possible through computer AI.  The game maps are completely open except for the main quest objectives (think Oblivion).  There are no \"bosses\" as such; the fighting just gets harder and harder (with better equipment) as the game progresses -- especially near the end.  It's all challenging as hell for a true FPS fan (\"casual\" type gamers will probably have trouble with the difficulty -- which of course they'll blame on the game rather than themselves).  For me, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. often brought back memories of the great Deus Ex when that game was set on its highest (most realistic) A.I. settings.  That's the highest recommendation I can give any game.

{"product_name":"B002BSA1MQ","description":"","reviewerName":"j-rob-82","summary":"Fun Game but Not Without Issues","reviewText":"I hardly ever review games since people are so different in what they think but I figured I would take another stab at it.  I will say this game is closer to four stars for me but not quite.  I played the crap out of the original Crysis but my PC gaming days have slowed so now I usually go with consoles since its easier and more streamlined.  With this game you can basically sit down and play no knowledge of previous game needed.  In away the bringing to the broader audience left out some key things I wanted to know such as what happened to Nomad and Psycho.  Prophets story actually made since to me since it was part of the first.  But even with those holes I found the game to be very enjoyable for the ten or so hours it took me to beat it.  I must say to have a first person shooter to have a story that long was a welcome relief from the normal four or five.The original Crysis offered a lot of sandbox options and I found myself playing certain scenes over and over a lot of times.  My favorite was having a jeep come towards you and shooting the front tire out and watching it flip and punching everyone to death inside if they happen to survive.  So much to do in the world and approach was left to the individual.  I know this game isn't called Crysis 1 so no need to point it out that this is a completely different game.  So anyways I found that type of play lacking in the this game.  Nothing stuck out to me that made me want to keep coming back.  The achievements are of course a draw to go back and play along with some great cinematic spots like building collapsing.As far as gameplay the second game does kind of present fight areas in a sandbox style with combat options but no open spaces to allow for absolute freedom.  So basically you have freedom to fight out the battle in the way you want but just in a very small way.  All the great suit functions are there but my favorite is the good old cloak and punch or grab or possibly a broken neck.  Everything about the combat has been simplified and I guess a little easier to do than the first except double tapping y was a strange thing for the controls.  I am gonna mention the glitches I came across since it was part of the gameplay.  I did find some odd graphic glitches when soldiers would completely disappear without dying but I could still hear them all talking and their gun fire like they were next to me.  A few times the drop ships were completely invisible and all you could see were the exhaust lights.  The A.I. was either to dumb or to aware but some were just right.  I came across a couple running in place and some wouldn't dies while I killed one guy and he stood there dead in mid air.  I wish I still had my happgauge 1212 to record this stuff but it was great funny things.  My problem was also when I was cloaked the enemy usually still sees me.  I was standing perfectly still and the guy still saw me which was annoying.  It kind of took me out of the gameplay and I found myself just armoring up and doing some fast running than face shooting or punching.  One glitch was my gun was stuck up to my face in the aim position and it wouldn't go down.  The one thing that drove me nuts was when I would wipe out ten guys then turn invisible the guy or two walking around would stop and say something hilarious like area clear or he's not here.  I mean I just wiped all these guys out.  Some I would shoot sneak off and they would just go back to their normal duty of walking around.  I would say gameplay is a almost close to four but a 3 out of 5.The story is o.k but I found it to be like the first game which I thought was weak but still a little better as well but everything turned into a go to point a and point b type thing which seemed over simplified.  I think the story is actually kind of a weak spot and I don't wanna say much about it since someone else might really enjoy it and its not like it terrible but just kind of predictable I guess.  This game might be a draw story wise for some but for me just like the first it was more about the gameplay.  The game does pick up about two or so hours in and the gameplay picks up so just make sure you put a few hours in before you decide how terrible it might be.  I did like the feeling of the city that it was in chaos and things were going on in it.  As far as explanation of whats going on you are kind of out of the loop at times and I was wondering what was going on.  I would have to say that its more of a 3 out 5 for the story.I need to point out I am not a Crysis loyalist so don't think by pointing out comparisons to the first I am biased against the second.  I am certainly not since I am not really a fanboy by any means I own all consoles and a pc.  I have been gaming for twenty five years so I don't really feel a need to destroy what other people enjoy simply because I am prone to one side. Some of the reviews on Amazon annoy me like crazy especially when they recommend what you should play instead. But anyways back to the review.The graphics shocked me from the start I thought it wasn't gonna look this good but I was surprised.  Being on a console it reminded me of a PC.  Though I think the game would run better on a decked out PC this still looked great.  Plus I am 1 of the 3 people with 3D on their t.v. that never use it and its a nice feature to have I guess though I think I have only used it maybe four or five times.  The feature on this game actually looked natural though kind of flat and as far as graphics in 3d I thinks its the best I have seen.  I will say it didn't stick out very far in fact I had to sit close just to get a decent effect but the best graphics in 3d I have seen in 3d.  I found 3d in Black Ops as soon as you pull the gun up to your face to aim there was kind of a second ghost and you couldn't use it since you couldn't see through it.  The PS3 does seem to do 3D a little better as far as the game actually coming out.  Though I have only played Black Ops, Killzone 3 and something else I cant remember in 3d.  I did have a few frame rate drops but nothing that was an issue in non 3D.  I have to say 5 out of 5 on graphics.The music is fantastic and I really enjoyed just listening to the soundtrack.  The sound effects were awesome cranked though I no longer have a surround sound.  I was disappointed by the voices of the enemy soldiers with only a couple of lines and usually the few people doing it.  Not really that big of a deal and it really doesn't take away from the gameplay any.  One thing that disappointed me which is kind of dumb and doesn't affect anything in the game is the grenade sound believe me there was a great sound in the explosion but if you have a chance play the first game and listen to the grenade explosion along with the blur effect it blew me away to see.  Sound though is still a 5 out 5 nonetheless.Multiplayer is fun but the maps are small but fast paced.  The demo of multiplayer I played at first the controls felt awkward like turning side to side was stiff.  I guess me playing through the single player helped get through those control issues I had in the demo since I played through the entire thing first before even touching the multiplayer. The action feels more like Call of Duty with an overlay of Crysis.  It will feel familiar well it did for me anyways.  That is what struck me at first.  As soon as I dropped in I was enjoying it from the start.  The one thing that got to be a problem was when I would spawn someone would be running around the corner just in time to kill me.  Multiplayer doesn't feel fresh by any means but it is good fun and a good change.  I wish the maps were bigger.  I find myself imagining the first games maps which were bigger and the action was just as intense.  Hopefully they will have bigger maps later or something like that maybe just one or two.  Not to big since Crysis doesn't feel like it should be played on a Battlefield map.  Leveling up and stuff like that is nothing new and its easy to jump in and play and get your but kicked.  I say 4 out of 5 for multiplayer.Games are kind of hard to review since we all have our own tastes and preferences and some pick up on more things than others but its more about the individual experience.  I didn't really go into much detail about a lot of things in the game since a lot has already been said and this review is already running long.  I stick by my 3 out of 5 though its more of a 3 15/16 out of 5.  The last thing I will say is its worth playing and seeing if you like it.  I take my review system like this 5 meaning almost perfection and 1 being a turd with no hope but a flush.  This game might blow you away or the hype may get you expecting its something that its not.  Its a good game don't get me wrong but try it love it than buy.  That is kind of my policy before I buy a game it has to be worth five stars.  Some might be accosted by my 3 stars but its not gaming perfection but anyways thats my take as I did play the whole thing.  If you read all this review than thank you so much.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2011"}

Nicholson","summary":"Frontlines...Play it on 'hard' to get the most out of this game","reviewText":"A good game that has some interesting features.I purchased this game from 'Steam' and after a long, sporadic download (off and on over 24+ hours) and then some difficulty getting it to load, I FINALLY got to play this game. (I suggest, before buying, that you visit the forums to see some of the troubles people are having.)I initially played this game on 'normal' difficulty and found that it was fairly easy; the enemy were not that strong, my buddies although useful at times, didn't seem to do much, and my character seemed to be able to take a pounding before getting killed. However, playing on 'hardcore' difficulty, gave this game a entirely new dimension; it was a real challenge (but a doable challenge).Some comments on what I liked and didn't like: (played on single player)1.)Excellent smooth flowing graphics, good audio (even a good 'heroic-type' music tract [usually I turn the music off in games as I find it annoying]) that was pleasant to listen to. Also, some interesting 'cut-scenes' (which you can skip).2.)There are the usual large variety of weapons; rifle, explosives, rocket launcher etc., but there are some interesting new remote controlled 'drone' robots (both ground and airborne) that do add a new twist to the FPS concept. These units can be used either as 1st or 3rd person and once you get the hang of manipulating these robots skillfully, they are exceptional pieces of weaponry.3.)Although specific objectives must be obtained to complete a game segment, there is no order in which tasks have to be done and furthermore you usually have several ways of approaching a target, giving the game a certain amount of non-linear play to it.4.)You get to operate a number of vehicles (both ground and air) and their weapons. Most of these vehicles can be played in either 1st person or 3rd person with a toggle key; obviously 1st person is the most realistic, but the 3rd person is extremely useful for looking around to get your bearings and to see where the danger is.5.)There are no quick F5/F9 game save/loads; you must reach a game check point to autosave (which basically means completing a specific objective). If you died you can 'redeploy' (up to 5 times) somewhere near where you died. This feature seemed to work well and checkpoints were reasonably spaced apart.On the negative side;1.)Learning to fly and control a helicopter was an exercise in perseverance and frustration; I'm not sure the time I spent on this was worth the mediocre results.2.)This game had a LONG load time from icon click to actual playing, however the restarts after dying (redeploys), were fairly fast.3.)With the 'Steam' download there were two concerns;A.)there was no manual available; this would have been very useful for general info and also for the different key combos that the different modes (infantry, driving, flying etc.) required . (these keys designations are available in options>controls but are inconvenient to look up in the middle of battle)B.)there was no key code to unlock the 'extras' which apparently contained some extra levels and cheat codes.4.)This is a fairly short game; only 8 campaigns (that have 4-5 sections each). I finished this game in two days of intermittent play. Not much playing time for $50 US.Conclusions:A short game, that graphically was well done, and it does have some interesting scenarios and ideas. And although it doesn't quite have that visceral intensity of Call of Duty 4, it is still an interesting and complex FPS. This game, played on 'easy' or 'normal' difficulty resulted in just a so-so rating, BUT on 'hardcore' it required some thinking and planning (and using your fellow soldiers), and thus making it intriguing FPS to play! 3 1/2 - 4 StarsSys Specs; Played on Vista with a Dual core processor, P5K motherboard, 2 GB RAM and nVidia 8800 GTS card","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2008"}

(Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...","summary":"One of the finest handhelds there is!","reviewText":"(Rewritten on 7/22/2012)I've played them all. From the monochrome old-school Game Boy to the Game Boy Advance...to here. As can be expected by how Nintendo's handheld series turn out (Game Boy is the original - Color is an upgrade - Advance is a whole new system with the Game Boy charm), the 3rd entry in the DS line was terrifically AWESOME and was like a whole new system with the DS's style.There is a lot to love about the Nintendo 3DS. There's a joystick (Circle Pad) for smooth analog control, actual 3D without the need of glasses, a SLIDER for how intense the 3D could be (Or even just turn it off), ETC. There's already quite a bit cleverly crammed into this little system. There's an MP3 Player, Netflix, an online shop for downloadable titles AND demos for retail games, a built-in game, AR cards, and so on. And best of all, they all work out greatly!The 3DS has a pretty huge library of games, and already are there bunches of favorites you shouldn't miss out on. Such game series that made it into the scene are Nintendo franchises like Mario, Pokemon, Animal Crossing, and even Kid Icarus. What's awesome about the game library, though, is the third-party support the 3DS is getting compared to the Wii. I mean, really. Street Fighter IV and Metal Gear Solid 3 have been ported onto here! These are kinds of games that are VERY unlikely to be on the Wii! Original third-party titles such as Rhythm Thief (Sega) and Kingdom Hearts 3D (Square) are certainly worth looking out for.(Yes DS games can be played on this thing)The Nintendo 3DS eshop is that online shop I mentioned earlier. Along with providing free playable demos of games you see on shelves, it also offers its own library of games that are worth anywhere less than $10 (Few titles are slightly more expensive than that mark). If you don't want to pay for games that are over $30 at some store, the eshop is the way to go for other games that are more affordable. Of if you want to know if a game at said store is good or not...Well, try out the demos! Plus, for nostalgia junkies, classic Game Boy, NES, Turbografx, and Sega Game Gear titles have been released as downloadable titles! The eshop service as a whole is brilliant and is certainly a step up from the Nintendo DSi's shop.Lastly, Nintendo has really made a better effort to having us communicate with one another. Yeah, Friend Codes are still kind of a pain, but you only need them for the system, and not individual games! Once you enter a Friend Code, that's it. You can also join in his/her server in a Nintendo game if you own a copy, too. What I didn't like was that you can only put in so few letters into a message. You need to simplify your sentences if you really want to talk to a friend online.But overall, this is one heck of a portable thrill. 3D or not, you need to go buy this! There's so many games you can nab (eshop + retail games) that it can just be simply described as more bang for your buck. The game library is certainly turning out to be a million times better than the DS and Wii's games. Plus, there's all these different apps (Netflix, MP3 Player, so on).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000E0VMVM","reviewerName":"M. Gray","summary":"almost as good as its predecessor","reviewText":"I thought I was buying Kingdon Hearts II when I bought Shadow Hearts 3.  (I don't know what I was thinking, I just remembered Hearts was in the title) To my relief, I fell in love with this game. I played this game before the 1st two simply because I did not know they existed.  When I read in a magazine that SH 1 is one of the top 10 rare rpg's to own, I had to have it, along with SH 2.SH 3 has a new lead character than the 1st two.  I know a lot of SH fans miss Yuri, but hey, this is a game, get over it.  The characters in this game are equally impressive and hold their own in the game.  I have to say that my favorite character would be Shania.  She had this \"like or not, I don't care attitude\" and her fusions are awsome.  Especially her La Sirene fusion.  She only has 4 spirits she can fuse with unlike Yuri, who had like 20.  I think that having just the 4 fusions is much better because it makes game play much easier to strategize.Each character also had his/her own type weapon to control, like Johnny uses a knife, Shania uses her axes, Natan uses guns for his \"Gun Fu\".  As you advance in the game, you're able to purchase more powerful weapons and better armor.  However, do not buy for Frank, all his weapons are either found, or won.  Also, only buy for the characters you use the most.  Money in this game is not plentiful, unlike the first game.  Spend your money wisely!!!I can't say this game is as good as the 2nd Sh, but at least Sh 3 tries to tie in the 1st two games in a very subtle way. If you have played SH 2, when you are in Times Square in SH 3, you'll notice a shop named Gepetto and Cornelia, sound familiar?  Some of you might have seen that the first play through, but I only recently noticed.  And the ring spirit, Aya, her \"daddy\" was the ring soul in Sh 2.  I guess they are just trying to keep some familiarity in all the games, sort of like FF did with the Chocobos.The judgement ring is back and as always, it determines the success (or failure) of your attack, the ring spirit is back, and of course, Roger  Bacon is back. If you've never played a SH game and don't know what I'm talking about, not to worry, you really don't need to play the 1st two games to enjoy the third sh installment.The story is rather straight forward, nothing too complicated, which for me was good.  And, if you get bored, go do some side quests, which there are many.  Like snap collecting.  Johnny takes pictures of all the monsters the team battles.  He can then trade those snaps to various snap collectors throughout the game in exchange for rare and even necessary items.  Be warned though, in order to open up the hardest side quest in the game, Johnny MUST take a picture of every monster.  He might not be able to trade them, but they are necessary.The battle system is your basic turn based rpg, but the judgement ring is what makes this game different.  That is what makes or breaks your attack.There is also something called Stellar Charts.  Equip your characters with a specific Stellar Chart, like Libra, and then you can equip certain stellars to that chart, like Cure.  Only Shania doesn't have a Stellar Chart because she had fusion forms.  You can then upgrade your stellar chart to make your attacks more powerful and even cost less MP to use.  Stellar Charts are a great way to customize your team.There is so much more I can say about this game, but It's just easier to play.  If you want to try an awsome, yet a little out there, rgp, I truly recommend this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2007"}

{"product_name":"B002I0JBL4","description":"","reviewerName":"Matt32 \"LIGHT WEIGHT\"","summary":"I am fairly surprised","reviewText":"Finally after 12 years of waiting, a new Duke Nukem game!  I am proud to say that I am fairly surprised.  I really thought the game was going to be a complete let-down.  Actually, Duke Nukem Forever is well put together.  There are many new features that make it a cut above the rest of games of this type.  The massive amount of interaction coupled with the first person shooter makes it a crossbreed of Zelda and Medal of Honor.  If you are unfamiliar with the Duke games, its basically a testosterone filled hulk of an Arnold Schwarzenegger/Jean Claude Van Damme offspring who is out to single-handedly save the world from aliens who are harvesting our earth women.  Plenty of lewdness and outlandish behavior.  Parents, this Duke truly deserves its Mature rating so DO NOT buy this for the kids!Call of Duty fan boys will hate this game.  You aren't just running and gunning your way through.  The interaction with the environment is extensive, you can adjust just about everything from the running water of sinks to lifting weights and buying a pack of cigs from a vending machine.  The basic idea is fire-fight/thinking situation/fire-fight/thinking situation.  You must interact and figure out puzzles to advance (hence why I compared it to Zelda).  Thats what sets this game apart, its not a mindless shooter.  The ammo comes sparse so you are forced to rely on weapons you pickup, not just carry the one you are used to.  This pushes you out of your comfort zone and really makes for a great challenge.  No more just run, shoot, its over.While I must say I'm shocked at how good the game is (considering the negative reviews I've read) the game does have its short-comings.  I've found:1- Shoddy hit detection, but what FPS doesn't have this problem?! Guns are hard to aim, leading to a more pray and spray tactic.2- The ability to interact not only makes the game, but hurts it as well.  Some of the puzzles are time consuming and difficult to figure out.  When you get it, you just want to kick yourself for being so stupid but, it does interrupt game flow a bit.3- Movement and controls are fine, they just weren't as smooth as I had hoped for.  Duke is a bit jerky and lanky, kind of like the movement of Medal of Honor (I hate to keep comparing but I know people can relate to these games).4- Graphics are ok, I really don't see why everyone is complaining.  There is a lot of attention to detail in this game while keeping the gritty classic look.  I was expecting more however, with a 12 year wait (and then a release date delay).As far as I can tell, those are my only four complaints.  This game is meant to be fun, its supposed to push the envelope of what game creators can get away with.  Take the multiplayer for example; it is designed strictly to be goofy and fun.  Really interesting, I won't spoil it for you, just check it out.  Aimed at the casual gamer instead of competetive (and probably designed so that hackers/glitchers won't be too interested in it).  The villians each have their own unique weapons and attributes and you must learn how to approach and dispatch each of them.  Not just your blind firing skills are tested, you must use your cunning, your stealth, your mind, and your hand/eye coordination.  The game makes sure to test every aspect of your gaming.  You also have to rely on performance enhancing items like beer (toughens you), steroids (makes your melee stronger), and Duke Vision (night vision).  The first few levels are slow moving, but that is so you can develop a feel for the game and I welcome that idea.  Stay away from the Piece of Cake difficulty and you've got a hard game on your hands!The introduction of vehicles into the world of Duke Nukem is a welcome one.  Not only are they fun to drive, but are useful as weapons and quick transportation.  The loading times are long, but if you got through Force Unleashed, you know what to expect.  The maps are fun to navigate and its interesting to find different things you can manipulate.People who are complaining about this game taking 12 years to make are fools.  They seriously think they worked 8 hours a day every day a week on this for all 12 years!  I mean, honestly, what did you expect?  The basic idea is that a guy runs around and kills aliens.  Lots of games and movies follow this model.  There really isn't much you can do with that.  The designers went an extra mile to make sure the monotony of the standard first person shooter was broken. I am finding most of the people that are complaining didn't even know Duke Nukem existed until this game.  If all they were expecting was another first person shooter, then yes I can see why they are disappointed.  All the haters are just mad Call of Duty couldn't have pulled off something like this :)  I believe its the younger kids complaining, the ones that grew up in the boom of games like Call of Duty that require little to no skill.  Duke Nukem Forever is old school gaming, this is back to the N64 with all the technology of today.  This is how we used to go HAM in the old days kiddies!They hit the nail on the head.  Is it the greatest game ever?  No, but it does welcome Duke back with style. The dialogue and off-color humor are awesome, never have I heard a game with more humor, swearing or such dirty sexual references.  They went overboard, and in a good way.  This game is worth the money.  Too much hype was put behind it, I agree, but its still an awesome game I think people looking for something fresh will enjoy.  Pick it up.*P.S. Balls of Steel Edition...not worth the money.  Unless you are a hardcore Duke fan, its really just a bunch of cheap garbage there to entice a sale.  Nothing you can't live without.  Do you really need a little cardboard cut-out of Duke that looks like it came from Burger King?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2011"}

As a member of a black-on-black organization, you are tasked with finding the leader and retrieving the weaponry.Alpha Protocol manages to come up with a good and well thought out balance between the action and the RPG halves that it tries to juggle. From word one, you begin to customize your character by what you say and how you act. While most people I'm certain will fall into the ruthless or professional categories, you can pick and choose with a little more degree than that, and nearly every action could have a perk waiting behind it, awarded for playing a certain part. Perks play like in Fallout, though they have far less impact and there are many more of them.Graphics are hit and miss. While the backgrounds and character models are great in some instances, at other times there are glaring clipping errors, and I've seen a few moments where my hair is struggling to keep up with the rest of me.Dialogue flows beautifully, and while some of the lines stretch the boundaries, everything manages to snap neatly together. You are borderline forced to follow every conversation line of line, as the dialogue options can't really be skipped to, and while there are only three options, there are very rare moments when what you mean and what the game decided you meant are completely different, and the terms can be vague at times.The action element could've used some polish, but nothing that crops up manages to be more than a major annoyance. Enemies can snap around, but not in a glitchy way, but almost more realistic than following the gentle, predictable routes that were programmed into them. What counts as cover that hides you and cover that you can be spotted behind is up to the first test to decide, as the enemy can apparently see you're aura at times, while missing your gun barrel in the middle of the door at others. The sneaking tends to be a bit choppy, and having been fed a steady diet of Splinter Cell, my bar for that is very high. The gadgetry minigames are great except for the hacking, and I weep for those poor souls without a good and large enough TV to be able to spot the lines you need.While hand to hand is fairly well done, it doesn't serve as a bulldozer but still manages to be useful, gunplay is severly hampered by a somewhat dodgy setup. You can't do select fire, and the limitations on modification to weapons is a tad annoying. Critical hits and aiming reticules work well though are very bland, but its nice to see enemies and you lose aim and stagger when getting hit rather than shrugging it off like a bee sting. Merchants work well, and you can bribe maps, info, and even bonus objectives by greasing some palms, and email manages to be just frequent enough but not be annoying.While this would have required more polish to make it better than a Mass Effect, with the dialogue, the character interactions and wide variety of personalities and outlooks, this manages to be almost more of an RPG than it. Only in the action portions does this start to lose some shine, but not nearly enough to matter. Well placed save points and a few dry runs are all that's required to make up for it. Part movie and part Bond/Bourne/Bauer action game, this has actually managed to be what it promised. Its not as sneaky as Splinter Cell, not as gunslinging or exploratory as Fallout or Borderlands, or even as filled with dialogue and backstory as Mass Effect. Its almost exactly like playing an action movie. Periods of dialogue and story development punctuated by shootouts on boats and in desert warehouses. The effects from the gunfights aren't exactly what you were hoping for, but you hopefully came more for the story than to see the highest body count possible.Considering several people apparently don't care for my writing, could you please comment why if you don't find this review useful.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2010"}

James/Jason/Jack Bond/Bourne/Bauer","reviewText":"When I first heard that Obsidian (Knights of the Old Republic II: Sith Lords) was teaming up with Sega to create the first-ever espionage, I was genuinely excited about the prospect.  Two years of waiting later, and over a day and a half of playing, I am reasonably satisfied with Alpha Protocol albeit with some moderate concerns.Story:The story is definitely on par with anything Robert Ludlum ever wrote.  You are Edward Thornton, a recently recruited spy to stop terrorists from blowing stuff up.  Along the way you encounter beautiful dames, evil bad guys, double agents, friends turned bad, deception, drama, blah, blah, blah.  Very contemporary and fairly compelling as one would expect from a spy game.  Wanna know more?  Play the game!Game Play:When I researched and read about Alpha Protocol, two games struck me as strikingly similar in nature and would be the basis for comparison: Splinter Cell and Mass Effect.  One for it's stealthy nature and the other for it's strikingly similar game play respectively.  While playing through Alpha Protocol with a neutral observer (a poor soul unfortunate enough to venture to my place for a free beer and ended up having to watch me play for a few hours) we found ourselves consistently comparing Alpha Protocol to the two games mentioned.The game centers around three basic mindsets of spy game play; professional, suave, and aggressive or Jason Bourne, James Bond, and Jack Bauer respectively (my apologies if you get none of the spy pop culture references).  You can go guns-a-blazing in a situation, sneak around, or, in less instances than you'd think, you use tech and sabotage to make your way around.  However, more often than not, you're either gonna sneak around and ninja vanish kill everyone or just charge in like Gears of War... although the latter doesn't work as well.So, you're probably gonna have to sneak around.  Fortunately, the AI has a very linear though process and will follow their assigned paths perfectly making observation and killing very easy.  The trick is to try and make your path of killing not coincide with the vantage point of another bad guy.  Again, fortunately, the designers of the maps made flanking very easy with alternate paths to follow.Combat is where it gets interesting... in a \"you got to be kidding me\" sort of way.  Close-quarter martial arts consists of rapidly hitting the red \"A\" button when you get too close to utilize your firearm.  Problem with this is that the \"A\" button also corresponds with your \"takedown\" command so while tailing bad guys I would get close, the bad guy would move a little and my \"takedown\" command would disappear but, too late!  I already hit the melee button and thus my cover is blown.  This happened A LOT when I was playing and it got annoying.As for shooting your firearm, the accuracy of said firearms revolves a lot around the same physics as Knights of the Old Republic II: Sith Lords as in you have a certain chance of missing even with the enemy in your crosshairs... this means you will miss a lot early on in the game until you hone your skills even if the bad guys is ten feet in front of you.  Needless to say, the combat really needs an update patch.Next are the gadget mini games.  The lock pick and bypass games are interesting enough and very similar to Mass Effect 2.  The only one that REALLY sucks is hacking, where you take a line of code and try to find it in an ever-changing grid of characters.  Unless you have a big screen and a fair amount of depth perception, this mini-game will crush your soul.  It took me five times to get it right the first time because my darned A.D.D. wouldn't let me focus right.  :P  Needless to say, take your ritalin (use as directed) before attempting this mini-game.Between missions you can customize your character at safe houses and change your most basic of appearances.  After being able to create anyone I want in Mass Effect 1 and 2, Fallout 3, Dragon Age: Origins, and Oblivion, I found myself seriously restricted in customizing Thornton beyond hair, hat, and maybe putting some kewl accessories on the pistol.Lastly is the dialog system.  Love the idea of very basic word choices, derived from the three spy \"JBs\" mentioned earlier, changing an entire outcome in the game whether big or small.  It can spell the difference between success and failure, victory and defeat.  It is highly entertaining to try out the dialog choices but my beefs with it are two fold.1:  You only experience dialog at key points and during mission briefs/debriefs.  In Mass Effect and similar games such dialog systems where omnipresent if not a substantial part of the game.2:  Some of the differences between the three spy mannerisms were way too subtle and lack any real excitement.  I was hoping for an over-the-top James Bond style dialog every time I chose \"suave.\"  It just doesn't seem as genuine as originally hyped.One more beef... no sniper rifles?  Not kewl man, not kewl.Graphics:Good sometimes, bad at others.  Am I the only one who had trouble aiming down the sights due to the graphics not being able to catch up or the calibration was off?  Facial graphics are standard, nothing amazing. The environments are authentic, but hardly breathtaking.Sounds and music:Mostly rehashed stuff from other films.  Again, nothing special although the dialog is wonderfully recorded and seamlessly applied.  Kudos there.Replay Value:Moderate.  I felt more motivated to get a few achievements by skimming the origin stories in Dragon Age: Origins more than playing through Alpha Protocol.All in all Alpha Protocol could have been simply amazing but decided not too.  Obsidian and Sega have many glitches to fix and need to make the game a LOT less linear.85% overall.  Solid B.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2010"}

vu. if you were to hand the controller to a fan of the original without telling them what they were playing it would take them a couple of levels to recognize it as goldeneye; if they were playing multiplayer, they wouldn't recognize it at all. that's not a bad thing, however, as the reason everyone wanted a remake in the first place was that the original has aged very poorly.---the single player game features extremely high production values, with a script rewritten by the original writer, a score by the composer of the films, key roles played by the film actors, and extensive motion capture to make it all look convincing. the story unfolds much like eurocom's last game, dead space extraction, with real time cutscenes that don't remove the player from gameplay very often. there are occasional dips where the story stops feeling like a playable bond film and veers into typical video game awkwardness, but for the most part the storytelling, acting and directing are all well done, especially over the course of bond's first and last missions with trevelyan.health regenerates and weapons are limited to two at a time (with bond's p99 as a permanent third choice). enemies no longer behave like cardboard cutouts and can very quickly multiply around you, making direct confrontations much more dangerous than the original (which largely let you run around guns blazing without consequence). regenerating health diminishes the strategy required to reach the end of a level, but at times feels like a necessary addition to make difficult stretches playable; the developers included a \"classic\" mode without regenerating health (complete with hidden body armor) so that you can play whichever way you prefer.the levels are entirely new designs aside from the opening dam, which is a recreation of the original n64 level. the art direction and architecture are extremely well done, at times almost rivaling retro studios' work in metroid corruption. from the stormy dam to blizzard drenched siberian forests to a mountainous african jungle, the environments never disappoint.unfortunately, while the new maps are very competently designed they are also extremely linear, often giving you a feeling of being funneled from one gunfight to another. the worst of this linearity is when the path needlessly closes up behind you after reaching a checkpoint, leaving you s.o.l. if you need to go back and complete an objective you may have missed. there are always multiple little paths to take along the way, however, and choosing one route over another can alter the way the level progresses a moderate amount. like the original, higher difficulties introduce more objectives that will take you into different parts of a level, giving you a fuller world to explore and helping to offset the linearity. the objectives feel a little uninspired compared to the original, almost always revolving around bond's cell phone, but they still go a long way towards deepening the game and giving you a break from shooting people.the emphasis on stealth is the single largest evolution of the gameplay, with bond's sneaking options expanded far beyond the rudimentary \"use a silencer or don't\" of the original. guards will respond to any attacks in their eye-line and will go on alert if they so much as hear bond's footsteps nearby. this leads to silently crouching and taking guards out one at a time with either a silenced headshot or a melee takedown, giving the game a first-person metal gear quality. rooms are set up like puzzles with different guards covering different zones and making different rounds through the area, and figuring out the correct order to neutralize them in without being spotted is a fun challenge.there are a few problems with the stealth, the first of which is bond's glitched p99; the gun shoots much lower than the sights indicate, and when you compensate for this and aim higher than your target, the body of the gun blocks your view of the enemy completely, making it a guessing game as to whether your headshots will connect and often leads to guards sounding the alarms. the fact that a blight this fundamental to the gameplay made it through glitch testing is astounding (the bug was fixed for goldeneye: reloaded). enemies also seem a little too sensitive to your presence in general, sometimes spotting you even when silently moving behind cover and leaving you with no clue what you did wrong.the hit detection is very poor, with nearby rails and peripheral objects that aren't directly in your line of fire taking your bullets anyway. ducking behind cover rarely prevents you from getting hit, and when the room is full of enemies this often makes you feel like there's no possible way to avoid being shot. luckily the game has a generous checkpoint system to make these segments less frustrating when you die, and these problems aren't annoying enough to ruin what is overall a very good campaign.the single player game regrettably lacks one of the original game's best features- the cheat menu. like the original there are time trials to complete for each level, but this time there's no reward for beating them and with the extremely high difficulty there's little incentive to try. with linear level design and no cheats to enhance the replay value, the game won't pull you back in nearly as often as the original.--when it comes to controls the game offers options for every wii compatible device, although most players will settle on either the wiimote or classic controller pro. nintendo worked with eurocom to ensure that the remote controls would function well, but the effort seems to have been in vain; while the customization options are expansive and the physics are great, the controls are absolutely riddled with game-breaking glitches. every time you sprint, aim down the sights, vault over obstacles, pick up a gun, or perform nearly any action whatsoever, the dead zone will lock and prevent you from turning. this prevents you from maneuvering or targeting for a brief moment each time it happens, which is obviously a huge problem when playing online. not being able to rely on the game to perform movements as simple as turning the camera is an incredible annoyance, and one can only assume eurocom missed these glitches by doing most of their play testing with a dual analog controller.---the multiplayer travels far from the original game, with splitscreen failing to capture most of what made the original fun. aside from a few game modes (golden gun, you only live twice) and some cosmetic throwbacks like paintball and playable villains there's really not much that much separating this from call of duty; regenerating health is mandatory and weapons are chosen from preset loadouts, which removes all of the strategy of collecting the best weapons from the map before your friends do. the splitscreen loadouts are not customizable and the very best guns are available alongside the worst, leaving little reason to ever experiment with more than a few classes. this leaves the weapon system in an unfortunate middle ground between new and old- all the strategy of the old game is missing and none of the customization and leveling that makes modern games fun is there.this doesn't mean that the splitscreen mode is bad, but it has a very limited feel compared to other modern shooters. large areas of the maps are blocked off to keep players from getting too far from one another, a limitation that claims some of the best parts of every level. the preset loadouts not only reduce the strategy but also a lot of the spontaneity; when every player starts with the same guns every time it begins to feel like you've seen all the game has to offer after only a couple rounds.online play is a much fuller experience; the maps open up, the loadouts are customizable, and the number of game modes increases several times over. out of the 10 maps there isn't a single bad one and the quality of their design is just as brilliant as (if not better than) the original. while there are some very large and open levels, the new maps for the most part feel a little more compact and maze-like than most modern shooters. this makes for more chaotic gameplay with players forced to engage each other face to face more often than sniping each other across vast expanses.there are enough game modes to choose from to keep you from getting bored, and every single one of them truly is fun- heroes mode randomly gives one member of your team the power to kill faster, take more damage, and refill the health of players around him; the trade off is that the other team gets massive points if he dies. black box is a spin on capture the flag where one team attempts to hold the box while the other attempts to destroy it, making for a very different match depending on which side you're on. golden gun returns and is just as fun online with 8 people as it was in the old days.unfortunately, while the components of good online play are there, the online system is a pitiful and half baked effort that can be summed up in three phrases: lag, host quitting, and noob tubers. lag is so prominent that players will often ending up mutually killing each other in fights no matter who shot first or killed first; the game is so slow to keep up that both players are riddled with shots by the time that one of them finally drops dead.in the event that the host quits (and it happens constantly), the game returns all players to the lobby with none of their xp or stats saved. considering how long it takes to level up in this game, losing any xp is a frustration, but hosts have a habit of quitting most frequently when you're playing your absolute best; you can expect to lose large amounts of xp and any killstreak records you've accumulated in good matches over and over again simply because the hosts leave when they're being beaten.then there are problems with constant noob tubers (players who abuse the grenade launcher), hackers, campers, and cheap players in general. these issues are present in any online FPS, but the playing community for goldeneye seems absolute intent on ruining the game with these tactics.---overall the new goldeneye is a solid FPS, but the final product feels like a buggy beta version that wasn't ready for release. the single player offers an experience that plays far better than the original game does today, even if it doesn't always keep it's best qualities consistently up to the same level throughout, and the multiplayer offers hundreds of hours of fun with addictive (if buggy) online play. it may not capture everything that made the original game fun, but what it does capture is the same overall sense of being a well made first person shooter, and it at least feels more aesthetically harmonized with the original than anything since the n64 era. if only eurocom hadn't been so concerned with porting it to the HD systems as goldeneye: reloaded and done proper glitch testing, it could have been a first rate shooter. as it is, that first rate shooter is permanently buried under a messy collection of unfinished code.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00009ZVHR","description":"As action-reporter Jade, use your camera and Dai-Jo staff to capture truth from a deceptive government, and restore freedom from an alien invasion.","reviewerName":"An Android Fan","summary":"Beyond mediocre and bad","reviewText":"I decided to get the HD version that just released for the 360 not long ago. Never played the original, so I didn't walk in with any set expectations. All in all a decent game; hardly the shining paragon of classic gaming some hold this to, but $10 can be spent on plenty of worse games.The camera simply has to be one of the biggest frustrations this game has, bar none. It's very difficult to navigate and fight if you can't see what's going on. Many, many 3rd person games that are much older than the original have had tight, responsive cameras, so there was no excuse for it to be such a pain when it came out in 2003, let alone 2011. The stealth sections are also a chore at best and controller-throwing frustrating at worst. There's one that's thankfully optional where you shimmy on a narrow edge across two of three sides on a building to get to a door, then Jade, the protagonist, inexplicably enters into a walking animation. Since the side she's on doesn't get any wider, however, this leads to her falling back to the previous section, where you have to do it all over again. Eventually I worked out that you have to roll forward to bypass this, but it wasn't from any cues the game gave. Why this wasn't fixed is beyond me. A lack of a waypoint system makes it very difficult at times to find your objective. Instead, blind navigation has to rule the day if you're lost. Most areas are straightforward enough that this won't be an issue, but there's at least one where that's not the case.And I do like games that have collectibles to find. It's enjoyable to look around, explore every nook and cranny and clear everything out. It's also great when the game actually gives you useful rewards for your trouble. Beyond Good and Evil does the first, but not the second. Finding every pearl gets you an awful minigame where you have to control two different pearls in an obstacle course at the same time. It'd be nice if the second of those pearls didn't have inverted controls. (So left is right, and vice versa.) And the reward for finding every animal, already an extremely difficult task, since the animal scanner doesn't clear out animals you already photographed? A collection of photos. Yep. I'm not joking. Some ideas for practical, useful rewards would include increasing damage dealt to enemies, decreasing the charge time on that useless super attack, an increase in running speed, perhaps, maybe even a whole new area to explore, like what Illusion of Gaia did back in the early 90's if you found every crystal.But I gave it 3 stars, so obviously there must've been *something* I liked about the game, right? And there are; many somethings, actually. The cast is interesting and funny; even the minor characters have their own quirky personalities that are tough to forget. Not a single weak voice actor/actress. The game world is very unique. The story is well paced and doesn't drag out just to artificially make itself longer. The achievements aren't too tough to collect, so you get an easy 200 points to bump the gamerscore for those of you who enjoy collecting achievements. And watch the credits through. It'll be a bit, but it is worth the trouble.I am looking forward to the sequel to this game and I do hope that the developers take what they did right and build on that to make an exceptional game. Playing through this one made it obvious that there's plenty of untapped potential for a new powerhouse franchise. So it's worth a play through. Just don't expect it to be the ultimate gaming experience that trounces all others. The good does outweigh the evil in the end, so 3 stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2011"}

I've been looking forward to this game for the past 9 months.  Its hard for any game to live up to that kind of frenzy of expectation.  However,  I have to admit, I still think it is a more enjoyable game than Halo for the following reasons.1. Controlling a squad allows for more strategy and manuvering than controlling a single player.  The ability to sneak, scout, and snipe with specialist characters adds an element not present in Halo.2. Unlike Halo this game has a built in navigator with an arrow that always points north.  I know this seems like a minor point, but if you have ever spent 45 minutes wandering directionless in a cavern or ship in Halo you will appreciate the value of this feature.The graphics are excellent!The responsiveness of the game to the controller is great.Two minor critisisms:1. The character &quot;Hawk&quot; is too weak.  Even when held in reserve, at the first encouter with combat she dies.  Her special ability (invisibility) does not last enough time to be very useful.  When she runs out of stamina it can take 5 minutes of doing nothing waiting for her to regenerate.2.  The game does not take full advantage of squad based tactic to win.  There are many portions of the game where the &quot;run-and-gun&quot; approach work just as well as the tactical/careful approach.Like I said,  it isn't perfect, but its a damn fun game to play, especially with a buddy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2003"}

Crawl buildings or swing all day, stop random crimes or take on the story.  Similar not to GTA but True Crime, but too unique for direct comparison.  Not as horribly difficult or badly acted as I've read, but it could use more variety in some areas.THE LONG: When I was first debating buying this game, I kept seeing comparisons to Grand Theft Auto. I will immediately tell you this is misleading. You don't steal cars, you can't beat up civilians, and there's no big series of missions to take from different people. It has a couple similar elements to GTA, but in fact the game plays more like True Crime. Like in that game, you can co anywhere at any time, your missions revolve around random street crimes, and aside from a main storyline the bulk of the game's fun is coming from exploring and building up your records. This isn't to say Spider Man 2 isn't fun on its own, because it is. And it's different enough from most other games to really stand out.The game starts you off as Spidey and guides you through a brief but helpful and humorous tutorial delivered by none other than the man, Bruce Campbell himself. After that, it's up to you.  Swing from the rooftops, stop random crime, help citizens in distress, or take on the main storyline. It's all fun, thanks to the great graphics and controls. The game's gravity and speed system gives you a very proper sense of weight and control over Spiderman, and it's a definite blast to just zip around through the rather large city.Fight controls are, in my opinion, good as well. Like a true comic book hero, Spidey does all kinds of goofy leaps and flips mixed in with the fisticuffs. You can literally run and knock an opponent fifteen feet into the air, jump up and kick him down, then throw a web to catch him before you land and throw him against the side of the building. It's wild, and although you can simply beat guys up with one button, the joy is in all the different flourishes and moves you can execute.  And after seeing the films again last week, I was surprised by just how many specific moves they took from the movie for inclusion into the game. Still, there's also a sick humor in just grabbing a mugger, webbing up to the top of the Empire State Building, and hurling him off. Yes, the game lets you do this. And yeah, it's fun.The random and distress crimes are fun enough as well, but their downside is that, like True Crime, they boil down to the same core missions when it's all stripped down. It doesn't matter if the enemies are robbing a bank or stealing a purse, it'll still come down to you chasing down the baddies and beatin' em down.  There's some variation that involves Spidey's particular skills like rescuing hanging construction workers and people from sinking boats, but after a while the crime stuff does get repetitive. In all honesty I didn't have a problem with it until a good week after playing (and finishing) the game, but some will tire more quickly of the lack of variety in the actual objectives.Which leaves the storyline, which can pretty much be followed at your own pace (although most of Spidey's coolest moves will be unlocked this way). The actual story mode follows the general course of the movie but throws in much substance and characters for filler, and can probably be beaten in about a dozen hours for a casual player. Some, like EGM magazine, have made the boss battles seem ridiculously impossible, but I hardly had a problem with any of it. The toughest spot for me was a sort of obstacle course I was forced to participate in pretty early on, but this type of story mission occurred only once, and the rest to me was just fine. The voice acting was perfectly adequate as well, with no one sounding particularly worse or better than they sounded in the films (again, EGM's review notwithstanding). The same can't be said for the citizens though, who sound quite dumb, but in a fun, somehwat conscious way.But if all the rest of this stuff doesn't grab you, there's still loads of optional goals to complete. There are literally hundreds of icons to collect in the city, as well as races to try to win and small secrets to uncover (minor spoiler: don't expect too much other than pride if you expect to collect all the green info tokens. This is one of the more wiseguy jokes I've seen in a game, and you'll either laugh or cry after all that work. So heads up).In my honest opinion, Spider Man 2 is a hell of a game. It's just plain fun to rush around the city while web slinging, crawl to the tops of skyscrapers and swan dive off, and beat up countless thugs with crazy moves. I put in about 50 hours, and a lot of that has been spent just exploring and collecting.  It's good enough in the substance that it borrows from True Crime, and it's unique and well made enough on its own to really stand out. I really enjoyed it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2005"}

So this game really caught my attention and kept me.  This game is fantastic.  The graphics are excellent.  The story is original and the best part of all is that all of the actors from the movie are in it!!!!  What more could you ask for.  Usually when they do a movie, they have some professional voice actors trying to do their best at capturing the original character.  But this game actually used the real actors.  Dan Akryod, Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson and Annie Pots.  Not to mention others.  The controls are pretty good.  I'm still getting used to the different button configurations, which is why I try not to play too many games at once because then I get confused!!  But, what else is cool is that you get to upgrade your gear.  Buying new traps, EKG meters and best of all proton packs.  What would a Ghostbuster game be without the music.  Excellent music.  Very 80's.  Also, the ghosts are great!!!  There is one level where you have to find a ghost of a sea captain.  It's really cool what happens to the hotel.  I won't spoil it.

So, instead of simply reviewing the crash process of starting the game, I get to actually review the game itself.The game takes place in a near-futuristic London.  Essentially, demons have invaded London (not sure if they got all of the earth actually) and the cities population has retreated to the subways.  Not entirely sure why but it seems that demons fear subways and have left them alone for 20 years.I prefer to lay these reviews out in a Pro/Con format, so allow me to start with the pro's.Pro:Some interesting classes to choose from.  With your melee, shooter, and caster classes having two professions each, you will likely find something you like.  Skill tree systems (almost exactly like WoW) give you a limited chance to customize your character and different types of weaponry is available depending on your class.The melee classes work in a third person view for some good hacking and slashing fun while the shooters and casters enjoy the use of a first person shooter system of dodging, aiming and rather old school shooter gameplay.  The views are adjustable if you feel the need to play a different viewstyle, so don't think that you would be pigeonholed from the start.Con:Sorry that the pro's were so short, but that was really about it.The failing point of this game is that it is simply pure grind.  Now I understand that there are people who like grind in their MMORPG's, but in a single-player game, plotless grinding is about as much fun as.. well.. work.  Multiplayer may spruce this up a bit, but then again the day I buy a game for the purpose of multiplayer is the day I jam my arm into my mouth and start chewing mindlessly.I also got a bit annoyed with the \"talent trees\" for the classes.  Due to the huge lack of passive skills and the large slew of pointless skills, you can count on investing points into three or four things the entire game.  Couple this with the lack of decent hotkeys for your right mouse button (like Diablo 2 had) you really are only able to make use of 3 talents at a time.  It seems that if Hellgate was so intent on ripping off WoW and Diablo 2 they should have simply gone all of the way and snagged the good parts too.Balance issues were a bit annoying.  I first started out as a Blademaster but soon found it to be a meaningless class.  I love the idea of putting a weapon in each hand and rushing into combat, but when 95% of the baddies die in one swing, the second weapon is a bit pointless.  Essentially, I was able to do lots of damage, but noting lived long enough to make it worthwhile.  Since blademasters lack in any sort of defense, I got killed constantly.  Rather sad when compared with my Marksman or Evoker characters who never died the entire game.The user interface can go and dump itself off a bridge for as much as I love it.  Due to a terrible inventory system, you can count on opening it and playing a bit of Tetris every three minutes or so.  There is no autosort function and it seems that every rat you find is carrying a bazooka for some reason.  The minimap does little but show you where you are in respect to the wall next to you, even when zoomed out completely.  The main map shows you only that you are in a specific area, not where you are in it.  So, enjoy wandering around in circles in a vain attempt to find your exit.I noticed the random level generation plug in the game description somewhere, but I actually saw very little of it.  I played through the first act about three times with different classes and vividly recall going through the exact same level designs.  Items, monsters, quest objects and chests would be in different spots but the level layout looked the same each time.Which brings me to the last con, the look of the game itself.  To the people who have already played the game I ask \"What was your favorite level, the smashed up city street, the sewer/subway tunnel, the red colored hell level or the red colored smashed up city street level.  That was all that I saw in the game.  It gets so repetitive that you constantly find yourself backtracking (thank you worthless minimap) and getting nowhere in the badly textured, unimaginative wasteland that is London (or will be, sorry anyone who lives in London).To recap, Hellgate London is a grindtastic shootfest which exploits bits and pieces from World of Warcraft and any run of the mill shooter to make a dreary dull game.  You will do the same quests over and over again, in what looks like the same exact settings.  Gameplay issues will challenge you further than the creators ever actually intended as you attempt to uncover anything resembling a plot in this mess.In all, amusing for the first few hours, but almost a chore for any longer than that.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2008"}

OK, sure whatever.","reviewText":"This review is for Half-Life: Blue Shift (H-L:BS) and the High Definition pack (HD), If you want information about H-L:2 or Half-Life Opposing Force, you'll need to go elsewhere.To wit, this game caught me by surprise. One week, my usual foolish salesperson was ranting and raving about the soon to be released H-L:BS and next week, I see it in stores. I admit that I bought every single Half-Life (H-L) I could get my hands on from the original H-L and the Promo CD that came with ATI Rage cards, to the poorly done Gunman Chronicles (GC). I've downloaded and installed nearly every &quot;hot&quot; MOD that was flung out onto the web. So naturally, I snatched this up when I saw it in the stores.The HD pack offers very little other than enhanced characters and weapons. What I mean by enhanced is that the weapons are supposed to look more realistic, that is all! The levels look exactly the same. The A.I. did not improve any. It's really not worth the extra stress that the graphics would place on the hardware. Let's face it, the HD pack is not worth the price that any one wants for it. It should have been available for free much like the Team Fortress Classic. (I suppose it may be, I haven't checked to tell the truth.)So how is the game? Some of the most disappointing work I've seen. True, the level of detail and the devious level design are truly ingenious. I spent as much as thirty minutes on some levels trying to find my way about only to be thwarted by a well hidden tunnel or a well placed jumping pad. But despite the great levels, there aren't enough of them! The game is so short that I would have been better off playing GC which, up till now, was the shortest H-L based game. The game ends so abruptly that it's like a car hitting a brick wall. I sincerely thought that I was going to see some awesome programming prowess with a car I could actually drive! When it ends, it's , BAM! Just like that. I mean, where were all the extra stuff that I saw when I was riding the train? Oh . . . I walked right by it, I suppose. Where's the &quot;old&quot; Black Mesa base? Oh, wait. I'm walking around it now. That's a train yard? I'm not a train buff, but those train cars are impossible (Look at where the doors are placed on the cars). Aren't I supposed to be in the same base as Gordon Freeman? Oh wait, I guess I am. Oh well.&quot;OK,&quot; I thought, &quot;the game's over, I'll try it online.&quot; Guess what? There isn't any online gaming via H-L:BS. I checked with my original version of H-L. There is no online gaming if you just install H-L:BS. I'm guessing that the player can play online if they install H-L:O4 but that's just junk. The box clearly states that there is Multi-Player and it implies it in two different sections. One part for H-L:O4 and another for H-L:BS. What's the deal? So I read the manual, the box says it has Multi-Player support, the manual clearly states that there is a third pack in &quot;game&quot; called OpFor: On Line. What? It also clearly states that Multi-Player is only available in H-L:O4 (Page 8). What a joke. More hard drive space gobbled up unnecessarily.If you like H-L and you don't have the O4 pack then by all means buy this game. Otherwise, avoid it until you see it in the bargain bin. None of the &quot;extras&quot; are worth the incredibly short game and they really add nothing new by way of &quot;new&quot;. I had to give it two stars since I gave GC three and I consider this game a step down from GC. Sorry folks, it's just not worth it unless I see it in the bargain bin.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2001"}

I'll probably put in another 20-30 hours before I finish the game, and I might even start a new game after that to try out a different style of play.The only slightly disappointing aspect is that the preview videos showed a much more interactive and advanced A.I than what's actually in the game.  After a while, the NPCs start to say the same things over and over, although they seem to keep up to date with current events.  The conversational dialogues aren't as deep and dynamic as I had believed.  These are understandable limitations, but still disappointing to me.I've read that Bethesda had to turn down the A.I. and the graphical effects so that the game could run smoothly on most computers.  I'm glad that they did though, because Oblivion still takes quite a powerful computer to run at high settings.  I have an Athlon x2 4200+, 2GB of RAM, and a GeForce 7900GT and the game still gets sluggish at certain spots.  Oblivion seems to run better on ATi hardware so if you're looking to get a new video card just for this game, I would go for an X1800 or X1900 series card from ATi instead.  If you don't want to upgrade, the game is pretty scalable and still looks very nice with lower details and settings.Some people don't like the leveling system, but I don't mind it too much.  Whenever you level up, all the enemies in the world also level up to match you.  This keeps the game challenging, but if you play as a pacifistic-type character, you'll be at a huge disadvantage.  My first few levels came almost entirely from Speechcraft.  The wolves in the wild got stronger, but my character still couldn't use a bow to save his life.  After I realized this, I made sure to also work out my fighting skills before leveling up.The complaints that I listed above may seem pretty big, but they're actually completely overshadowed by how good the rest of the game is.  Once you realize how the leveling system works, you just have to make sure to work out your fighting skills too.  The game is open enough to allow for tons of different gameplay styles.  I'm playing as a likeable Robin Hood type character, while my friend is a sneaky assassin who spends most of his time picking wild ingredients to make potions with which he poisons his arrows.Everyone I know who has played Oblivion has loved it.  It's definitely worth getting, especially if you're a fan of RPGs.  Just make sure to have a lot of time to dedicate to playing it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2006"}

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"Michael Corona \"Nemesis Legion\"","summary":"Brave New World","reviewText":"Resident Evil 4 - Circa 2005GOOD:- Fast and furious game play- Original Resident Evil story with little to do with pervious Resident Evil gamesBAD:- When compared to other Resident Evil games this one is a little light on story- You have to buy almost all new guns and upgrades (which for some people is a pain)IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- This game is almost nothing like pervious Resident Evil games form the game play being very fast moving, to the story having no zombies or umbrella company- This game while harder combat wise when compared to other Resident Evil game is much easier in terms of puzzlesGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Resident Evil: Zero- Resident Evil (Remake on Game Cube)- Splinter Cell (not for story or stealth, but for shooting aspect that is similar in both games)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- Beating the game once will unlock Leon's Resident Evil 2 costume (police uniform), A arcade style battle mini-game, and a bouns Ada mini-game- The Playstation 2 version has bonus that the Game Cube doesn't (as well as all of the Game Cube bonus) have like a an expanded Ada mini-game and a 1920's Gangster costume for Leon (but you have to beat the game once to unlock theses options)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2006"}
{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"C.

No character dominates another, and the three main characters are Sora, Donald, and Goofy. The environments are awesome too, with FF locations as well as very familiar Disney locations as well. Disney characters and FF characters alike are incorporated perfectly everywhere throughout the game, and what you have is one of the greatest storylines in gaming history. The graphics are great, even without being as cel-shaded as Disney games and as top-notch as FFX. But Square does a great job of balancing out. It would be very weird to see 2-D alongside 3-D. For the music-oh, the beauty of the music! Disney remixes are AWESOME and make you feel dreamy, like you aren't even playing at all! The world that Square has created is awesome, and the game is by no means just for kids either! What Kingdom Hearts is is the greatest combination of franchises in years, and one good Action/RPG as well. The world of KH is so fantastic, and so honorable, that it could be the best game that Squaresoft has ever produced. For any fan of Disney or RPG/Adventure or Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts is a must-buy!My Rating-9.3!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2003"}

It starts off extremely slow with a boat load of boring on screen text. Heck, your 'boss' will remind you about 15x that you should use stealth to complete your mission. Yawn...But when the prologue ends and the meat of the game begins... you are in for a treat.Everything single part of this game is practically flawless. From the graphics, to the weapons, to the enemy design, to the voice acting, and especially the in game cut scenes.Some of the cut scenes are so friggin entertaining that its scary. They are so good that they made a special dvd that compilies every cut scene into a feature length film!Plus, with this special 'Subsistence' edition you will get a whole lot more than the original game. You will get two super old school Metal Gear games for the MSX console which are over 15 years old, bonus 'blopper' movies which are a joy, a light hearted monkey catching game, and more. Getting all of this bonus content for 'free' is beyond awesome.If youre looking for an action packed, mature, brilliantly executed game than look no further. This game is all you need for pure gaming pleasure.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2006"}

This game is great for people who have played the game originally as well as for new players.PROS:- First off, the graphics are amazing. I have played the original ocarina of time through the Wii virtual console about a year ago for the first time, because being only 16, I never got to experience it when it first came out. I loved the game, but growing up in a world of wonderful graphics, the N64 graphics are hard to get used to. The 3D version looks ten times better, with improved textures and more details. For example, instead of the grass just being a blurb of green, there are actually many flowers and weeds and little things that make a big difference.- The 3D makes some of the best moments even better! I'm not a big fan of the 3D on the 3DS because it bothers my eyes, but for this game, it's worth it :) Especially the iconic moment when link takes the master sword out and goes to the future.- There is a LOT of game play. When you finish the game (which is already pretty long) you unlock the master quest, which is a harder, mirrored version of the game. This doubles the gaming experience!One thing I noticed is that there are some things that were added to help new players who have never played Ocarina of Time (or any zelda) before. Whether or not you think they are pros or cons is up to you:- There are two glowing sheikah stones in the game (one in links house and the other in the temple of time) that give you video hints on what to do if you are lost. I think using them make the game too easy, because they basically tell you everything you need to do. Luckily, you do not have to use them.- Navi randomly throughout the game says things like \"are you getting tired? You can save the game and resume later if you want\" (not word for word, but something like that) when you play for more then an hour at a time. It's kind of annoying, not really a big deal though. Also, she says things like \"do you need help? these sheikah stones can tell you what to do\" (not word for word like that).- When you are doing side quests (like obtaining the big goron sword), instead of leaving you to guess what you need to do or where you need to go next, the locations are marked on the map. I liked this, because there were somethings (like getting the blue cuckoo) that i had no clue what to do with in the original game.CONS:- Nothing really :/Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone. The game did not loose it's original charm through the improvements.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2011"}

For the first time, drivers explore new competitive kart possibilities, such as soaring through the skies or plunging to the depths of the sea. New courses, strategic new abilities and customizable karts bring the racing excitement to new heights.","reviewerName":"HeavyMetalSushi","summary":"Fun Factor High!","reviewText":"I bought this game first thing upon release.  I have played maybe only about an hour before writing this review, before having to go to work, but that was enough time to be able to determine that it's pretty fun.  Any Mario Kart fan would probably have a great time with this game.  My wife was sad to learn that Birdo would not be returning as a playable character, because that was her favorite character to play in 1 or 2 of the past Mario Kart games, but she likes Koopa Troopa and Yoshi and whatnot, and there are some fun unlockable characters.  As I understand it from a review in front of mine, you have to beat a cup on 150cc in order to unlock a bonus character, which sucks because I'm really only a casual, mediocre player at best really, but always something I can work on if I really want the unlockables.  Other than that, the controls are pretty tight and the gameplay is really fun, and I like the addition of customizable vehicles and battle mode.  Different tires, for example, will work better in different ways on different maps...will have to play the maps in order to find out which wheels will work best on which courses.  On Battle Mode, you can customize weapons, whether you want shells only or you want just certain weapons cut out, and vehicle customization applies to it as well.  You can also customize whose on your team if you want to do teams.  As with any Mario Kart, this one will prove to also be fun to play with friends, whether via system link or over internet.  I have one friend already as I write this who has bought a copy, and some others who will probably eventually buy it as well.  We all look forward to playing together on it.  The tracks are new and inventive, and I like the addition of being able to drive under water and soar through the air in certain parts.  Supposedly you can use gyro controls when flying, but I haven't gone in to see about activating that feature yet.  I can imagine that will be pretty cool though.  All in all, if you're a Mario Kart fan or just a fan of racing games in general and you own a 3DS, definitely pick this title up!  'Nough said!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait. You can't buy a much better game.--John CockingPros:A story to beat all storiesCharacters worth caring aboutHey--it's from SquareSoftStunning animationsCons:Too many random battlesCombat is, as always, turn-based and offers minimal excitementWeak souls might give up after two or three discs of play","reviewerName":"Michael J. Covino","summary":"Even After All These Years...","reviewText":"Final Fantasy VII might be a good game, but I never could finish it. Part VIII, on the other hand, I have played time and time again throughout the years. It's one of those games that I know I'll always come back to, and I'm going to tell you why.Never before have I seen so many memorable characters in a single game. Not just the main characters, but even the characters you meet throughout your quest you will always remember. Then of course there are the main characters: rambunctious Zell, lady man Irvine, bossy Quistis, and the energetic Selphie. They all play a vital role in the lives and story that unfolds with Squall Leonheart, who, for reasons unknown, is at first a stolid, unfriendly young man who sees dependency on others and self expression as weaknesses. This philosophy is probably what made him such a great warrior, but when he is thrown into a leadership role he is forced to interact with others. His comrades, with a lot of continuous effort, work to bring him out of his shell, but no one does this better than Rinoa Heartilly. Distant as always, Squall gives her the cold shoulder throughout most of the game, but despite that, she keeps trying to win his heart. Even the others do some pretty crazy things to get them together. Some people don't understand why he suddenly changes from a battle hardened warrior to a loving, caring man, but to me it makes perfect sense when you come to know his past and why he chose to live a sheltered life for so many years. I'm trying not to give away much here, but you're not going to see characters as complex as these in many video games.Finally Fantasy VIII is a story within a story. At the same time Squall is going on this journey of self discovery, he and his army is at war with a Sorceress that plans to wipe out the human race. Simple right? Wrong. There are so many insane twists in this game it's bound to drive you nuts. Just when you think you got it, you realize you don't. But one thing for sure is that IT IS a good vs. evil EPIC and you will love the many places you visit and the people you meet on your journeys across land, space and time.Some people hate the leveling system in this game, but once you understand it, it's really fun to aim for perfect stats. Basically, you are required to hunt down these beasts across the world map that become Guardian Forces once you've defeated them in battle. Sure, you can summon them in battles, but I never do that. I concentrate more on the junction options they give to your characters: Health, Physical Strength, Vitality, Magic and Endurance against Magic. Maxing these stats out to 255 each is real fun and challenging. Combine this with hunting down extremely rare items during your travels so you can refine them into powerful weapons and command abilities, and you're going to have your hands full for a couple of months. Thankfully, for some people, you do not need to do any of this to play and beat the game, but to me, it's another reason why I like this game.Graphics was revolutionary in its day, and I think everyone, regardless if they enjoyed Final fantasy VIII or not, can agree that the game has a great soundtrack.Did I mention anything about all the side quests in this game? At the beginning you are fairly limited with how much of the map you can explore, but once you become more mobile, you can walk away from your main objectives and discover new places that provide you with additional quests. This is how you will get the bulk of your Guardian Forces and some other life-saving items. My favorite places were the Deep Sea Research Center, the Centra Ruins in the wasteland of the Centra Continent, and the Shumi Village in the north.I've played Final Fantasy VII and IX, but I feel the characters are more believable in this one, the drama is more serious, the leveling system is rewarding and Final Fantasy VIII has some of the most imaginative environments I've seen in any video game. In fact, I feel this is the most imaginative game I've ever played (Shadow of the Colossus comes close). At times when playing Final Fantasy VIII I felt I was watching a real good Science Fiction instead of a fantasy. A lot of cool ideas were used in making this game.So what more can you ask for? Good story, memorable characters, fun leveling system and unique, creative environments. I will always come back to play Final Fantasy VIII, and if you haven't done so already, you are missing out on an unforgettable gaming experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00008H2IS","description":"The most highly-anticipated fighting game has arrived with 200 different weapons in an all-new mission&#151;complete Weapon Master mode.","reviewerName":"Matthew Ivester \"Power User\"","summary":"Welcome to the new stage of history!","reviewText":"There isn't a whole lot I can say about Soul Calibur II that hasn't been said by everybody else already.  It makes relatively small changes to the gameplay of Soul Calibur, which is fine by me -- SC is still the gold standard of arcade fighting games, as far as I'm concerned.The graphics (especially the 3D backgrounds) have been kicked up a notch.  The gameplay is faster and a bit more streamlined (Guard Impact moves have been simplified, and it's now more apparent when moves have special properties like Guard Break or Auto-Counter).  Many characters received changes to their move lists (some larger than others, but mostly for the better).  There are also two entirely new characters: Raphael, a fencing noblemen, and Talim, a Filipina fighter who uses bladed tonfas.The home version brings back everyone from Soul Calibur: Sophitia, Seung Mina, Lizardman, Rock (now named &quot;Berzerker&quot;), and Hwang (now called &quot;Assassin&quot;) all make their return.  The last three have to be unlocked in the &quot;extra&quot; Weapon Master missions, which can be accessed once you beat all the standard ones.  Also, fan favorite Cervantes (from Soul Edge, the game before Soul Calibur 1) is back.  The Gamecube version also features Link (from The Legend Of Zelda), although some people have derided the &quot;bonus&quot; console characters as a marketing gimmick (the more the merrier, I say).  This brings the total, I think, to 23, which is a *lot* by any measure.Speaking of the Weapon Master mode, it returns from the Dreamcast version of Soul Calibur 1.  In this mode, you progress through a number of increasingly challenging &quot;missions&quot; (basically, fights against the computer where you are often handicapped in some way, or where you fight more than 1 battle in a row).  A new addition are &quot;dungeon&quot; missions, where you navigate your way around an overhead map, fighting enemies in each &quot;room&quot;.  Playing these missions lets you unlock the hidden characters and 10(!) weapons available for each one, as well as several artwork galleries, extra costumes for most characters, and the game's alternate modes (such as Time Attack, and the demo modes).  It's also fairly entertaining, and there's even a cheesy storyline that goes along with it.The GCN version supports Dolby Pro Logic II surround sound (the desert level with the lightning storm going on in the background is very cool), and 480p progressive scan (in both 4:3 and widescreen 16:9 modes).  I don't have an HD television, but I hear it looks fantastic.I have run into the occasional bit of graphical slowdown, mostly when the game tries to throw in tons of flashy lighting effects on the larger levels.  This is apparently a problem in all the console versions of SC2, but I must emphasize that it's very minor.It's likely that Namco has made more gameplay tweaks to the US release (the Japanese version has been out for some time now, and improved on some of the arcade version's problems), but it will take a little while to figure out what they've done.  Nothing has leapt out at me, but I also haven't had it very long.The biggest complaint you could really register about the game is that it's more evolutionary than revolutionary, and that the Dreamcast version of SC1 a few years ago looked almost as good and ran smooth as silk.  But as others have pointed out, this is more of a testament to the amazing Dreamcast hardware than a fault of the next-gen systems.Soul Calibur II is certainly the premier fighting game on the GCN right now, and I recommend it for anyone who likes the genre.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2003"}

Aside from the occasional draw distance issues it looks simply amazing.The gameplay is also very solid, and from the beginning you are able to move around the city fairly quickly and easily. The powers you collect are varied and fun, but they do seem to be missing something that electricity had (perhaps it is just nostalgia). My two biggest complaints of the game are the length (I got the platinum trophy in under 14 hours of gameplay), and that many of the missions simply involve you chasing somebody around the city.I didn't find the story particularly compelling. I didn't really care for Delsin or his brother, and the overall story was just somewhat boring. It was still good enough to warrant a second playthrough immediately, but it wasn't groundbreaking. I found Cole (from the previous games) to be a much cooler main character.All in all, this is probably the best game currently available for the PS4.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2014"}

Link \"wildfirelink\"","summary":"A mandatory addition for any SNES library","reviewText":"Super Mario All-Stars(1994). A revamped collection of the first three Super Mario NES games, plus a Mario game that was never released in the U.S. until now.Just this past summer, I finally bought a SNES and started collecting all sorts of games for it. I guess you could say that I was more of a Sega Genesis gamer back in the 16-bit era, but since then I've seen that both systems bear their own strengths and redeeming qualities. One of the games that should be bought first for the SNES is Super Mario All-Stars, a greatest hits collection of the NES Mario games with revamped graphics and sound. How does it fare? Let's see:POSITIVES:-Like I said before, there are 4 games with around 100+ levels combined which makes this game a bargain of a deal. That's a lot of play time for anyone who wants it.-Now you have the ability to save each game at each world. To those who normally have a hard time with Mario games, this feature helps gamers get accomodated with each of the different games.-The graphics have been revamped to look spectacular. Now there are scrolling backgrounds and all the characters and enemies look better than ever.-Even with the revamped look, every aspect of each game remains intact, from the levels to the placement of coins and enemies. The difficulty is also the same.-Lost Levels (originally the Japanese SMB2) is a welcome addition, and proves to be a great harder extention of the original SMB game.NEGATIVES:-Although the graphics upgrade is nice, the new sound and music here are plain bad. The SNES has much better examples of great music quality, and the music here just sounds bland. Not downright horrible, but compared to the NES original music, it's quite a letdown. As A. Paul Melin stated, the sound effects are also quite dumbed down.-By including the save system, some of the challenge factor is lost in the games.-I agree, I would have rather had the NES originals compiled here as opposed to the newer versions. There were some unneccesary additions to some of the games, such as the background \"Bonus\" icon in the underground parts of the first game.-As it was stated elsewhere, if you already own and beaten each of the first three Mario NES games, there is very little else new that you will find other than the Lost Levels game.THE BOTTOM LINE:If you've never played the first three Mario games and you only have a SNES, make every effort to hunt down this great collection. It's got a few flaws, but otherwise it works well. They offer plenty of playtime to the average gamer, and it makes for an excellent addition to any SNES library.

{"product_name":"B003Q53VZC","description":"","reviewerName":"Night Lord 40K","summary":"wayyyyyy under rated game.","reviewText":"Please Dont listen to all of these negative reviews because this was a fantastic game. This is not Call of Duty , Halo , Gears of war or any other big name title you have played. This is Homefront developed by THQ. Since this is none of the other titles I have mentioned above take this game for what it is and enjoy it. Game developers each have their own style when it comes to making a game and all are different in their own way. If everything were like Call of Duty , or Halo wouldnt games get kind of boaring after a while.___ Graphics. - The graphics are not horrible or bad as alot of these reviews say , they are just different . If this game was made By the developers of Call of duty or Halo I would expect the graphics to look like or better than the latest call of duty , or halo , but as I said above this game was made by THQ and this is their style of graphics and there is absolutely nothing wrong with them___ Sound.- The sound is great. the explosions are pumped up to sound as real as possible in a game. If you have a surround sound system at home you will absolutely love this. the guns , tanks , etc. also meet my expectations.___ Gameplay.- The game is fast paced and fun. People have been making false statements about the lenght of this game. There is no way you can finish this game in under three hours or under four hours. I played this game on normal and beat the game in a little over five hours so it is a little short , but the game was fun all of the way through. I wont tell you how it ends but you will deffinately know by the way it ends that there will be a sequal to this game . who knows there might be a trillogy or more. I hope so. I started the game again on it's hardest level which is guerrilla and I know for sure no one will be finishing this game quickly on this setting. I am having just as much fun on the second play through as the first and will play through it again after this to aquire all of the achievments. So If you want this game to last you longer play it on a higher setting because normal on this game felt like an easy setting to me.___ Multiplayer.- The multiplayer in this game is just awesome. You have the tanks , helecopters , drones and unlimited sprint like in battlefield bad company 1 and 2. Your controls are Identical to call of duty and can also go prone in this game. the drones , and missles in this game are controled by remote like the RC car in Call of Duty Black Ops. All you have to do is find a place to hide and press up on the D-pad and you will deploy your drones or missles. you will be in third person control of your drones and missles until it is destroyed by an enemy or you are killed in your hiding spot. You can also spawn in tanks , helecopters , Hummers, and any other mobile vehicle they have to offer when you have earned enough points in a match. Also the controls in the campaighn and multiplayer are smooth and percise ,and if you are used to playing Call of Duty there will be no learning curve.___Multiplayer Maps.- ALL OF THE MAPS ARE HUGE. the maps have to be this way because of the type of warfare that goes on in these matches. 32 people on a map at a time is awesome. If you tried to put that many players on a call of duty map you would be killed as soon as you spawn so this is why we have large maps in this game. not to mention could you imagine how it would be to have tanks , helecopters , drones and everything else this game has to offer on one of the small Call of Duty maps. Two map packs have now been released for this game and only cost 250 microsoft points for the first and 400 for the second , not to bad if you ask me.I didnt go over all the specifics of this game because they are to numerous and would take alot more time but, I hope this will help you make your decision on buying the game. If you are still not sure about it go buy a used copy from Gamestop and if you dont like it then you can return it within 7 days of your purchase date. So no loss if you decide to take it back. I think if you give this game a fair chance you will see this game in the same light as I. Have fun and happy gamming","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2011"}

I got the 'Speed Demon' achievement on the first (and only) run through.  The combat system, on the other hand, is easily the low point of the game.  It is not intuitive, restrictive in design, and not very much fun (especially for a Ninja Gaiden 2 fanatic like myself).  I basically learned a couple combos and just kept using them.  I was never able to do a long combo set, and honestly didn't even care to.  The game looks great though with gorgeous environments and the voice acting is top notch.

With such great franchises as Resident Evil, Street Fighter and Mega Man it is no secret that Capcom has given us some memorable titles to enjoy for years to come. Now they are at it again with their newest offering called Remember Me but is this a game that you are going to want to play or should you just forget about it?Remember Me takes place in the future in Neo Paris in the year 2084 where the Memorize corporation has developed a new piece of technology. The sensen engine is a device that allows you to upload your memories online and alter them as well but some say that this will allow them to view anyones memories at anytime. You play as Nilin Cartier-Wells as you were against the actions of this corporation as a Errorist and was about to get your mind completely wiped. At the last second you are rescued by a strange man known only as Edge and you set out to reclaim the memories that were stolen from you.At it's core this game is an action game where you fight enemies by stringing combos together and navigate platforms and ledges trying to get to the next section. But where this game deviates from the rest of the pack is that you have the ability to steal and manipulate other people's memories! If you need to find out a keycode to open a door that will let you progress in the game you can simply take it from one of the guards memories. Another unique feature is called the Combo Lab where you can string together your own combos. And not just stringing together attacks as you can pick which attacks you want (either doing more damage or having some of your blows actually healing you as you fight).This is one of those games that you hope Capcom makes a sequel to because I feel that this first game just scratched the surface. Remember Me is enjoyable but I felt that more could have been done with this whole universe as well as the remixing of peoples memories. If you love near future and cyberpunk type games this is one that you definitely need to check out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2013"}

Note that I didn't say \"first-person shooters;\" despite the fact that there is limited gunplay involved within the game, it is indeed possible (and rewarded) to avoid it altogether (and it makes the game that much more interesting in doing so)...and this is *exactly* what is so revolutionary here. The entire first-person game market is absolutely saturated with clones of truly great first-person shooters (Call of Duty 4 and Far Cry 2, e.g.)...but where has the innovation been? Didn't anyone ever think that there was more potential in the current generation to first-person gaming than simply mindlessly running and gunning? Apparently, DICE recognized this potential, and what they've done here is not only *revolutionary* for first-person gaming, but \"platformer\" gaming to boot (a genre generally written off these days).Most unfortunately for mature gamers seeking innovation, style, and charm, first-person games that don't focus on gunplay and gruesome violence don't have a prayer sales-wise on any platform outside of Wii (which simply wouldn't be able to pull off the fresh style of this game successfully), and as the weak numbers came in, this game was deemed a \"flop\" by those who deem themselves worthy of applying such labels. Ultimately, this game slipped under the radar, and seemingly disappeared in the crowd of bloodier, angrier first-person games clearly aimed at the ten-to-twenty age group (despite the \"M\" ratings that do nothing to deter (but everything to highlight) the violence (and its degree) that they'll be salivating over (especially since every chain but the biggest sells these games to kids without a second of hesitation)). In my opinion, this game \"failed\" (to sell three million as estimated) because expecting a \"T\"-rated game to sell well, period (again, excluding Wii), is a bit of a stretch of the imagination in this day-and-age (most inevitably). More significant, however (e.g. \"Dead Space;\" insanely gory, yet still \"failed\"), is the \"problem\" that one can't go online and attack another in one manner or another (most certainly a deal-breaking issue for a good portion of potential purchasers (the kids mentioned above, predominantly)). While I offer my condolences, DICE, this is a genuinely awe-inspiring game, and regardless of how well the game ultimately sells (a sequel and continuously lower prices should eventually push \"Mirror's Edge\" over two million), this is exactly what we, the mature gamers of the world, are looking for; we are growing in number, and we are willing (and able) to pay full price for games that are genuinely worth our money.Anyway, back to the game; my first experience with it was, probably like most, seeing the mediocre reviews (namely IGN's) pile up and wondering what the game really entailed. \"Parkour?\" \"Weird...and lame.\" I'd imagine that I wasn't alone with this initial sense of disinterest in the title, and frankly, it wasn't a title I was even interested in renting. Fortunately, one day I decided to finally upgrade my 360 by connecting to XBOX Live for the first time (I'd wanted an upgrade to the new firmware), and the first thing I decided to do was see what demos were available...and there it was. As demos are free, I decided to dedicate a GB of my 250 GB monthly download maximum to \"Mirror's Edge\"...and by no means did I expect to find what I did. I was nothing less than instantly enthralled with this title; from the striking artistic style (backed up by the very smoothly-running engine) to the brilliant soundtrack (really, the music couldn't have asserted the game's style any better, and it's worth a purchase in its own right) to the incredible sense of vertigo when jumping across rooftops a thousand feet in the sky, I fell in love with the game at first glance. Upon completing this demo (it's short, despite its file size), I immediately went and ordered a copy of the title on my own, and patiently awaited its receipt in the mail. A week later, I found myself spending an entire weekend playing this game (by the way, ignore what you've heard about the game's length; when you're learning the levels for the first time, it's as long as or longer than most titles on the market (especially if you take the time to find the best path (not always the one highlighted in red))), and I absolutely loved every second of it. It's been some time since I found myself hopelessly addicted to a game (probably since Far Cry 2, a game that despite being based on violent gunplay, makes tremendous use of its stunning backdrop and is highly memorable and fun to play as a result), but I simply could not stop playing \"Mirror's Edge\" until it was over...and immediately started a new journey after its completion.You've probably been reading about the game's inadequacies with its controls, and how \"frustrating\" it can be to find the \"right\" path, but folks, platforming is platforming...and that's what it's all about. Granted, you might be pulling your hair out by the scaffolding section in stage eight (the red paths are few and far between; the gradual decline in pace beginning in stage seven is perhaps the game's only real flaw), but solving the puzzles and finding the path are quite rewarding, as it can literally take twenty or more attempts (deaths, rather) to find your way. However, you'll often (usually) find that when you've struggled and had to replay a section twenty times, your impatience and/or inability to successfully complete wall jumps correctly were to blame. Take it from me; you *must* *master* every jump in this game (especially L-jumps off walls) *before* beginning the journey. I failed to do this, and spent a great deal of time dying as a result. Upon replaying the game, I was amazed at the simplicity of these once seemingly impossible moves, and being able to do them right the first time, every time, made the game that much more fun and flow that much smoother. That said, \"Mirror's Edge\" is far from the most difficult game I've ever played, and it's not too challenging to turn away casual gamers, so it's hard to criticize the game even on this level. With practice and *proper* training (again, master every move *before* leaving the training stage, or I promise you that you'll be regretting it (especially by stage seven)), this game can, and will, flow beautifully, but it's up to *you* to make it happen; don't fail to put in the time to learn what's required, then rant about how \"frustrating\" and miserable it all is...you're to blame, not the game.In conclusion, if you're not playing \"Mirror's Edge,\" you're either content joining the masses with their mindlessly sadistic first-person shooters, or you're simply unaware that this game exists and are depriving yourself of a truly original, intense, exciting, and thoroughly exceptional gaming experience. Considering that EA has dropped the retail price to [...](like \"Dead Space,\" they obviously realize that if they can simply get the game into more hands, the sequel has great potential for financial success), unless you only play online games, and/or refuse to play anything without excessive blood and gore (again, aimed at those ten-year-olds I mentioned above), you have no excuse to pass this one up. At the very least, download the demo and give the game a chance...DICE deserves that much for *finally* doing something innovative and giving us something new, and personally, nothing would disgust me more than to see the sequels scrapped due to disinterest (or unawareness) of this terrific product. Make no mistake; despite receiving only a 79% score (various sites supply the same review summation), this it not only a \"triple-A\" game, but one of the best games currently available, period. Ignore what you thought you knew about it, and reviews that I feel completely missed the point of the game (style, innovation, and above all, *fun*), and simply give it a chance...you deserve it (and again, so does DICE)!p.s. feed Scruffy! Hahaha...if you've played the game, you'll know what I'm talking about. Funniest thing ever in a video game, hands down.Edit: 7/8/09  I've been playing this game for about six weeks now, and I still can't put it aside.  I can't tell you how many times I've played through the entire story (I don't care too much about the speed runs or time trials), but it's well over ten, and I just can't bring myself to play anything else.  When will I tire of this game, I wonder; perhaps not until \"Modern Warfare 2,\" or maybe even \"Mirror's Edge 2\" (it's thankfully been confirmed).  While it might not be technically perfect, the simple fact of the matter is that what is good in this game is *so* good that it quite easily overshadows the negatives (basically, it's a \"12\" brought down to a \"9.5,\" for me, due mainly to the forced combat that everyone hates (though you will learn to properly time those disarms, in time) and the drop in energy level (and increase in frustration) in chapters seven and eight)).  This is what I believe most critics have failed to properly recognize; they've rated it mostly in terms of mechanics...as a \"game,\" starting from the same 1-10 scale that they place \"Gears of War\" and \"Halo 3\" in the nines on..\"Mirror's Edge\" is not a game.  It is a truly transcendent, stunningly beautiful, mind-altering *experience*...and this is what separates it from just about every other \"video game\" out there.  It is simply light-years beyond everything else on the market in terms of fun, re-playability, ingenuity, and most importantly, impact, and it is *the* benchmark, at least for me, for games to meet from its creation forth.  I'm quite anxious for the \"game\" that will overpower my absolute obsession with, and love for, \"Mirror's Edge.\"  Quite frankly, it might never happen...and it looks like it's time to start listing some (most) of my titles for sale, because I doubt that I can go back to the level of \"gaming\" that once seemed so impressive...and now so lackluster in comparison.  This game was never given a fair chance by critics, as it was so over-hyped and boasted about by DICE (unrealistic, arrogantly high sales estimates, etc.) that everyone was simply salivating at the chance to tear it apart.  See through the \"reviews\"...and take it from someone who's played them all; find yourself a copy of \"Mirror's Edge,\" and don't look back into the sea of mediocrity that is comprised of those 9.5-rated, play-through-once-and-forget titles that the 360's image is based on...you deserve better than that.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2009"}

I especially loved the Ezio franchise due to the story, the awesome gameplay, and the fact that Ezio himself was such a bada$$. I beat all of the Ezio games within a week because I was so eager to finish the story.Then, AC3 came out. I was very excited to continue the story. However, I was disappointed and here is why:-Connor is boring. I'm sorry to put it so bluntly, but it is the truth. He bores me. There is nothing exciting about him at all. When it came to Ezio, he at least made me feel like a true Assassin. With Connor, however, I just don't get that same feeling because his character is so dull.-There is too much running around! I swear, I can't tell you how many times I had to literally run, and run, and run some more to get from point A to point B. You are slowed down by so many things too, such as a mountain range. I will be running in a straight line, but then bam there is a mountain in my way and I have to figure out a way around it.-Too many cut scenes. I enjoy cut scenes, but not when they are as excessive as this game is. I feel like I'm watching a movie with the amount of heavy cut scenes they added to this game.-The story is on the dull side. I get bored to the point where I stop paying attention anymore.-I feel as though all I do is fight those guards at times. It's fun at first, but it loses it's appeal quickly. You can only fight so many guards before it gets repetative and therefore boring. The older games, such as AC2, were not anywhere near this bad when it came to the guards. The guards chased you down in the older games, but it was not as excessive as AC3 is.-Most importantly, this is the FIRST AC game that I put down and have yet to finish. I do plan to finish it one of these days for the sake of the story line, but the game is just such a big disappointment that I can't pick up the controller just yet. In time I will, but I need a break from this terrible game.It saddens me to leave a bad review. I gave it 3 stars only because it is an AC game and it is fun to a very small extent. I do like to know what happens in the story too. Other than that though, it's just not a super fun game like the others before it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2013"}

Yet, this game is so well done, I rate it five stars- and this coming from a gamer who is fairly biased against its subject matter. Why? Because of the following:The beauty of Telltale's episodic game is in its powerful narrative, its compelling use of emotion, and its unique (by modern standards) gameplay. In terms of the gameplay, it largely reminds me of the wonderful \"point and click\" adventures that I played on my computer as a child, where story was paramount. However, Telltale has refined the formula so that this \"point and click\" style works well even with console controllers, and there is a wonderful level of tension created at times, when you must quickly perform an action or choose how to respond to another character's inquiry.The visual approach works wonders, creating a unique, comic book style that can quickly turn from colorful to frightening. Atmosphere is huge in this game, and the world is engrossing and it becomes \"realistic\" as you're drawn into the story and the perils that the characters face.The story can at times have ludicrous elements (this is my lone criticism), such as when adults don't know how batteries work (or that portable radios run on them). But this is a minor gripe, and it is vastly overshadowed by a tremendous narrative that is coupled with moving music and some of the very best voice acting I've ever heard in a game. Rarely have I ever felt more connected to a character than the lovable Clementine, who even the coldest of gamers will grow affectionate of.Combine this with many branches in storytelling that are available as a direct result of your decisions (oftentimes made under extreme duress with limited time), and episodes of perfect length (about two hours a piece for me), and \"The Walking Dead\" is a true winner- and a revival of the old PC adventure genre!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2012"}

{"product_name":"B002BS47YE","description":"","reviewerName":"the gamer","summary":"Crysis 1 for the single player Crysis 2 for the Multiplayer (until the hackers show up)","reviewText":"So I pre-ordered this cause I really liked the first game. Playing as a guy in a suit who can go invisible, increase strength (such as jump, and throw), and speed was a lot of fun. Also the plot of the first game even though it was lacking was still entertaining. I expected this one to be great. Then they decided to dumb down the PC version so they could also have it on PS3 and x-box 360 and that kinda ruined it in my opinion. The plot is more fleshed out in this one and kinda interesting but kinda lacking in some spots.Unfortunately they completely forget about Nomad and Pysco. Only showing Prophet briefly at the beginning. You end up playing as the silent protagonist who they actually gave a name (Alcatraz). You then go through New York on a set path which you cannot div-ate from or at least look around very far unlike the first game. Then near the half way point you get to enjoy fighting some aliens that are different from the first game and talk to the suits creator and eventually meet him (kinda). The fighting is kinda fun but its not as great as the first game cause your stuck in these small areas and such.The part I liked in the first game was HUGE open areas where you could go multiple ways to get to your destination and fighting smart AI with whatever buildings and parts were quite destructible. In this one you can barely make a dent in anything even after they sent out an update to help make it more realistic.Also the weapons aren't much to write home about. They seem to be the same 1-2 weapons just a slight difference. And later on near the end levels when you finally get different ones you barely get to use them or they aren't that great. (ie the microwave gun?)Also slight SPOILERS below for the plot on something I really found to be dumbfounded.------------------------So when Heartgrieve tries to get your suit because he needs it instead of giving a few soldiers some of the nano suits he has laying around all over his office/home or training some for a while after Prophet leaves. He instead sends ORDINARY solders against you? I thought he was saying &#34;this isn't a war ordinary soldiers can win&#34; As well as even though the new solders with the nano suits (even older models) wont be as experienced with them or have the upgrades that Prophet and Alcatraz get when playing with the alien's toys they would still do better then regular soldiers I would think. Being able to go invisible, being stronger, faster, and having a tactical mode to help them in some spots would help them a lot more then just going out with some army experience and a gun. Heck even the first game had a few Korean knock off nano suits and when that part in the game came up I was actually kinda freaked out seeing something moving and being invisible and then realizing there are some nano suit Koreans with sub machine guns waiting for me was actually quite awesome. Yet in this game there is not ONE! other nano suit guy trying to fight me. How stupid can the game creators be and the people who made the plot. Maybe it was just they wanted Heartgrieve to look like an idiot when trying to capture you&#34;hmm lets see.. I need that specific suit.. I have plenty of old version nano suits all over my office/home maybe I should have one or two of my army guys get in one and fight Alcatraz with it and maybe then I can subdue him and get the suit.. nah ill go against what I told Prophet and use ordinary soldiers to take him down.&#34;That was something I found really annoying and stupid. Also something similar on that note the aliens are trying to also take down Alcatraz as well it seemed like once you finally meet them. Yet not until the last part of the last mission do you fight any that can go invisible as well as being strong etc. They even hinted at it during the game at 1-2 spots where you see the invisible alien go visible and run away but never fight you. That was pretty stupid to. They should have had them throughout the game after you meet the aliens but no they decided lets have an epic final battle at the end and use them. Even though it wasn't much of an epic battle. :S------------------------End of minor SPOILERSSo anyways this game kinda let me down in quite a few ways but I haven't even gotten to the multiplayer. Now that was one part that when I started playing before the game came out turned out to be great. The first games multiplayer kinda stunk and was difficult to get to work. This one though was lots of fun. However, a problem arose where someone leaked the game online and then all of a sudden everyone could play it free if they got it illegally. Well before the game came out I got beta access to multiplayer and you had two choices: Use a gamespy account (also linked with IGN.com account) or get a mycrysis.com account. I choose gamespy since I already had an account there anyways and I didn't want to sign up for another thing. Well after the fiasco of the game getting leaked the full game came out and to combat it they made people get a mycrysis.com account.So I made a new account at mycrisis.com unfortunately since I used a gamespy account I couldn't use the same ingame name or something. But then the gamespy account info worked again and because I pre-ordered my game I had a few in game things for multiplayer. I also had lots of points on one account over the other. When trying to get rid of one account I came across another problem. Both accounts were tied to the same e-mail. So if I changed the password of one it changed the other as well. I could not get on and use one account while the other I could. Mycrysis.com wouldn't allow anyone to change their e-mail associated with their account (at least not the people who pre-ordered or bought the game right away. The ones who waited and got accounts could. So I got stuck in a huge mess without any way of changing e-mails for the accounts. In this day and age its amazing that a company wouldn't let you do something so simple. I got tired of trying to transfer over the items I got with my pre-order and losing all my points I had gotten.Around the same time as well was a massive influx of hackers and cheater on multiplayer. Eventually it seemed every session you played there was at least one. They kept trying to combat this with no avail it seemed and just caused more problems for the people who bought the game and were playing it fairly. I even got slack from regular players when some sessions I would use a grenade launcher which was one of the guns that are actually in the game. They got all whiny because it was &#34;to over powered&#34; its not my fault, that's one of the guns in the game. If your gonna whine and such do it to the people who choose to have that gun in the game. Even got threatened to be kicked/banned from some servers for trying to use guns when there was no warning of not to. There is also the problem with some players who spend every waking minute on there unlocking all the good weapons/etc and then having an advantage against players who just start out. Again it was fun at first but then became bad cause of the hackers and such.To shorten all that up:Pros-1. New story with a better plot2. The parts with Heartgrieve were entertaining and fun. Kinda wanted more of a back story or something.3. Multiplayer was fun at first (before the hackers/cheaters)Cons-1. Linear single player2. No challenging single player fights (ie from the spoilers section)3. Multiplayer (from the hackers/cheaters/whiners)4. No support with account problems from mycrysis.com such as being able to change e-mail's (which no longer exsists apparently was shut down)This game could have been a lot better but unfortunately I guess they were under pressure to make it so it could come out on PS3 and 360 which dumbed down the PC version. Also the leak of the game before launch really hurt the multiplayer with hackers/cheaters. Also the story wasn't as good as it could have been in some plot points but since the company is more interested in making really cool looking realistic demos then games I can understand why.Well that's it from me hope my review helped sorry if it was a bit to long.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2014"}

I assumed that since the movie was great, and the book was great, and the soundtrack was great that the game would be as well... The good news is that the game is very fun, the bad news is that its very short, and a mockery of great graphics. Anyone boasting about how good this game looks, I'm sorry, must be blind. Although there are many digitized scenes from the movie included in this game there are some pretty terrible CGI FMV sequences that wouldn't have even looked good on the original Playstation, maybe for the Sega CD... The in game graphics are low polygon, and poorly textured... darn Resident Evil, you raised the bar so high!Playstation fans have been boasting for months about how great this game is. Now I'm reminded why I don't use my PS2 very often.The GameCube version supposedly features a hidden level and character not found in the XBox and PS2 versions. Please note that I do not know if this is true or not, but the back of the GCN version does state \"Exclusive hidden level and character to unlock.\" I can confirm that it has the fastest load times of the three, but if its graphics you want don't worry, all three versions look pretty bad.The thing is that Lord of the Rings could make an excellent video game or series. The problem is that nobody has done it right. The game should be an RPG, either turn based, or action based. The game should include every intricate detail from the books and the movies, and should go where no game has dared to go.I think the problem is that EA was afraid of surpassing the movie in the presentation front, something they should not have been afraid to do. EA usually does a great job with their movie licenses, but unfortunately, this time the game comes out as average. Unlike the books and the movie this game has little to no artistic value, and presents itself as an attempt to cash in on what has sadly become a huge cash cow. The game is fun, but not what it should have been, so I give it three stars... and I will continue to dream of a day when I can play Lord of the Rings developed by Squaresoft, for either XBox or GameCube because no matter how many people deny it, PS 2 is just technically inferior to both by a long shot.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2003"}
{"product_name":"B000UZVL58","description":"Set after the events of Contra III: Alien Wars, the game follows mercenaries Bill Rizer and Lance Bean as they battle to save the world from a new extraterrestrial threat. Contra 4 takes advantage of the dual screens of the Nintendo DS to deliver larger than life action, with massive enemies, detailed platform gaming and mind-blowing set pieces. Using a variety of upgradable weapons, take the fight to the alien army of the Black Viper and reclaim Earth for Mankind in single-player or 2 player co-op mode.","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"Contra fans, rejoice!","reviewText":"Konami took a huge gamble with this game. Instead of developing the game themselves, it passed off the opportunity to a then unknown third party studio named Wayforward. Then, Contra 4 was released on the Nintendo DS in 2007 just in time for the 20th anniversary of Contra. Believe me when I saw Wayforward did an excellent job of keeping old school Contra alive and modernizing it for today's modern gaming.Contra 4 is all about blasting aliens and that's it. Choose a difficulty level, then pick one out of 4 characters and you're off to take on 9 stages. Beating the game on all difficulty levels  and completing the challenge mode scenario missions, you unlock all kinds of bonus content (gallery, interviews, NES oldies Contra & Super C, etc.)Convince your friend who has a DS to buy this game and the both of you can play together with 2 player support.The PROS: This is classic Contra action with upgraded graphics and music with elements from previous Contra titles mixed in and it works perfectly. Get ready to shoot everything and anything in sight while having fun as well. The controls work fine so you will get into it quickly. Going the extra mile to complete everything in the game really pays off with the bonus content. Unlocking the original NES Contra and NES Super C means you can play them anytime. The gallery and museum really give you an accurate perspective of the entire series with a little background information for each title as well. And of course, there are secret characters as well that you get to unlock too.The CONS: Warning!! Warning!! This game is brutally difficult. It's not just hard, it's numbingly pain inducing frustrate worthy hard. On normal and hard modes, you will curse, scream, get mad and even throw your DS across the room or out the window. The Contra series was known for its no nonsense challenging game play that separates the men from the boys and makes grown men cry. Anyone who grew up to the likes of NES Mega Man, Ghosts N Goblins and Ninja Gaiden games will know exactly what I'm talking about. It's still a great game but be wary of the challenge it brings.Contra 4 is not for everyone. Then again, the Contra series isn't for everyone to begin with. For those who get mad easily or isn't willing to put themselves through a game like this should stay away. However, those of you who haven't played this yet but loves this kind of challenge and withheld from buying a DS, you should take the plunge as it won't be too expensive to buy either one. I did and I recommend you do the same.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2011"}

{"product_name":"B004NRN5EO","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"Mosquito007","summary":"Average Joe Review","reviewText":"This is one of the few games I have logged over 200 plus hours on, and I am not a hardcore player. So here is my take on the game.Basics,This game is sort of like a combination of Zelda and Castlevania Symphony of the Night (Or Metroid for old timers like me). It's a big world, tons of items and armors, unlock doors, level up, go where you please, fight stuff, beat the game, game starts over with even harder hitting enemies.Challenge,The challenge comes from the fact that enemies will basically kill you dead in 1 to 4 hits (CastleVania 1,2, and 3 style) depending on your level and equipment. So the idea is...don't get hit...the shield is your friend.The other factor is that the game does not tell you what to do, so you got to explore or check one of the many online guides out there for tips on where to go.Online,Playing this game online changes everything. There are basically two sides to online:Helping and Invaders.But you have to be at the right level at the right area to get a good online experience. There are a lot of charts online to tell you what level to be at, make sure to check those.PvP is not my thing, but jumping in and helping a group take down a boss is a blast.I have fought through some levels/bosses at least 30-60 times with different groups and each time it could be different depending on the different player's skill and the chance of another player invading.There is no talking between players, just some emotes you can do, but this non-verbal system is good because most of the players I ran with were Japanese (8pm to 1am Alaska Time).The best part is that there is no risk to yourself when helping other people, so if you die you lose nothing. But you keep any souls (XP) you get while helping other people, so all the rewards with none of the risk.Downsides,Unless you have the knack, fighting other players/invaders is an exercise in frustration. Pros will kill you in one hit/backstab, not much fun. But on the other hand PVP is entirely optional, you can only be invaded if certain conditions are in place, and if you watch what you are doing the only thing you lose when you die is the time spent playing.Also there are a few \"choke points\" in the main quest that can be pretty tricky the first time through.But there a several in depth websites that have the data to get you through.Overall,I got this game for my sibling and they hated it, but I couldn't stop playing when I tried it. So it may be dependent of the person. A lot of other people have said this as well, but I think Dark Souls may be the best game in the last 3 years.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2012"}

However, having loved the first three games in the series I decided to give this game a shot.  I am certainly glad I did, because this game brought back the fun and charm of the early versions.The plot has always been the selling point of the Suikoden series, and this version does quite well in that area.  Of course the other big thing is of course trying to recruit all 108 characters that are in the game.  One thing I should mention though is that many characters in this version can be missed if you don't recruit them at the correct point.  So reading a strategy guide on a gaming site like gamefaqs might help you there.  The endings of the game are largely determined by how many of the 108 you find.  Obviously the more you locate the better the ending.Suikoden has never been known for its outstanding graphics, and this game is no exception.  They aren't bad, but they don't measure up to many other games released late in the ps2 cycle.  The music is decent to good, with a few outstanding tracks, and a couple stinkers as well.  The game does start off a bit slow, and the action can be a bit lacking in the first 10 hours or so.  However, once you reach a certain point in the story, the game really takes off and becomes very addicting.  The plot may not be as good as Suikoden 2 in my opinion but it is close.  Hopefully the series will live on.  When it comes to characters and story, not many series out there can rival this one.Graphics: 7/10  Not the best out there, but get the job done.Sound:  7/10  Good music for the most part, and decent voice acting.Story:  9/10  Like much of the series, this version has a very good plot.Replay V. 9/10  Different ending depending on several factors.  Once you have your castle, there are a fair amount of side-quests to participate in as well.Overall  9/10  Much better(and longer) than Suikoden 4.  While the graphics may not match up with many other Rpgs, the plot and addictive nature of the game truly make this game stand out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2010"}

For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience.

It spawned lots of alternate versions, a \"Director's Cut\", and a few sequels, but none quite captured the inspired dread of the original.Until the series moved to the deceptively capable Gamecube.Capcom, masters of franchise-milking, outdid themselves with the new version of Resident Evil (often referred to as the \"REmake\").  It succeeds on two fronts:  it retains almost all the elements that made the PSX original a classic, while adding just enough to keep RE vets on their toes.  Item boxes, typewriters, and scattered ammo will still be found, but new rooms, enemies, and items (the defensive items can drastically change your tactics).  Capcom could just have done a mere port, but they cared enough about their franchise to mutate the beloved mansion to a new and gloriously twisted shape of its former self.The much-maligned static camera angles and initially awkward control scheme are still here, but that's what Resident Evil is - change it too much and it becomes something else.  Besides, prerendered backgrounds have never been portrayed with such beautiful decay.  It's like each camera frame is a painting by Francis Bacon - only populated with disturbingly animated, hideous life.  Moonlight streams sickly through dingy windowpanes.  A swinging chandelier bathes a room in a pattern of dusky light and shadow.  A flickering fire casts a gleam over rotting grey undead flesh.  A slowly crawling mist hugs the ground, sliding around dingy abandoned stonework.  You will not find a more accurate, effective portrayal of decadent horror anywhere in gamedom.  Somewhere, George Romero is grinning ear-to-ear.Many people decry the REmake as \"the same old game I played six years ago\", but why alter such a brilliant formula?  Tyrant and Plant 42 never looked this good.  Producer Shinji Mikami has  ominously quipped \"It now looks too real.\"  Capcom gets major kudos for taking the time and expense to create something special: a remake of a classic that not only caters to new fans, but also pays tribute to veterans.Nothing feels like the original yet new Resident Evil, and nothing ever will - until Capcom redoes it again in 2008!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2002"}

The main feel of the game has hardly changed, which is good, but there are some new optional enhancements that some like me appreciate, while others think there should have been a much bigger change.THE LONG: In some reviews (like EGM), this game was given an apparently lower score than it could have had because it hadn't changed enough or improved enough from the original. The word Halo was then instantly dropped half a dozen times in comparison which isn't fair at all. The bottom line is this: If you liked the original, you'll like this one because it plays the same and is like getting a whole new roster of maps to conquer.The game does add a few new things though- playable \"Hero\" characters as well as Space Battles, and reaction ranged from liking the new options to others thinking they should have been better.Here's the deal: Battlefront 2, just like the original, is still all about you taking control of one of the Rebels, Empire, Clones or CIS (droids) as you spawn and keep respawning until you've either defeated the other army or lose all your own.

The joy of the first game remains: Play as a grunt and fire your blaster rifle down hallways, from behind obstacles, and while storming command posts, or be a sniper and camp or take control of one of the many vehicles and just destroy. It feels and looks almost identical to the original game, but with a dozen new maps, many of them fantastic. You can now also greatly increase or reduce the number of troops per stage, so battles can be about as long or short as you want.New to the game are almost every important 2 legged character from all 6 of the films. You'll find everyone from Anakin to Luke to Grievous to Darth Maul, and the only ones that seem to be missing are (sadly) Qui-Gon Jinn and Lando Calrissian, possibly because they just didn't have 2 more villians to stick in to keep balance.These characters, \"Heros\" as the game calls them, are great fun. I recall asking if you could play as these guys (and gals) in the original game, and was met by angry fanboy complaints of \"It's all about the infantry, these characters would RUIN the game! No Jedis, that would be LAME!\" Yet, as I visit Xbox Live, it seems these are the only characters people ever want to use. Funny.I can't entirely blame them though, these characters are handled quite well. Far from being invincible, they're just stronger, faster, and have the Force with which to do things like throw their Sabers and Force-Choke from afar. And in an expert move, the programmers made you, the player, entirely in control. Set up the options to have the characters in every battle, all the time, set them up to appear only when certain time or scores are reached, or just turn them off altogether. You can go through this game using almost nothing but the Heroes or never using them at all. It's up to you. My only complaint about this addition is that continuity-breaking is NOT up to the player. Every stage has 4 specific Heroes to pick from (2 for each side, 2 for each era) and they're correct to Star Wars history. You won't be able to, say, put Luke against Han Solo on Geonosis for example. As to why that is I don't know, I mean it makes story sense but who cares if I mess up the story all alone in my living room. I want to play how I want, and this lack of complete control over the game is the only thing that bugs me. Still, there's always at least one character per stage that's fun to use. Besides, there's a stage (quite a few stages if you download the Xbox Live bonus content) where you have an all-out war with nothing BUT every Hero character, which is a rumble of fun in itself.Using them is a varied opinion of fans as well. The controls feel a little sloppy when using Heroes- they move faster, jump higher, and have powers that aren't entirely balanced. True to the characters, you'll see Yoda jumping 30 feet in the air and then tearing through five soldiers at once with his green Lightsaber. It's all fun, but some have complained that it's too \"crazy\" to use these characters. I don't think it's too bad, but it does come across as awkward sometimes- it just feels a little less natural when using the Heroes, though I still insist that it's quite fun.The other hanging point is the addition of space battles in this game. I've never really understood why people didn't like it, just that a lot didn't- without really saying why. Don't expect the level of depth of an actual Star Wars space game, of course, but I still think it's handled quite well. Each faction gets the proper choice of ships, which respawn just like you do. It's all about coming out of your hangar, jumping in a ship, and going after the enemy. Chase after their dogfighters or shoot out the life support systems on the major warships, or even land on their deck and try to disable their shield. You have complete freedom of movement, with no restriction of gravity, direction or perspective, and it's a little disorienting at first. Personally I find it fun, but if I had one complaint it'd be that I was led to believe that when you land on an opponent's ship, you could run around deep inside it, like a regular ground level of the game. You can't- each mothership only goes a few small rooms back from the deck, leading to the shield generator, there really isn't anything to explore.SO that's the bulk of the new stuff, but there are two very important changes to the original game still left: the single player campaign and the improved Galaxy Conquest. In the single player, you take control of a Clone general starting early in his career, the battle of Geonosis. Through mission-based objectives, you'll fight through a dozen stages playing the course of the Clone Trooper's life. We who have seen where the Clone Troopers started and where they all wind up, will enjoy playing through the life of one of these guys and experiencing a fun (if a little shorter than deserved) trip through the chronology of all 6 films. It's a welcome addition in that it finally gives something with specific goals and experience to someone who wishes to play the game without others.The Galaxy Conquest is improved in that your goal is still like a board game- look at your map, seeing all the planets, with the goal to eventually to conquer them all for your side. This time you amass points for each victory and use it to buy special bonuses such as more troops or a Hero character, as well as space fleets (since you now also fight in space in Galaxy Conquest). It's much more fun than before, less linear and a bit more difficult. And with space fleets, Hero characters, and half a dozen different timelines (and matching planet layouts) there's a lot more variation to the mode this time. It's fun, and takes as much as 2-6 hours to go through just one of these, which of course you can do whenever you want. Fun stuff.Lastly I'll mention the Xbox Live content: It's actually fantastic. If you can sign up for Xbox Live, it's worth doing so for this game because not only does it add two new Hero characters (Asajj Ventress and an overpowered Kit Fisto) but also half a dozen of the best maps from the first game including Cloud City and both Rhen Var maps, all of which now allow the Hero rumble mentioned earlier. And once downloaded, you can log off and enjoy the new goodies on your own without having to ever connect again. It's a great addition that should have been included to begin with.SO there you have it. Whereas the first game was just a great, easy to get into addictive shooter, this time it's the same but with even more stuff, all of which is your choice to use or not. Add to that a decent sized single-player game and improved Galaxy Conquest, and you have a game that's fairly improved over the first. If you liked the original, I can't imagine this one would be disappointing. Just don't be like those goons who want it to be just like that OTHER famous shooter- it's not supposed to be. Instead just sit back and, well, I'll use the cliche- let the Force be with you. Have fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00005ULXN","reviewerName":"Matthew Ivester \"Power User\"","summary":"Fast-Paced Supersonic Action!","reviewText":"This game is *fast*.  And then it's slow.  And then it's blazing.  I like it a lot, but the new features aren't quite all they're cracked up to be.As an old-school Sonic The Hedgehog fan (I had all of them on the Genesis), I was very happy to see SA2B released on the Nintendo Gamecube.  I was a little concerned, though, as Sonic on Nintendo hardware *was* predicted as a sign of the apocalypse by Nostradamus.  But the world hasn't ended yet, so I think we'll be alright.The gameplay is somewhat mixed.  This is because there are three different kinds of levels: &quot;Sonic&quot; levels, where you race through various 3D worlds trying to get to the end as fast as possible, &quot;Tails&quot; levels where you run around in a mecha-suit blasting enemies and trying to get as many points as possible, and &quot;Knuckles&quot; levels where you have to run, climb, and fly around 3D levels searching for randomly hidden Chaos Emerald fragments as quickly as possible.  I found the &quot;Sonic&quot; levels to be the most fun -- the &quot;Tails&quot; levels tended to drag at points, and the &quot;Knuckles&quot; levels vary in difficulty drastically depending on where the emeralds are hidden each time.  You have a sort of &quot;hot/cold&quot; detector to help find them, but something that at least gave *some* hint of a direction to go in would have made these levels much less painful.  As you progress through the game, you can also unlock extra abilities for each character, which will let them go back to the earlier levels and find hidden items and areas that you couldn't reach before.There are actually two plots, a &quot;Hero&quot; plot where you play as Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, and a &quot;Dark&quot; plot where you play as Shadow (an evil hedgehog), Eggman (Dr. Robotnik's grandson, who has a mech like Tails'), and Rouge (a bat with abilities much like Knuckles').  After you beat both games, there's a final set of levels where both teams have to work together to save the world, culminating in a final boss battle featuring... well, I won't spoil it.The &quot;Chao&quot; feature allows you to raise cute little tamagotchi-like creatures between levels.  By feeding them various powerup items you collect by destroying enemies (and which are also hidden around the levels, see above), you can make them grow into various forms.  I didn't find this particularly compelling, but you can do all sorts of things with them, including entering the critters you raise into a series of races and competitions, and breeding multiple generations of them in the hopes of, uh, getting an even better little virtual fuzzball, I guess.  This also interacts with the Sonic games on the GBA, but as I don't have a GBA, I can't comment on that.The multiplayer I found to be not very fun at all.  You can play several of the game's levels against each other, and you can also play a kart racing minigame.  If you have friends who are big fans of the game, you might get further than I did.Basically, SA2B is a fun, colorful, fast-paced game that's not too difficult, and probably great for kids -- the plot is pretty simple, and the dialogue couldn't be any cheesier.  But it's still a blast.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2003"}

Forza 5 looks and plays better than Forza 4 but I'm more interested in gameplay than graphics.I've been playing Dead Rising 3 and while it is not the most visibly impressive game, the gameplay is amazing. There can be over 100 zombies on the screen without stuttering. Fighting hundreds of zombies at the same time is just crazy fun.The Kinect has been greatly improved. I just need to walk in the room and it recognizes me and logs me in. The minimum distance from the camera is not 3-4 feet versus the 6-8 feet of the old Kinect. Kinect Fitness and Just Dance 4 work great. Hardcore gamers have little use for the Kinect but with the improvements that could change - that depends on game developers.The thing that I expect to be really popular is the game DVR. The ability to easily record gameplay clips is something the gaming community really needs. I've already used it and had no problems. It feels weird yelling, &#34;Xbox, Record That&#34;, but it will become natural soon enough.If you are on the fence about buying an Xbox One, I suggest waiting another 6 months or a year.

{"product_name":"B002BSC54I","reviewerName":"Charles H.","summary":"Skyward Something","reviewText":"I wouldn't say Skyward Sword is a 'bad' game, per say, but it has its problems. I pre-ordered this game from Target with the Wiimote/CD bundle a while back, but I've been hesitant to share my thoughts about it. Well, I'm bored, so behold!Controls:This was some kind of great debate when the game first came out. \"Are Skyward Sword's motion controls broken?\" was the question. I can only speak based on my own experience, and the answer is no. You have to recenter occasionally, which is rather annoying, but the actual swordplay works pretty well. I have to make a well defined arm movement to get an accurate swing, but I've spoken with gods know how many Zelda fans who say they can play the entire game by just flicking their wrists. So, one way or another, the controls do work and work well.Music:I think that the 'epic ballads', if you will, aren't up to par with previous entries into the franchise, but some of the music for the areas is better than usual.Gameplay:The dungeons in Skyward Sword are some of the best 3D Zelda has ever seen. They're certainly the high point of the game, as it should be. But just outside of those dungeons, there is a world restricted by artificial barriers that you cannot explore (until certain plot developments occur). This means you have to do these fantastic dungeons in the same order and with the same items every time you play this game. Many Zelda games have opted to employ a predefined dungeon order, but it's more noticeable (and thus more annoying) in Skyward Sword because the world is so hedged off.There are sidequests, but most of them involve flying, perhaps lowest point of this title. There's a warp system for the world below, but to get anywhere, you need to spend two to ten minutes flying through the air to get to it. The sky itself is a desolate place filled with nothing, save a few Goddess Cube puzzles. And this is particularly atrocious because the sky is the only real area you can explore in the game.Story:It's pretty good. Some characters are a little cheesy, but that's to be expected.Replayability:Most Zelda games either allow enough freedom to do things differently on subsequent runs through or they give you a warp system to skip past endless travel. Skyward Sword doesn't really do either since the warp system still requires you to ride Sky-Epona to your destination. So, there's endless flying coupled with a quest that allows you no freedom of choice whatsoever (And the second phase of the game could have easily allowed some choices on where to go.). The replay value is kind of average, in that it's not really there.I wouldn't count Twilight Princess as being one of my favorite Zelda games, but the more I think about it, the more I realize that I find it to be vastly superior to Skyward Sword. If you have a Wii and are looking for an adventure about elven heroes saving princesses, why not check the much cheaper Twilight Princess out before spending 50-70 bucks on this title?","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"J. W. Mullins","summary":"The reason to buy a PS3","reviewText":"I will have to start out by saying I am a MGS fan from NES days. That simple statement is to warn people that while I try to be as honest as possible I do have some bias towards the game and series.If you don't own a PS3 yet MGS4 is the reason to buy one. This is the fitting end of an era for Solid Snake and the game is a master piece of art, story and gameplay. That said this is Hideo Kojima's story and he is going to make damn sure you see it. While I am not sure of the percentage I would guess at least a third of the game is made up of cut scenes. You will watch through entire stages of cuts scenes, only to save and watch another one before getting to a playable stage. For the less than total MGS fan this can be quite annoying. Luckily you are able to skip the scenes if you want, though you will lose all understanding of the story in the process. And like all previous MGS titles on the PS systems this is a complex and convoluted story. But for the fan it will answer so many of the questions that have up to this point been unresolved in the series.The gameplay is typical MGS but even more refined and precise than before. While I thought it would be hard to top the control available in MGS3 this game has done it. Snake moves with amazing precision, but with a real world weight to him. Snake is an old soldier and it shows. But while any other person his age would be home watching TV, Snake is out to save the world one last time. The years of hard live come across clearly in the gameplay while not being an unnecessary hindrance. The fact that Hideo Kojima was able to pull this off is amazing. The amount of Easter Eggs and homages to the series and his past game means several play through are in order for the fan. The amount of gear and weapons also means most players will play through several times just to make sure they have experience all the action.You can not go wrong with this game, be it for the hardcore MGS fan, or the fan of action games in general. This is the fitting end of Hideo Kojima run on this amazing series and it ends with every bit as much emotional investment as Lord of the Rings or Star Wars. There may be Metal Gear games in the future, I hope there are, but this is the fitting end of Snakes tale.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2009"}

Why was this game made? The story of this game should have been written to make it the third and final game of a trilogy.

The story is flawed by comic book canon - If this is the first time Batman meets Joker, then why are Black Mask, Bane, Firefly, Deathstroke, Deadshot, etc. in the game? These others are introduced later in years as Batman and Joker&#8217;s rivalry intensifies. And even if you were to cram all these rogues into 1 game, make the story have multiple layers and be long from just a character interaction standpoint, not dopey side quests and silly hidden item goose chases!!No room for error whatsoever.Scoring system for this game is horribleToo many cut scenesBoss battles not continuous &#8211; consistently disrupted by cut scenes which prevent a flow for a real fightToo many hidden itemsNo explanation / tutorial / legend for Deathstroke&#8217;s playable weaponryChallenge maps are way too difficult","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2014"}

Why change too much when the 1st one is so successful, right? The campaign is reasonably fun and enjoyable with or without friends. Comfortable and easy for the most part. The levels are brilliantly designed, of course.The greatest thing about this game is community. I'm totally astonished how many well-constructed levels are out there already. LBP2 opens up much much more potential for level designs. It provides a lot game mode possibility such as musical, 2D shooter, strategy, tower defense and more... even RPGs. I believe most of items from LBP1 can be used as well. Everything you can see in the game is customizable! Designing a level takes time but relatively easy because it doesn't require any computer language or so.The downside might be looking for random multiplayer games. I find myself disconnected and stuck at the loading screen often which could be fixed in future patched.(now 1 week after game release) But the fun part is also playing with people & friends! It's so hilarious all the time. It's one of few games that players don't hate each other...I like the game a lot but if you hate LBP1 a lot... probably won't like 2 either. I hope this review helps.

In case you don't know, here's what's happened: Gruntilda, a big green ugly witch, was defeated by the dynamic duo of Banjo and Kazooie and trapped under a boulder as Klungo desperately tries to free her. If you have played the first game and collected all 100 Jiggies in the game, then Mumbo let you in on a few secrets that would be revealed in the next game; as promised, they are! There are also several new protagonists and antagonists.The new protagonists include Humba Wumba, a Native American woman who believes Mumbo Jumbo is a mere amateur and that her own transformation magic is far greater than his. Also, rather than Bottles the mole teaching you new moves (he is killed in the beginning of the game), Sgt. Jamjars the mole, who is Bottle's brother, teaches you 22 new moves. Speaking of Bottles, you meet his wife and kids. Also, 4 new Jinjo colors are introduced. In the original, you had to find green, blue, yellow, purple, and orange Jinjo in each level. Now, 4 new colored Jinjos are introduced: Red, Brown, White, and Black.Also, there are some new antagonists. To begin with, you meet Gruntilda's evil sisters, Blobbelda and Mingella. Also, Klungo, Grunty's Igor-parody of an assistant, plays a much greater role, for you must fight him three times in the game. And speaking of fighting him, eight massive bosses each possess a jiggy in each of the worlds. The worlds are all new in design, from the prehistoric era, to high up in the clouds, to a massive factory. The game is huge in size, and though you only need 70 jiggies to finish the game (there are 90), it is still a great feat. The game is very challenging. The reason I've made considerable progress so quick (there are a couple):1. I use the player's guide I purchased some years ago, but only when I need it.2. I have been playing this game a LOT!For the N64, the graphics are excellent. The sound effects that made the first game so great are all there, from personalized vocal styles to audio indicators (i.e. the music on the massive overworld changes based on what world you are close to), and everything in between. Also, it's very cool that you get to play as Mumbo, his magic is vital for every world. He doesn't transform you, for that is Wumba's job, but if you step on a pad, he will execute a certain magic, which is very cool. This is probably the best new feature. The bottom line: I highly recommend this game if you are into action/adventure games of this sort (e.g. Crash Bandicoot), though unlike a typical action game of modern day, the focus is not on platforming, but on exploration of massive worlds. The bottom line: if you still have an N64, but didn't pick this up, I must recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2005"}

Production values are super-high, and the game stays entertaining and full of great new ideas all the way through. In many ways, this game reminds me of Prince of Persia. I am sure the developers of GoW have played PoP a few times  ;-)However, there are several differences. There is more fighting here, and it is done very well. While in PoP fighting is annoying, here it is great fun. The things you can pull off are just amazing. I especially like the fights while climbing a wall.On the other hand, PoP is much better in pretty much anything else. Particularly the \"walk the plank\" balancing acts are done very well in Prince of Persia, while in God of War, they are a constant source of frustration. I was tempted to turn down the difficulty (an option the game provides when one fails to often) in \"jump, balance, and run\" parts, but then I didn't because I felt the game would have gotten too easy in other parts.What amazed me about this game are all the new ideas the developers had. I enjoyed all the puzzles, because they are not too hard and don't get in the way of the action. Practically all of them can be solved without a walkthrough or strategy guide.So what didn't I like? For one, there is the camera! What a mess! It almost seems like they just didn't have time to finish it. There are a number of times where you fail due to the bad camera angle (which you can't change). In a game of this class, this sort of problem just must not happen!And then there is the play balance. While at times, the game flows very well and at an adequate level of difficulty, at other times, things are just plain sadistic. I would like to meet the psychopath who designed the \"rotating blade climbing wall\", just so I can give him a piece of my mind. The thing is so ridiculously difficult, I literally slammed the controller on the floor several times (this is the first game where I actually did this for real). You keep climbing, and it is already very difficult, and then at the very top, it is a matter of luck whether you will make it or not. And if your hand just touches the side of a blade (which would not even hurt me, but apparently it kills the tough-ass God of War) you fall to the very bottom and have to start over (if you have any life left in you). This is just plain BS. Spend some time in play-testing and balancing for crying out loud.Another thing that might be worth pointing out is the brutality in this game. Never have I played a game where violence was this graphic. I guess it goes with the story, but I could have done with a lot less.Overall, this is a very good game. Some people even say this is the best PlayStation 2 game ever. It certainly is one of the better PS2 games I own. Possibly the best. However, it isn't even close to being the best game I own counting other platform. If this is as good as it gets, then it isn't embarrassing for PS2, but not particularly impressive either.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2005"}

It succeeds in blending WRPG/JRPG concepts for the most part.  Sometimes you'll get annoyed with the over abundance of cutscenes, especially the middle part of the game.  But you'll stick with it because the dungeon exploration is great and battles can be chaotically delicious. If you are a fan of action-RPGs and you own a Wii, I would definitely recommend this game.  The Last Story is no masterpiece, but its heart is in the right place.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00000DMB3","description":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timemay be the greatest single-player video game ever created in any genre. It's that good. Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide. WithThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Nintendo has come up with an all-consuming adventure title that will provide days of engrossing gameplay.--Eric FredricksonPros:Best single-player video gameFreedom to explore a rich, complex worldHelpful fairy guide gives hintsCharming, humorous, lighthearted, yet challengingCons:Some puzzles can be frustratingOnly one saved game per player--don't save when you're stuck!Much more fun with Rumble Pack","reviewerName":"nafysmiley","summary":"Zelda is cool","reviewText":"Ocarina of Time is a massive, epic Action/Adventure game out for the N64.  Many have been tempted to call it the best game ever (just read some other reviews) but I would step back from that.  It is still one of my favorite games, despite the fact that I play mostly RPG's.  By the way, Zelda is not an RPG, even though you do talk to people and have a sword.In Zelda you play as Link (Zelda is the princess, not the main character) as you go on a quest to save the world from the evil Ganondorf by freeing each of six spirits from their different temples.  You change between times, where you are adult or child Link, and you have to switch often, and do different things in both, and each time has different weapons and items.  The time-traveling aspect of the game is one of the coolest parts.The real-time combat is a lot of fun, and fairly well put together.  It involves a 'Z-targeting' system in which you can select a monster and then keep it in the center of the screen and move around it.  The fights against other monsters with swords and shields are great as a result.  Z-targeting is not perfect, but it works well.The dungeons are all awesome, and very unique.  Each dungeon is mostly based around one particular item or weapon, its own gimmick, but despite that they really don't seem forced, and stay fresh all the way through (although, the last couple dungeons aren't nearly as long as the others, almost like the designers started getting bored).  For the most part the dungeons aren't too difficult if you know what to do, but it is very easy to get stuck if you don't, and the game often leaves you on your own to figure out what to do, especially on side quests, so having a good walkthrough nearby is helpful.The overall story isn't too great (for the most part, \"save the princess\"), but many of the individual events and side stories are neat.  The characters and different races which populate the world are cool, especially the Gorons, which are one of the best races ever.  The bosses of each dungeon are awesome, as well as being original, and can usually be beaten by hacking them up, or through the use of special tactics.  It's always good to have a choice.Despite how good it is, Zelda isn't perfect.  The graphics, for example, are nice, but they are old, and on the N64.  The music is okay, but mostly just ambient, and the classic Zelda overworld theme is conspicuously missing.  Having to constantly change which items you have equipped is also annoying, even if there isn't really a better system available.  Some would say Zelda has an almost kiddy atmosphere and suffers from an occasional lack of seriousness (I would tend to disagree).  And of course, the fairy is annoying, but no reason to like the game any less.All in all, Zelda is a great game, and a must buy for any N64 owner, as it is one of the best Action/Adventure games ever.  If you are looking for an RPG, look elsewhere.  This isn't one.  And be prepared to get a little frustrated.  Zelda is pretty long, especially if you do everything there is to do.  Maybe 25-30 hours if you run straight through, but  it could take many more depending on how much extra stuff you do, or how often you get stuck.  Have fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2002"}

I find the plot a little bit silly and hardly motivational but events that unfold during your quest might be appealing to some. Regardless, as a huge Fallout 3 fan (didn't like turn-based 1 and 2) it is a nice have must play game. I wish this game had continued where the original left off through the eyes of the same character or maybe I'm not too attached to mine yet...Pros:- lesser grim mood than Fallout 3- new perks- companions can be commandedCons:- crashes (one time my PS3 slim crashed so badly that I had to power cycle it)- slowdowns (they're not that bad but console games should be optimized to play on a console)- graphical bugs (large objects that are far away show clipping problems like lakes/buildings)- leveling system is different from Fallout 3 either by design or a bug (player is able to chose perk with every other level up)- personally I dislike the faction based fame system (game is forcing you to choose sides a way or another and you'll end up in conflict)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2010"}

The reason why I mention that is because BUZZ! has a definate age range, age limit and age cutoff to its charm. BUZZ is overflowing with charm, but for some kids it may be boring and for some kids it may be too hard. This being the only reason why I don't give it the full 5 stars.Since opening up the game and giving a paddle to my 7-year old, my 2-year old and myself, BUZZ! has been the talk of the house. Mostly from my 7-year old. While my 2-year old has no idea how to play or what he's doing, he enjoys holding the paddle and he enjoys watching the silly monkey's doing crazy stuff. My 7-year old enjoys easily beating my 2-year old at every challenge, but despite the lack of competition, she seems completely ENTHRALLED in the game and can't get enough of it. \"Can we play buzz again?\" \"I'm watching football now.\" \"When football's over, can we play buzz again?\" \"Yes. When football's over.\"The game consists of numerous challenges and games ranging from hurdles, to baseball to mimicing a dancing monkey or throwing coconuts at turtles. All of which are engaging, fun and range from incredibly easy to hard, for a seven-year old. Ultimately, though, the game has numerous qualities to its charm. It isn't just a mindless game for a kid to waste a couple of hours with, it has beneficial games that tests your kids color recognition, to their ability to see something fast and recognize details, to their eye-hand coordination, rhythm and timing.The game combines fun with learning and with 4 paddles, you can sit a family of four in front of the television and have a great time.The only KID I would not recommend this game for, would be that kid who's already keen at the RESIDENT EVIL's and the HITMAN type games that come with the PS2 console. Where they might find the game fun for a short time, they will easily become bored and wonder when they get to shoot something. Although there is a game where you get to shock your fellow monkeys. They might like that.So, in short, if you have a child who ranges from 7-12 and hasn't already perfected the more adult titles of the PS2 console, BUZZ! is tremendous fun and will have your kid begging for you to turn off playoff football.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2008"}

{"product_name":"B002C0VNQQ","reviewerName":"Media Man","summary":"Absorbing fantasy RPG for the patient gamer","reviewText":"In Risen you take on the role of a nameless (male) hero castaway on the fictitious volcanic tropical island of Faranga. The island is originally only inhabited by humans and animals.  However, recent storms and volcanic eruptions cause ancient temple ruins to rise from the ground unearthing long hidden areas such as catacombs and dungeons.  From these \"Risen\" ruins strange and fantastic creatures begin to spill out across the island.  With these creatures comes the lure of long lost treasure and riches hidden within these ruins.  As a result, a group of humans called the \"Inquisition\" place the island in a state of quarantine, forbidding anyone from exiting their city or the island.  While farmers, hunters and common folk are locked inside the city two factions vie for control of exploring the newly appeared ruins in hopes of discovering their origin and ultimately the salvation of the island.  Here are my thoughts on this extremely engaging CRPG masterpiece;Pros+ Very nice graphics overall.  Weapon, armor, creature and water details were exceptionally impressive as was all of the scenery (sunsets, waterfalls, forests etc.).+ Another amazing musical score by Kai Rosenkranz that fits the world beautifully.  It's not quite Gothic 3 but still very good.  The only track I didn't especially care for was the spaghetti-Western sounding song in the Bandit Camp.+ Brilliant voice acting on every level utilizing the talents of Andy Serkis and John Rhys-Davies.  Every line of dialogue within the game is spoken by voice actors, including your character.  This is extremely refreshing in an RPG and still quite uncommon today.+ Twitch based combat was fast, fun, extremely well done and a vast improvement over Gothic 3.  It required you to be strategic and time your attacks as well as your blocks/dodges.+ Dynamic night/day and weather cycles added a lot of realism to the game play.+ Adult themed fantasy CRPG.  The game beautifully handles violence and vulgarity without making it seem over the top or forced.  Some of the dialogue was absolutely priceless.+ Excellent item descriptions tell you exactly what the item does, is for and how to use it.  A good example was with various meats and vegetables you could buy or find and how to cook them into stat beneficial food.+ Brilliantly laid out dungeon and underground areas.  Dungeons were plentiful, not overly long, beautifully decorated and always a joy to discover and explore.+ Engaging and original storyline.+ Spell effects were clean and didn't bog down the system when cast.+ The Don and his bandit's are very well portrayed and the hardened outlaws they are.  They're crude, crass, heartless and unforgiving.  They are bandits after all, why shouldn't they act like them?+ Hero you play has a witty and sarcastic sense of humor.+ Many of the characters on both the Inquisition and Don sides have Spanish names (Esteban, Mendoza, Delgado etc.).  If this was homage to Monty Python's \"Nobody Expects The Spanish Inquisition!\" then, well done developers!+ Multiple storylines depending on the faction you choose to ally with.+ Completely seamless world both indoor and outdoor.  There are no loading times except during cut scenes, chapter changes and teleports.+ Creatures and Enemies are NOT scaled by level as in other games like Oblivion.  If you shouldn't be there, they let you know.  Some may find that harsh but I find it realistic.+ Save anytime, anywhere.Cons- Steep learning curve.  Leveling is very slow to start with, gear is tough to acquire, combat is extremely challenging and opponents are vicious.- Not many factions to ally yourself with.  Eventually you're forced to ally with a faction as the game progresses and none of them start out particularly appealing or friendly.  The Don and his bandits are cold, unfriendly and selfish criminals while the Inquisition are self righteous, strict, imposing and almost oppressive.- Magic use (other than scrolls or potions) is only available on the Inquisition/Convocation of Mages side.- Can't loot armor from any of the opponents you defeat even though they're clearly wearing it.  Early on in the game I defeated a high level Inquisition NPC who was wearing extremely nice armor only to find that I wasn't even offered the choice of looting it.- Sneak skill doesn't allow you to sneak up on monsters.- Quests in Harbor City became a bit too long and boring.- Game suffered a bit from pacing problems depending on how you approached the story.- Your character begins to feel a bit too much like a tattle tale throughout many of the quests.- The differentiation between Magic Barriers (blue) and Magic Force Fields (Red) is never described.- Very limited armor choices- Limited terrain.  It's basically only jungles, swamps and dungeons since you're on a tropical island.- Ending was sort of abrupt and a bit of a let down.- Shadow graphics are very heavy on the system.- Lots of foot travel and backtracking around the island before you can activate teleportation stones.- Opening cinematic really doesn't make much sense until later in the game.Tips &lt;Contains SPOILERS>~ Save often as you will die A LOT.~ Always take descriptive notes and mark down locations when you find a chest that you can't open, a magic barrier you can't dispel, a dungeon you're not strong enough to explore, ore you can't harvest or a creature you can't defeat.  If you don't you will most likely forget and miss many of the treasures throughout the game.~ DO NOT eat any Ogre Root, Pixie Hat or Wanderlust plants.  Wait until you take Alchemy which allows you to brew potions that give you +5 to a stat from one plant vs. +1 from just eating it.  Wanderlust will give you +100 exp for 5 plants vs. +25 exp if you just eat them.  I didn't notice a stat potion for Druid's Hemlock to increase your life by +5 rather than the +1 from eating the plant.~ One switch may open multiple doors depending on how many times you press it.~ Beneficial skills to take are Smithing (craft weapons and magic jewelry), Alchemy (brew health/mana potions and permanent stat enhancing potions), Pickpockets (if you prefer to complete quests the easy way by just stealing items people may have rather than doing what they request of you), Sneaking (if you don't want to be heard entering off limits areas to pilfer goodies),~ Turn Shadows down to Low if you're experiencing any lag or memory leak style issues while playing.  Once I did that the game ran flawlessly.~ If you want to learn and devote skill points to magic early join the Monastery, don't wait.~ 2-handed weapons can be used 1-handed with a shield if your weapon skill in that area is high enough.~ Learn to properly use the \"charged blow\" attacks.~ Pick 1 or 2 max styles of attack if you want to maximize those skills (melee weapon, ranged weapon or magical attacks).  If you spread your skill points evenly across multiple attack styles you'll be less than mediocre at everything.~ Staff Fighting, while it looks cool at first is very underwhelming damage and defense wise later in the game.~ Don't explore at night as you will more than likely die repeatedly.  Night time is extremely dark in the game and most creatures tend to sleep at night.  Often times you'll find yourself struggling to see where you're going and literally trip over a group of sleeping enemies who will in turn make an easy meal out of you.  Use a bed to rest until morning so it's daylight.~ Open all pouches and mussels found in your inventory as they can yield rewards.~ Do as many quests as you can before joining a faction and many will no longer be available or be lost once you choose sides.  However, if you wish to become magically adept early you may have to skip some quests.~ DO NOT kill any NPCs without knowing the consequences.  If you kill someone who is part of a quest line or is a trainer you can never finish or take advantage of either.~ Skills I took that I could have done without; Staff Fighting, Create Scrolls (was forced to take it as a Mage), Skin Animals (you need a specific tool for each type of animal to remove the necessary piece) and Acrobatics (nice to have in case you fall but otherwise not very useful)~ Read every bookstand/book you can in the game as it increases your wisdom.~ Conjure Skeleton is extremely useful against tougher and multiple opponents as it allows you to flank and or attack from behind.~ Always carry Nautilus Transformation, Levitation and Telekinesis scrolls if you're not a Mage or don't use ranged weapons.~ Ranged weapons can flip switches, levers and pulley systems.I'll admit, at first I was apprehensive about this game but after only one hour of playing I was completely hooked.  This game absorbed me for weeks and took me a total of 76 hours to complete with my character ending at L29.  I chose to ally myself with the Convocation of Mages faction who formed an alliance with the Inquisition (Essentially I was considered part of the Inquisition).  I was primarily skilled with Swords, a few points in crossbow and full points in Seals (Magic Spells), Open Locks, Smithing and Alchemy.  I also took Pick Pocketing (2), Acrobatics, Sneaking, Prospect Ore, Create Scrolls and Skin Animals.  Money seemed a bit tight in the beginning of the game but I finished the game with over 17,000 gps.  If you're a patient gamer into CRPG's that allow you to build your character the way you want then this is the game for you.  Or if you enjoyed similar games such as Gothic 3, Two Worlds or Divine Divinity 2.  I can't recommend it enough.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2010"}

They could have went the extra way and made a lifelike size Replica plasma. That would have been awesome. I wouldn't mind paying extra for something like that. Even a stature of the character would have been better. The one that comes in the box is about at the size of the box. It was no stand so you can mount it anywhere.

Due to the defect rate especially in older years of the console, you might find yourself scouring the shelves for the latest date and revision number.  I bought in 2008, so I can only comment up until then and would hope that it has only improved in 2009 revisions.Don't let the console revisions scare you too much, but you probably should get the latest possible unless you have a reason to get an older one.  Not all revision updates apply to hardware.  It can simply mean an updated copy of the operating system which is updated automatically when you connect to the internet.  The biggest thing to look for is at least get one with lower power consumption, which in 2008 I think it was the 175 Watt power supply in most 2008 versions.  I found quality control issues on minor things and ended up purchasing and returhning several consoles until I found one that worked great.  I personally didn't like the August/September 2008 revisions and ended up looking for slightly older revisions because of a high-pitched noise problem on the newer version of hardware at that time.  I actually much preferred the June 2008 revision and choose an older box after buying and returning several.  There could very easily be more updated versions by now, but I can only speak of the 2008 versions that I spent a considerable amount of time pouring through when I bought mine.My biggest problem was a high pitched noise that came from the power supply brick.  I had to go through several purchases and returns until I finally got one that didn't make a high pitched noise.  Some were far better or worse than others.  My bottom line is that when not using the xbox, I don't want a constant high pitched noise in the background when doing other things like watching movies on my DVD player.  Some people cannot hear electronics noise since the higher range goes as you get older.  If you are one of those that can hear if a TV is on without looking when muted, then you'll hear this since it is far louder than the TV noise.  After several purchases, I finally found a power brick that didn't make a noise.  If you are stuck with one that makes a noise when off, you can put it on a power strip and turn the power off, but that isn't very convenient.I was also surprised by how much the console vibrates when a disc is in the DVD tray and spinning.  I could feel the floor shake several feet away.  But if you install your games to the hard drive, then the disc doesn't need to spin.  It really isn't a problem.  Some vibrate a bit more than others.  I believe the DVD drive is designed to run at a higher rate of speed to load from disc faster, but vibrates more as a result.The XBox console makes a bit of noise while running, especially when a game is in the DVD tray and not installed on the hard drive.  The DVD drive while spinning is very loud, louder than the original xbox.  I highly recommend using the option to install the game to the hard drive and it loads faster and is much more quiet when running.  When installed, I don't even notice the noise, but it certainly isn't quiet.  Note that some console's DVD drives are noisier than others.  But if you just install all games, it make virtually not difference.  It also saves wear on the DVD drive which is one of the componentns likely to fail first.Beyond considering hardware version, regarding the console alone, I really like my console.  Once I got one without the minor issues that seem like poor quality control on small things, I really like it.  If I forget about the search to pick one, I would have said 5 star.  If I rated on the imperfect ones I returned I would say 2 stars.  But after 1.5 years of playing games without any problems at all, I rate it 4 stars because overall my experience is very positive.  I am very happy with my xbox and the experience ever since I set my last one up.  There are lots of games at reasonable prices that I like.  It has never failed me once.  I am not at all worried about my hardware failing and it has never given any hint of any pending problem.  If you didn't know there were issues in the past, you'd probably be thrilled with the current revisions of the xbox.  I had heard the biggest problem of the past I believe was the console overheating due to motherboard configuration with the video and CPU chips too close together with insufficient ventalation and when it got too hot the video processor would fall off.Speaking of heat, to prevent overheading, make sure you don't obstruct any of the ventalation holes and that the console is in a sufficiently ventalated space (not a completely enclosed cabinet.  My cabinet has a ventalation grate on the bottom and back.  Think of it like a computer in terms of the fans and heat it has to expel.  My sound system gets a lot hotter than my XBox though.But if you are a hard core Playstation fan, then I wouldn't force an xbox on someone who doesn't want one.  I'm sure Playstation is great and am not comparing the two.  All I can say is I am very happy with my xbox.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2009"}

The content on the games for the PS3 in the games I've bought so far is excellent. No memory sticks or troubles with this version PS3 console. It looks really nice and works great.

It isn't going to be obsolete anytime soon so I really like that about it. The PS2 got old fairly quickly after it's initial purchase, but with all the content and extras that the manufacturer provides, I think it will take a long time for this system to get old and there is always new things to get such as motion bundles and different controllers.I am super happy with this system and I am enjoying the cool games and graphics. I haven't done many extras so far but will in the future. Uncharted is super fun and very interesting. I can't say enough good about L.A. Noire, for an adult player, it's super fun and amazing.

The game helps to teach you the skills necessary to care for a pet!There are three different types of Nintendog games out there - Chihuahua, Dachshund, and Labrador Retriever. Each game has a different group of dog breeds available in it. If you get all 3 games you get the full collection of dog types - but there are plenty enough to choose from with just one game.You start out by choosing a dog and naming it. The simple interactions come first of course - tossing a tennis ball, petting the dog, teaching it to sit. Your pet learns to respond to your voice commands, and develops a personality depending on how you interact with it. You take your pet for walks, feed it, give it water, and most of all provide it with love and affection.As you progress with your pet, you can teach it more tricks, play frisbee with it and enter it in a variety of competitions. You can earn money, buy new treats for your pup, and even customize the home you live in. If you have other Nintendo DS owners in your area, you can even share pet time together and exchange information!I've played many pet games before this one - Catz, Dogz, Creatures, NeoPets, you name it. It's impressive how far the graphics have come in these games. The Nintendog pet is very emotive - from the hopeful eyes to the wagging tail, you really get a sense that this is a live creature anxious for affection. You can pet the pup, nuzzle it under the chin, tickle its belly.  When you throw the ball or toss the frisbee, it really reacts the way you would think it should.It's delightful to see a game that doesn't involve violence or destruction. Sure, if you neglect your pet it will get upset. But in general, you can go as slowly as you wish, caring for your pet, knowing that it will unashamedly love you back completely.There are millions of people out there who simply cannot have a real pet. Some are allergic to pets, some have tiny apartments where there is not enough room for a pet. Some kids are simply too young for a real pet and have parents who will not take on the responsibility. There are many, many reasons that a real pet would be impossible - and the Nintendog is the perfect solution!Highly recommended - 5/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2005"}

{"product_name":"B001CWXAP2","description":"","reviewerName":"Da Jester","summary":"Bioware's Magnum Opus for the Star Wars Universe!","reviewText":"I will start this review stating that no matter what happens, nothing in my opinion will replace the amount of fun, trial & error, and over all experience I had with World of Warcraft. When it comes to my MMO experience, WoW will always remain my favorite MMO of all time. Luckily after feeling the withdrawals of finally stopping my WoW account for months, I got a chance to be a general Beta tester for Star Wars the Old Republic. Being a huge Star Wars nerd like so many others, I was excited to partake. Within a week of Beta testing, I fell in love with this game.I understand that it was Bioware's mission to create the first fully voiced story driven MMORPG and there were going to be game design repercussions. They are: that the race choices are very limited and not very unique from one another, questing is linear, and some social aspects like emote animations will seem very limited to WoW's unique races and class choices.It's a MMO that has large amounts single player grinding that even some serious MMO players will enjoy, but will be very nit picky about. As a 6 year WoW veteran, I understand the concerns.However, getting past this hump, one immediately is treated to what I will call Bioware's best written and designed SciFi epic. As much as I love other Bioware titles, The amount of story hours a player can pour into 1 of 8 classes is already more than the first two Mass Effect games together. Each class story is unique from the other supplying a huge reason to log in and play. In other words, the level grind is never boring. At the same time, it's still as much as a MMO with heroics (group quests), Flashpoints (instances), Warzones (PVP), and Operations (raids). The fact that you can actually bring 3 other player's characters to your starship and travel planet to planet or have a mini party was very awesome! So don't worry RPers, there is something here for you as well. The environments seem sandboxed, but each planet is visually beautiful to quest in and explore. Combat animations are very strong here! Unlike World of Warcraft, combat is never dull with each ability having unique animations. I've read many complaints on how the game looks dated. I had 0 problems with the graphical look. Just watch a Sith Warrior fight hordes of enemies or partake in one of the epic and visual Flashpoints.One feature that I was not entirely sure was going to be satisfactory is the companion system. I never liked playing a MMO class where I had to micro manage a pet feature, such as hunters or warlocks in WoW. But, in relation to other Bioware games featuring companions, this system surprisingly works well in this MMO! Each companion has their own personality and usefulness during your level grind. They literally become your crew and actually can perform tasks for your character while you are questing. The big one they provide is the 3 professions you can have. Instead of having to go back to a capital city to increase your professions, you make them do the crafting and mission gathering and never have to stop questing, ever.The game is not perfect and does need more polish and other features added. I personally would like to the have the addition of social mini games such as the fun card game or Swoop races from Knights of the Old Republic. Space battles are visually neat, but only play on a rail shooter system. Bioware stated that they are truly dedicated to providing more of the features that mmo players are familiar with in the near future.  If you are a Star Wars fan and enjoy Bioware's style of games, then please check out Star Wars the Old Republic. I believe that even if this games fails in the subscription numbers or goes toward the Free to Play genres of MMOs, it will still be super popular because of the Star Wars fans. With that said, time to log back in. :D","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2011"}

{"product_name":"B004FS8LYK","description":"","reviewerName":"Genryu","summary":"A great survival story with a fresh perspective","reviewText":"I wasn't sure what to expect from Tomb Raider going in, and initially expected a Uncharted-like game except with a female-lead. I am actually happy to say that I could not have been more wrong about the difference having a female protagonist could make. I am a male gamer, and frankly most games have leading male protagonists that physically and emotionally don't often have their character depth and progress thoroughly explored. Whether you're playing as Master Chief from Halo, Kratos from God of War, or even Drake from Uncharted they're all characters that are meant to be more empty vessels that a player can jump into. Even for the games that do have some interesting characters, they are often male and usually not usually portrayed in a vulnerable state emotionally or physically. As video games grow and evolve it's nice to see a fresh perspective and Tomb Raider, at least partly, is one of those games. Lara Croft is a strong young woman who gets herself launched into a terrifying situation where she's shipwrecked on a mysterious island full of dangerous inhabitants, wildlife, terrain, and mysteries. Separated from her friends and forced to rely on her own ingenuity and cunning to survive in truly brutal circumstances (trust me, this game is quite graphic), Lara is portrayed in a way a lot of us might feel - scared, but resolved to survive. It is that sense of vulnerability in having to face very real dangers like men that are all larger and stronger than Lara that brings a new sense of danger. As a male gamer playing male leads, you never really face that issue since even Drake from Uncharted, despite being a normal man, never feels like he is out-matched physically. There are literally scenes where you are forced to fight for survival, frantically swinging your pick-axe and running to keep yourself from dying or being brutally assaulted and attacked by the remorseless \"natives.\"The game works great to show that progression of Lara's character as she overcomes the emotional challenges of accepting her predicament and physical challenges of being forced to fight to survive all in the name of wanting to save her friends. The game does an excellent job, both through the script and the cutscenes to show her character progression throughout - but there is 1 critical flaw. This is of course an action game, and the combat feels great with a variety of weapons available along with upgrades along with a fluid movement and cover system. Though like Far Cry 3 and Crysis 3, the bow is one of the showcase weapons and is frankly the most satisfying one to use (not to mention completely silent). While you start of feeling \"capable\" of surviving, at some point you really do turn from being a survivor into a true hunter. This change feels like it happens very suddenly to me, and doesn't really fit with the emotional turmoil Lara goes through in her fight for survival. I started off in the first part of the game with my heart beating faster in each fight to later encounters where I planned out and stalked my prey with deadly precision. Though I admit the combat feels incredibly satisfying, especially using the bow, it does break the sense of danger they did such an excellent job building up earlier on. The story itself plays out well, and does incorporate some mystical aspects to keep you guessing exactly what is going on. There are little journals and other snippets that can be collected throughout the game to help fill you in on the backstory of the island and various characters as well. Though it does seem odd to be finding random journals where characters detail their innermost secrets laid plain to bear for anyone that walks by.The graphics on the game look great, with solid environmental effects and character model details. Though you can tell they used a darker palette to help mask some of the rough edges here and there, it's still one of the better looking games of this console generation. As far as Tomb Raiding itself goes, it's entirely optional. It's a fun way to play through some puzzles, but frankly Lara's \"intuition\" kind of vision makes each of the puzzles very simple to solve for all of the Tomb's I've come across. There are plenty of little things to wander around and find, and navigating the terrain is fun and satisfying without being frustrating or cumbersome. The enemies are not particularly varied though, so expect to be fighting a lot of the same kinds of enemy types except with increasing numbers as the game goes on. But rest assured there are still plenty of surprises to keep you playing! Overall, this game gets my vote of recommendation. Whether you're looking for a fun 3rd party action game, a new take on the stereotypical adventure game genre, or a bit of both with a little extra mixed in you can't go wrong with Tomb Raider.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2013"}

But lacking if you don't have any friends with the same game.","reviewText":"Titanfall feels sort of like a small evolution of multiplayer gaming. I consider the former pinnacle to be Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Everything about that game just felt on point, with a few exceptions.Titanfall, made by those same developers, is very similar, but more focused. The selection of weapons has been slimmed down significantly, but each weapon in the game is perfectly balanced to not be too over or under powered. There's no &#34;noob tube&#34; in this game. For instance, the Smart Pistol, which automatically locks on to a target and offers and one hit kill, would normall seem overpowered. However, it takes a few seconds to lock on, and in a game where everyone is moving so quickly, it takes quite a bit of skill and maneuverability to actually get the lock on to complete. Every weapon or power has a nemesis, something that negates its benefits. It makes the game a blast to play.On the downside, single player content is completely nonexistent save for a brief training tutorial. YOU MUST HAVE XBOX LIVE GOLD TO PLAY THIS GAME. The campaign is an interesting concept, framing the multiplayer matches with storyline. However the storyline presented is pretty thin and weak and most won't be interested in multiple play throughs.If you love COD multiplayer but find it getting a bit stale, I highly recommend this game. Just don't expect a lot of story out of it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2014"}

{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"Felllix","summary":"Still solid, but better.","reviewText":"I wrote in my review of the first Uncharted that \"solid\" is the perfect word to describe it. Uncharted 2 does little to change that evaluation. It changes what little was wrong with the first game but does little to advance itself as an original product. Is that enough? Overall, I would say, yes, but Uncharted 2: Among Thieves still doesn't feel like all it could be.Once again, the plot follows Nathan Drake, treasure hunter extraordinaire once again voiced by Nolan North, now attempting to find the lost city of Shambhala, which contains the legendary Cintamani stone. This time, Drake's companions are Chloe Frazer, voiced by Claudia Black, and Harry Flynn, voiced by the always reliable Steve Valentine. The plot takes Drake to Nepal and also involves the nefarious General Zoran Lazarevic, who wants the stone to help him take over the world instead of just having something pretty to look at.The gameplay is transplanted almost wholesale from the first Uncharted; cover-based combat, run-and-jump platforming sections, and \"puzzles.\" The good news of all these things has been polished to a mirror sheen in this sequel, to the point that it's hard to criticize how well they have been done. So let's talk about them a little.My major gripe about the combat of Uncharted 1 was its frequency and its difficulty; it was sometimes frustrating and more often felt arbitrary. Uncharted 2 has been balanced more or less perfectly, and the difficulty ramps up correctly, easy at first, more difficult as the game goes on. There's also some light stealth this time, and it's clear when the game wants you to use it and when it's impossible; there are sections of the game that significantly reward the stealthy player.The action sections in Uncharted 2 also up the ante; there's a section involving a helicopter chasing a train that stands out, in my mind, as creative, challenging, and pretty spectacular. The game also has the sense to realize that it doesn't need a dozen of these sequences strung together; having earned its huge chase, it is content to have the next section be isolated on top of a mountain in the snow.My only real complaint about the combat in Uncharted 2 is the lack of a variety of enemies; you only really fight three kinds; the normal, the heavy, and the extra-heavy. Besides the final battle, the game has no real bosses, and given the supernatural elements of the plot (as with the first game), there are huge wasted opportunities for strange monster enemies.The action not involving enemies has many of the same issues as the original Uncharted, though the climbing sections are no more difficult than before. The controls have been tightened up quite a bit, and it's much easier now to pinpoint exactly which ledge you want to jump to. My complaint remains the same as in the previous game for these sections; they aren't exactly difficult, and feel a little like you're wheeling Drake from one action game section to another.And once again, the design of the puzzles leaves much to be desired. The puzzles in Uncharted are less puzzles than they are re-arranging minigames. They aren't challenging in any sense of the word. Check your journal, and copy what's there. Boom, puzzle solved.What's missing, in the puzzles and in the game at large, is cleverness. What Uncharted, and Uncharted 2, are both lacking is moments where the player can feel smart by jumping through the correct hoop. The \"aha!\" moments aren't there. The game once again looks great, and at this point it's playing as good as it possibly can with its current design, but is that all we want as gamers? I give Uncharted 2: Among Thieves a 4-star score, because I enjoyed it, finished it, and might play it again someday. It's worth the thirty-some dollars I paid for it. But the elements are here for a masterpiece that the game does not fulfill. Uncharted 2 is good. It can still be great.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2011"}

Cadieux","summary":"Overwhelming, boring, first game I've given up on in 10+ years","reviewText":"I have about 30 games for each of the PS2 and PS3, and have finished them all until this one.  The last game I gave up on was probably on the PS1.  I really thought I was going to like Dragon Age Origins (DAO), but didn't.  Strangely, I bought it with Demon's Souls (DS), and was sure I'd like DAO but not DS (was giving it a try anyway).  It was the opposite.  I loved DS, but DAO just couldn't keep my interest.My first impression of this game was a feeling of being overwhelmed.  There are so many spells, abilities and tactics.  I eventually got the hang of it, and was sure that I was then ready to play.  But the feeling of being overwhelmed continued.  There are so many items and pieces of equipment you can buy but you have very limited money, which turned me off completely.  Some people might like all of that choice, but psychological studies show that too much choice in anything in life can turn some people off, and that's what it did to me.  Then you add to that the constant addition of new quests to complete, and it starts getting out of hand.  I'm trying to complete one quest and the game adds 6 more.  I'm trying to make my quest list shorter, but it multiplied several times.  Let me finish one first!  To make it even worse, you often have to go long stretches before you can get to a shop to sell extra gear, and you get so many items from enemies and chests that you have to start leaving stuff on the ground.  If you do want to pick something up, you have to go into micro-managing mode, discarding items from your inventory, while you curse the game for not giving you a shop to unload at.  Overwhelming and frustrating.The menu interface is slow and awkward and the battles are pretty lame.  Having just completed Demon's Souls immediately before playing this game, Dragon Age just seems weak in the combat department.  I don't mind the low-end graphics so much.  It also takes forever to start, as it wants to check for downloadable content each time you start the game from the menu screen and then it checks the Dragon Age servers, which it was never able to log me into even once, despite the fact that I made an account with them in-game and had it confirmed to my email.So when did I give up on DAO?  On the quest to the mages' tower.  You think it's going to be fairly straight-forward, but it ends up turning into a super-long quest with no chance to re-supply your diminishing health potions, no party to help you, and some frustrating battles.  I died over and over again and the load times drove me nuts.  I got pretty bored, and the game was becoming a chore to play.  Even though I was nearly finished the quest and could see the light at the end of the tunnel, I hit the eject button.  I'm not sure if I'll go back to it or not.(Yes, I know I disagree with the professional reviewers.  I'm entitled to my opinion of the game.)","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2010"}

Drumming as Lars in this game is amazing and at least 50% of the draw here so that is super disappointing, however like Lars and his public appeal the game rebounds once you forgive this.  The music is the best yet but we need expansion songs already (besides Death Magnetic) Live/Garage Days track packs anyone?  The side acts are also a huge part of the appeal and seeing Lemmy is too cool but more stars, (Dave Lombardo, Danzig, Rob Halford)should have made an appearances as well.  On the difficulty front GH/MET plays so smoothly and reliably that Hard for seasoned players is almost too easy, especially when compared to ONE on GH III.  Expert mode is the insane finger workout it should be, and is equally daunting on bass(with its challenging extra note) and the skins.  Speaking of which repeats of ONE and SANDMAN(RB) are fine but no FOUR HORSEMEN, that hurts the most of all.  The vocals also feel a bit on the tough side maybe just because almost every song is easier to score when crooning instead of metal growling (which feels natural but scores ROUGH)once you get accustomed though med to hard/exp is an easier shift than previous games.  As awesome as the bass, guitar, and mic feel - the drums are the star of the show, pounding out the beats to Metallicas crushing classics is unparalled in the rhythm gaming genre, too bad I can't bang it out with the dual pedal but maybe someday.  The the on/off option for the touch slider solos is also most welcome as is the on/off for tilt star power.  The unockables are also the best yet in a GH game, including the new guitar effects in studio.  Difficulty is just right and the song selection is SUPERB however more guest appearances by metalists in game and flexible GH song sharing would have sent this one into the stratosphere as it is you will be left desperately wanting more.  Four and 1/2 stars rounded to five for the sheer satisfaction of having Metallica Karaoke in the house, not to mention one sick GH game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00009WNZA","reviewerName":"K. Ostrowski \"bra1n1ac\"","summary":"A little too SIMilar.","reviewText":"People love the sims.  Their unique blend of easygoing lifestyle, need-fulfillment gameplay and incoherent babble makes them an instant hit as playable characters, and the fact that the characters must do all the things normal people must do in order to survive is easily the best of the game's features and one that should be incorporated into (in my opinion) just about every other game that wants to be taken seriously.The Sims was a game with a vast number of wonderful things to build, buy, jobs to get, points to earn, rewards to find and skills to obtain.  It and its umteen-million expansions brought a vast database of home-neccesities to the pc, showing your sim's active home life and relationships with other sims (simulated people.)In this respect, the Sims 2 manages just about half of the content of the Sims one and its many add-ons.  It's a fun game for all simulated-life lovers.So now for the gripes.This game is much TOO similar to the original.  House-building, job-getting, skill-building and relationship-building are almost precisely identicle to what they were in Sims 1.  The biggest difference is that now, the Sims' facial features and the textures applied to the character models can be customized more easily in the Sims body shop, but I am still struck, as I was with the original, by the glaring room for improvement this game has.All full-grown sims are approximately the same height and weight within a few inches and about 35 pounds.  They're all more or less similar and easy to get along with.  They never have to worry about sending out multiple job applications before getting an interview, and although the game does give you some \"on-the-job choices,\" on occasion, you still don't get to see the sims at work.  As in the original, you once again always go to work by carpool, which they actually poke fun at later in the game.  I think the thing that bugged me most of all was how few options the gamer has when making a sim.  People have hailed \"body shop\" as \"a powerful tool for making your own sims,\" but really, it's no more powerful than a good paint job.  You still can't make a Sim with the height of Toguro or Garry Coleman or with the muscle structure of the Hulk and all sims everywhere are unfairly thin, even when the game tells you they aren't.  Humans come in many different types, personalities and shapes, not just in many different colors, as this game specializes in.  EA has the technology to confront this as well, but they're not using it.What I found really sad was that aside from the new camera interface, there was hardly a single thing in this new game that the original didn't have, and it lost many things the original had in the process.Now, maybe I'm missing something, or maybe Sims 2 will get some add-ons that will help to solve these issues, but this review is for this first installment, and in my mind, it doesn't deserve anything more than three out of five just because of how far it still has to go before actually becoming a people simulator.Think I want too much?  Think I'm being unreasonable?  Take a gander at Warcraft 3's World Editor.  Now, there was a game/level editor that allowed you to edit just about anything except the character shapes.  It had the power to create virtually any style of gameplay imaginable.  If you think my expectations for video games are too high, you can blame Blizzard for that.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2004"}

Randall","summary":"Slight, but fun","reviewText":"The veritable grab bag of Star Wars games currently available puts Star Wars and gaming fans at a bit of a disadvantage.  For every quality title created under the Star Wars brand name, there are two lackluster, or downright disappointing, titles.  For every wonderful \"Jedi Knight\" there is an unplayable \"Jedi Outcast\" and \"Masters of the Tera Kasi\".  For every scintillating \"Rogue Leader\" there is an atrocious \"Rebel Assault II\" and \"Phantom Menace\" (video game version).  Heck, even the sequel the unmatched \"Rogue Leader\" called \"Rebel Strike\" has garnered numerous disappointing reviews (I have yet to play it) for being merely a copy of its predecessor with a few additional, unsatisfying missions thrown in.  When one considers the high costs of these games, one can become very wary of investing in them.  Fortunately, that's why forums like the Amazon.com customer review sections are so valuable.  In this particular forum, it is my intention to give gamers an idea of the quality of a relatively recent game based on the second prequel, called \"The Clone Wars\".\"The Clone Wars\" is utterly devoid of the challenge and replay value of the wondrous \"Rogue Leader\".  Its graphics are run-of-the-mill; its storyline is thinner than a sheet of paper (Anakin Skywalker is on some vague quest to take on the sources of some dark energy); and there's just not a great of reason to play this once it's been defeated.  Those gripes aside, \"The Clone Wars\" is still an enormously entertaining game to play.  Even with its routine graphics, the game designers were able to develop a number of visual appealing worlds.  The varied style of the missions is also a plus.  Anakin can fight on foot, upon a beast of burden, or in the skies high about the ground.  Most of the missions aren't particularly challenging (with the exception of one taking place in an ancient mausoleum and the final battle), but that is of little consequence for this style of game.  \"The Clone Wars\" probably most closely resembles \"Starfighter\" in its overall structure (among the Star Wars titles).\"The Clone Wars\" is probably best appreciated if it has been purchased from a discount store.  It's too slight to satisfy fans who paid full price for it.  Still, it's a fun few hours of gaming.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2004"}

I just finished up with a somewhat disappointing Bioshock 2, and was looking for anything that wasn't a sequel to something I had played before.  In spite of the comments from other reviewers that it was like Fallout3 with some more action (I liked Fallout3, but it was my intro to the Fallout franchise) and my resolution not to play sequels, I picked this up at it's current bargain price.The artwork for outdoor settings is great.  Unlike anything else I've played.  Indoor settings don't match the outdoor slickness, and are mostly just OK.Warning: strategy discussion pro/con below may be considered minor spoiler, or more like walk-through material.The RPG aspect is OK.  I didn't start playthrough 2, instead chosing to start playthrough 1 again with a different character.  Definitely the different characters require different combat styles to be most effective.  Also the active skill trees are hard to predict which branch has most value to develop, and rebalancing skill points occassionally creates some interest and variety in combat style.The vehicles actually handle quite well, but there's a knack for it that took me a perhaps embarassing amount of time to figure out.

Because the throttle is on L joystick I had a hard time overcoming the normal PS3 move/turn on L, slide on R, kind of control scheme, to have L be just move, and R be turn.The other aspect that took a little to figure out was strategy for levelling up.  Be very selective about the order of the missions/bounties.  The difficulty rating is *relative* to your current level.  As you level up impossible ones become hard, hard ones become tough, tough becomes normal, and normal becomes trivial.  It's much easier to tackle the trivial/normal ones first to level up, until the hard ones drop in difficulty.  I discovered this only after my first multiple death experience going up against the same scenario.Enemies respawn more frequently than loot.You spend WAY WAY WAY too much time in the inventory screen.  Inventory is limited, all the guns are different, and there's a huge variety of shields and grenades, so it's non-trivial to manage having the best guns for different enemies, best grenades, etc.Saving at save points or manually via exit says \"saving all progress\" but not really.  You get to keep all your loot, but you go back to the beginning of the mission or sometimes a different close-by save station, and you have to re-fight some of the same battles again (seen enemies respawn comment).Some of the boss battles are tedious.  Bosses don't move very fast generally but take huge damage to kill (unless you've over-levelled) so you can spend minutes with fairly repetitive combat to get past them.Overall a fun game, and one you can easily spend hours without dying once you learn a few small tricks, and the artwork for the outdoor scenes really is great.  I might have to reconsider my \"no sequels\" rule in another 2 years when borderlands 2 is at bargain prices!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2011"}
{"product_name":"B007SRM5U6","reviewerName":"Tstops","summary":"Batman collects question marks","reviewText":"Arkham asylum was amazing ,so if you enjoyed that game You'll love this one. So lets get to it.Arkham city is just like the original game in terms of combat and control except its a lot bigger. Gliding and grappling through the city is really fun and combat is smooth and satisfying. I'm not even a batman fan. In fact I hate batman...a lot. I think he's one of the stupidest superheroes ever actually. But I know a good video game so I don't care, the arkham series are good games and I look foreword to playing arkham origins when it comes out.The controls are extremely heavy at first but you start to get the hang of it after a while.The graphics are awesome. Everything. Is so dark and cold you feel like batman that's for sure. Stalking enemies with a huge array of gadgets and attack takedowns you actually know whats it's like to be batman. Its assassins creed meets batman.But there's one major flaw in this game that kept taking me out of the action and story. Riddlers stupid freaking question mark trophies littered every freaking where. If you played the the first game you might be familiar with these collectables. I hated them in the first game and I hate them even more in this game.  I realize you don't have to collect these but some are easy to collect, some require a little problem solving, and some are in elaborate riddler challenge rooms, but if I see one I can't help but try to grab it. Now in the first game I was like \"screw these, I don't care I just want to enjoy the game and move along\" since in the first game you saw them less and they were a little harder to come by. Problem in the second game there's a million more of em and it was overwhelming me and pulling me right out of the game. I kept going \" oh there's one! There's one! Oohh up there! Down there!\" I kept telling myself to skip them but a lot of these trophies are as easy as walking up to them or swinging to them or clicking a switch. Others require more thinking and different gadgets.  I'm unable to quell my curiosity and I always try to obtain these stupid things. I don't know why they even have them in the game. There's already a bunch of side missions that force you to explore the city such as answering phones from a vicious killer Zaas and doing time trial runs, solving puzzles for riddler to save hostages, helping political prisoners from street thugs. And on top of that tons of in game challenges. Like glide for 100yards or do certain combat combos and certain times. There's plenty of content in this game we don't need 400 riddler trophies to collect that divert your attention at every corner. Every room I step through, I get distracted by these damn things. Just stick to the basics arkham! Collecting challenges need to be few and far I between, not every step of the way for gods sakes. Take red dead redemption for example. It had a treasure hunt challenge. You collect maps and study its picture and explore the country side where the treasure is, that is a collection challenge. Or imagine your in a hallway with a bunch of doors. At the end of the hall there's a smoking hit woman (or guy) that really really wants you bad. You make your way toward her and someone steps in front of you and throws a 100 dollar bill in one of the hallway doors. You go in the door and there's 100 dollar bill randomly place everywhere. You collect them all and go \"phew, now where we're we\", you make your way back towards her and that same person pops out of another door waving more cash in your face and this continues until you cover every last door in the hallway. Sure that sounds like fun but after the 100th door your just going to want to go straight to the girl and come back to the doors later but you can't.  Lol my point is the riddle trophies are pointless busy work that need to be toned down from 400 to 20. I know I'm going on and on about it but these things, but it ruined the game for me to the point of turning it off because I just couldn't get into the plot or actual gameplay. Which cost the game a lot of points and a much lower score. 7 out of 10. Which is still a good score. This is a really good game. I recommend to anyone looking looking for a solid well made game and if your a fan of batman, you have to own it. I just hope in Arkahm Origins they take it easy on the riddler trophies or just get rid of them in general and stick to real game challenges.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2013"}

The end result is the most open-ended RPG possible--one with an infinite number of possible paths through the game.","reviewerName":"Jobe","summary":"Endless Adventure","reviewText":"For anyone who's ever thought about a combination of two great games, into one greater I always had an idea as of recently. Take the sheer massiveness and incredibly detailed world of Shenmue, use its complete sense of freedom of going into any building and examining just about anything and everything in sight, sprinkle in the vigilante factor of Grand Theft Auto 3, with the ability to kill and maim at will, and what'd you end up with? Well it certainly wouldn't be Elder Scrolls, but what you'd see here in Morrowind is the next closest thing of freedom in gaming history.In the medieval land of Morrowind you are nothing more than a lowly prisoner captured and released into the world as a freeman after a journey across the sea. And after those first steps outside the sea-ports door the world is at your fingertips. Live the life of a noble dispatching thieves and bandits and serving the empire. Or be a thief, murder shop keepers and civilians at will steal items from their home and sell them off to afford more weapons and armour. With the possible exception of Grand Theft Auto 3 and Shenmue, I've never played a game this free before.Being able to venture off on your own without following the storyline and diving into hundreds of side-quest and finding hidden caves and bandit camps is Morrowind's biggest strength. Within the first 15 minutes of my game I had already found a cave of bandits, freed their slaves, and swam into a lake finding the remains of a skeleton at the bottom where I found a sword and gold pieces next to his body.Your character is chosen from ten classes of races, from Dark Elves, Wood Elves, Orc's and humans. The faces, hair, and sex can be altered, though shallow does make for a nice variety in at least making your character seem somewhat customized to your liking, once chosen you also are given the ability to generate, choose or even create a class/profession. This ranges from Warriors, Knights, Crusades, Thief, Mages and many others. Choosing a class gives players a certain abilities the others work without, Knights and Crusaders can wield heavy weapons from hammers to double-sided axes. While Thieves and Assassins can be deadly striking in stealth and small daggers.The entire game plays similar to Drakan: The Ancients Gates; your character can be viewed from 1st and 3rd person points of view. Along the empty dirt roads beasts and enemies will be encountered along the way, killing so many increases your characters attributes depending on what method is used, stealth, strength, magic, ect. Outside of towns you can camp to regain your health and pass time. The weather will constantly change from misted mornings, to rainy nights and even heavy thunderstorms with lightning crashing overhead. If you're not fond of travelling such vast distances on foot, hitch a ride on a mammoth insect-like creature to the next village, it costs money but takes no time to travel. Decisions, decisions.The Elder Scrolls series has been a phenomenal success on the PC, and after reading the features for Morrowind during my purchase I was sceptical as to the notion \"Go anywhere, do anything\" Gameplay. Of course it didn't take me long to realize, they meant it. Morrowind is a great RPG that no Xbox owner should be without. Not only is it massive and seemingly endless in its production but it's also a lot of fun. A must-have title.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2002"}

Fast forward to now and I figured I'd give the latest in the series a try.  The game seems to be a jumble of a bunch of mechanics and the story just doesn't seem very engaging.  There are lots of characters to interact with for sure, but there didn't seem to be much behind the surface.  It's almost like  they were shooting for a target they couldn't possibly hit by having a huge story with a lot of depth and deep engrossing characters.  Instead they have a big story that sometimes makes sense and a ton of shallow characters.If I had an investment in the series like some people do maybe I would have enjoyed it more.

{"product_name":"B000034DMG","reviewerName":"JackLiberty \"Steven Smith Jr.\"","summary":"The Best in the Series, Even Better than Resident Evil 4","reviewText":"The series of Resident Evil continues with its sequel Resident Evil 2 on PlayStation released in 1998 and developed by Capcom once again. It takes place in Raccoon City which is the closest residence of the mansion from the first game. This time, the entire city has been transformed into zombies from the outbreak of the T-virus created by Umbrella. You get to play as two characters: Leon S. Kennedy (disc one) who is a Raccoon City Police Officer on his first day of the job and Claire Redfield (disc two) who came into town to search for her missing brother Chris Redfield who was one of the main characters in the first Resident Evil game. Both characters get their own set of weapons and storylines, but it doesn&#8217;t matter what order you play them in.The gameplay features the same basic principles as the first game. You have to solve puzzles, use a limited supply of ammunition, herbs to heal wounds, carry only eight items, and use typewriters to save. It&#8217;s nice they stuck with the original format of the first game and I wish every Resident Evil game in the series was like this.You get some new weapons such as a bowgun, sub machine gun, spark gun and upgrades to Leon&#8217;s handgun, shotgun and magnum. The aiming feels more comfortable and you always seem to be in control of where you shoot. One downside is that auto aim isn&#8217;t set by default. When you start the game, you have to press &#8216;Select&#8217; to get to the options, select the controller settings and set the mode to &#8216;Type C&#8217; to turn the auto aim feature on. A nice new addition is that the character&#8217;s current health can be determined by their posture and movement speed. This makes it easier to tell what condition your player is in and you don&#8217;t have to go to the inventory screen to find out how much health you have like with the first game. The Item Boxes are back where you can store items you don&#8217;t need and pick up later, but a new item you can retrieve is the &#8216;Side Pack&#8217; which will allow you to carry two more items increasing your total to ten. Both Leon and Claire are joined by a support partner throughout the story. Leon is aided by a woman named Ada Wong who is searching for her boyfriend. Claire is aided by a 12 year old girl named Sherry who was told to go to the police station because of the dangers in Raccoon City. But even the police station is infested with zombies and bio weapons. The enemies in this game are really memorable; there are the lickers who are just terrifying and powerful, especially later in the game. Then there&#8217;s Mr. X who is like the Terminator, he always comes back to hunt you down.The most innovative feature in this game is that there are different scenarios in this game. Say you play as Leon and complete the game as him; well you can then play as Claire in that same scenario to find out the true ending. And you can&#8217;t play Claire&#8217;s second scenario by popping in the second disc for the first time to play as her, you have to unlock it first. So in total, there are four possible scenarios in this game.Another innovative feature is that you get a ranking based on the total amount of time it took to complete a scenario, the number of saves and healing items you use. If you do well, you can unlock some goodies such as infinite ammo for a sub machine gun, gatling gun, rocket launcher, unlock special outfits and three new mini games. The first mini game, you play as Hunk, whose mission is to escape the Raccoon City Police Department with the latest G-Virus created by Umbrella. The second mode is known as &#8220;Extreme Battle&#8221; in which you play through the entire map of the game and you have to locate four special bombs to destroy the T-Virus in Umbrella&#8217;s Lab before it can cause a lot of damage. You get to play as four characters: Leon, Claire, Ada and Claire&#8217;s brother Chris. Each has their own set of weapons and you can adjust a difficulty setting to fight stronger monsters including bosses from the regular game. The third and final game mode is called &#8220;Tofu&#8221; and it is the strangest mini game I have ever seen. You play as this giant block of Tofu (Yes, I am dead serious, a giant piece of Tofu) and in terms of the objective it&#8217;s the same as Hunk&#8217;s mission except you play as Tofu, who is only equipped with a combat knife, so it makes this mini game very difficult to complete. I&#8217;ve completed the mode as Hunk, but never as Tofu. The good news however is that Tofu takes a lot of hits to kill so basically the only way to complete this game is to run. Don&#8217;t even bother fighting the enemies, the knife in Resident Evil 2 is just extremely weak and isn&#8217;t worth the time. Still this mode is worth playing just for the amusement factor because Tofu says some funny Japanese phrases whenever he gets hurt. It&#8217;s funny, even though I can&#8217;t understand it. It is also pretty difficult to unlock, you have to get an A ranking at least six times to play this mini game. For the Extreme Battle and Hunk, you only need two A rankings.One thing I didn&#8217;t mention yet is that the music is really awesome. It has orchestral themes and even opera themes and it fits the game very well. There were many different versions of this game. There was an updated version on PlayStation called Resident Evil 2: Dual Shock Edition which is the same as the regular game except it supports the PlayStation&#8217;s DualShock controller&#8217;s analog stick and vibration function. The Extreme Battle Mode I mentioned is exclusive only to the Dual Shock Edition. There&#8217;s also a &#8220;Rookie&#8221; mode which gives the player a Machine Gun with infinite ammo at the start of the game, but you can&#8217;t unlock the other mini games playing this difficulty even if you get an A ranking, you have to play Normal mode to unlock them. Another cool thing about the Dual Shock Version is you can use a cheat code to give yourself unlimited ammo. You just go to the control settings, hold R1 and press square repeatedly until the icon turns red. This version was later released on the PlayStation Store as a PS One Classic on the PlayStation 3.There were also ports on the PC and Dreamcast with slightly better graphics, higher frame rate and an art gallery. There was even a port on the Game com. It was a s***ty 2D black and white handheld console by Tiger. That port is just pathetic; I&#8217;m not even going to discuss it. The best port however is the Nintendo 64 version. The sound on the Nintendo 64 version is better than the PlayStation&#8217;s version, it has updated graphics, new costumes, a setting to adjust the violence and blood color, a more responsive aiming control scheme, new files, cheat codes to give you infinite health and ammo and the most interesting feature of all is a randomizer to place items differently during each playthrough so it definitely has more variety. The only thing it&#8217;s missing is the Extreme Battle mini game. But this port is equally as good as the PlayStation&#8217;s version.Any criticisms I have with this game? Well it&#8217;s hard for me to think of things I don&#8217;t like about this game, I guess a minor criticism is that you can&#8217;t skip the in game cut scenes, you couldn&#8217;t do that in the first game and it&#8217;s a minor annoyance when you already played the game a million times like I did and just want to get through the game. The problem most people have with this game is the beginning. You start the game surrounded by about ten zombies with a slow handgun. The first time playing, you only have a few seconds to figure out the controls until the zombie&#8217;s corner and kill you. It definitely sounds like a terrible idea to start next to the zombies. My strategy is to just run away. Hold square, press up on the d-pad to run and use up-left and up-right to get around the enemies. Once you figure that out, it isn&#8217;t too hard to get past the zombies and give yourself some breathing room. It did take me a while to figure out the controls but I&#8217;ve mastered it and you can too. The voice acting in this game is much better than the first Resident Evil, but still nothing too special. That&#8217;s about all the criticisms I can think of.When I was a kid, I used to play the s*** out of this game and in my opinion; this is undeniably not only the best Resident Evil game, but the best survival horror game and one of the best PlayStation games I have ever played. This game still manages to be very scary, if you&#8217;re playing this for the first time, you are guaranteed to be so scared; your heart will burst out your chest. Trust me; I had my jumps even to this day. It&#8217;s more fun playing this game alone in your room in the dark, with the volume turned up. This makes for a terrifying and memorable experience. I absolutely love this game, it&#8217;s just a masterpiece. I&#8217;d recommend getting the version from the PlayStation Store to play on the PS3 for only $6, or the regular PlayStation version or the Nintendo 64 version. Those are the best options. The replay value is very high for me and I could play this game at any time. You will admire this game and it&#8217;s by far the best in the entire series.FINAL RATING: 10 OUT OF 10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2014"}

The first trailer showed some rather intriguing cinematics, and a return to 2D exploration reminiscent of Super Metroid (arguably the best game in the Metroid series).  Then we learned that developer Project M (a joint venture between Nintendo and Tecmo's Team Ninja) had planned from the outset that this game would only be played with the Wii remote held sideways.  The point was to return to a simpler control scheme that resembled the old NES controller.  This is when people became dubious, and rightly so.  The result is surprisingly sketchy, unpolished and erratic.  Sad to say, Metroid: Other M is a huge disappointment.Let's start with the controls.  Like I said, Samus is controlled by holding the Wii remote sideways.  You move her through a 3D plane with the D-pad, jump with the 2 button and fire with the 1 button.  Pressing A will cause Samus to assume her morph ball form, in which case the 1 button lays bombs.  To shoot missiles and use the grappling beam, you must point the Wii remote at the screen, which causes the game to shift to a first-person perspective similar to the Metroid Prime series.  Only in this game, Samus cannot move while in this mode.  While in regular third-person mode, the game utilizes an auto-aim mechanic.  You have no control where your shot will go, as it'll be aimed towards the closest enemy.  Normally, this works rather well.  When running through a corridor, you can simply keep running straight ahead while tapping the 1 button and get very satisfying results.  However, when the auto-aim is REALLY necessary is during boss fights, and in this case it's far too unreliable.  This is especially true during the last two major boss battles in the game.  During those times I was really tempted to just quit.  Going to first person mode is very fluid, except again, during major boss fights.  During these frantic moments, you have to find time to point the remote at the screen, find the weak spot, charge up and fire.  But since Samus can't move, this becomes an exercise in frustration on some fights.  And while the transition from third-person to first-person is smooth, you still have to find your reticle.  Using the d-pad to move Samus around works okay, but it's far from efficient.  You'll find your fingers start to get sore pretty soon, right before your whole hand cramps up.  The Wii remote is not a comfortable controller to hold sideways in a frantic and fast-paced game like this.  This makes me wonder why they bothered with this control scheme at all.  The point was to make this Metroid easier and simpler for non-gamers to pick up.  But aside from the control scheme, the game is anything but.  This is still a hardcore experience, and your casual gamer will NEVER last through it...so why not just add analog control??  The way it is, the game feels rushed and unfinished.For the first time in the series, Samus has a real voice.  And here is something that I personally like...it is very nice to actually see this iconic character in this light.  She's still the strong bounty hunter we've all come to know, but she also has insecurities just like a normal human being.  It's good to see that, and I hope that Nintendo continues to give their characters a true personality (I'm looking at you, Link).  The story in Other M is very good.  At times, the monologues border on melodramatic, but it's not terrible.  The story moves rather quickly and is very interesting with a few plot twists here and there.  As a direct sequel to Super Metroid, this is awesome.  The only weak point in the game is the character of Adam Malkovich, whom Samus idolizes as a father figure.  He is the source of her strong feelings and self-doubts.  Unfortunately he has the personality of a brick wall.  The character is horribly constructed and you wonder why Samus feels so much for him.Probably the most absurd aspect of this game is the method in which Samus regains her weapons and abilities.  In past Metroid games, she somehow loses them physically and must recover them throughout the adventure.  In this game, Samus keeps all her powers throughout, but chooses not to use them until Adam gives her authorization.  While the end result is the same as the other Metroid games (that you only gain abilities at certain points in the game), it's difficult to believe that Samus would willingly take damage by adventuring through a volcano without her heat-resistant Varia suit.  Plus Adam's timing in authorizing said weapons is ridiculous.  Most of the time, they're authorized mid-boss battle.  Other times, during normal exploration, you'll come across an obstacle that requires an unauthorized ability, and you have no choice but to go back.  Except when you get back, your ability is suddenly authorized so then you have to backtrack!  It makes no sense whatsoever, and it ruins the integrity of the game.The game will run you roughly 10-12 hours if you want to strive for 100% (all item locations are conveniently displayed on your map).  Once you reach the game's fake ending (there's a whole extra mission after the credits roll), a nice theater mode is unlocked that allows you to watch all the cutscenes in order with pre-recorded gameplay thrown in to bridge the gaps.  This is rather cool, as the story is the very best part of this game.  But once you beat the game, there's little reason to go back.  The game lacks the fun of Super Metroid, and it lacks the polish of Metroid Prime.  Graphically, it's sub-par, even for a Wii game.  The cutscenes are nicely rendered, but so compressed the video quality turns out blurry.  The sound is weak due to the Wii's lack of surround sound processing, though it just screams for a nice 5.1 digital surround mix.All in all, a decent game that is saved by the story, but killed by the horrendous gameplay.  Metroid fans will still want to pick this up, but anyone new to the series would do well to play one of the better entries first.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2010"}

Rich, Parents' Choice&#174; 2000--FromParents' Choice&#174;","reviewerName":"ajnrules \"ajnrules\"","summary":"Best Tennis Game Ever","reviewText":"Mario Tennis certainly ranks up there with Virtua Tennis and Top Spin as the best tennis games of all time. With that said, let us take a look at what exactly makes this game so great. Well, with any sports games, the factor we have to take into account when analyzing its quality is its gameplay. Specifically, we want to know how well it emulates the sport. At first glance, Mario Tennis would not seem like a good tennis simulator. The controls are simplistic, and the characters are, well, Mario. Yet Camelot, who made Mario Golf, manages to put one over us. Despite the fact that you can perfect the controls in minutes, the game is deep. Ball physics are exceptional, and the type of court actually has an impact on the physics. Each player has his, her, or its own distinct feel. Movement in Mario Tennis feels more fluid than the more \"realistic\" tennis games, and this opens up the possibility for the development of strategy in your style. One complaint in the actual gameplay aspect of the game is the camera, but this is a flaw that plagues all tennis games. The court is split in halves, and one player/pair gets the bottom half and the camera behind them. This is infinitely better than being on the top half and having the camera facing them. It is possible to keep the camera behind you in single-player mode, but it can be a bother in multiplayer modes.Like Mario Golf, Mario Tennis is chock full of various modes of play relating to tennis. I feel that the best one is the exhibition play, since that is the one best suited for multiplayer. It's just tennis, plain and simple. You can play a short game (1 set, 1 game) or a standard game (5 sets, first to 6 games). The latter length can get pretty tedious, especially if opponents are well matched. The Bowser match, however, feels underdeveloped. The items were supposed to be the key aspect of the Bowser match, but the rocking of the court seems to have a greater effect. The ring mode is better than ring mode in Mario Golf, since it is easier to aim, but there aren't that much incentives to play this mode. As far as single player mode, Piranha Challenge is super-cheap. Tournament mode, on the other hand, rocks. The game's standard 3 modes are okay. They range from extremely easy to challenging. However, definitely try to beat all three cups with everybody to open up the Star Tournament. Although the matches can get quite epic in length, these are definitely worth playing.Okay. If you thought that you could get past this review without seeing a comparison with Mario Power Tennis...sorry to disappoint you. Many sport games can be separated into two forms: a more realistic sim-style game, or a less realistic arcade-style game. With improved battle modes and the flashy Power Shots, Mario Power Tennis is definitely more of an arcade-style game. So it all boils down to which type you prefer. MPT is just too insane for me. However, the graphics are definitely nicer than the somewhat blocky graphics in Mario Tennis for the N64.Although limited, the voice samples are pretty good. The sound effects are well done, as each type of hit produces a different noise. The music is nice, generally falling under the easy-listening category. As far as replay value goes, even though multiplayer is fun, there gets to be a point (for some people) where it just gets old. Even so, Mario Tennis is still one of the best tennis games out there.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2004"}

Mario Tennis is a perfected version of classic video game tennis featuring a Mario all-star cast. Play as everyone from Mario to Bowser to Donkey Kong Jr., and also Waluigi and Daisy, who were introduced/re-introduced with this game. You get the rules of real-life tennis, smattered with some power-up moves, and lots of tournaments and modes to compete in. It's the gameplay that's the real kicker; by yourself you'll have a reasonably good time unlocking stuff, but with four players in a doubles tournament it becomes absolute madness. Controls are tight, and the gameplay allows both experienced gamers and newcomers onto the court.Nintendo may have eventually over-milked the 'Mario sports' sub-genre, but the Nintendo 64 version of Mario Tennis is a solid investment. Still worth picking up if you want a fun sports game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2007"}

It is just a recap of the past with a bodyframe over the same greezy old scateboard chassis motor. My girlie friend's Nordstrom spiked boots over her greezy pimpled feet are the analogy here. The fact that it is NOT compatible with Game boy LS is reason enought to beleive that Nintendo is a cash duller and milker of it's sucker-fied customers.  Yeah, game color and the classic one is understandable, they are old, but LS??? c'mon people!  No reason for it NOT to be the LS AND SP version of Star Wars and WingCommander V is superior to the SP version. Play the bass/gitar pick, fret,or slap all one mono-el-mono to me and Geddy Lee.  It's not the face plate it's the screen that matters to true gamers, dude.  The reason to get a screen cover is for consolation and(protection of the screen) not the MAIN reason to buy if you have a SP or LS already. Jeez!

{"product_name":"B002MED6EO","description":"Midnight Club: Hits PS3","reviewerName":"Jared Burdick \"JBurd\"","summary":"Midnight Club at it's best","reviewText":"I've owned several versions of of Midnight Club. The game has always had the same idea: open world, various race types that have you moving from point to point to earn cars, reputation and money. The graphics are okay, not great, but the cars look good and that's the most important thing. The soundtrack is amazing. Here are some additional pro's & con's.Pro's:Rockstar - the style in anything they touch is amazing. The soundtrack, environment and characters are fun and interesting.Handling - All of the cars feel good and rarely do you feel like you lost becuase the controls were not responsive or too twitchy.Cars - There are a wide variety of cars that require a lot of time and work to unlock. They are highly customizable and it's fun moving up through the ranks to faster and faster cars.Con's:Framerate - there are times where it dips, and there are times when it stops. That is why I gave it 4 stars. Occasionally I've thought my PS3 froze, after a few seconds, the game starts again. I've never seen this before on any game that I own or any game my PS3. Unfortunately, when you're going 175mph and you just stop and start, you will crash.Rubberband AI - Although it's nice to know you're never truley out of a race, it can be maddening to see a competitor spin out behind you at the beginning of the race only to blow by you at the end when you've driven flawessly. MC probably has the best rubber band AI I've seen implemented. You can put some space between yourself and your competitors and if you race really badly, you will lose, BUT, there are times when you should win, only to lose on a fender bender with the finish line in sight.City Map - when not racing, the map is awesome. It's easy to navigate and locate challenges or missions. During races, it's terrible. And so much the maps, but the lack of checkpoints on the map for most races. Memorizing L.A. is part of getting good at the game, but as you progress and the AI gets tougher and tougher, you have to pause and make sure you don't miss a turn or shortcut, becuase the AI most certainly won't. In future games, I hope Rockstar adds more race markers so you can focus on the game in front of you and not the map.All in all, this is the best version of Midnight Club yet, and at the reduced price, there is really no reason to pass if you are a fan of arcade racers.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0053B5RGI","description":"The Next Evolution in Pokemon comes to Nintendo 3DS.","reviewerName":"K. Geddings","summary":"One of the must have games for the 3DS and any pokemon fan","reviewText":"I gotta say i dont have that many games for the 3DS but this is one that is well worth the money.  Sure it has some issues, there may not be as much post game content as previous games, there is no printed updated pokedex yet, and you have to wait till decemeber 27th to transfer any older pokemon to the game...but I find this one of the best games out there for the 3DS, i think the graphics are nice balance between the old  games and new...the pokemon do not look quite as good as in the pokedex 3D app, but they retain a cartoonish style that works well.  The scenery and locations seem to have such a nice feel and animations during battle really make the game more fun.The frustrations of previous games also are a bit less as the exp share really helps to feel less of a grind.  If you compare the graphics between even pokemon black white 2 and this game you can see a major difference, things feel more vibrent and detailed while retaining that old school charm.  Someone complained why arnt the graphics more realistic? why do they still use a tile based map system? well i think that is part of the games charm. Pokemon as a core feels more like an old school RPG with extra twists and i think for those who are older who remember games like final fantasy and RPGs on the super nintendo and older games..  it brings back good memories of games like that.  It shows that you don't have to have a game that looks like crysis to be enjoyable...and the graphics are just the right style to make the game very fun.One aspect i didnt get too much into in the past was trading,  the GTS sytem in previous games becomes a bit useless when the \"market\" is flooded with requests for pokemon you cant give aside from cheating..the addition of Wonder trade makes it so that anyone can trade without worrying about the hassle.  Its kinda a fun mini game in iteslf, because you really do not know what you will get. sure you may get low level pokemon but try it more and you may get some good stuff too!  its fun because you have no way to know what you will get and you can keep using it as many times as you want (i find one tip is to simply keep retrading the same pokemon you got from it in the first place if you keep getting ones you dont want..that way you wont even up with a ton of pokemon you do not want)I think this is a fun game for kids and adults and the nice thing about it is while you have all the fuss of violent games like call of duty and GTA5 this game will make you smile and is fun for any age group.  If you are a parent you should consider buying one for yourslf and then getting one for your kid that way you can play together.. and if your an adult who wants this but afraid what others might think? who cares!  if you have a 3ds you really should get this game in my opinion :-)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2013"}
