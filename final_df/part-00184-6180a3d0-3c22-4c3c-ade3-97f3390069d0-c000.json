Shafer","summary":"Complete garbage, do not play this game","reviewText":"After beating Tales of Symphonia (ToS) atleast 5 times back on the GC, I was exciting to see the newest game in the franchise to arrive on the 360, however it turned out to be one of the worst games that I have ever playedThe story starts out with poor 21 year-old named Yuri who lives in the lower quarter of the capital of the empire and one day, someone steals a blue rock (known as blastia which is the pinnicle of technology and a way of life for people) and takes off with it, however due to removing it, it causes all of the water to go everywhere and flood the lower quarter.  Yuri decides to go after said thief with his ragtag team that meets along the way which include his dog, a princess, a 12 year old orphan, a perverted old spy, and a half naked spear weilding elf dragoon.The main problem with this game is the lack of story, because quite frankly, there is none.  You spend 1/3 of the game trying to recover the afermentioned rock, and then the story changes drastically another 3-4 times that follows the same pattern (something major happens, everyone leaves for a while, everyone meets back up, etc.)  And the ending is one of the worst, most complete garbage excuses for a game that I have ever seen.On your first playthrough, it'll take you roughly 40+ hours to complete, which is not including the various sidequests that you can come across, assuming that you even find them.  Like most Tales games, its infamous to completely miss a side quest, simply by advacing the story, only so that you can never do said side quest again which would more than likely give you an item that would greatly help.  This game even has a new feature to the series which are called \"secret missions\" which as the name implies, is something secret that you have to accomplish during a boss battle.  In retrospect the idea sounds very good, however, it isnt.  There are about 30 that you can complete and while optional, you wont get anything for completing every single one, unless your going for  100% completiong which would take another 2-3 playthroughs.  Youll know if you completed a secret mission if the word \"Great!\" appears, afterwhich you only need to finish the battle and out of every single one, there are maybe 2 that help, 1 of which is nearly impossible to do while the other is obsolutely esstianly in winning the battle, while also at the same time very difficult to do.The only reason this game receives a 2 out of a 5 is because the Tales series has a unique battle system of being in real time, however, not much has changed within 3 years.  Back on ToS, you moved on the same plane as the enemy did and moved back and forth as you saw fit and attacked them.  In Vesperia, its the same exact thing, only this time you have the ability to walk around anywhere you want.  Sound like a good idea?  Well it isnt, more than half the time if even attempt to do so, the enemy almost always outruns you and nearly kills you, thus rendering this new feature pointless, which brings up another issue about the game, the AI.To put it mildly, the AI is just terrible.  There were countless times when I told my healer and mage to sit in the back and cast magic the entire time like their supposed to for every other RPG ever made, however, even after telling them countless times to do something, there was a 75% chance of them ignoring me and deciding to rush the enemy and fling their weapons wildly untill they died in a matter of a few minutes.  Bosses werent any different either.  You will find yourself constantly going through the same dungeon 7+ times just to level up because your too weak to kill the boss who litterally cheats.  Every other battle followed the same pattern:  the boss comboed everyone, usually you and your healer and/or mage to the point where when you finally got a chance to attack, someone was litterally about to die and so much and shoving them caused them to die.  Most of the attacks they did stunned you and would somehow manage to reach across to the other side of the arena, which is something they usually did for your casters because so much as slapping them across the face caused them to fall down and stop casting.  By the time that you acctually start doing good, they boss usually used their overlimit move (which anyone, even common enemies can use) which causes said person to make a blash of energy that sent everyone flying in all directions and when you hit them, they didnt flinch at all and could attack you as many times as they wanted without needing to take a break, which in the end brought you down to near death.  Most of the bosses even had \"nuke\" abilities where they would do something so powerful that it killed more than half of your party, while the other half was about to die and more than likely stunned and laying on the ground with more than 2 status effects, usually giving the fight to the boss and causing you to throw the controller across the room.  Most people will just say \"Dont get hit then.\"  but thats the problem, you cant avoid anything by bosses, even if you attempt to guard, they would break it in about 3-4 hits and then proceed to whail on you.On a final note, the graphics arent that great either, the honestly dont look any different than they did back on the GC and only really have some improvements with a few extra movements of a persons body, and it has more animed cut scenes, but hardly.  If your looking to play the Tales series, than completely skip this one and go play ToS on the GC because that game was a masterpeice.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Hill \"CFH\"","summary":"Good Game For Me - Recommended","reviewText":"\"L.A. Noire\" is a very involved investigation style game that will be best enjoyed by players that have patience to let the story develop and like solving mysteries. While there are a few \"action\" elements where there are shootouts and fistfights, these are somewhat cumbersomely implemented and difficult to master.The real value of the game is in the in-depth look into to 1940's L.A., complete with an amazingly detailed city to explore. As \"Phelps\", you begin the game as a regular officer and work your way up to detective by solving cases. The investigative process involves looking for clues and interrogating suspects, which is often harder to get right than it should be. The suspects you encounter include a wide range of normal street criminals, \"Hollywood types\", and normal citizens, all right out of your favorite pulp fiction crime novels.The interface is mostly intuitive when looking for clues or for normal actions but, as noted above, the action bits are harder. One of the best parts of the game is learning to drive on the streets of L.A., this could be it's own game (reminds me ofCrazy Taxiin some ways). The amount of carnage you can inflict on the town is just amazing and the comments are sometimes laugh out loud funny.This is a great game for a casual gamer like me, but those that like more actions will likely not appreciate the slower pace.Recommended!CFH","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2012"}

My son loves it. I don't care for it but it's not exactly my type of game so I won't knock it for that. The graphics look good. It offers a great deal of open play instead of a linear path. The beginning has been a bit confusing and we are still not sure what the whole animus sequence is about although from reading up on the game I gather it is key to the other games in the series. Whatever it is, it is long and tedious and it would be nice if it was able to be skipped through.

Smail \"Smailien\"","summary":"Great game, greatly limited by it's technology.","reviewText":"The game itself is pretty solid.  It has the feel of DOOM 3 when you're doing missions, and a pretty decent adventure feel outside of mission areas.  It is basically completely linear though, so if you are looking for an expansive adventure this probably isn't for you.  Don't expect Fallout.The graphics are great, when they aren't getting jacked up.  And there lies the problem, I don't know if the problem lies with video drivers or is really an Id Tech 5 engine screw up, but it seems that this game wasn't tested at all on PC because the graphics are very screwy.The texture popping is very prominent, the only things that are fully rendered are those that you are looking at, an area is never fully represented so any time you turn your head, there will be a texture pop.  Fairly often (about once a minute) a wild shape will jut into the screen, which is sometimes bright enough to make you physically uncomfortable.The vehicle portion of this game has been given WAY too much credit by it's makers.  The buggies handle pretty awfully, and nothing like a real buggy, or any kind of car.  Vehicle combat is something you will quickly realize is no more than an annoying gimmick.  Enemies have insane maneuvering abilities and can annoy the hell out of you.The sound is one thing I have really had a problem with.  This is the one game I own that has messed up sound placement.  I have fully updated drivers but I still have problems.  The big thing is that an enemy thirty feet away from you and to your far right can sound like it is directly in front of you, inches away.  In a game where sneaking has its benefits, this really ruins the experience.If they fix the tech problems, I'll give this game a 4 or 5, but until then I can't do better than a 3.  It deserves some praise, and I wish the raging 1-star reviewers could look past the errors to give the game a proper representation.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2011"}

And now that it is out I'm glad that I waited. So here is my review:Pros:the graphics are great for a PS3 and sound quality is awsome.the vast amount of weapons and being able to create different loadouts with different affects is something that I like a alot.the combo system is great and ease of use of that system is better then DMC.special abilities is something that has not been done before and looks great.and just the overall ease of being able to pick it up and play without a steap learning curve is great and not having to remember long combo strings is refreshing to have in a game.and there is a practice mode in between stages and that is a good touch.Cons:the load time is a bit annoying but it doesn't take a way from the overall game.voice acting is a bit over the top making it cheesy at timesbeing able to activate \"witch time\" is a pain sometime. especially when you are trying to aviod an enemy attack that you see coming.And that about sums up what this game is about. The cons that are in the game really didn't bother me that much and were over looked cause compared to the Devil May Cry series this one is on par if not better which is saying alot cause that series brought a new light to action adventure and this game really shows what could have been done better with that series. But I want to make some side notes about it that I think that will help most people when they see certain content in the game. It has alot of underlining JPOP (japanese pop culture) in it and alot of english reference it in as well (meaning british not US). So some of the jokes that are in the game are lost to the american fanbase that are not fimilar with these particular cultures. Not that anyone needs to know this but i think that this why the game has gotten some low reviews cause to hear certain things and have no idea what it means or why its in the game seems confusing especially when it comes to the dialog of the game. And that at times can hurt a game when fans don't get the punchline or the culture that is centered around it. But that doesn't take away from this action packed game either. Get it cause it was worth the wait and one more thing ITS NOT FOR KIDS UNDER 13. The sexual over tone in this game is a bit much but its done right. Again it was worth the wait.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2010"}

You are a gun for hire and it is one of your jobs that gets you in the mess that you find yourself in. Looks like you should have checked references on the last job you took, but now you get to come back with a vengeance and show everyone you're no one to be mess with.Graphically this looks like a very good game. the projector effect, however, will leave you slightly motion sick after a while. You don't to get to see too much of it unless you're about to die and then its as if the movie is about to come of the reel. The added commercials for the concession stand were an interesting touch to the game, but had me rolling my eyes about halfway through. What I want to know was there someone on the development team who had a screw loose and decided to go old school with frozen pickles and such? You will notice that apparently all the enemies that stand in your way have all the same parents, that's the only way I can think of why everyone is basically a clone of one another.The music was a fun surprise, a punk alt-rock type of vibe kept me from wanting to turn down the volume. The voice acting was impressive by names alone, sure some of the sections were very muffled, and thankfully there was sub-titles so you actual could figure out what was being said.The controls were pretty crisp for the most part, the d-pad to change weapons, right trigger to shoot, x for your sword, A to jump, and B to slide. Utilizing these buttons will basically see you through the game.This was an interesting game, I wish there was a bit more to it, or perhaps that there was going to be a sequel to it. There were a lot of good things about this game, especially the main character, a very good looking chick whose skills could put anyone down. The combat sections got very repetitive short into the game. You're going to find yourself, at least once a level, having to close these spawn doors, and defeat all the enemies. You'll also have sections called Rage Mode, which is where everything goes a kind of Sin City color mode and your main mission is to rack up back to back to back kills until there's no one left standing. To be honest this game kind of felt a little Kill Bill-esque. It really did fit that mold, but like I said there wasn't very much variety in combat.You'll start the game off with your pistols and a sword, and as the game progresses you'll all of a sudden have a flash back to remind yourself that you're actually holding more weapons, and upon completing an obstacle course you can use that weapon in the next section. You'll find that you have mini-guns, shotguns, and crossbows. You'll get plenty of time to use those weapons when you jump in the air, slide, or do a wall run, shooting while doing one of those activities will slow down the game and will allow you to mow through your opponent.Though I found this game a bit short, and repetitive I was still glued to my seat to get through it to know what happens. So I have to give this game a 7.3 out of 10.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000B2YR74","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"Hard to believe it is a game!","reviewText":"There was nothing new much in the Half-Life game engine which was essentially just a modern hack of the Quake game engine, so how could a game that based itself on software that others developed succeed in becoming the biggest selling game of all time? When Half-Life first came out it did a couple of things right that most other first person shooters failed to do... (1)Story,(2)Story and (3)Story. Valve created Half-Life in a period of our lives when Area 51 was a hot topic among UFO buffs and the X-Files was to become mainstream family television viewing. Alien based entertainment media was a craze in the mid and late 1990's, unprecedented since the 1950s. Smack in the middle of what could be considered the most influential era for UFO enthusiasts came HALF-LIFE where YOU get to play as Gordon Freeman, a physics researcher who witnesses a freak accident in an Area 51 type facility. All hell breaks loose and YOU have to survive. No cut scenes. No initial story. No explanation. You where just there and you had to escape. Cue interactive characters that could follow you around and say a few things, maps rich in objects that you could break eventually leading up to rapid action shootouts with monsters and marines.The GOOD NEWS is that Half-Life 2 is another world beyond HL1 and is like nothing you have ever played before! This IS the first person shooter 'Game of games', hands down, period. As a stand alone game, HL2 is 100% pure adrenaline, no holds barred, from start to finish. If you own an Xbox then own HL2 because your world will never be the same again. Half-Life 2 WILL destroy lives, educations and marriages and......IT IS NOT A GAME! ... or at least that is the net result. This thing is real. Forget \"Doom 3\", \"FarCry\" or any of the best pixel pushers out there - HL2 just mashes `em into the ground and then sets off an amazing fireworks display to welcome you back. How many games within the first two levels have you literally calling friends, family and neighbours to have a look at it? You must LIVE this game.Nowhere else will you see anything as amazing as City 17. The game starts right where the previous one left off, as you are dumped into this futuristic eastern European city like something out of Orwell's 1984 following a brief meeting with the GMAN, learning that citizens are slowly going missing from City 17 you must meet up with old friends - scientists from the first game including security guard Barney. As soon as your teleporter goes wonky you are landed right in on the action with soldiers storming apartments looking for you. On the run you manage to land a hovercraft and go on to tear through flood channels ramping over obstacles while seeing full scale battlecrafts flying overhead... and when you hit them, bits break off and explode... slowly... so you give `em more heat... and more bits break off... and then they crash and burn with a roaaaaarrr! The gem of the game though is when you play with DOG and learn a neat trick with a new weapon called the Gravity gun. Not to spoil the fun but let a few disc saws whirl and watch what happens to the bad guys or even throw a petrol canister into a group of zombies and hear them scream. The animation is hyper-realistic and your fps will match your heartbeat. This is THE REAL DEAL.The characters all have their own unique personality and walk, talk and act differently. The cut scenes all look great and are done in 1st person as you walk around the event. Like its predecessor, each level is designed with plenty of tasks to do, puzzles to solve and bad guys to mow down. There is also team play in this one like in HL1 but is more organized with much more firepower. Join the resistance in City 17 and win the war! If you have a thing for 1984, conspiracy theory or the New World Order, then HL2 has it all! HL2 also borrows HUGELY from other games and films you have seen, but that just makes it all the better because it seems somewhat familiar, yet ABSOLUTELY NEW.The bottom line is that it is, hands down, the best 1st person shooter you can find.Pros:- It does not feel like a game. It feels real.- Totally immersion in a film-like environment.- Truly massive maps with PLENTY to do.- Action, action, action, non-stop.- Lots and lots of variation in the gameplay.- GRAVITY GUN!- A real interesting futuristic story- The best 1st person shooter (maybe game) ever.Cons:- Single Player Only, No Multiplayer!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2005"}

I ordered it from Amazon Prime for overnight on Friday (1.99) and it came by noon on Friday.I have now played it over 20 hours and am blown away by the system.  I did not even buy a game, yet spent hours playing some of the literally 99 demos they offer of full 360 games (such as Bioshock and Madden 08).  Plus I played many other demos for the games in Live Arcade (every arcade game has a demo).  I loved Geometry Wars and bought it for 5 bucks. I also downloaded a HD version of 300 (4.50) and an episode of Star Trek (2.00).  I have never had so much fun with a system before without even buying a game.As for the system, it works perfectly and the fan makes virtually no sound.

Its marketing department gave Two Worlds really good hype and made it sound as if it was going to be equally good or even better than Oblivion. The sad fact is that Two Worlds is basically a broken game.Though it is open world and the map is much larger than any rpg currently available for the 360 console, the game has tons of pop up visuals, animation hiccups, framerate issues, and glitches that will cause your character to get stuck to invisable objects. The sound effect, and voice acting have a timing issue, some sound effect come with a delay, other times voice acting from the characters start too early. The quest system is broken down as well. The animation hiccups and constant loading are very annoying and detract from the fantasy.A new patch was recently released that was supposed to fix a lot of the glitches in Two Worlds, but the fixes were so minor that they barely made a dent on major problems the game has. And I'll tell you this. No amount of patch fixes will ever correct the game's: stupid story, boring side quest, terrible voice-acting, cheap sound effects and idiotic artificial intelligence. Save your money because Two Worlds is not even worth a rental...let alone a purchase. The video game retail stores that I buy my games from all tell me the same story; lots of customers are returning their copies of Two Worlds because it is so buggy and lame. The stores actually have a bunch of unsold new and used copies of Two Worlds and that has got to tell you something.Pros:+open world gameplay+lots of items and weaponsCons:-trashy graphics-cheap sound effects-cheap animations-terrible menu system-terrible voice-acting-game still crashes-terrible A.I.-very buggy-bad framerate-lousy controls-dumb story","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2008"}

Working in the proximity of the palace, Leonard stumbles on a plot to kidnap the enigmatic Princess Cisna. As he helps her escape he also becomes aware of his connection to a transformative power which allows him to take on the ancient shape, and harness the devastating power of the White Knight. Yet there are other elements at work here as well, including the forces of an evil wizard with powers that stretch back to the same ancient times which produced the White Knight. With the help of his friends and the power of the White Knight, these are the forces that Leonard will have to face in his quests.GameplayWhite Knight Chroniclesis a Japanese RPG (JRPG) centered around a turn-based battle system in a local single player story-driven campaign that is supported by online multiplayer functionality. Gameplay questing occurs from a third-person perspective and follows Leonard and up to three other AI companions, which can include the customizable character that players assume in multiplayer mode. Once quest members are assembled, players utilize the strengths of the overall group as a whole, and are able to switch between characters at will. Combat being turn-based, players must be able to cue up and control the actions of each character in quick sequence for each combat scenario faced. The game facilitates this via the Function Palette, located in its Battle Preparation menu, allowing players to prepare in advance a series of commands for each character to carry out. These can involve magic or weapons use and can be merged into combos. Multiple palettes can be saved, making it possible to optimize actions for specific types of enemies, and making for quick changing of commands. As with any RPG, throughout quests players accumulate experience which allows their character to level up, purchase items and abilities and generally grow stronger with an eye towards besting the increasingly challenging creatures, bosses and situations faced.Online MultiplayerAlong with a compelling single player campaign,White Knight Chroniclesalso contains an exciting online multiplayer component. Within this, up to four players can engage in more than 50 multiplayer quests, with each player creating their own unique customizable character which can be leveled up in a combined group effort, and take advantage of created items and new skills. Although unique to the online game mode, which is designed for multiplayer action, these quests can also be played alone if players wish. In addition to this functionality available in the online multiplayer mode also includes a variety of ways to interact with the widerWhite Knight Chroniclescommunity on the PlayStation 3 platform. Included in this is town building through the Georama functionality, which allows players to construct a town to their own specifications that can be populated offline with characters from throughout the single player campaign and then taken online where it serves as a base for quests hosted by players, as well as a persistent online location that other players can visit and buy items your town's population has for sale. The game also offers an online interface known as GeoNet that allows players to communicate with others via blogs, forums, quest logs and voice chat functionality, as well as post snapshots from their journeys using the Crystal Camera in-game tool.Key Game FeaturesWhite Knight Transformation- During single player combat players can transform into the giant White Knight, gaining the ability to challenge large enemies as well as troops of soldiers throughout the adventure.The Customizable Avatar Character- Using a wide array of sliders and customization options, players are able to create a unique character that can join the adventure in single player mode as well as online.Combo Battle System- Engage in an accessible, active turn-based battle system that caters to players of all levels allowing both default attack settings and a system for for maximum damage.JRPG (Japanese RPG) Action for PS3- Experience true JRPG action on PS3 that incorporates a variety of online gameplay elements.Beautiful Environments- Players traverse through 13 stages, as well as visit up to six towns/villages to visit and purchase items at shops or interact with NPCs.

It has a modern warfare feel to it, which I like.What I don't like is the &#34;Spawning&#34;. It notorious for spawning you right around the corner from a moving enemy who then might kill you most likely considering they didn't just spawn and are expecting to be able to run in a safe zone, cause you would expect to be spawned in a safer area and not next to an enemy, right.. ? WRONG.Call of Duty Multiplayer has yet to fix the spawn issue just like the last 3 CoDs. The multiplayer maps as well are way to big than the average CoD maps you are use to. This is a whole different kind of Call of Duty where the maps are Battlefield size and the Camping is made very easy. There are way to many houses, rooms, and windows etc. that are all to easy to camp and only 1 entry point which is the way the camper is facing you. Pretty hard to even stand a chance against a solid camping, grenade proof room in CoD.I can't really explain the camping, you need to see it for yourself by playing it. So please, REDBOX this game before you do. I love 1st person shooters, but this game is unacceptable and the campaign is so dull.The Campaign, oh gosh. Lets see, theres a map where you are underwater, and shooting underwater fighting, yes yes yes. Sharks are included in the game, I don't know why. Then theres a mission where you are in space. This part really has no character related to anything you are doing on &#34;Earth&#34; instead of space. You're just activating some laser, then you get transferred to another mission of something else going on. It's really a dull, not well-written campaign. It really isn't fun. The campaign though ,I didn't play Bo2 cause I hated that multiplayer.Thankfully, multiplayer on CoD Ghosts is fun, somewhat, but its really frustrating to play when you are spawn killed not just once, but twice or more consecutive times in one game. How does one play yet one have a good score if they are being spawned in enemy territory ? It makes no sense, but you know what thats cool. Activision, Treyarch, whoever it may be, Infinity Ward. Doesn't matter.Call of Duty has been run out dry with modern war Ideas, just as the world has grown tired of World War II video games. I know there isn't much to go off of because we want to make war games with countries, not war games with the USA fighting Al-Qaeda and their corrupt religious ideals.Seriously though, this game is dull online and offline.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2013"}

So with that out of the way it's easy to see why I like this controller as it's basically the 360 and even has offset concave sticks.Other reviewers have noted this so there's no surprise there, but I have xbox controllers from third parties that, whilst they look the same and have the same layout, they don't *feel* the same and have proven to be detrimental to my COD and BF3 stats hugely.Happy to report that the sc-1 really does feel and act like the 360 and performs excellently. It's a rugged thing of beauty (if red and black is your thing) and the battery lasts about the same as the 360 controller does on full charge. You will lose a USB slot to get it to work but other than that I see no reason for someone who has a preference of the 360 design to not take to this immediately.It's also very well priced in my opinion.

{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"{HB}SharkMan","summary":"Highly Addictive game, one of the best rpg's ever","reviewText":"I played this game from a recommendation from my friend, who was addicted to it at the time. i got played it, and i love it i definately can say it was well worth the 8 dollars i payed for it from amazon marketplace. i probably would have paid full price if i knew it would run on my machine. ran great i even had AA at 2x on my p3 866 w/ geforce 4 ti4200, and 768mb of ram. who would've thought.

{"product_name":"B008PQU3E4","description":"","reviewerName":"E. Luna \"FPS Connoisseur\"","summary":"Great Collection","reviewText":"Back in 2004, Killzone was originally released. Unfortunately, Killzone had been over hyped by the gaming media to an almost ridiculous point. This was supposed to be Sony's answer to Halo. Some had even dubbed it the \"Halo killer.\" It was no surprise that the game failed to live up to the expectations that had been set for it. I bought this game day one at my local Gamestop, and I fell in love with it. It was buggy, and wonky. There was no jump button, and the story was not exactly the stuff of legends. But there was something about it that kept me coming back time and time again. I played through the campaign probably 3 or 4 times. Then I moved on to the PS3 in 2008, and I left behind Killzone for a while. I played through the superb 2nd game, and the fantastic 3rd game. Every time I played through a new Killzone game, I wanted to be able to play Killzone. I had long since given my PS2 to my parents, and they used it as a DVD player exclusively. I waited, and I waited. Last year they announced that there was a planned release of Killzone via the PSN as a PlayStation 2 classic title, and I was overjoyed. Then it was unceremoniously delayed. Then, Sony announced that HD port of Killzone, and this trilogy pack. It's a fantastic set, to be sure. For the price you get 3 complete games, plus all the DLC for KZ 2 and 3. All this for 40 bucks is steal. But, how is the HD transfer for Killzone?First off, while it is on the disc, you must first install the ENTIRE game onto your PS3 before you can play it. While the file remains on your PS3, you cannot play it without the disc. So technically, it's not really on the disc. It's on your PS3, and the disc is merely the key to access your content. Now, the game is still a buggy mess at times. But damn it, is it fun. The graphics definitely look dated, and the game play is stiff compared to todays FPS. The cutscenes are not remastered, and quite frankly, they look like crap. To my surprise, there are still a few hiccups when there are to many enemies on the screen, but nothing too alarming. One thing that they did absolutely correct is the fact that you can COMPLETELY customize the controller layout. It's fantastic. So, my impressions so far is that Killzone is exactly what I remember it to be. A game that manages to entertain despite many misgivings. It will definitely be fun to replay those later missions as all the different characters.I was kind of tempted to say that this was a cash in, but look at the package. It's three complete games, plus DLC for 40 bucks. If anything, I felt like I ripped somebody off.Recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00006FWTW","description":"Oh no! It looks like your granddad was right--things really were better in the old days. At least they were if you liked 2-D platform games, andYoshi&#x92;s Islandis indisputably one of the best ever made.Yoshi&#x92;s Islandgoes back in time to recount the touching story of the various Yoshis' attempts to unite Baby Mario with his parents. You don&#x92;t actually control the Italian plumber-to-be but instead his dinosaur pal, who has the curious ability to eat his enemies and then immediately turn them into eggs, which he can then fling at more enemies.Since Yoshi isn&#x92;t particularly fast and can float in midair for a few seconds after making a jump, the whole dynamics of the normal Mario gameplay have changed, but the same incredible attention to detail and endless imagination that mark all of Nintendo&#x92;s best efforts are still here in full effect. In fact they&#x92;re joined this time, after the rather plain-looking prequel, by some wonderful pastel-shaded graphics that were jaw-dropping when the game was originally released in 1995 and still manage to impress now.As with the otherSuper Mario Advancetitles, this game also contains a four-player version of the originalMario Bros.arcade game, making it even more of a bargain than it already was.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"M. Scott","summary":"One of the Best","reviewText":"Yoshi's Island is up there with the best of the best when it comes to Mario style platformers. It has beautiful graphics sprite graphics, great sound effects, simple yet effect controls, and crisp, fluid gameplay. With the possible exception of Super Mario World, it is my favorite Mario platformer.While the story is not really the focus of the game, it is there and is different than most mario games. You play as yoshi who is minding his own business when a baby gets dropped on his back. As it turns out this is mario and he's been separated from his brother Luigi and you need to go on an adventure to reunite them.Your main attack is eating/squashing enemies but you also can throw eggs. Gameplay never gets stale and while it starts easy, some levels can be pretty damn challenging.A special note about the music. Its catchy and atmospheric and keep in mind that is an old 2D sprite game. The music is pretty lo-fi but its so well written that you dont even notice. It has seriously some of the best music in any nintendo game. Once again, not a statement said lightly as nintendo games have arguably the best music in any video games.All in all, I highly reccomend this game. I say, if you've never played it, and you like this kind of game, buy it before it becomes impossible to find!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2013"}

I caught up the game really fast and already bought a DLC for multiplayer. Even though there are 3 classes, i only use the Scout. THe other classes do not seem as entertaining even though i tried to make it fun. I didnt care about the guns because it did not make too much of a difference. The game may seem bad in this review, but it is not. The game has extremely good body movements and some very cool gadgets. Single player was not all bad because when you play stealth, it gets real exciting.

{"product_name":"B000TT4GBG","reviewerName":"Mr. Bey","summary":"Quite Possibly the Greatest Party Game Ever Made","reviewText":"This Christmas season many people and parents are thinking about whether or not to buy Rock Band or Guitar Hero 3. I bought Guitar Hero 3 when it came out but the truth is I only bought Guitar Hero 3 so I could have the extra guitar controller. Guitar Hero 3 is a fun game but if you're a parent who's looking to decide which one to buy there's really no competition. Rock Band may be $170 but it's been many years since I felt that I got this much value out of one game. Rock Ban's replay ability downright massacres Guitar Hero 3's. Rock Band may be a lot of money but I think you'll win parent of the year award if you buy this game.Harmonix, the original Guitar Hero creators have once again revolutionized the way we play video games with Rock Band. Rock Band's main game play is meant to be its multiplayer where four people create their own characters in a band and travel to various places around the world playing gigs and earning fans and money. A new feature introduced in Rock Band is that you are penalized in the game for failing or restarting a song during world tour. As you gain fans you gain people like sound technicians who in reality do nothing but look cool in the game. The world tour should supply you with many hours of game play even more if you aren't using the same four people as your band mates.The solo career is basically the same thing as Guitar Hero's except it should give you a lot of much needed extra practice with drums, vocals, and guitar if you need it. I found the guitar parts to be much easier than Guitar Hero's but at the same time more enjoyable because hard and expert are not all about pushing the same two buttons over and over again as fast as you can. It's quite fun. I'm a bassist so I was disappointed about the lack of bass career mode but the bass lines can be rather boring so I don't exactly blame them. The drum parts are very hard at first but you should get the hang out it. Singing is a different story, I still haven't mastered it. Despite what people might tell you, Rock Band's single player is just as fun as Guitar Hero and gives you more stuff to do.Rock Band fixed some of the annoying things about Guitar Hero. Rock Band shows you how many stars you have earned and how close you are to the next one while you are playing so you get a sense of where you need to improve. However I felt that the Rock Band guitar was not as good as the Guitar Hero 3 wireless guitar. The set list is great but contained fewer songs than Guitar Hero, but there are more downloadable songs and Harmonix have announced more for the future. I was very impressed with the selection of songs the game had, every genre is represented in the game.Guitar Hero is a great game but Rock Band has taken Guitar Hero's basis and built so much more on top of it. Rock Band so far has destroyed every party game I've ever played and this game is the must have game of the year. I would still buy Guitar Hero 3 for the controller, but if you're only going to buy one Rock Band is the one for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2007"}
{"product_name":"B0029MAXS6","reviewerName":"Slyohazard","summary":"X-Marks the spot!!","reviewText":"Microsoft's little engine that could, was at first met with cynics such as myself.I actually referred to it as the all American discardware: Red as in RROD, White for white hot heat sinks which can lead to RROD. And Blue, for the early adopters 2005-2007 that \"Blew\" $$$ from buying accessories and peripherals i.e. wireless adapter, box live subscriptions and replacement consoles.But when it comes down to it, it's about the games stupid. What makes MS' stand out from it's competitors, is that the X360 has the strongest 3rd party support from publishers of exclusive titles such as HALO, Mass Effect, Left 4 Dead, Fable, etc.And although there are 3rd party games for both consoles, the 360 usually has the advantage when it comes to graphics and processing power. Just compare a game like say, Bayonetta between the PS3 nad 360 to see who comes out on top.What's great about the 360 is the option to rip game DVDs and play it from your hard drive.The bad news is that you better have atleast a 60gb HDD to get best results that and you still need the original disc in order to boot the game. As of now, the newest crop of 360 consoles have an improved chip that would less likely to overheat, and now you can get a yearly subscription for XBL Gold as low as $35.00 if you look hard enough.Although I could care less about the facebook and twitter features, it's an added bonus to one up it's competitors. (All they need now is youtube!!)I'm mostly stoked by the Netflix option. Although you need the gold subscription to play streamed movies, I found the interface far superior than the Netflix compatible Blu-ray players such as Samsung's pd-3600 with no lagging either.What also bumped this up a notch for me is the ability to not only play mp3 and divx videos, but it can be bookmarked. (Meaning if you turn the console off during the middle of the movie/file, you can continue where you left off once you reboot the console.) Other players lack that feature. Hopefully there will be a Matroska firmware update in the near future.Overall, I am very satifsfied with my 360 consoles as it's tailored for the hardcore gamer audience without too many bells and whistles.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2010"}

The story itself has a good amount of humor so far. The characters use cuss words, but not as crudely as in other games - still not a game for kids.The controls take a bit of getting used to, but the in-game tutorial is very effective.Anyway, if you are tired of whacking enemy soldiers, aliens, monsters and zombies, \"Binary Domain\" is a nice change of pace.***Addendum - Just finished the single player campaign, took several days - overall, it was pretty fun - it DID have a lot of cutscenes to flesh out the story, and the gameplay seemed a bit unbalanced at times (back to back \"boss\" challenges). If you finish the campaign, the individual chapters (and their episodes) unlock, but you still have to perform the challenges in certain episodes. Was hoping for an arcade style unlock.

Left 4 Dead 2 does a nice job of expanding on the original while keeping the core gameplay that made it so much fun.  This game playes like a first-person shooter (FPS) that emphasizes grouping and teamwork.  Even if you're playing the single-player 'campaign', it really has the feel of a multiplayer map with bot allies.  There are character archetypes you choose from to play, and each has slight differences but most of the gameplay is still down to your own level of skill.If there's one thing I really like about Left 4 Dead it's that someone like me who is fairly poor at most console shooters (but a whiz on the PC) can still easily get hold of the interface and play well.  One thing I like least is that there are times when you will get overwhelmed simply because you weren't aware of what was ahead--and a different decision next time or going a slightly differet way through the map becomes the difference between life and death.  It's hard to complain about this though, because truly that's what the whole \"undead horror\" genre is all about.Left 4 Dead 2 gives you multiple types of undead:  these aren't just your shambling slow-moving horrors but instead we're talking about some zombies rushing at you trying to pin you to the wall, others 'spitting' acid/venom at you, and still other types (\"Boomers\") that run up to you and explode.  The box art should make it clear to you that this game is rated 'M' for a reason:  the gore is vivid and there is more splatter here than a Gallagher concert in fast-forward.  John Carpenter and George Romero would be impressed.  Like all good horror stories, there's humor woven throughout:  characters crack jokes to ease the tension, and there are many objects in the world you can use creatively if you run out of ammo (or just feel like going nuts):  baseball bats, chainsaws (of course!) and even frying pans can be picked up and used on the living dead (called 'the Infected' here).The developers have also come up with what they call 'AI Director 2.0'.  This intelligent subsystem creates 'procedurally generated' (read, 'dynamic') changes to the map as you play.  Pathways are slightly different on one playthrough than they are on another, and the difficulty of the game seems to adjust itself to your level of skill, so you don't get too overwhelmed but neither are you quickly bored.  Instead you're continually kept on your toes, because at times it seems like nothing is permanent.  I'd read an article with the creators about how much easier the new engine made it for them to populate the environment with hundreds of bodies, all without crushing performance, and it shows:  at times you feel like you're charging through masses.If you like survival horror and you also enjoy fast action, Left 4 Dead 2 is an excellent choice.  I find aiming and combat easier on the console than other shooters I have tried, and I found myself really falling into the storyline, getting immersed in the chaos and at times startled out of my wits.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2011"}

You're moving away from home but you don't have a place to stay so you come under the wing of Tom Nook, who runs the store you happen to move too.

It's a colorful game, especially when you have the varying seasons but don't expect nothing \"holy crap!\" like on here.Sound/Music: The characters speak what myself and others most likely call \"Animalese\", it's gibberish but it sounds like the text they're speaking. The laughs have that chipmunk quality and the songs are funny(especially if you connect a Gameboy Advance and travel to the island). The music itself is ok, nothing buy worthy like a Final Fantasy, Zelda or Lunar soundtrack but it fits oddly.Gameplay: This is where the game gets addicting. You have fishing contests, errands, furniture, fossil collecting, fruit planting and many other things.

{"product_name":"B00000J9J9","description":"One of the best things about the Game Boy Color is that it's  basically an original Nintendo Entertainment System that can fit in  your pocket. What this means for gamers is that many of the great games  for the classic system are being ported to the Game Boy Color, giving  us a chance to re-play (or in some cases discover) the best game titles  from the '80s.Nintendo's ownSuper Mario Bros. Deluxeis among the first of  these conversions, and it certainly remains one of the best. Actually,  calling this game a conversion really doesn't do it justice. This  version actually contains more levels than the original game, including  the entire Japanese version and a slew of extras (such as a two-player  mode).The controls in this game are easy to grasp--even for novice gamers.  All Mario can do is jump (and shoot fireballs with the right power- ups), but it is amazing to see how much gameplay can be squeezed from  these simple actions when the controls work in direct harmony with a  player's thoughts. The only element of this game that could have been  better is that the Game Boy Color's screen isn't quite large enough to  show the entire layout of the original game screen, so players may  occasionally need to press up and down on the control pad to see some  offscreen action. While this can be distracting, it ultimately has  minimal impact on gameplay. If you are looking for the quintessential  side-scrolling platform game, you can't do much better thanSuper  Mario Bros. Deluxe.--T.

When the NES was released in 1985, the game that shipped with the system was the instant classic Super Mario Bros. And what better way to kick off the first year of the Game Boy Color's life than with a true Mario game? The Game Boy Color game Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is a pixel-by-pixel translation of the original NES game, with a ton of added features. And because the original Super Mario Bros. still holds up extremely well after all these years, Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is an absolutely fantastic game that borders on perfection ? perfection in Game Boy standards, of course. There are many different modes in the game, but the main game is the 1985 classic Super Mario Bros. 32 levels of platform-hopping gameplay where you must go through the world, jumping on enemies and collecting coins, making your way to the next castle before time runs out. Collect 100 coins and you've earned a secret life. Make sure you jump on...aww, skip it. You've played this game before. What you haven't played are the new modes injected in the Game Boy Color version. The Vs. Mode requires two Game Boy Colors and a link-cable, but this game is a whole lot of fun. It's a race to the flag pole between Mario and Luigi, and you'll try to screw each other up by hitting triggers that will put blocks up in the way. Very cool use of the original Super Mario Bros. engine, and worth the purchase of another cartridge just for this feature alone. Super Mario Bros. Deluxe also has a Challenge Mode, where you'll have to find five red coins and a Yoshi egg, as well as beat the level's preset score to finish the level completely. This is pretty darn difficult, hope you have a lot of patience. When I say pixel-perfect, I mean it. Even though the Game Boy Color screen has less resolution than a standard television, the developers have translated the same pixel count for every object in the game, from Mario to the koopas, turtles, even the question-mark blocks. Granted, this reduces the screen visibility somewhat, but the developers have added user-controlled screen-scrolling to the mix. If you want to see above or below where you're standing, it's all a matter of pushing up or down on the pad. All 32 levels, from 1-1 to 8-4 are patterned after the levels in the NES classic. Nothing's changed. Well, that's not exactly true, you can now save your game in progress, something you could not do in the original. It also remembers which levels you've completed, and unlocks secrets based on how many you've finished. So it's not always a good thing to find the warp zones so early in the game. Secrets? That's right. As you complete certain tasks in the game, you open up little hidden trinkets. Things like a Photo Album where you can print out earned pictures on your Game Boy Printer, or a Toy Box where you can make messages and print them out. Oh, and just because they could, the developers stuck in a fortune teller (just think \"Mario Magic 8 Ball\") and a calendar option where you can enter important dates and save them to a cartridge. Do they need to be in there? Of course not. But they're cool additions nontheless. Super Mario Bros. remains one of my top 10 favorite games of all-time, even though it's almost a decade and a half old. Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is such a perfect translation, it makes me wonder if it's easy to port NES games to the Game Boy Advance. Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is the Game Boy Color-specific game to own, hands down, and will be the title that, hopefully, will key a revolution of porting NES games to the handheld system. Buy this game. Now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2004"}

And at least for the first day they are having good time with it.Nothing here to hold an adult's interest for very long.  No killer app in the box.And at the end of the day  you're not going to be using this to control your 360 interface.  Too slow, not reliable enough and/or not integrated deep enough into 360 interface yet.The variety of games here is lacking.  There are 5 games, but a few play very similar to each other.  Blocking holes with your hands or legs in 20,000 Leaks is pretty much the same game as punching balls with your hands or legs in Rally Ball.  Jumping, shifting right/left and waving your arms is pretty much the gameplay of both River Rush and Reflex Ridge.I find the games highly forgettable and mediocre/generic.  WiiSports didn't get enough credit for being a really fun game.  This is truly a slapped together tech demo compared to WiiSports.  EVerything screams \"hey we can do motion capture!\"  The game part is secondary.For kids though?  It's held their attention much more than mine today.  Maybe because they have more energy?  You move alot in these games.  CAn relate more to these fantasy-type games?  Or maybe because it takes pictures of them and lets them record their voice, body and lip movement and apply them to cartoon characters?  They laughed hard at that.WE'll see how long that lasts.Maybe another game shows the tech off better?  Not sure I want to blow another $50 to see what's behind door #2.Don't get me wrong.

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"Ashern \"Hmmm\"","summary":"Finally, a Final Fantasy.","reviewText":"Honestly, this is the first game on PS3 that I could actually spend 60+ hours playing, and STILL want to keep it up!I decided it was high time I wrote a review about this game, because it just doesn't make sense to me how people can say this is a bad game, or worst game in the series - don't get it. While I understand where they are coming from, they also have to understand that not all games can be the same. Of course, when a new series-based game comes out, you're looking for it to be the same - yet better than the previous one. It can't be that way all the time.Personally, I love this game, I can't say it's my favorite Final Fantasy, because it truly isn't.But in no way will I say this game is terrible and disgraces the Final Fantasy name - because it doesn't.I don't compare games to each other, because really, it's not fair at all. To me, it feels like you're not appreciating the game itself, rather just saying it's better or worse than it's predecessor. I look at what the game, personally, has to offer. Not what it didn't have that others did.But anyways, I'll start with the story.*STORY*The story in whole is interesting, yet boring at times that come quite too often. But I'm not the type of gamer that will put a game down because it's boring, I give the game time to recoup or regain my interest, which it did. Even though it is boring some times, it does still remain it's interesting plot. The story is told in a nice way, although confusing sometimes, I guess until you get to the end. I like how the game has movie scenes every so often, because I like a good story, and not many games have such in depth story lines anymore, so I personally liked it.I never felt like I was actually IN the game, but it was amusing watching the cut scenes, and I really liked the characters relationship with one another, and how they talked to each other, and all that. It made me feel happy, for some reason, that they all were getting along or having fun - or something. But to me, the story is pretty much the same as always, but it is told in an interesting way, and I liked it very much - especially the ending.*CHARACTERS*Ok, so the characters themselves are pretty nice. They all have nice personalities and such. It's 6 playable characters, Lightning, Snow, Sazh, Vanille, Hope, and Fang. And a non-playable character, that the story pretty much revolves around, Serah. My favorite character is Sazh, and then probably Hope and Vanille. Now I read that Lightning's character was modeled after Cloud Strife, from FFVII, I didn't know that at first, but it really wasn't done well at all. What I mean by this is, even though Cloud was the silent type, he still had a lot of dialogue in the game (or at least I THINK he did) even if it was '...'. But Lightning on the other hand, it's not necessarily her character, but it's the way they implement her into the game; She's supposed to be the main character, but has little less than 20% of the dialogue in the whole game.She talks, of course, when spoken to; but they hardly speak to her within the whole game. While I don't personally have a problem with it, it is a bit weird seeing as the character Fang (who comes in way too far in the story) makes for a better main character than Lightning, and she comes into the game halfway through! But like I said, I don't personally care, I just find it strange.People say that the character Vanille is way too cheery and annoying, while I could agree, I don't find her THAT cheery or annoying.To me, she's just a Selphie or a Rikku; she has her ups and her downs, and her ups are usually fronts - you'll understand all soon enough. But personally I never found fault with her, or any of the characters really.*Gameplay*This is basically what has this game thrown overboard. But wait, it's not because the gameplay IS bad, it's because reviewers and critics have MADE it bad. Saying that it has super linear gameplay, as if it's some monstrous, demonic, SESAME STREET CHARACTER.I can say, that the game doesn't have big open areas that branch out into different areas at every which way, but so?If you look at other games such as FFX, it's no different at all. There was only one way down Mih'hen Highroad, and only one way up Mt.Gagazet. What's the problem? Well, there isn't one really. The only things that this game doesn't have, (though I'm not comparing),are towns in which you can go to shop or take quests or whatever.You can shop, of course, but I'll get to that later. So there is no Balamb, no Luca, it's just field, basically.While there are towns in the game, they aren't the same as other games, they put you into towns but there's really only 1 way to go, and there aren't any merchants or no shopping district or anything, it's strictly storyline when they put you into a town.But I don't have a problem with it, because it's just the way the game is made. (Even though it's not like I don't have problems with ANY game because it's just the way it's made.)People say the game 'Opens up' at Chapter 11, and in the end-game area, what this means is - without ruining the story - that at chapter 11, you go from Cocoon to Gran Pulse (Cocoon is a world floating in the sky, visible from Gran Pulse as like a moon, and Gran Pulse is the giant, wild-life-filled outer world. And so at chapter 11, you go to Gran Pulse, and the areas there are open, even though it's not THAT many different places you can go to, for me, it's still enough. And at the end of the game (Chapter 13) there are portals in which you can revisit 2 places: Gran Pulse and another place within Cocoon. Even though the game only pretty much has Story and Hunt quests, it's not like the game is empty, I still have fun farming for money/CP (exp equivalent), probably because this is the first console game where I actually had to farm! But anyways, I still find it fun hunting all the monsters, I think it's about 64 or 63 marks in total, but when you start getting to around 40-50, it's when you really start having to farm and get a little stronger. So it's cool.*Battle*In a way, Battle has been changed in this game. I say in a way because its's still ATB, like FFX-2, but it's different.Now how it is, is you play only with the party leader, and the other 2 characters are played by the AI. Don't worry, they are played pretty well, even though they can only use Abilities, not Techniques or Items, so you end up having to use potions to help them after so long. But anyways, your character has an 'ATB Gauge', you start the game off with 2 bars. 1 skill uses about 1 bar, but more advanced skills may use 2, or 3. At times in the story, you gain an ATB gauge, the max you get from completing the story is 5; but their ultimate weapon gives you 1 more, so a total of 6. But it's costly/hard to get an ultimate weapon, so you'll have 5 for a good majority of the time.The battle pretty much becomes battle when you have to switch Paradigms. Paradigms are like templates of Roles, a Role is like Medic, or Commando, or Sentinel, or whatever. There are 6 roles in total. Anyways, a Paradigm is when you choose what roles the 3 characters in your party will use. Example: A Paradigm that consists of Commando, Ravager, Ravager can be switched to in battle. You can set up to a total of 6 Paradigms, but can always change them/delete them in the main menu (when out of battle).The battle isn't won by attacking or using a spell though, a key to winning is to fill an enemies Chain Gauge, and stagger it.A Chain Gauge is this: Enemies have a bar, 'Chain Gauge', and every time you attack the enemy, the gauge fills. Ravager's build the chain gauge fast, as it's a passive ability they have. But the chain gauge will decrease as fast as it increased if only a Ravager is attacking. Commando's can slower the time it decreases by attacking the same enemy as the ravager. Saboteur's can do the same as a Commando and Ravager, but it's a lot less potent. They can't build a chain gauge alone, but they can slower it a little bit - a lot less than Commandos, but still, a little bit. And when you get the gauge filled, the enemy becomes Staggered. When their staggered, they can basically be destroyed, their defenses are lowered, and most of the time, they become susceptible most status ailments.Overall, it makes the battle much easier. But this really makes for a fun, challenging battle, and ALWAYS. You never really get a feeling that you're overpowered against other monsters, because really, if given a chance, they would scrape you - and hard. But if you go about it right, everything will be fine.*CHRYSTARIUM*A Chrystarium is the name of the thing where you develop skills. Some say it's like a Sphere grid, I guess it's like that, but just a bit worse. Anyways, you unlock the ability to actually change roles at Chapter 3 of the story, and it did make the game much more fun.Each character starts off with their main role, and throughout the story they unlock about 2 more. You can only choose from all the roles halfway throughout the game, meaning that Sazh only has 3 roles until the middle of the game, in which all 6 roles are unlocked.It's ok I guess, even though I kind of wanted them to follow different role paths, but it's fine. What I really dislike is that not all characters can learn the same skills. Each character basically has a main Role, so if you max Sazh as a Ravager, he has a few of all elemental skills, but his main ones are like Firaga and some other aga, and if you maxed Snow as a ravager, he'd have Blizzaga and some other aga as his main ravager skills. This is really annoying because you can't develop a super ownage character, and it basically forces you to use certain characters in certain battles, because they all have something the other one doesn't.Especially when you have your favorite character, and you can't even use them that much because they really aren't much of an asset to the team. Even though it's ok for the most part, I still would have liked to have that 'I AM ALL POWERFUL' feeling.The Chrystarium has 10 levels, which are all unlocked throughout the story. Every time the Chrystarium levels up, you can learn more skills. You unlock level 10 after you beat the game. (When you beat the game, it asks you to save, then when you reload that save, you'll be before the boss battle in terms of story, but after the boss battle in terms of points gained and stuff. Then you just run and go through a portal to start the farming and side-quests.*MISCELLANEOUS*The game features Eidolons (Aeons/GF's); each character has 1, and they can only be used by the party leader. So the AI won't use them, only the person who's Party Leader is able to use it (because it's a Technique, and AI can't use Techniques).Sadly, even though their summons, they aren't strong at all. You'd be lucky if you can kill the easiest mobs with the Eidolon's \"limit break\". Really. Very lucky. Really, though, they make a good asset to battle because, when summoned, your 2 AI partners disappear, and it's just you and the Eidolon in battle. The reason they make a good asset is because 1) they use Curaga when your HP is low, so the only times you can really die is when your taking major, quick damage. 2) when you die, they use Arise, which makes the Eidolon disappear, but revives you. 3) they have a mode called Gestalt mode, in which you basically can't get hurt because for some reason the enemies can't even target you, but anyways, your Eidolon turns into whatever kind of vehicle, you get on, then you have a selection of different skills you can use. For example, if you hold the left analog down, then press X, you'll do this move. Or if you hold the analog stick left or right, then press X, it'll do a different skill. And if you press Triangle, it does their ultimate move. Even though it is in no way an ultimate move - in terms of damage, it still looks nice.And most importantly of all, when your summon is de-summoned in any manner, you, and your party will be completely healed.One bad thing about summoning them is that if the enemy is staggered or has a chain gauge near full, using the Eidolon's ultimate attack will clear it, and what's left of the stagger on enemies. So you'll have to restart filling that gauge, which is bad if you're fighting a hard monster. But it's fine, I GUESS.  I'm just sure we all would have liked to see Eidolon's do 100x more damage.You can upgrade your weapons, and thankfully, all weapons can be upgraded to an ultimate weapon. How it works is, there are 3 tiers of weapons. 1, 2 and 3, the third is the ultimate weapon. It doesn't matter what weapon you start with, but each Ultimate weapon is different, depending on what weapon you start out with. If you start out with a weapon that greatly reduces max HP, but has stronger offensive power, and upgrade it to an ultimate weapon, then that weapon will do a lot of damage, but in turn, it will reduce your max HP by 70%. If you start out with a weapon that allows for faster chain building, then the ultimate weapon will come out with faster chain building. Even though you'd probably only be able to afford 1 catalyst needed to transform a Tier 2 weapon to a Tier 3, there still are various types of ultimate weapons, even though they retain the same look and name no matter what weapon you start with, the effects all differ.Gil. Gil is hard to come by unless you farm it. If you beat the game without doing THAT many side quests, then you could easily have about a total of 500,000 gil left. Maybe less, depending on whether or not you buy materials to upgrade weapons. The only way to get gil on here is to farm certain enemies. Which you can easily do once you get to the portal section of the end game area. You can farm one enemy, which is tougher than a fat baby (no offense) or just go a simple route, getting a nice amount of money each run (about 80k), and it doesn't last that long. But anyways, it's no deal breaker, it makes it worth farming though, which is a nice difference in games.You don't actually gain the ability to 'switch your party/party leader' until like halfway through the game, which is kind of annoying, because you might want to play with Sazh or Snow at some points, but they automatically force you to use so and so.It's ok I guess, but even more so in the beginning of the game I wanted to play with certain people.I easily spent 70 hours on this game, and plan to spend quite a few more hours. It's actually fun trying to see how I should go about this next battle, or what I should upgrade.*OVERALL*In total, I give this game a 4, because it just messed up on a few things, like not being able for all characters to have at least MOST of the same skills, etc. Even though it can easily be given a 5, I just can't. As far as people saying 'YOU'VE BROUGHT DISGRACE TO THIS FAMILY'S NAME' goes, they can shut it all up. Never through the game did I say, wow, this game ruined Final Fantasy for me.Whoever says that never was really connected to the series anyway, just wants to say something. Of course we all have our personal opinions, and you can hate the game deeply if you want, but to say that 'I'm never playing Final Fantasy again' just because one game out of the series is actually different, then what does that say about you? Even if this game was bad, and all the innovating stuff wasn't innovating to me, I still wouldn't say 'DISGRACE'. I'd just say, man they really messed up, I'll have to see what's next.We all are different types of game players, I'm the type that gives a game time to develop, and appreciates it for what it is, and not downing it because it's different from it's counterparts. I actually like story lines, I don't always like jumping in and slashing and shooting everything in site. Personally, I play a Final Fantasy game FOR the story line, I don't understand how anyone can expect this game to be something it's not. Of course it doesn't have the same aspects as others, but it still does a wonderful job at what it has. And I had, and am still having a lot of fun with it, and am glad I spent money on it.If you don't like 'BORING STORY, LINEAR RAWR!11!!1!', which this is non of anyways, but you just need something to blame your dislikes for the game on, then you probably shouldn't get this game.But if you're like me, and don't play that many RPG's and was looking for something to slip on, then get this. It's very fun, interesting, amusing, and most of all, it's one of the few games that remains fun after beating it. Good luck, hope this helped.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2011"}

I loved the game-play and cinematic scenes along with the enemies and variety of abilities it gave me.  This made me want to try more games, so I bought the old PS3 which was compatible with the old console games.  I played 10, 12, and 7.  Final Fantasy 7 was fun while I played it, but the poor graphics made the cinematic scenes hard to watch and the lack of any voice acting hurt it even more.  If I had played it when it originally came out, I guarantee that I would have loved it, but now it is just too old to enjoy.  The others were alright but the lack of surprise enemies in 12 made it hard to enjoy as you could walk right past them without using any items and the skill system was hard to get used to because you never knew what the next square over was and in 10, it was slow travel and repetitive in some areas because surprise attacks just kept coming.

{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Leonard","summary":"When life gives you lemons, shake your hands at the sky and scream \"Why?!\"","reviewText":"The system worked out of the box.  One complaint is that they didn't make the Power/Eject Disc buttons obvious enough.  So if you don't read instruction manuals, the buttons are by the Blu-Ray drive.  I'm sure there are a lot of lemons out there.  And I can't vouch for mine working in the future.  Mostly because my launch Xbox 360 lasted two years before it broke.  All I can say is that I feel sorry for the people who received lemons, because the system is great.  Very little video lag, minimal noise from the Optical Drive and fan.  Relatively good Wireless NIC, that has only lost connectivity once in the 10hours I've used the system.  The Graphics Quality are almost on par with my computer.  If you're still on the fence about buying this system, I would hold off until the third or fourth shipment (probably around the time Destiny comes out).  By then they should have whatever bugs people are experiencing worked out.  They wont have to &#34;rush&#34; systems to meet demand, which causes problems in my opinion.Pros:  It worked for me.  Set up and updated in less than an hour.  Graphics/Textures, particles, and lighting are great and virtually free of any artifacts.  Runs quietly.  Runs about the same temperature as my Xbox360 and PS3.  Controllers are an improvement from the Dual Shock 3.  Has a variety of Free-to-Play games, as does the Xbox One I believe.  Free games come with subscription to Play Station Plus.  Games download patches while you play, as opposed to prompting you to patch before you start playing.Cons:  Play Station Network was down and affected Settings and Registration of their own product.  From what I've heard/read, there's a 30% chance that you'll receive a lemon that will take Sony 2-4 weeks to replace.  You have to sync your controllers before you can use the PS button to turn the system on; which means you have to manually turn the system on and then hit the PS button to sync your controller.  The Power and Eject buttons are about the size of a sewing needle.  I have used 80GB of the Hard Drive with four games: three disc and one download.  When you PS button your way out of the game to use other &#34;Aps&#34; the system will send you back to the menu and highlight that game every 90 seconds.Overall I'm happy with this purchase.  I was going to wait until the second or third shipment of the system to avoid the &#34;growing pains&#34; that are associated launch day systems.  My brother bought one too and his is working fine as well....  Happy gaming everyone, and my condolences to the people who received broken systems.

This was due to people being outraged that a completed DC game got canceled at literally the last minute and moved over onto the Xbox for a North American release (Shenmue 2 was supposed the DC very last game,think of it as going out with a bang) So a majority of people ignored the Xbox version completely and imported the English subbed PAL version. Anyway enough with the history lesson on with the review.Shenmue 2 takes place right after the events of Shenmue 1. Shenmue 1 only contained 1 chapter of the Shenmue universe whereas Shenmue 2 contains 3 chapters. One thing that people will notice right away is that there was a whole chapter dedicated to the ship but it is only mentioned in the game near the beginning in one sentence (you can unlock a few books that tell you what happened on the ship) A nice touch that was done for Xbox owners who purchased the game was that Sega decided to included a 1hr 30min DVD on the events of Shenmue (it's just a DVD with every cut scene in the game). I can tell you right now if you didn't like Metal Gear Solid because of all the story telling. Then Shenmue 2 is not for you,it is basically just an interactive movie. I found that there was not as much fighting as the back of the box makes out to be.The graphics of Shenmue 2,while beefed up a bit for the Xbox,Shows it was essentially a straight port from the Dreamcast with a few extra features added in,there is now a camera option in the game witch lets you take pictures of people in the game to unlock a whole lot of stuff.Overall Shenmue 2 is a great game if its your kind of thing.

I know u have probly read other reviews about this game being mean,and disrespectful but thats only when u treat ur town members mean like hiting them with nets or not doing things they ask u to do. And Resetii is the main problem. Everyone says that their kids and parents r complaing how mean he is but he teaches u a lesson. UR NOT SUPPOSED TO TURN THE GAME OFF WITHOUT SAVING EVEN IF U DID NOT DO ANYTHING. If u did not even do anything it still needs u to save because it needs to know if u were on or not so u get mail and stuff. And becides, i am almost 14 and it took me a while to get youst to the game. U can even save anywhere by hitting start. Not trying to be mean but little kids dont need to take this game seriously. It is simple to save and it is too confusing for most little kids. Some dont get the purpose of this game so they r careless about what they do and thats why they r always being bullied by the animals on this game. So tell ur kids to be more carfull abut what they do on it.This game is completly different then the GC[gamecube]version. The animals r smarter then the the GC and there is more furniture on this one. u can get a much bigger house on this one. And in Nookingtons there is a hair shop. If u r stuck at any store u either have to spend a certain amount of bells or if u spent allot allready try paying off ur house dept then he should say the store is going to be closed whenever for remodling. I know the house dept gets higher each time and then so high that u cant pay it off. I know a cheat to fix that. First u need at least 20,000 bells then go to the post office and go to save bells. Put in at least 20,000 and save game and turn power off. Then turn DS back on and change the date to 2099 then save and turn back off. Turn back on u will see that u have mail. The one from town hall says that u got 99,999 bells. U can go back to post office and go to access amount and go to withdraw bells and u will have 99,999 bells plus the amount that u had before. After that u change the date back to original time and u can do this as many times as possible. Notice that weeds and grass apears all over ur town and dont pull them all out untill u r done doing the cheat,this is pointless because they will just come back as soon as u do the cheat again.All of the songs r the same as GCs. Grapics r better for people and background but houses and stuff in houses r blocky.This is my favorite game for the DS.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2009"}

Their team has skillfully squeezed consoles to the limit, offering breathtaking environments at smooth frame rates. Doom and Quake are perfect examples of Id's masterful creation of atmospheric worlds that almost threaten to overwhelm the characters themselves. Look at those textures! I mean, LOOK AT THEM!But, there's one other, significant area Id still needs to work on, and if they did, they would own the gaming industry. I'm talking about depth and emotion and story. Id does not deliver much of any of these critical areas.Rage has the looks of a supermodel and the brains to go with it. Rage has a non-existent story. It's mostly a collection of \"Would you please get 'X' for me? Then I'll give you 'Y' in return\" moments. You're always getting some object for someone. They give you an object in return. Characters look real but you develop no connection with them. They're gorgeous paper cut-outs. Rage has some depth to it. You can upgrade your guy's weapons, engineer items and choose different ammo, but that's where it ends. Fallout stomps Rage in this matter. You have to remember that this is a free wheelin' FPS and not an epic experience like Fallout. As for story, haven't found one yet, but I am keeping my eyes open.Id needs to take the next step. Rage could've been the game of the year if they'd focused on story and depth, but maybe they don't care about that stuff.I don't recommend you buy this unless you're just looking for a reason to kill stuff and run errands while gawking at the scenery.

Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions.

{"product_name":"B0002B90SA","reviewerName":"Bilbo Baggins \"mighty hobbit\"","summary":"An evolution rather than a revolution","reviewText":"This game continues on the momentum gained from the previous KOTOR game.  It is very similar to the previous game but with a lot of little touches.  Several things I noticed; one, the game features the ability to equip two sets of weapons and you can switch back and forth between the two with a push of a button.  This is good if you have a character who uses ranged weapons and then gets into a melee battle or vice versa.  The conversations are now much more active.  In the first game whenever there was a dialouge the game just stopped and got static.  Now, you see people moving around in the background and in the foreground.  Talking during battles is interesting.  One of my more memorable moments during the game occured when my character set a power conduit system on overload and then entered a conversation.  Halfway through the discussion my chracter gets electrocuted and falls to the ground.  It was quite humorous.Another thing I noticed is that the ability to create new items and breakdown old items into componets to create new items.  I didn't use this option too much but it is still a nice touch.  The ability to influence your companions to the light side or dark side was also a nice addition although I never really bothered trying to convert anyone to my cause too much.I must say that this game was very fun to play.  Unlike the first one you start the game as a jedi from the first moment.  Unlike the first game you can go beyond level twenty which allows you to learn more force powers and become much stronger.  The addition of prestige classes also adds a touch of variety.  Playing as a Jedi Master or a mighty Sith Lord is quite the thrill.  You can just bowel people over with your force powers.But alas, I must now deal with the negative.  The story is somewhat lacking.  I never knew 100% what was going on.  I'm sure part of that was deliberate but still it was annoying.  The game lacks the big \"I am your father\" mind trip moment that the first game had.  The ending, also is somewhat lacking, both for the dark and the light.  Granted, I wasn't expecting a twenty minute final fantasy III-esque ending after the first game's ho hum finale but this was even worse.  I won't spoil it for you if you haven't played the game but I could surmise the ending in one sentence easy. Also, going back to a previous complaint the characters you have to choose from are essentially the same dudes you got to choose from in the first game, with slightly better looks.  I hate to keep beating this into the ground but I got a fever and the only prescription is being able to play as a wookie.So, in all I have to say this is a great game but if I had to give a nod I would prefer the first one but still, for having come out so soon after the first game this one does a good job trying to fill it's big brothers shoes even if it doesn't quite succeed.P.s. If you play through the game as a dark side character you may notice that at the end your character has replaced Darth Sion/Darth Nihilus on the title screen.  It's a very minor thing but it really is symbolic of what this game is about.  The special little touches.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2005"}

I was very impressed with the graphics when Altair first rode into Jerusalem. The swordplay can be somewhat repetitive...countering an opponents attack can be fun though.

He is supposedly the greatest assassin but does not possess the simple skill of swimming? Really? This inability is particularly frustrating when you must chase an assassination target through the docks without falling into the water.

It is crucial to help Amaterasu make the world a place where all living creatures can dwell once again.","reviewerName":"Kevin FitzPatrick \"eeble\"","summary":"Zelda + RPG = Okami","reviewText":"The game Okami seems to be a response to the game people hoped thatLegend of Zelda The Wind Wakerwould have been and generally is a great adventure game using some Zelda-esque elements. It is basically a RPG in the form of an action adventure game. Instead of random battles you can see cursed pieces of parchment that you can avoid or run right into to fight. Instead of experience points for fighting (you only get money or items) you get 'thanks' for cleaning things up or making someone or something happy which you use to up your stats. There is a wide selection of weapons: shields, both offensive and defensive, shootable rosary beads, or swords to use in battle. You select a main and sub weapon so there can be a combination of different types.The first thing most people will notice about the game is the beautiful watercolor cel-shaded animation style. It fits well into the Okami world - cut-scenes are narrated paintings and a major element of the game is using a magical paintbrush to affect the world by actually painting on it. This visual style influences many small aspects of the game, for example as you run you leave a train of flowers & the act of blooming trees looks great in this style.There are only a few issues with the game. First a simlish like language is NEVER better than silence for a conversation or cut-scene. It only detracts from the experience. I don't want to hear grating noises every time I'm trying to quickly get through a dialogue. The music is quite good, but when I play the sound gets turned off.Second, favors for retards is a common RPG theme, but this game takes it to new retarded heights. For example the fishermen in the game have no line. The went to fish with a pole and nothing else. I get the \"I need medicine but so-and-so in far away village has it\", but c'mon.Other than the cel-shaded style, many aspects of the game are Zelda-esque. While some things are similar (when you are underground you leave by walking into a lit up area and get sent upwards or you can change between day or night), some other stuff is way too similar to be coincidence. For example there is a forest kid named Kokiri. There is aLegend of Zelda The Minish Capshrink down section, opening treasure chests, bombing walls, & collecting parts of a unit of life energy to combine into a new unit of energy are all way too close.The real question is does this game rip off Zelda or is it an homage? Personally I think that this game takes a number of Zelda like elements and combines them into a fantastic original game.You simply need to play this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2007"}

Also that the enemies are not as tough to kill this time around unless you are playing veteran or elite difficulty.The good changes that were made to Killzone 3-Enemies are of a challenge they auctully run away from grenades and are pretty smart on getting the jump on you.-The graphics, definitely noticable in different levels, each has a feeling of it's own scifi world.-A mechanic were you can hide behind something and slowly pop out and shoot(think Uncharted but in first person)-You can brutal mellee kill a helghast and not like a 1 second slash, but a 7 second hitting a helghast and holding a knife and stabbing it through their eye and feeling that intensity of auctully killing that enemy.Needs ImprovementsStoryline-Not to say that it was terrible but you could tell it was short, and to me i want to know one question is \"How did the war happen?\"Botzone-The bots are fun and really do help bring a multiplayer experience without the internet, but there were moments were it felt like my bots were not sitting sniping, or doing their objectives but going out there to be killed, to me this was a major letdown it could have more improvements on the bots in general, it just needs a few more tweaks and it could definitely be a great offline multiplayer experience.No multiplayer co-op and co-op botzone- To me and a lot of gamers who i have talked to online in the beta matches, have said that no having co-op online is a sin to video games, because when Killzone 2 came out 3 years ago it was understandable to not have a co-op online the technology may have not been there, but in today's standards there is no exception. Plus Co-op online botzone would be fun for a clan, or especially a few friends to revamp their skills and to maybe help them become an elite squad, to me this would help put Killzone a cut above the rest of the shooters if they just added those features.Maps- There is only 6 to 5 maps depending if you are playing in Warzone,Operations or even Team Deathmatch, and only 2 if you baught the Helghan edition, to me i understand the DLC's need to be baught, but could the devolopers have atleast thought out 14 maps instead of 5 or 6? because the Multiplayer experience is great, but the common complaint amongst the fans is that the there is not much of a selection.This is all i can say about Killzone 3, it is a fantastic Multiplayer experience, Single Player can be drawn out a bit, but to me if the devolopers can fix the problems i have stated for Killzone 4 then trust me it will be one of the top shooters of all time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2011"}

In an age where many publishers are releasing/using DLC in controversial ways, Rockstar has proven this generation to be ahead of the pack in releasing substantial, meaningful post-release content, and Undead Nightmare is no different.You step back into the shoes of John Marston, one of gaming's great characters, and plunge back into the Old West in an apocalyptic adventure that is darker and more grim than Red Dead Redemption.  Flesh eating zombies have infested the landscape of early 20th century Southwestern America and Mexico, and when his wife and child become infected with the plague, John sets out to find out what has happened and to eradicate it once and for all.  Undead Nightmare has something of a survival-horror feel to it.  Since stores and basically the entire economy of the Old West have disappeared in the face of this plague, the only currency that matters is bullets.  Naturally, with hordes of zombies everywhere, you do a lot more shooting in Undead Nightmare than you did in Red Dead Redemption, and this works out very well for the gameplay.  You gain access to your weapons much quicker, and ammunition proves to be a very important element in not just your own survival, but in the survival of other survivors you meet along the way.  Characters from the main game return (sometimes in various forms) and the game has a surprisingly intriguing story, which is something I wasn't expecting.  Like the great zombie movies of the past, there is strong satirical commentary (one woman blames the plague on the USA's refusal to \"close the border\").  The sharp humor from the main game is still here, as are many moments of suspense and terror that bring a new element to the game world.All the great gameplay from the original game is here.  The entire game world is still here, albeit transformed to appear much more ruined.  Your dead eye gauge (which slows down time to let you get more accurate shots) fills much faster to help you deal with the undead hordes everywhere.  There are some excellent moments with the native wildlife, who have also become stricken with the plague, and new mechanics are introduced, as well as new weapons.  Altogether here, there is about 8-10 hours of additional content, not including every side mission as well as added multiplayer content.  Rockstar has set a great example here on how to add content to a game that really breathes new life into it and gives excellent value for the money.  If you enjoyed Red Dead Redemption, this is really something that should not be missed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2012"}

Although it is very short, only twelve missions in all, Agent Under Fire is able to set up a decent storyline, without the help of a movie this time around, and is also able to work in all the necessary weapons for Bond to use for his battle against evil.

I first came upon it in a computer magazine. It wa sin development for at least 2 years. The previews looked fantastic. So much to do, but the greatest part of this game was going to be making movies, editing, and watching your possible masterpiece. Sadly, it was hyped as the most anticipated game but it didn't live up to the hype.The graphics weren't bad. They sort of resembled the Sims2 graphics with almost the same language. Building the actual movie set and studio was a fresh and unique way to start the game. Hiring script writers (or you can write it yourself), actors, extras, and scientists were pretty good. Hiring janitors and construction workers was a very demanding task that quickly got frustrating. I can understand you have to build trailers, bathrooms, bars, and resturants but it was slightly taking away from the main part of this game---making movies. Being a realism freak and the fact that I love buisness sims, I thought I was not going to get any sleep when this game was released. I was going to make masterpieces. Alien movies, horror flicks, love story with a twist, oh I was waiting for the release date. I was shocked to see that you only get a small tidbit to make the movie. The scenes were short. Your movie was only a couple of minutes. This was a letdown. With todays computers as well as 2 years ago and the ability to buy large capacity hard drives for low prices, I thought Lionhead would of allowed players to make feature films possibly 30min-2hrs in length obviously that would take a huge amount of space but what Im saying is 3-5 minutes of a whole film is nothing. I had high hopes but it was somewhat of a letdown. Time seemed to go very fast (its not turn based).I did have fun with the game but everytime Im making a movie, I get that dissapointed look when my movie, after months of shooting and getting the scenes right, is completed all 5 minutes of it. Sadly it's not enough to keep you playing. The expansion pack for this game (Stunts) does add some renewed excitement but it quickly vanishes since the length of the movies remained the same and its slightly buggy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2007"}

I however just do not see it. The game seems to move in slow motion. Season mode is always the same unless you pick a different brand, which create only two different Season Modes. The new submission systems, GM Mode, and the graphics seem to be the only good things in this game. The game can be fun for a while; this is just not a great game.Graphics- 8/10For the time, these graphics were very solid. Most of the wrestlers look exactly like themselves. Most move animations, while recycled from previous games, are well done. There are very few graphical glitches. I have had my character suddenly appear on the outside of the ring. Overall though, there aren't many problems.One major problem I had was the winning animation. Each time you win a title, you will get a scene with your wrestler crying on the ground ala Chris Benoit atWrestleMania XX. This would be okay, but it feels very overdone and makes me want to vomit each time I see it now. Even if a champion retains a title, the same animation takes place. Last time I checked, that doesn't happen in real life.Created Wrestlers all look decent. They still can't stand up to the actual character models, but at least they work okay. I suggest looking for a website to help you make the most accurate Created Wrestlers. Wrestlers that you make on your own will often stand out for their ugliness.Another problem I have is in the Create-A-Entrance Mode. The mode is missing too many animations. Often times I have to give my wrestler a generic entrance because the rest of the animations are stupid things. I feel like this mode could have been done a lot better.Loading times aren't too bad. Sometimes while previewing Create-A-Entrance, you will lose your mind about how it has to load every single time. The rest of the game doesn't have terrible load times though.Story- 5/10Season Mode in this game is extremely lacking. You can pick a superstar and play on the brand that they are on. Raw will have a different story then Smackdown. Both of the stories are pretty good, but overall are only worth playing through once. After you have finished Season Mode on both brands, you are done with this one.Another problem I have is in G.M. Mode. You are the General Manager of the brand of your choice. You make the matches and stipulations. This is all very fun until you realize they are trying to throw a story into it as well. You are often building feuds and suddenly you are pushed into a Storyline with the other brand. To me, this ruins the idea of having your own show. Often times it will ruin huge feuds you had ready for the PPV.Sound- 5/10All wrestlers now have Voice Over in Season Mode. Even Created Wrestlers have voice over. This however doesn't always pan out. While playing as Edge, I got to a point in Season where Edge stopped having Voice Over. He just stopped making any noise at all. I am guessing that THQ forgot to record the voice over for that portion of the game. This is inexcusable. If you are going to have voice over, you should actually have the voice over work correctly.Commentary in the game is horrible as usual. JR and King do Raw matches. Tazz and Michael Cole do Smackdown Commentary. There is no music during matches, only this commentary. They will say the same generic things every single match. Tazz wants to make Cole Cruiserweight Champion...and whatnot. They have yet to fix the commentary in this series. I hope they do soon.The music, which takes place in the Main Menu and G.M. Mode, is extremely repetitive. You can a few rap songs and a couple hard rock songs. They are played very low though. They only emphasize the fact that this game is very boring. The songs just don't fit this title.Gameplay- 7/10This was a huge let down. The game seems to move slower then ever. The addition of a stamina bar has only made the game even slower. The gameplay is now a bore to even play. The AI is pretty good and can have a decent match with you if you have the game set right.The addition of G.M. Mode is what saves this for me. Despite the storyline added in at certain points, the mode is fairly fun. You set up feuds between wrestlers and try to keep it interesting each week. The more interesting the show is, the more popular your show gets. The object of the mode is to have the more popular brand at the end of the fiscal year. The only problems I have with this mode are the inclusion of storylines and the fact that feuding wrestlers must constantly be in matches with each other.The AI in the game suddenly becomes idiotic in the Elimination Chamber match. They will be constantly climbing the wall and internal chambers. Literally, they will do it over and over again. This kills one of the best matches on the game.The roster in this game consists of all your 2005 WWE favorites. There are also many Legends like Bret Hart, Andre the Giant, and Jimmy Hart. This wasn't my favorite roster, but it was an accurate roster. There are plenty of Create-A-Wrestler slots for you to create anyone they missed.There is plenty of extra crap in the game. You can now set up your private locker room. You can customize it will about 4 different pieces of furniture and a few posters. This is probably that biggest waste of space on this disk.Championships can now be defended separately in Exhibition Mode. This will not affect your Season Mode though. You can even create your own titles to be defended in Exhibition mode.I cannot comment on online mode, as I haven't played it. I hear it was decent. I did not take any points off for online mode.Difficulty- 8/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty)This is one of the better points in the game. There are four difficulty levels. Legend mode is extremely hard and you will constantly be reversed. Easy mode will have you stomping mud holes in Hulk Hogan in seconds. Overall, pretty good difficulty.The points are counted off for the fact that season mode can be beat in a few days. Season mode is a huge point of gameplay in these games, and this one is far too easy. There are challenge modes and other things, but they aren't too hard either.Overall- 6.5/10G.M. Mode will keep you going for a while. After that though you will be left will just a slow moving game. Online play might add a bit to the experience, but I cannot see it becoming a long-standing multi-player game. The game moves far too slowing for it to be a good multi-player game. Good for a bit, but overall there are better wrestling titles.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2008"}

This mysterious power forms the beginning of all life, is the source of all magic and the origin of all thought. For eons the angelic Seraphim watched over the T-Energy and therefore over the fate of the entire world. But eventually tiring of their burden, they passed their knowledge on to the High Elves. T-Energy helped the realm of the High Elves to experience an unimaginable boost of prosperity, making it the reigning culture in Ancaria. But a force as powerful as T-Energy carries great dangers. Not taught how to deal with this, no sooner did the Elves take control, then a heated dispute erupted among them as to how and to what purpose the T-Energy was to be used. Dispute morphed into irresolvable conflict, then rift and eventually to a civil war among the High Elves, where all participants were losers. Their realm collapsed and with it the entire power structure of Anacaria. In the turmoil all the peoples of Anacaria coveted the right, either openly or in secret, to wield the power of T-Energy and in the end, unmanaged, the T-Energy raged out of control warping creature and lands alike. Can anyone regain control over the T-Energy. And if so, will he/she strive to prevent the world from lapsing into final chaos, or deepen it?GameplayGameplay inSacred 2: Fallen Angelin divided into two campaign paths: Light and Dark. As the game begins players choose and customize their character and choose the path they will follow. This choice determines the ultimate goal and intentions of their character, and as the game progresses through literally hundreds of quests and side quests, the paths of different characters intersect at different junctions. Choose one way and you may be tasked to defend a town and its people, while another path could result in you attacking the same town. The choice is yours and the fate of the world and your well-being are at stake.Key Game Features:A massive, seamless and dynamic world delivering hundreds of hours of freeform exploration.Two deep campaigns: play as the 'Light' or 'Shadow' side, complete with distinct skills, rewards and story-elements tailored to the chosen path.Six exceptional, playable characters, each with a distinct look, capabilities and in-game motivation.Modifiable combat arts: change, upgrade and link together your alter ego's combat skills to match your playing style.Fight effectively from the back of a number of mounts under your control; equip and upgrade your character's unlockable special mount.Deities offer unique combat disciplines and unlock additional quests.Seamless transition between single and multiplayer gaming modes via Xbox LIVE.Captivating online modes of play challenge gamers in cooperative, PvP and PvE play.Extraordinary, cutting-edge graphics and Dolby 5.1 channel surround sound utilize the latest technologies for a truly immersive experience.Character ClassesInSacred 2: Fallen Angelplayers assume the role of one of six characters -- five of which are new to the franchise -- and delve into a thrilling story full of side quests and secrets that you will have to unravel. Breathtaking combat arts and sophisticated spells are waiting to be learned. A multitude of weapons and items will be available, and you will choose which of your character's attributes you will enhance with these items in order to create a unique and distinct hero.SeraphimOften referred to as 'Fallen Angels,' these mystical and angelic creatures are the oldest inhabitants of Ancaria. Fast, elegant and acrobatic warriors from a technological future they fight with light to medium weapons and, if required, with massive technological support. Players can assume the role of a Seraphim and protect the world from chaos.Shadow WarriorShadow Warriors were originally humans trained as elite soldiers in service to the High Elves. Upon their death their souls were stolen by an Elven general, bound to lifeless bodies and imbued with T-Energy. Now free, they travel between this world and the next as undead beings with only the desire to return to the peace of the golden halls of Elysium.High ElfThe best student at the ancient academy of magic in Thylysium, the High Elf character lives and breathes magic. Her hunger for adventure and her insatiable desire to increase her personal knowledge and the influence of her once-powerful house are the driving forces as she sets off into an Ancaria boiling over with turmoil.DryadMasters of the hunt and akin to the Elves, The Dryad are in tune with nature and are equipped with the strength of the forests. The most powerful and the strongest among them are knowledgeable of the dark art of voodoo and were chosen in order to save their peoples from extinction. All are expert with the bow, traps, poisons and lore of the forest.InquisitorThe Inquisitors are the High Priests of the High Elves. Arrogant and deadly, they are only committed to themselves and their ultimate goal of assume control over the T-Energy. Proficient in close combat and able to gain increasing power as damage is taken, their manipulative spells make them powerful fighters from the shadows.Temple GuardianSince the beginning of time the purpose of Temple Guardians were to maintain and protect the Great Machine, so that it could keep the world in balance. Neither fully flesh or mechanical, they are half human and half machine. Propelled by T-Energy and devoted to protecting it, they are part of the Great Machine and so able to use the T-Energy for their purposes.A Wide Variety of MountsAcross Ancaria you will find many horse dealers. They offer all kinds of animals, from the simple nag up to a real war horse. You can equip a war horse with bridle, saddle and even special armor. These special items can be found in the game just like player items, ranging in quality from regular to rare and even unique items. In addition, every character also has a unique mount created specifically for their character class. This mount not only fits the personality of the character, but also complements the various aspects of the character's playing style perfectly.

Needs good hardware though","reviewText":"So I am a pathological upgrader.  And FEAR was a great excuse to buy yet more hot hardware.  The good news is that FEAR is incredible.  The less than good news is that on lesser machines, you might not get to see why it is simply so amazing.  Even according to the highest end video card manufacturers, this game really pushes the limits of the technologySo now that I've spent way too much on new hardware, FEAR simply blows me away.  The behavior of the AI (the enemy soldiers) is simply not to be believed.  The developers have made huge strides in creating natural bahavior in software.  The guns...my goodness, the guns are simply awesome.  Once you get the hang of the slow motion, and decide which of the weapons are your favorites, the weapons are unparalleled with the possible exception of Half Life (Doom 3 has good weapons, but they are slow and always out of ammo).  The way the AI react and interact, you feel like you are there sometimes.As far as the story goes, I didn't totally get it until the second time through.  Its a good SciFi yarn actually, would make a decent movie. Now the game isn't exactly frightening, at least not to me.  There were a couple of a eerie sequences for sure, and a couple uncomfortable surprises, but basically that was it for me.However, the action is what its all about.  The firefights, the bad guys, the weapons, learning the subtlties of the storyline, more bad guys.  I can't say I've enjoyed many games as much as this.  Half Life 2 and FarCry are up there as well with games I keep playing and playing.  But this one is so organic feeling, like you're in the action with these wierd AI characters.FYI, when I moved from a Nvidia Geforce 6800 to a 7800GT, the game became totally different. A couple of patches, a bios or 2, and the thing now runs so well, it feels like an alternative world, and less like a game.FEAR. Truly moving the art form to a new level.

There's every reason to love it, after all. It's quite sturdy and well-made, it doesn't have any problems registering hits and it folds up nicely. I should've loved it, but I merely sort-of liked it. Why?First, the drums wander. A lot. My problem initially was with the yellow cymbal migrating slowly to the left each time that I hit it. I managed to fix that by angling the cymbal so that it was point downward (like it shows in the picture), instead of having it straight out. It's still a problem, but not nearly as much. I also found that angling the support bar for it back a little (again, like in the picture), prevents another problem I had, which is that each time I hit it, it went down a little like a nail being driven by a hammer.But there's a wandering problem that I can't fix and that's the red drum slowly rotating each time that I hit it. There's no way to fix it completely in place and unless you are relatively gentle, it's going to move. The blue drum also has this problem. The green probably does, but I haven't used it much.Despite those two problems, this is a pretty darn fine set! Like I said, it's quite sturdy. I feel like I could smack it around all day and not have it break on me. Also, I rather liked the foot pedal. Some people have complained about the \"Guitar Hero\" logo sticking up and that it forced them to wear shoes to use it. I just played in my socks and had no problems.I can't really compare this to the standard drum kit for the \"Guitar Hero\" games, since I haven't ever really used it. I do know that this one is merely ok, and while I might be willing to buy it, I certainly wouldn't be willing to at the current price. Cut it by 50% and then I'd look at making a purchase.Bottom line: if the drums are important to you and you're not happy with the basic controller that came with the system, you might well like this one. The minor problems of wandering drums can probably be fixed pretty easily by someone with a drill, some screws and a few minutes of effort. But if you're merely fond of the drums, well, you can probably find a better deal elsewhere.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0002CHJAA","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"A severe disappointment","reviewText":"The original Xenosaga was a massive epic set in the universe of Xenogears (though not directly related.) The anime art style was innovative, and fun, and the story well thought out, deep, and engaging. Early on it was made clear that Xenosaga was meant to be a trilogy, so naturally Episode II was inevitable, and I was looking very forward to the new entry as many plot threads were left untied at the end of the original.This installment disappoints in a number of ways. First, the art style has gone from being an anime, to being an attempt at more realism, which isn't easy to pull off on PS2. I normally do prefer realism, but I loved the art style of the original here, and felt that there was no need to change it. Many of the game play mechanics were confusing, I never got a double attack going, it seemed overly complex compared to the original. The game suffered from severe frame rate drops frequently, and worst of all the story was convoluted, and about half way into the game completely looses track of its own plot, either that or it feels that way because rather than focusing on the story and primary quest the game drowns the player in too many nonsense side quests, many of them taking far too long, and many of them having a hook that they cannot be completed until playing through the game a 2nd time. Namco really made me mad because I normally like to get absolutely everything in an RPG, but this game you have to literally play through the game 20 times just to complete one of the side quests, and frankly, I have too many other games to play, I'm sure that other people would feel the same way.On the plus side, there were a handful of interesting revelations in the story. I am eager to see the third game, but I certainly hope that Namco shifts its focus back to the story and the main quest. Side quests are good, but there should only be a small handful of them. The average player will spend about 25 hours out of the 40 it takes to complete this game (as complete as possible for 1 time through) on side quests and that's just far too many.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0050SWUTQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Citysmash","summary":"Wonky beginning and ending, but the main quest was fun","reviewText":"Having not played the other 2 games in this series I can say it was a really fun game for the most part.  Fighting the human enemies at the beginning was almost as awkward, as the duck & cover moves were never needed again until late in the game.  On the other hand, the missions in deep space were very fun and especially enjoyable while playing online with a buddy.  I loved me some RE6, and this game felt like an even better version of it.  Unfortunately the later levels on the snowy alien planet were visually appealing, but a little less fun to play through.The only real weakness in this game came from the overall storyline (the boss was kind of a loser douchebag) which is like watching a B-rated movie script unfold with great visuals.  I didn't hate it, but it's definitely not worth playing through again for.  And the final alien boss was more weird than hard to beat.Overall, this is a well produced game that is fun to play through with a friend.  The length is about 10-12 hours, so a decent amount, and perhaps worth an additional playthrough in the +mode for upgrading your weapons and armor all the way.It's worth renting and perhaps buying if you like Dead Space and/or co-op action games,I'm giving it 1 less star because the gameplay and overall storyline was a bit underwhelming at the end. I did, however, enjoy this game more than Crysis 3.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SWUTQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Sky","summary":"Bytor and the Snow Beast","reviewText":"Dead Space 3 isn't causing the major heart attacks that Dead Space 1 & 2 gave me, but the anxiety level is still in the red. Fans of the Dead Space franchise should be thrilled. I'm not gonna lie....With Dead Space 3 I'm definitely used to where to expect the scares or enemies to pop out at me, but I was still literally crying out loud during the many ambushes and battles that occurred in Dead Space 3.You'll recall in the first game that each chapter ended with a tram ride, so there was never any question as to when a chapter ended and a new one began. Dead Space 3 is like 2: chapter changes are subtly spelled out on the screen, so if you're not paying attention or just recovering from the latest attack you could easily miss one.Dead Space 3 is a lot more action oriented, but there are still many moments of terror. And everything is presented (once again) terrifically! You're Isaac Clark and you're again plunged into a necromorph-infested world of nasties.What's really cool is that Visceral Games listened to those screaming for a co-op version of the campaign. But with co-op there's good news and bad news. The good news is that...well...there's co-op! The bad is that it's only online co-op, meaning my only choice for co-op is to play with some stranger versus playing locally with a friend or one of my sons. So for me...as of this writing....there has been NO co-op. I took a star off my initial overall rating for that, but I put it back because of the super-coolness of the new feature of being able to construct your own awesome weapons that don't require any specific ammo type; all ammo is universal.The creatures in Dead Space 3 are familiar and scary. When they're not scary they're disturbing. When they're not disturbing they're viciously ruthless, and there are some new ones to look out for. The background sounds are again creepy and send chills down your spine. The background music is orchestrated precisely, and it builds you right up to an anxiety attack when the action starts. The graphics are great and the environmental layout and surroundings are super realistic.Dead Space 3 is just awesome! If I had to try to find another flaw it would be that the save stations are gone and replaced with auto-save points. If you don't quit at an auto-save, only the inventory that you quit with is saved and you go back to the last auto-save point to start your next session.Visceral has done it again. Sick. Game. Sadly, Visceral has announced the cancellation of Dead Space 4 due to lagging sales of 3. Too bad...so enjoy this final chapter in the series. And by gosh, if you're new to the series, by all means get Dead Space 1 & 2 as well (they are pretty cheap now here at Amazon!). You don't really need to play the series in order, but it helps ever so slightly.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00020BV1A","reviewerName":"Acoma","summary":"Great entertainment","reviewText":"First off, I've never been a big fan of First Person Shooters. The only exceptions being Half-Life where the story and interaction was compelling enough to be more than just a \"blast the bad guys\" expierience. So when I picked this up I was skeptical as something akin to Star Wars: Battlegrounds. This was not the case.Republic Commando is indeed a first-person shooter but more than just a \"blast the bad guys\" because you are not just controlling yourself but three other squadmates. Controlling them is very very easy as their AI is extremly well done. For the most part they will stay in a tactical formation and not do stupid stuff like running into mines, etc. They act and move independantly and support you rather than hinder you. This is all without you giving them orders. The orders you can give are very simple with two primary formations which is basically Offensive or Defensive. Offensive they will actively engage targets of opportunity with intelligence i might add, using cover and not just standing in front of a droid and shooting until it dies. Defensive your squadmates will stick to you for the most part, firing at targets of opportunity. The other big part of controlling your squadmates comes in the form of taking positions. There are several types of positions (Grenadier, Sniper, Anti-Armor) which are preset depending on what map you are on. It's a simple matter of clicking to order a trooper into a position and he will either snipe, use his anti-armor attachment from his gun or lob grenades on targets of opportunity.The gameplay and mission assignments are various and exciting. No two missions are alike. You will hear all the familiar Star Wars music from John Williams, and move around some familiar environments. The Wookies were very well done btw, and much more than a tall british guy in a shag carpet costume. Very large, very fercocious which don't just stand around...they help fight as well.Lucasarts proclaims that the squad is your weapon and this is exactly on target. Most of the time I spent ordering my squad to solve problems and eliminate bad guys rather than shoot myself. When I did it was only after i put my squadmates in a tactical position and would lend whatever firepower I had to taking down X or Y bad guy. There are certain points in your missions where you are solo and your squadmates are not available to you, I still found those enjoyable because it was a nice change of pace.The Gameplay is superb. The graphics and environmentals are absolutely outstanding. They were very well done.Now..the bad parts which are few. The game was way too short, which isn't necessarily a flaw. The game was so good i actually played and beat it twice in a row. It will take your average gamer approximately 4-8 hours to win. As mentioned in another review i also expierienced points where one of my guys would get stuck and lost. This would require me to backtrack and find him to get him back in the group. This was fairly rare and easy to fix, but a bit annoying.Overall it's an extremly fun game to play and recommend picking it up for a good fix of Star Wars entertainment, but the minor bugs made me give it 4 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2005"}

The dialogue choices you make has an outcome every single choice always yield different result, this will make you play the game multiple times just to see what you can do different.The graphics and gamepaly is what's going to get the most attention in a bad way. It looks and plays like a high def PS2 and xbox game. Don't really see how this is a next gen game especially with the 360's and PS3's tech. Nonetheless the levels look good and the characters are animated ok but they're stiffness sticks out and they're movement isn't smooth in the cut scenes.The AI in the game are pretty hit or miss mostly miss. They are inconstant and will do really dumb things for the most part. Stealth will feel broken at times as the enemy AI will jump at the moment to find a fellow guard's body thus setting off an alarm. Some enemies are either blind or deaf when your shooting their friends.I knew going into this game that it wasn't going to blow my mind. At the price I purchased it I am pleased and feel that I got more then what I payed for. This game is no where near as bad as people make it out to be. It has flaws just like any other games its just this game's flaws stick out a little more. And I believe many just thought it was a mass effect style game where you can shoot through,make choices and get an ending which is just not the case with a game that has an heavy emphasis on RPG stats and skills. But if you want a blend of RPG and stealth gameplay with real choices with real outcome ALPHA PROTOCOL will fit your bill.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2011"}

There's just something amazingly charming about this game that I can't quite put my finger on. I've played it multiple times and I never get tired of it. Overall, this game simply excels.Graphics (score 10/10): Some people are put off by the large-headed characters, but it didn't bother me. What I really love, though are the towns and other environmental locations.  The various locations of the game are all beautiful in their designs (my favorite location is Cleyra; I just love the look of this place).  Even though the PS1 has poor graphical capabilities compared to today's systems, I've never seen a game with such beautiful and detailed environments.  You can really tell that the designers made the most of the PS1's abilities.Music (score 10/10): I love the music in this game! Many of the tracks have a meideval sort of feel to them, but in an upbeat kind of way. Alot of it just feels...cozy. I can't think of any other way to describe it.  Every time I listen to the game's soundtrack I just feel like curling up with a relaxing cup of tea. I guess that if you prefer action-packed music this wouldn't appeal to you though.Characters (score 10/10): The characters are well-developed and everyone is just so darn quirky and likable. I really became attached to Freya--I'm not even sure why. Square really did a good job with characterization without using voice-overs. For example, Vivi can be seen fiddling with his hat in many scenes, portraying a nervous habit. It's just little details like these that make the characters so enjoyable.Story (score 10/10): The storyline too is also very enjoyable. I found many parts of it to be very relaxing, although exciting moments are in there too. Overall, the narrative is well-crafted right to the very end (with the exception of the final boss, where did he come from?) By the time you've finished, you'll feel like you've been on an epic journey and all the characters have become your life-long friends.Battle System (score 10/10): The battle system is turn-based, and pretty easy to learn. You learn skills by keeping weapons equipped until the skills are learned. This is the only irritating part of the system, because it can get annoying when you want to learn a skill but have a much better weapon you could switch to. But this is only a minor gripe, as the rest of the battle system is excellent.Gameplay (score 10/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me. Where to begin? Well, there's nothing wrong with the camera system (thankfully). Oh, there are plenty of minigames and side-quests available to please everyone. I especially enjoyed the Chocobo Hot&Cold; game.  The pacing of the story is also excellent.  The game does a very good job of balancing combat-heavy portions of gameplay (like going through a dungeon) with more relaxing non-combat gameplay (like exploring a town for information).  Honestly, it's this perfect balance of combat and non-combat portions of the gameplay that makes Final Fantasy IX so enjoyable.Overall (score 10/10): NOTE this score is not an average, it's my subjective overall score. I really highly recommend this game to all RPG fans. I think it really deserves it's 10/10 score, especially compared to other games (and I've played a lot). This is definitely my favorite game out of all of them. Considering it's current affordable price (about $15 as of now), I suggest any RPG fan pick it up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2008"}

There are some good things and some bad things about this game. first the bad: 1. Squaresoft (Now Square Enix, Goddammit!) was trying to get to the old roots of the SNES games. To me anyway, it doesn't look entirely like those games. 2. Some of the characters are the worst in the FF games' history (Quina, Eiko, and Garnet. I am not sexist, it's just that their abilities suck and their type of combat is terrible). the other characters are good, not great, but decent. 3. I don't care too much for the character models (the deformation and Final Fantasy 8 graphics mix). okay for the good parts of the game: 1. The Cinemas!!! they look really good for a PSone game, most of the games cinemas on the PSone don't look that great in this era of gaming and even some during that era. 2. Ending!! I am not saying anymore. 3. The battle system. it's not quite FF8 and not quite FF7 but it's in between and has the Trance system thingy. After this game, I sadly am seeing the series not being as good as it once was (I like Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicals and can't wait for the remake of FF3 for the DS), Final Fantasy 10 isn't that legendary, FF 11, which I never did and never will play (because of fees, reminds me too much like Phantasy Star Online (I like that game though), and not much of a single player expericence with no storyline), and FF 12 just because it will have the FF11 battle engine, looks like FFCC and FF10 mixed together, and I just seem not to care that much about the newer FF games anymore. So I would recommend any FF game on the PSone (Including the PSone ports of the SNES games and Origins) because they are so great and even if the games don't have the best graphics in the world, it's gameplay and storylines that count.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2006"}

I am returning them.  I am pretty picky when it comes to audio.  Don't get me wrong the sound quality and microphone quality of these is pretty good, just not on par for me.  The voice morphing for the microphone is pretty good, the space squirrel and giant are the best ones.  You have to pay like 20 dollars for software that does that.  Anyways I am going to list the pros and cons and my main reason for returning them.Pros:-Sound Quality-Microphone Quality-G Buttons-Volume control on headset is fantastic addition-Wireless-Great charging system-Decent Software-Folds flat for storage-Range is pretty accurate-Look pretty good while your wearing them, not huge airplane headphonesCons:-Comfort-Price-Range isn't as good as some people say, but on par with 40 feet-Closed-ear headphonesThe main reason I am returning them is the comfort.  I have a larger than normal head, and although these aren't terrible, they do fit too snug for me.  The best comfort headphones I've owned were the Razer Barracuda and Sennheiser HD-555.  I know the HD-555 headphones were open-ear which means you can hear things around you and allows air inside.  These headphones are closed-ear and even after like 20 minutes of wearing them I already feel a little sweat from them.  I had a bad feeling about these headphones but I though I would try them out considering all the good reviews I read.  But if your into watching movies and music I recommend the HD-555 headphones.  They are also good for gaming as well.  I consider myself an audiophile now after using the HD-555 headphones.  These are pretty close to them, but the Sennheiser's are much better quality and make you feel like your there.  Anyways, I can't justifying paying this much for headphones that aren't as good as I expected.  If they were 100 dollars, I would probably keep them, but they're not.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2010"}

Vegan","summary":"Great game.. easy to learn!","reviewText":"Beyond Good &amp; Evil puts you in the role of Jade, a young woman who, along with her humanoid pig uncle, Pey'j, runs a lighthouse on the planet Hillys.  Hillys is at war with an alien force known as the DomZ and an elite squadron known as the Alpha Sections protects Hillys from the alien threat. An underground rebel organization known as the IRIS Network charges that the Alphas control both sides of the equation.  You quickly hook up with IRIS and spend the bulk of the game infiltrating Alpha strongholds in search of the truth.  The game gives you a companion most of the time and many puzzles will require you to get your associate to do things.Most of the game's sections have you out and in search of photographic evidence. You're looking for specific pictures and the areas of interest are marked on your map. The game does have combat but it's a fairly straightforward system. The strength comes from the game's puzzle solving.  Sometimes it's as easy as using your projectile attack to push a button on the other side of a force field. Sometimes you'll have to find fuses in other parts of an installation to power elevators or other equipment. Sometimes you'll have to learn a password to proceed into a locked area. And there's a whole lot of sneaking around. Beyond Good &amp; Evil is a fantastic-looking game that tells its story well. It may be short enough to rent and complete in a day or two, but fans of action adventure games will find enough to love in the game's overall design to make it worth purchasing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2003"}

Great RPG","reviewText":"It's very refreshing to see a solid single player RPG hit the PC that's not just a continuation of an already existing series or an MMO.  Even better is that it's focused on a more mature player base.  Expect a large amount of sexual references, acts, explicit language, gore, etc.  It's not overdone, it's just realistic.  I enjoyed it, but it may not be for kids.  The regular story line is excellent and I suggest reading The Last Wish before playing as it enhances the experience that much more.  The enhanced edition even outdoes the original in terms of stability, loading times, translation, and some other minor helps.Not everything is perfect.  There are more NPC character model clones than most any rpg I have played.  It's pretty bad, but it's not a game breaker.  Also, some of the voice acting is not the best.  While the translation was definitely improved with the enhanced edition, I'm not sure that the voice acting has.Definitely worth purchasing and playing.

Discover the true origins of Dracula and the Belmont family in this exciting first episode of the saga.","reviewerName":"C.E.","summary":"One of the best","reviewText":"Castlevania: Lament of Innocence is a great game that has been a long time coming.  When any classic series is translated and morphed and placed in a new setting, in this case 3D, you will always have a portion of the purists who insist that you have comitted one of the 7 deadly sins.  Then you will have the other half who will applaud your efforts and thank the stars that something new has come of something old.This game strikes people differently and has a mixed acceptance ratio.  I, for one, love this game and am pleased with the finished product.  The developers have dealt with problems that plague the translation of a classic franchise, and they have come through the process with a great finished product.  The game is awesome, and by all means, should be judged on its own without the cloud of expectation cast over it by its predecessors.The game developers have made the jump into the 3rd dimension, not an easy task to say the least.  At last, we are presented with a huge castle, tons of monsters and cool effects the way that they were meant to be seen.  The effects and animations are superb, the whip is realized in 3D in such a way that makes it easy to control and cool to watch.  The old sub-weapons are back, and now we have the added effect of relics and other items that can be equipped.The inventory system is easy to manage and items can be bought and sold, found and plundered- ala Symphony of the Night for PSOne.  You can equip different armor and acessories like rings and jewels and things of that nature.  The bosses are huge and animated impressivley.  The dialog is somewhat laughable, but who really cares anyway?  I certainly dont...if I want good dialog, I'll rent a movie or something.  Gameplay is what it is all about.The castle that we find ourselves exploring is actually quite large, and surprisingly easy to navigate thanks to a great in-game map feature.  The numerous bosses dont have to be beaten in any order, and so a ton of freedom is introduced.  You will find yourself wandering through halls and rooms several times as you acquire different items to aid you on your quest to destroy that pesky vampire once and for all.  While this may seem to be a large amount of backtracking and wasted effort, I found myself enjoying the journey.With a large cache of unlockable and secret rooms, some cool optional bosses (Elementals) and one big bad beastie hiding in the basement for you to find, many players will find themselves being pulled back into the castle after they have finished the game so that they can acquire that coveted 100% completion percentage.This game is awesome and should be judged on its own.  The gameplay is slick and smooth, the animations are first rate, the castle is huge and the visual style, while somewhat repetitive, is great as well.  The fixed camera may seem at first to detract from the whole experience, but the after a few moments of playing you wont even notice.  The developers had a huge challenge to overcome and in my opinion, they have done an admirable job of doing so.  To be sure, I would rent this one first and then decide if it is worth the buy.  You might be pleasantly surprised.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00006Z7I3","description":"The Getawayoffers shooting and driving action in gigantic London environments, from busy streets to gritty warehouses, that are re-created in obsessive, photorealistic detail. How gigantic? One of the developers boasted that it takes 15 minutes of real time to drive from one end of the city to the other. The game follows the story of an ex-bank robber, a vigilante cop, and their battle against Charlie Jolson, a notorious crime boss of London's East End. This game will inevitably draw comparisons toGrand Theft Auto IIIandMax Payne, but its ambitious scope puts it in a class by itself.","reviewerName":"Nick","summary":"A Cinematic Experience","reviewText":"The Getaway is unlike any other game. Sure it borrows some ideas from the somewhat similar GTA: Vice City, but The Getaway is its own game propelled by an incredible movie style script. The game's story will have you as tense and excited as any good gangster flick does.You play as Mark Hammond, a former gangster whos wife is murdered and son is kidnapped. Hellbent on revenge, the story follows Hammond as he tries to get his son back. The minute you start playing the game you will notice there is absolutely nothing on the screen. No health meters, bullet numbers, shields, arrows, or money amounts. This game is meant to seem as much like a movie as possible. To show you where to go, the turn signals flash. To heal himself Mark must lean up against a wall. The cars are real- Lexus, Nissans, Hondas and many British cars abound in this game. It really feels like a movie.Many of the missions in the Getaway are excellent. Whether you're getting in a huge shootout with the Yardies, or running from the cops or even going through a burning club, this game never gets old. However, the game falters at a few points. First, leaning up against walls to heal gets really old really fast. And trust me you'll be doing it a lot. Also, the controls on foot are a bit clunky. There could also be a few more guns available to complement the paltry 4 you can fire in The Getaway. Minor Quibbles aside, the Getaway is great game. If you are a fan of gangster flicks, GTA, or just mature games in general, give this one a look. It's truly revolutionary and incredible.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00A750QIE","description":"","reviewerName":"MHoss","summary":"Same Old Show","reviewText":"I have been playing the Show for a long time and I have been saying that it is the same game but just a roster update. An expensive roster update... I was so upset with the Show that I did not buy 12 because there wasn't much change that meant anything to me. I'll try to list things.1. Graphics - great, looks nice.2. RTTS - Frustrating, hasn't changed, unrealistic. I play this mode a lot and it frustrates me very much. I was a 5 time MVP and Cy Young winner once I hit free agency. I wasn't getting but 1 contract offer and the value was very low. The MLB is at an all time high on contracts right now and the game does not reflect that. A little disappointing.3. Guess pitch/location changed a little bit, I find it to be a good change and a little more challenging for batting.4. Franchise - Taking a step back. It seems like they took away some things from you as far as Owning/GM goes. I think there should be a full on GM mode to go along with the Franchise that can be taken off if you do not want to play it. The older games gave you a little more of that.5. Trading - I had a problem with this in the old games. The game makes some bad trades, such as having a stud first basemen and trading or signing someone just as good, making a surplus. You could turn-off trading, but that really takes the point away from it.6. Players losing ability FAST - I noticed this in my RTTS, Giancarlo Stanton was something like 28 years old and his rating went down to something like a 70 after being studly. This can happen in the MLB but it seems to happen across the board.Unfortunately the game just hasn't changed and until the consumer demands it they really do not have to because 2K is so inferior. It is the only game worth buying on the market and it isn't a terrible game, it just hasn't changed. I've sent several emails and posted on Facebook about changes that I think would be cool, they get ignored.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0088MVPFQ","description":"","summary":"Remember when Super Mario games used to be an event. . .","reviewText":"Back in the past, whenever a new Super Mario game would come out, it meant something. This sentiment held up very well, from the original NES trilogy, the SNES launch Super Mario World and the remake of the NES titles, even with an off shoot title with Yoshi, on to the 3D age with the N64, the GameCube, and Wii with the Galaxy duo. Whenever Princess Peach gets kidnapped, you knew something good is waiting for you. Somewhere along the line, Nintendo decided to rekindle that old flame of 2D Mario titles with the 2006 release of New Super Mario Bros. on the Nintendo DS. Personally, I didn't care for that game too much. It played it too safe with the level design and innovation, the difficulty was LOW in general, the graphics and art style was totally bland, the music was grating to the ears. It turns out that the \"New\" in New Super Mario Bros. isn't a nasty little lie Nintendo concocted to sell a rehashed game. It's a serial of games that would eventually make it to the Wii in 2009 with a titled New Super Mario Bros. Wii. It still had the same dull art style and rehashed music with a focus on four player action and a much higher difficulty level. Now, the third of the \"New\" series comes to the Nintendo 3DS with New Super Mario Bros. 2, a title that could have used the subtitle \"We ran out of ideas.\"First and foremost, the game is still fun to play, most of the time. Mario controls exceptionally well you really feel every leap and stomp. In fact, it's so good the player is the one who should be blamed if Mario were to meet his end on a stage, not the game mechanics or the stage design. It's perfect for this kind of game as I always preferred Mario games over its competitors. There are 80 new stages here which consist of 6 main worlds and several extra worlds to play and explore. The new gimmick introduced here is everything in the game is all about coin collecting. The game keeps a tally of how many coins you collect, accrue one million coins and you get a reward. To expedite this \"monumental\" task Nintendo added a new mode called Coin Rush Mode. Coin Rush Mode has you playing 3 randomly picked stages with less time than usual and you get as much coins as possible. It's an interesting mode but just like many things about this game, it has major flaws. The power ups here are completely taken from past Mario games with one of them being a revised version of the flower power that shoots out gold flames that turn enemies and bricks into coins. Another gimmick added are gold circles that turn into enemies into gold for a limited amount of time. Hit a Koopa Troopa and kick its shell, coins will appear. Overall the game has coins in every nook and cranny on the stages which fits the one million coin goal.As much as solid the game mechanics are, the game still under performs severely and falls way back to the standards older games set. The game is part of the \"New\" line of Super Mario games and it looks DULL and BORING. The 3D effect absolutely does nothing apart turn the background even more blurrier than it is in 2D mode. The music is all rehashed and reused it isn't clever. The challenge once again relatively low considering how much strides the Wii version took with its more sinister stage designs. Honestly there were parts of this game I actually felt bored playing. Nintendo also shows again how they are completely behind the curve when it comes to online play or connectivity. As much as what in interesting concept Coin Rush Mode is, it is totally offline only and the only way to show your best records is by Street Pass, LAME!Perhaps this game wasn't designed for me in mind. Nintendo just felt that taking nothing but old bits from old games (like the Rhino bosses, the Raccoon Suit), make easy, uninspired levels, throw them in a blender and call it a game. Oh, and add in a dash of a new concept with the coin collecting, but not too much, just half ass it by having a completely worthless reward for getting one million coins. Younger crowds who are still deprived of playing the older games know no better. Sell it to them and watch the cash flow come in to Nintendo HQ like the coins in this game. I've reviewed other games that play it safe yet still scored it high. With Mario, I hold his Super Mario games on to a different standard. Even when Nintendo disguised Yumi Kojo Doki Doki Panic as Super Mario 2 for the US audience, I applaud Nintendo for taking risks, Yumi Kojo Doki Doki Panic isn't a bad game. For me, Mario is the ultimate symbol for video games, he is a legend for a reason. Nintendo shouldn't be making tried but true Super Mario games. This one is, I get it, it's not a bad game technically. Nintendo should be pushing the envelop, creating new power ups that are original, more clever stage designs, new art directions. I say kill off the \"New\" series and create something new and mind boggling. We all first had doubts about Sunshine and Galaxy at first but they turned out fantastic in the long run. I don't recommend this game to old fans, unless you just want to play with the Raccoon Suit for brand new levels. I recommend getting the infinetly superior Super Mario 3D Land or if you crave for a 2D side scroller fix, Rayman Origins on the PS3/360/Vita/PC.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-23-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00004U5VK","description":"PlayStation2 owners with a passion forResident Evil's  genre-launching gameplay are in luck: Capcom delivers the same  world-famous gameplay style (sans zombies) in a beautiful action-adventure  set in a mystical medieval Japanese kingdom.Onimusha: Warlordsprobably won't win any awards for groundbreaking gameplay, but the  fast-paced action promises to overload the senses with more than enough  stimuli to notice.The experience is set in 16th-century Japan, a fantastical era in which  warlords clash for control of the country. As the samurai Samanosuke,  players volunteer to rescue the kidnapped princess Yuki. No surprise  that the ultimate goal (and the entire story line, for that matter)  falls by the wayside as hordes of demons converge on the player hour  after hour. The weapons system benefits from the flashy graphics--as  players discover and add gems to a gauntlet, weapon upgrades increase  firepower with increasingly dramatic effects.Graphically, the game is stunning. Carving through the levels--forests,  tunnels, and the requisite dark, dank castle environment--isn't  anything less than a spectacular experience, thanks much in part to the  game's unusually high production values. Character models are built  from up to 10,000 polygons each--high detail, even for a PS2 game.  Subtle environmental effects--the wind flowing through the trees, for  instance, ripples the fabric in characters' clothes--furthers the  game's realism. The game's backgrounds are painstakingly detailed and  nicely enhanced by dynamic lighting effects.The talent behind the aural effects is just as impressive. Japanese  actor Takeshi Kaneshiro lent his voice to the main character, and a  200-piece orchestra delivers a dramatic score.Call over any PS2 skeptics in your neighborhood, then load upOnimusha: Warlords.

I can't really pick which one of the four is my favorite, but this game was extremely fun.  I have played this on all modes of difficulty, and beat them all.  I highly recommend this game for people looking for a R.E. feeling to it except with swords basically.  Lets break it down.Graphics: The graphics are dated, but when it came out it was top of the line back then, so no complaining about that.  I didn't experience no lag or buges so were good. 2/2.Story: The story is kind of a damsel in distress theme.  Samanosuke is the hero of this story that has been chosen by the Oni's to represent to defeat the Genma(demons).  This is a great beginning to a 4 game series.  You will be introduced to four main villians that you will see in the other games, and they are Fortinbras, Nobunaga, Guildenstern, and Tokichiro.  Overall this is more of an horror game then an action game, so I enjoyed how devlopers did that.  I believe this game will appeal to the masses giving you a true taste of horror :). 2/2.Characters: The characters Samonosuke and Kaede are your main duo in the game.  Your introduced to all of the main villains in this game, but you really only get to know Tokichiro and Guildenstern.  I really like the relationship that Sam built up with Guildenstern in this game because their was a huge resentment between the two lol.  I really wished their was more to Yuki the princess the character but alas nothing.  Tokichiro was kinda of annoying character who was just like a crazy rabbit on drugs.  He was just there to annoy basically.  Kaede was a superb side-kick in the game, and her undying loyalty was great to see. 2/2.Sound: I believe the sound in the game made the game feel more exciting, but also gave me goosebumps at times.  The music and sound were pretty good in my IMHO 2/2.Controls: The camera angles and handling of the controls work perfectly. The third person view of this game really help control the character better in my opinion, thus letting you know where to go, and to see enemies coming around the corner. 2/2.Overall, this was a great game to play and I enjoyed it.  The story was eventful, and extremely fun.  I enjoyed all of the enemies in this game, and I hope to see them in later games.  10/10.Game on.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2012"}

I don't know why now but I was wondering if it would be as good of an experience as the first.Now that I have beaten the game I can honestly say that this is the best batman game. That's not saying much so I will say also that this is the best super hero game of all time. That's saying a bit more.I loved the first one so I immediately got into Arkham City. I will say that this is pretty much Asylum but set in the city. I am not saying that in a bad way at all. Why would you want to drastically change something that worked so well.There is a lot that is the same but that doesn't mean there aren't improvements. The combat has been enhanced and now flows smoother than the already incredible combat. Also batman has a few new gadgets that enhance the game set in a big city setting.Cat woman is also a playable character. I was a bit nervous about playing her character at first but I soon was loving whipping around the city and pouncing on unsuspecting inmates.The visuals are fantastic as well. Being in a big city I was worried about glitches and pop in issues. Despite the minor glitches that do tend to happen, I was very impressed how smoothly the game ran. I rarely saw any texture pop in and the game never slows down. Everything looks amazing.The story is awesome as well and it includes many different villains. I was happy to see that there were many sidequests that incorporated another handfull of villains as well. I definetly felt rewarded for journeying outside of the main storyline to tackle other things. To round it all off the voices for everyone is done extremely well. This is some of the most convincing work I have heard. It's great.The only gripes I have with the game are with the story and with the length of the game. Since it is set in a city I was hoping for a bit of a lengthier story. I beat it in around 25 hrs and thats with completing the sidequests and collecting a little more than half of the riddler trophies. The story was great and ended really well. I just felt like I wanted to tackle more missions after everything was said and done.I would still recommend this game to anyone.

The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"N8online","summary":"Boot Camp For A Casual Gamer","reviewText":"My brother bought this game for me when it just came out.

I'll give you one detail,  when you drive your car in the game and accidentally or intentionally hit something like another car or whatever you can see the actual damage to the vehicle and what you hit like it was actually real.

{"product_name":"B00C1ZBFTW","description":"","reviewerName":"ahw","summary":"Unorthodox and Challenging Game That May Not Be For Everyone","reviewText":"Shin Megami Tensei IV is an unorthodox and challenging game that will click for some and will be inscrutable to others.For starters, the story and setting will likely be bizarre for Western audiences unfamiliar with Japanese culture, particularly anime culture.  The setting does not fit into any \"traditional\" Western genre such as science fiction, fantasy, etc.  The story involves samurai, who do not look like samurai and instead wear what looks like school uniforms.  The samurai fight with swords and older, feudal weapons, yet also have access to computerized gauntlets, guns and other modern amenities.  They both fight and ally with demons.  It all makes for a very weird experience.On top of the odd story and setting, the presentation is very minimalist, which can be disappointing to some.  Initially, world navigation is done via menu, with the player selecting where to go from a menu of locations.  When you get to your first dungeon, you navigate by controlling a sprite.  Disappointingly, enemy demons in dungeons are represented by amorphous sprites of blue digital static instead of 3D models resembling what the demons actually look like.  When your character sprite bumps into one of the blue blobs of digital static, a battle is initiated, but you really can't tell what you are going to fight until after the battle starts.  Later in the game, the presentation gets even lazier, as world map navigation is done by moving a green arrow around a map.  In other words, unlike other RPGs where you move around the world map with a sprite that looks like your character, the developers replaced the sprite with a simple green arrow.  On the world map, encounters are again initiated when your green arrow bumps into a circle of blue digital static.  IMO, this lack of attention to presentation is lazy and makes the game less engrossing.The gameplay is a cross between Pokemon and old-school RPG's like the Dragon Quest series.  Battles take place between your party (your player-character, up to three of your demons, and an ally) and the enemy.  The battle screens are very similar to Dragon Quest, in that all you see is a 2D anime-style sprite drawing of your enemies on a generic background.  Your party takes turns doling out attacks and can earn extra moves by getting critical hits or using an attack that the enemy is vulnerable to.  Your party can also lose turns by missing with their attack or using an attack that the enemy is immune to.  The enemy is also subject to these same rules.This relative simple rule-set results in a battle system that you'll either find challenging and enjoyable, or arbitrary and frustration.  It is challenging in that it offers the opportunity to strategize the makeup of your team and their moves to exploit the weakness of your enemy.  It can be frustrating in that you are often vulnerable to being combo'd to death by enemies using attacks that your party is weak to, giving the enemy party multiple turns to wipe out your party.As a result, a boss battle will typically involve this sequence of gameplay: an initial encounter with a new boss to \"feel out\" his strengths and weaknesses.  If it's an easy boss, or you're just lucky and happen to have a party that is built the right way, maybe you can kill the boss on your first try.  More often though, you'll die on your first try, but hopefully get some intel on what element the boss is weak to and what element its attacks are.  Then, you grind your way to building a party that can exploit the bosses weaknesses and resist the bosses attacks.Building your party is a lot like Pokemon.  Most \"regular\" enemy demons you encounter can be recruited via the \"Talk\" command.  Negotiating with demons is another aspect of SMT4's gameplay that might frustrate some players because a lot of demons will troll you hard.  Many demons will ask for money, items, or even free attacks against the player.  A lot of times, they will ask arbitrary questions with arbitrary \"correct\" answers.  A lot of times, acquiescing to a demon's demands will result in the demon laughing at your and running away after collecting your gifts.  Recruitment often requires multiple attempts to \"learn\" the demon's personality and be able to predict what answers will satisfy them.  Personally, I found demon recruiting to be rather amusing, because it's akin to trying to make friends with anonymous users on an Internet message board.  Sometimes it's straightforward, other times you have to figure out how to make friends with a troll.  However, I can see how this aspect of the game can be a turn-off for others.New demons can also be created by \"fusing\" two or more demons already in your party.  You are allowed to see the results of any fusion before you commit to it, and review the new demon's stats and moves to see if it's an upgrade.The game has a seemingly infinite number of demon types.  The design of each demon is very creative, in a Lovecraft-ian type way.  However, one of the aspects of the game that I found somewhat frustrating is the fact that the demon types are so bizarre it's hard to keep track of each demon's strength and weaknesses.  Sometimes the demons will have a name and appearance that relates to their type (like the Jack Frost demon, who looks like a snowman and is predictably strong against ice attacks and weak against fire attacks).  Most of the time, demons will have bizarre names and appearances, so who knows what they do.The same could be said for the names of the moves in the game Healing spells are called 'Dia' or 'Media,' while 'Agi' is a fire attack, and 'Tarukaja' is a buff that increases your party's attack power.  Thankfully, you are told what each move does when you hover over them, minimizing the inconvenience.  Still, I sometimes wish the moves were given more obvious names so it is quicker to scan a movelist and know what each move does.In sum, SMT4 is a very niche game that will appeal to gamers who appreciate the challenge and are looking for something different from the familiar tropes used in most video games.  Buy the game if you don't mind dying a lot, and don't mind a substantial amount of grinding and exploration.  However, if you are a casual gamer or someone who is turned off by the oddball setting or minimalist presentation, SMT4 will not be for you.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive.

You roam through a fantastic world chasing down enemies with your arsenal of living creatures.The game is extremely well animated and rendered, with a variety of creatures that you immediately connect with. There are little multi-teethed killer Fuzzles, the oh-so-cute Chippunks, flying creatures, smelly creatures, and more. You fire all of these with your crossbow, wreaking mayhem on your enemies.The theory here is that you're trying to capture as many bad guys as you can alive, to get the largest bounty for them. Different enemies call for different capture techniques. Some require the flying monsters, while others need to be wound up in a cocoon. It's all done with an \"old west\" motif, with drawling, laconic discussion and dusty, tumbleweed landscapes.We love the game. The dialogue is brilliant at times, the gameplay is engaging. Your ammo is just so much fun! They talk back to you, laugh as they are flung at the enemies and have a variety of attack styles. When you run out, you just go to a patch of weeds and track down some more.The game goes between first person and third person and does so rather well. My only real complaint is with the camera, which at times gets caught behind buildings and other obstacles.The game guides you along nicely. You are pursuing bounty person X, you know their hideout area, you go there and find them. It keeps you moving along in the right direction.If there's a real complaint, it is that the game does NOT work on the XBox 360. This is one of the only reasons we were holding onto our ancient XBox system and I would much rather be playing this on the XBox 360.

Looking at the scores already here on Amazon.com, I completely understand and can agree with most of them.  As such, it's hard to really place a score on this new device.  Honestly, I don't think there's been such a contentious electronic device launch like the PSP Go in...well, recent memory.  Having refreshed the PSP what feels like a hundred times already, Sony, presumably feeling the sting from Apple's success with the iPhone/iTouch as a digital gaming device, decided to refresh the PSP yet again.  And herein lies the problem.The Go gets rid of the UMD feature of all of the previous PSPs and embraces the digital world in a remarkable way for a gaming device.  Without getting too far into the \"owning versus not owning debate\" (let's keep this civil), a lot of people have flocked to the iPhone's bite-sized, digital-only gaming and Sony's new direction is pretty much inevitable.  If a way of presenting games is making money, a company will always follow suit.  The problem is that with the lack of a UMD drive, Sony's faithful who've purchased at least one PSP in the past are left high and dry.  For individuals who have a nice UMD collection going, this move can only be met (and has understandably been met) with vitriol, with calls of \"why are you ignoring us?\"  There was talk, at one point, of having a UMD transfer system that would allow gamers to somehow turn their UMD into a digital purchase. This was scrapped in the USA even though, from the sounds of it, Sony Europe still has a program for some games.  Then there's the issue of the price.  Buyers can easily purchase the slightly older PSP-3000 for about $170, $80 less than the PSP Go's $250 price point.  To make matters worse, any of the digital products being released for the PSP Go will work on prior models, as long as they have a memory stick.  Yikes.All of this history going into today leaves the question is the PSP Go worth it?  Well, that kind of depends (with one huge caveat I'll mention in a bit) on the consumer.  The Go is about 16% lighter and 35% smaller than the PSP-3000 (more so for the original PSP) and has a slick sliding system that hides the keys.  When closed, it's roughly the same size as an iPhone, a tad longer, wider and rounder but almost the same size.  Unlike the other PSPs, this one does seem a lot more portable.  It also does look and feel like a nice expensive piece of electronics.  I remember when I first held the original PSP in my hands and it felt like an expensive system; this brings back memories of that day.  While it doesn't have the UMD drive, it does come with 16 GB of storage space (which could cost you $60ish to get the same amount of space on the PSP 3000).  One of the bigger new features, though, is the Bluetooh technology.  The latest firmware update (available today) will allow tethering to your cell phone, which, if your plan allows for it, will allow you to use your cell phone as modem if you don't have Wi-fi available.  It's a nicety and one I won't be able to use (thanks AT&T;) but somehow I don't think a cell phone, even 3G, will be strong enough to consistently play online or be quick for downloads.Not much comes in the box.  You get a cell phone-like charging kit, based on a new framework for charging.  It's kind of a \"one jack fits all\" multi-purpose plug-in.  The cord has a USB connector on one side and the cell-phone-like plug-in for the PSP.  This same jack will be used for other purposes like TV out, etc.  This means that any of your old accessories won't work on the new system.  It also comes with a voucher to download the PSP Go version of Rock Band Unplugged; this version is free to start out and comes with five songs (\"Buddy Holly,\" \"ABC,\" etc.) and then you just buy additional tracks &agrave; la carte.  The demo for Patapon 2 comes pre-loaded, as well.  The final thing, besides the manual, is the Media Go software which you can also download from the internet, to purchase games on your PC to transfer to your PSP.  Nothing fancy.  As a quick update, I've had more time to mess around with it and have started using the Media Go to download files.  Like a cell phone, you can plug the PSP Go into your computer through it's power/USB jack to charge the phone.  Media Go acts like iTunes (and has a similar skin) so you can download games through Media Go, directly to your PSP Go.  It's a lot faster.  As an example, it took me around the same time to download/install God of War (over 1 GB) via Media Go as it did Castlevania: Symphony of the Night (200ish MB) via the PSP Go 802.11b Wi-fi.  The synching process will be familiar to anyone who's used iTunes or Zune software and is actually a bit easier and quicker, even if it takes an additional step.So, again, is it worth it?  This brings us back to that one caveat: the price.  If you're not a current PSP owner, have embraced digital-only gaming and don't mind dropping $250 (as a comparison, you could get an Xbox 360 or a Wii for that price or less; or, for $50 more, a PS3) on a \"new\" gaming system that is technically about four years old in terms of games (meaning, not a \"next generation\" PSP), then yes.  The PSP Go is a worthy purchase.  It's still the same PSP, a strong, powerful device that has a good assortment of fun games.  Even when the most angry at the product, you have to admit that.  It's just a great device, whatever version you buy.  But it's just not as well-rounded and consumer-beneficial as the older, cheaper models.  So, if you're not that person above, either keep (or upgrade to) the PSP-3000 and you have the benefit of not only getting all the new digital games and \"minis\" available today but also play UMDs.I like mine and am glad I purchased it.  I love the portability of it and the lack of UMDs.  But, I'll be honest, the PSP-3000 is still a cheaper and more well-rounded option.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2009"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Mixed bag","reviewText":"With an ever growing list of games being made based on older, classic films (the Godfather, From Russia With Love, the upcoming Dirty Harry), it seems kind of natural for the Al Pacino gangster classic Scarface to make the transition as well, and it's finally here.  The eagerly awaited Scarface: The World is Yours puts you in the shoes of Tony Montana as you are on a mission of revenge to reclaim your empire and blow away anyone standing in your way.  Now the first thing you'll notice here is that Tony looks like Al Pacino (unlike Michael Coreleone not looking like him in the Godfather game), but the Pacino sound-alike voicing Tony isn't very good.  The graphics aren't too bad and serve their purpose, while the environments are varied enough and resemble the early 80's Miami location of the film.  The controls should feel right at home for the most part for veterans of GTA, the cars handle very well, the game is easy to pick up and play, and there's a decent amount of music and songs from the film's soundtrack that reflect the era.  And that's all the good points of Scarface, and after that, it's all downhill.  The voice acting is horrible and the dialogue is even worse, even though it is humerous to hear Tony curse when no one is around.  Not to mention that when you remove the Scarface license, the game is just a generic GTA clone that overdoes on the cursing, language, and violence (then again, this is Scarface after all, so it pretty much hits the nail on the head).  However, my biggest gripe with the game is only because I am a lifetime fan of the film, and it may not sit well with others as well, but that depends on how much you value the film.  The game's beginning takes place at the end of the movie, as Tony's estate is being swarmed by assassins and you have to blast your way out.  As we all know, Tony died at the end of the film (and there's no coming back from all the bullets he took, let alone the fall from the balcony) and the game changes it all around just to justify itself.  If you can get over that, you'll find a somewhat enjoyable GTA-clone that makes good on it's source material, but there was a lot of wasted potential here to make something really special.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2006"}

He is trained in the ways of war, but as he seeks out his friends and tries to take down the pirate leader, Vaas, he risks losing his soul as the violence and conflict intensifies.Far Cry 3 is the third title in the Far Cry franchise, though it is not a true sequel. It does not share any story or character elements with its two predecessors and can be played fully independently of them. What it does share is the same ethos: a dedication to providing a story-driven single-player experience within a sandbox environment, giving the player immense freedom in deciding how to proceed.Far Cry 2 was heavily criticised for featuring a similar approach, but not doing enough with it. The game's annoyances - almost non-existent characterisation and of course the frequent road checkpoints with near-instantly respawning enemies which made travel across the map excruciatingly frustrating - overwhelmed the game's conceptual strong points, such as its 'buddy' NPC system and rich atmosphere. The designers of Far Cry 3 seem to have borne the previous title's problems in mind and provided a counter for every one of them whilst reinforcing those elements that did work. In short, Far Cry 3 finally fulfils the potential its predecessor squandered, and redeems the franchise.The game employs a number of different systems which work in tandem to make it more engrossing for the player. There's a campaign story which you can follow, in which Brody rescues his friends one-by-one before trying to kill Vaas and his ally, the drug-runner Hoyt. However, at the start of the game Brody is a nobody with no combat training and no ability to carry lots of guns around. To improve your chances of survival, you can undertake training missions for the Rakyat or go hunting animals to improve your aim. Skinning these animals also allows you to craft holders, bandoliers and backpacks, allowing you to carry more ammo and gear. However, your map at the start of the game is almost devoid of any useful information: to open up more map information, you have to ascend radio towers and download information from them. Travelling around the islands is also hazardous due to enemy checkpoints and strongholds. To reduce the number of enemies roaming the islands, taking out these outposts is essential. Unlike Far Cry 2's instantly-respawning bases, however, the outposts in Far Cry 3 stay cleared once cleared. In fact, Rakyat forces soon show up and these outposts become havens for resupply and re-equipping between missions. Outposts also generate their own missions, with side-quests, further hunting challenges and assassination assignments becoming available.In short, there is rarely a lack of something to do in Far Cry 3. It's up to you whether you pursue the single-player storyline to the exclusion of everything else, or put it on hold whilst clearing up all the side-quests first, or (more satisfyingly) mix and match as you proceed. There are whiffs of the Elder Scrolls and GTA series in the game's freeform structure, with the same potential for unintentional dark comedy: laying down a minefield to trap  unwary enemies only for the mines to be detonated by a wayward crocodile, or standing triumphant at the entrance to a freshly-liberated outpost only to be run over by a jeep carrying your over-exuberant allies. The game's addition of upgradeable skills and experience points continues the franchise's evolution into a pseudo-RPG, whilst it is a huge improvement over both its predecessors due to its much stronger characters. I can't remember the name of a single NPC from Far Cry 2, but the likes of Vaas, Hoyt and Citra definitely rank amongst the more memorable characters from recent first-person shooters.Graphically, the game is lush and even beautiful. Whilst not quite the equal of the still-astonishing Crysis in its depiction of a jungle environment, it is still a remarkable graphical environment. Combat is much more satisfying than its predecessor, with a pleasing mix of long-range sniper and close-up assault options. The 'magic binoculars' from Far Cry (and missing from FC2) return, allowing you to 'tag' enemies and keep track of them even through walls. Whilst still being completely nonsensical, they are nevertheless a vital and welcome tool to help plan attacks.On the negative side, the game is tonally disjointed. The main storyline features a thematic element in which your character's evolution from urban city-dweller to mystical jungle warrior (complete with magical tattoos) is commented on, with a sideline in musings on the corrosive effects of violence on the soul. Whilst it remains interesting that a game which features shooting people in the head actually takes time out to dwell on the consequences of such violence, it's also the case that this element is not particularly developed very far. Also, every violent game of recent note has done this, leading to the suspicion that such an element is being thrown in as a sop to justify its violence rather than a genuine attempt at commentary. Less philosophically, the game sometimes feels like a bit of a mish-mash between a linear, story-driven adventure and an open-world free-for-all, with the two sides of the game not meshing as well as they good.Ultimately, Far Cry 3 (****) is a ridiculous amount of fun. As a pure first-person shooter, it's the finest example the genre has thrown up in several years. It's a careful and successful refinement of the best elements of its predecessors, with the negative factors mostly removed. Whilst not as broodingly atmospheric as the recent Dishonored, in terms of a game being a sheer joy to play, it's a triumphant success and one of the best games of the year.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2012"}

{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"Jack Treese \"Jack\"","summary":"After a month, still no regrets","reviewText":"Shortly before Christmas, I decided to take the plunge and purchase a Wii U Deluxe set.  Here, I'll discuss my experience setting the console up for the first time and follow it up with my likes and (very few) dislikes with the new Nintendo system.The night I brought my system home, I knew to expect a lengthy update and install process.  So I took my time setting the system up and I let the Wii U GamePad fully charge before the first-time setup and update.  After 2.5 hours of charge time, I proceeded with the first-time set-up, but for one reason or another I couldn't get the Wii U to connect to my home network.  It was relatively late at this time (around 10:30PM) so I gave up trying and played some Nintendo Land until I got tired.The next morning, I attempted connecting again to no avail.  So I contacted Nintendo, whom was very helpful but couldn't solve my issue.  After contacting my Internet provider and tweaking my firewall settings, the Wii U finally connected to my network and the update began downloading.Now, about the update itself... I've read all over the place all sorts of nightmare stories about the first-time update, with stories ranging from long update/install times to systems crashing or bricking.  I'm happy to say that I probably had the rare case of the update not being nearly as bad.  Not only did the update download AND install within an hour, but not once did the console freeze or crash during the process.  Hope for the best but prepare for the worst, I guess.  After the main update, there were no more connection issues, and I was able to update the on-board apps such as Netflix and YouTube.  The Nintendo Land update was sorta obnoxious to wait for, but I can't complain because unlike its predecessor, at least Wii U has patching in the first place.Console Pros/ConsPROS:-FINALLY, an HD Nintendo system!-Smoother menu interface-Ability to swap between screens;  One screen can have the menu while the other shows your MiiVerse.-Still quieter than every console available-Four USB ports, perfect for charging controllers and utilizing external hard drives-Speaking of, memory expandable with external hard drives-Compatible with all your Wii games and accessories-Transferring from Wii to Wii U is surprisingly easy-Most titles available via downloadCONS:-Slow OS (which Nintendo has said will be fixed through patches)-Not compatible with GameCube games, CDs, DVDs, Blu-rays, etc.-The eShop looks boring, like it's begging for an overhaul-Dismal amount of storage space; an external hard drive is necessary if you want to download many full retail titlesGamePad Pros/ConsPROS:-Despite its looks, is very comfortable in the hands-Does not require a TV for most of the basic functionality, and even with a good amount of the games-The screen looks just as good as an HDTV-The speakers are surprisingly loud and detailed-Built-in microphone and camera-Can be used as a universal remote for your TV and cable/satellite receiver, and is arguably the best one out there-The buttons never feel out of reachCONS:-Not every game can be played with ONLY the GamePad-Battery life is obnoxiously short; third-party battery recommended when available-You'll need a second power outlet available to charge the GamePad((I'd point out the Pros and Cons of Nintendo Land, but I'll save that for a separate game review.))The Deluxe set also comes with an HDMI cable, a GamePad stand, a charging cradle, and an exclusive Deluxe Digital Promotion.  This promotion gives you 10% back (in points, of course) for every game you purchase on the Wii U eShop.  If you have an external hard drive, this is an amazing opportunity to rack up some free eShop cash.If you're looking to jump into the next generation of games with Nintendo, the Wii U is definitely an awesome console to have.  You might want to hold off if you're looking for some new games to play, but for gamers like me that have been excited about this console since its initial announcement, it's totally worth the hype.  I currently log more hours on my Wii U than my PS3.Thanks for checking out my review!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2013"}

So I bought the game.MotoStorm is a one-of-a-kind racer that gives you all the highs you want from a game racer.

The speed -- and the associated adrenaline rush -- are exactly what a gamer wants in a game.  In the fun arena, no other game beats this one.Unfortunately the game is ultimately a short one.  With only eight tracks and one single-player mode, it's bound to get boring.  I'm still enjoying the solo experience but I can imagine very soon I'll start playing online.

{"product_name":"B00BGA9YZK","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Harley","summary":"Save your money","reviewText":"Sadly, I knew from the opening sequence that this game wasn't going to be very good.  I had high expectations that were not only not met but actually dashed to bits.  In a nutshell, this game stinks.First is the environment.  Forget the lush visuals of the trailers and promos. at least 80% of the game will be spent in dark rooms, hallways, corridors, outer space, spacecraft, vent shafts and other drab environments.  Second, the navigation stinks.  The navigation and objective markers are very confusing at times. And that's only when the directional objective marker actually feels like appearing (there were several times I tried to invoke it, only to get a text display of my objective and nothing more).  It can be more confusing than helpful at times, especially when it rotates 360 degrees, like when you're in outer space, zero gravity or on a multi-level structure.  And some of the mission objectives are just downright confusing.  You'll get a vague hint like \"assist so and so\" but it doesn't tell you that this assistance involves several steps that aren't very intuitive.The weapons for the most part are decent but there are major shortcomings.  For instance, the game loves to put you in rooms full of ammunition and weapons like you're in a candy store but you can only carry a ridiculously small supply. You get one primary weapon, one secondary and a max capacity refill of reach. There are two types of grenades but you can only carry one type at a time.  When you're looking at a weapon on the ground, you can see the specs for it but the lame comparison leaves a lot to be desired.  Instead of orange and green bars to indicate more or less power, just do a side by side.  The worst glitch with the weapons is that some of them will simply refuse stop working and refuse to fire.  There is no explanation, no little text message to say \"too close to target\" an indication that the weapon is empty or anything.  Nope, you just sit there pressing R2 like a maniac while getting riddled by the enemy.  As if ridiculous cheapness were';t enough, the AI enemies even do little victory dances over your body and take cell phone pics of their kill.  So after the game fails on you, it celebrates its failure in tacky fashion.There are adrenaline packs that you can use during battle.  They will restore your health and also give you a temporary slowed down Matrix style \"bullet time\" boost.  It's helpful when facing a few enemies but pretty much useless when needed most, against scores of enemies as you'll encounter in the latter stages of the game.  Like the weapons, they also seem to disappear without warning when you need them most.  I'll start a new section with a full supply of adrenaline packs but somehow go down and see the message \"no adrenaline packs available\".The tactical echo and O.W.L. were the only two things that really stood out about the game and even they had their faults.  They are usually excellent tools in your arsenal, especially for helping  deal with the darker environments.  The tactical echo acts almost like a heat sensor, displaying enemy silhouettes through walls, doors or floors.  The O.W.L. is your personal drone that is capable of providing a shield, attacking enemies, disabling enemy shields and hacking computer systems which accomplishes numerous objectives like disabling alarms, opening doors, navigating ships, disabling security systems, etc. Unfortunately, when you use the most useful features like shield and pulse, it quickly drains the O.W.L. and it will end up off in a corner recharging when you really need it.  Also, as far as engagement, although it occasionally kills enemies, (more in the beginning than latter stages), by the last few chapters of the game, it amounts to little more than a distraction and hacking device.  99% of the enemies will need to be dispatched by you.All in all, I played the game only because I paid for it. I can wholeheartedly say if this were offered free as a PS-Plus game of the month or some other deal, I likely would have deleted it by now.  I would not buy the game again if given the chance all over again, but everyone has different tastes.  My advice is to watch a couple play through videos online just to get a grasp of the environment you'll actually be playing in versus the much prettier environments shown in the ads.  Might not hurt to rent it first as well, if you're able to do so.  Otherwise, grab it in a bargain bin as cheap as possible or wait to see if Sony offers it as a free PS plus game (highly likely in the near future) if you simply must have it.However, if frequently getting lost in dark environments with malfunctioning weapons and vague directives while having enemies twerk over your body and take cell phone pics after a ridiculously cheap kill seems like fun, then dive on in.  This is the game for you!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2014"}

There is allot to like about this game, though unfortunately it has some shortcomings as well. On the plus side the action is top notch. The \"futuristic\" weapons are fun to use and offer a bit of fresh air on the traditional \"pistol, shot gun, flame thrower\" mix that one usually expects in these types of games. Furthermore the enemies are challenging, and to successfully defeat them you have to \"strategically\" target various body parts to most efficiently put them down, simply put the combat is very very fun. Next the environments are beautiful, the various places you will go are reminiscent of a big budget sci fi movie. On the negative side the story is quite poor and does not develop/conclude in a manner that is at all engaging or satisfiying. Furthermore the game is quite short, it is a 10-12 hour experience. Now even though the story is dissapointing, those 12 hours of gameplay are very challenging and very fun. If this game had a more fully developed/executed story this would be a 5 star game. That not being the case 3 and a half stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYV70","description":"","reviewerName":"Private Quentin Tarantino Fan","summary":"One of the Best Single Player FPS I've Ever Played 93%","reviewText":"Visuals-95/100 (Beautiful Game All Around. Hampered slightly by weird facial animations and minor technical hiccups)Story-90/100  (Exciting Plot Anchored by an great cast of characters)Sound-95/100 (Excellent Voice Acting, music, and sound effects)Game Play-100/100 (Utterly Intoxicating sandbox style shooter with echos of open world role-playing games)Multi-player-30/50 (Generic, boring Multi-Player.  I'd recommend against buying Far Cry 3 if you were solely interested in multi-player)Lasting Appeal-100/100 (With all the stuff to do, you can easily spend around 40 hours or so.  Not to mention it's a game you WILL want to play more than once)If Far Cry 3 has taught me anything, it's the fact that the FPS genre is far from dead.  Yes, the genre is over cluttered these days, but there are those certain titles within the industry that aim to provide the genre with innovation and excitement.  Far Cry 3 is one of those games.  Far Cry 3 finds its own identity through its own niche gaming experience.  Even better, Far Cry 3 ends up being even more ambitious and unique than Far Cry 2, while being absent of the big missteps that plagued the second game.  While Far Cry 3 is yet another FPS that features worthless MP, its single player is worth the price alone.  For me, it's definitely the best in the Far Cry series, as well as one of the few FPS you should care about in 2012 regardless of your genre preferences.Far Cry 3's story has certainly been one of its tantalizing aspects all throughout the game's numerous previews.  The plot itself isn't going to turns head by itself, but its characters drive the plot to a point where every action has weight, and everything is shrouded in thick human vice.  It all boils over into complete depravity, and its been quite the experience watching these personalities come into play.  Sure, we've seen characters like these all over the media spectrum before, but there is something about them that transforms them from yawn inducing pot boiling shlock, to something that feels credible and downright dangerous.  It's also delightfully engrossing watching these characters because they are so interesting.  Populated with sociopathic pirates, volatile and terrifying crime lords, primal, dazed yet strangely idealistic drug dealers, and more, Far Cry 3 makes sure the personalities all play important roles throughout your journey.  Voice acting in particular is excellent, making sure the characters come alive.  It's a great tale to be sure, and I can't wait to see how it ends.At its most basic level, Far Cry 3 is a sandbox open-world FPS.  Huge sandbox maps let you tackle objectives in numerous ways, and this is only complimented by a open world packed with locations and space that all adds up to the game's immense depth.  Even better, Far Cry 3's weapon and health systems both recall the days of BioShock/Half-Life 2 than the Halo/COD model we're all sick of by now.  Health does not regenerate at first (you can later, however, get a skill that adds some regenerating power), and the weapon wheel at hand lets you carry more than two weapons at a time.  Your character grows to be agile and able to of nifty features you eventually unlock that make combat a joy to converse with.  Finally, the game offers plenty of ways to make your character do more than just shoot.  Far Cry 3 offers both currency and experience points to make sure the game play experience is more personalizing and diverse than it previously was.  You can use currency and experience points to offer your character a plethora of options and opportunities to create better weapons, inventories, and items, as well as honing your own skills in general.Far Cry 3 uses its huge (and I mean huge) open world, emergent systems, animals to turn on your opponents, diverse customizations, and RPG elements that gives Far Cry 3 a huge advantage over its staid contemporaries.  Far Cry 3 uses its pedigree, Far Cry 2, as inspiration, without the poor design choices that bogged down the aforementioned (no guns jamming, no malaria, no enemy re-spawning to infinity, no horribly placed checkpoints, etc).  Much of the game's revisions has been made on fan feedback, and as a result Far Cry 3 is a much better game compared to the second.  For example, once you capture a radio tower, it's yours.  Ditto for any of the point locations you capture.  Once you capture these, you can use them as save points, which also double as fast travel points.  I hated the absence of this in Far Cry 2, and the inclusion of all of these makes Far Cry 3 much better to play.  The environment also comes into play, such as fire and the animals.  Also, like Far Cry 2, fire spreads, and you need to use that to your advantage.  Far Cry 3 is not a game that encourages you to stick with a few weapons and tactics.  Use everything you have, and play as creatively as possible.  If you do, Far Cry 3's game play possibilities will unlock for you.Far Cry 3 takes some lessons from modern RPGs with a skill system, organized into the form of three skill trees.  While the Skill trees available are not in abundance as they are in a proper RPG, as only three exist in total.  However, while there are only three, it more than makes up for the amount of satisfying and useful skills available.  As you progress more and more into the game, you'll find yourself eventually chaining knife attacks in succession, moving around with the agility of a seasoned hunter, selling and trading at a lower price, managing weapons like a trailed warrior and a lot more as you slowly become master of the island.  What's more, I've heard from many players (from professional reviewers to my European counterparts who got the game before us Americans and finished most of it) is that it's possible to max out every skill through the course of the game.  All of the skills I've acquired so far are useful, and they make the game all the more .  Aside from the skill system, Far Cry 3 also has a heady dose of crafting and gathering to offer news ways to engage in game.  These promises offer tons of reasons to gather, hunt, and collect cash from the island at large.You know all that open land available?  There's a reason why it all exists.  If you don't gather and hunt, your not going to make it very far in the game.  Luckily, the rewards are vast and interesting.  With around animal species to hunt, and tons of material to collect (plants, mushrooms, the works), hunting and gathering is addicting and leads to many memorable encounters as a bonus.  Hunting is used for gathering essential materials and you can use these to craft ways to hold more ammo, and other materials.  Gathering plants is like gathering materials for magic.  You'll end up being able to use potions for enhancing various aspects of your own human ability.  The ability to use cash round it out, and the numerous shops around the island let you customize and purchase weapons.  You'll be able to get standard such as cross-hairs and suppressors, as well as much more interesting things like grenade launcher attachments.  It's a blast exploring to beef up your arsenal, and it's as rewarding and fun as some of the best open world games I've played.Aside from the combat related exploration, Far Cry 3 offers some fun things to do.  The mini games have an echo of Red Dead, and even though I'm not much a fan of mini-games in my games, there's some pretty leisurely fun things to do.  Also, be on the look out for pieces of back-story information around the world, which very much works like Dishonored did with its numerous books, papers, letters, and so on.  With so many things to complete, PLUS the desire to play through the game again thanks to the fact that you can do same tasks in different ways, there is more than enough reasons to get Far Cry 3 as a single player game.  The general consensus from both professional reviewers and our European counterparts is the main story lasts around 15-20 hours.  With all of the other content, it can easily be much longer than that.  This is one single player game that does not fall short on providing value.Now, to multi-player.  As much as I hate to admit it, the MP doesn't come close to the single player game.  Unlike the unique single player experience, Far Cry 3's brand of MP ends up being the weak link of the package, both in terms of co-op and regular MP combat.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad feature, but there is little to nothing new Far Cry 3 does over other games.  Little of the open world and emergent aspects of the single player experience are transferred over to the MP experience, and as a result, you get the same brand of death match/\"Capture the point!\"/destroy parts of the base/whatever else counts as MP.  Play matches, level up, use perks to upgrade your overall load out.  Haven't we seen all of this before?  Sure, it's a fun mode, but my god, there's NOTHING new.  It doesn't help either that the maps you play on are cramped as all hell, making sure the game's amazing core game play is lost.  Even with better designed maps, though, Far Cry 3 does nothing new with competitive MP, and it's not really worth tinkering about with.Co-op is a *little* better, but not by much.  It tries to sell itself upon its storyline, but unlike the single player, the story falls flat.  The characters are completely unappealing, the plot is generic, and nothing compelling happens.  Aside from that, game play is just bland.  Much like the competitive MP, it falls flat due to a lack of identity.  The same objectives, the same game play models, it's just so overwhelming bland.  Even worse, you almost need to rely on almost four people.  If you don't, be prepared for an absolutely miserable experience.  Yeah, it's an amusing diversion overall, but there's little justification to playing \"generic shooting arcade\" co-op while much superior co-op games like Left 4 Dead, Ghost Recon, SWAT 4 (extremely underrated!), Rainbow Six, and Borderlands 2 all exist, offer great game play, and actually stand out from the pack.  Play those games instead of this generic copy cat.I didn't even bother trying to make MP maps with the map editor, because I found the overall MP game play to be so generic.  Granted, the multi-player is in it's early stages, so the inclusion of the map editor, ehhh....*MIGHT* help remedy the cramped, generic MP maps, but the potential for great maps to play on rests solely on the community.  It's a bit too early, but I can see the (non-dedicated) servers for the MP being dead within a month.  I can name plenty of games off the top of my head that had MP die out as fast as a fly lives its lifespan.  I know I sound a little harsh, but I speak from experience.  There are much better MP games that don't suffer from an identity crisis like Far Cry 3 does.  So don't bother getting Far Cry 3 if you're interested in the MP.Despite that, any one looking for a lengthy, quality SP experience should make Far Cry 3 a must play.  For me, this is definitely the best game in the Far Cry franchise.  Opinions definitely differ, but previous entries in the Far Cry franchise have left me cold.  I didn't like the original Far Cry; its generic story, boilerplate shooting, horrid AI, god awful mutant narrative judo, and pathetic \"open\" world, all turned me off.  Far Cry 2, while a good game, was hampered by poor game design decisions combined with some poorly implemented game mechanics.  It didn't quite jell together, and as a result the game felt uneven.  But I digress.  Whether or not you are a newcomer, former doubter, or a veteran of the franchise, it all doesn't really matter in the end.  Far Cry 3 is simply a damn fine game.  Anyone who is looking for an ambitious alternative from the generic shooter market should check out this one.  It's absolutely worth your time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2012"}

This package is sweet and a must buy for any Sonic fan. I'll run down the list, game by game:Sonic 1:A great game to pick up and play. The first in the series, and in my opinion, the best (besides Sonic CD). Good graphics, catchy music, perfect level design, tight controls and fast gameplay- this game has it all. Excellent. Only bad thing is there is no save feature (just like the one for Genesis). Still very fun.Grade: ASonic 2:Has better graphics, but is not as good as the original. Still an excellent game though. Still great level design, even catchier music, and a new character (Tails)make this game awesome. A new move was added (Super Dash). Another excellent classic.Final Grade: ASonic 3:Not as good as the others. While the graphics are better, the gameplay isn't. The level design isn't either. What can I say, this game simply isn't as fun. While good, Sonic 3 isn't as good as the previous 2 Sonics.Final Grade: B+Sonic and Knuckles:Great Game here. It adds another character (Knuckles) which adds another dimension to the gameplay. very fun, and good level design. The levels are original and differnt than the other sonic games. Excellent and a classic.Final Grade: ASonic Spinball:While mildly amusing, this Sonic take on pinball is average at best. A bit clunky and the graphics are not very good. The pinball &quot;tables&quot; are boring and the levels are drawn out. Overall, you'll probably play this one for about 5 minutes before going back to playing one of the other games on this disc.Final Grade: CSonic 3D Blast:Ughh. Crappy controls, an isometric point of view, bad levels- this game is bad. Doesn't even feel or play like a sonic game. The graphics aren't even 3D and look terrible. The controls make it feel like Sonic is running on ice. This a clunker and should be avoided. Not even close to worthy of the Sonic name.Final Grade: D-Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine:This is an excellent puzzle game. Very addictive and deceptively simple gameplay. Good controls. Everything a good puzzle game should be: easy to learn, hard to master. A classic.Final grade: AOverall, this collection will give you hours of Sonic fun. Whether you've been a Sonic fan for years or are just getting into the blue blur, you should buy this collection. The games stand the test of time and are excellent. A great collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2004"}
{"product_name":"B002BS47JE","reviewerName":"Margaux Paschke","summary":"A GREAT UPGRADE!","reviewText":"I bought wii Fit a few months ago and addedEA Sports Activeto the mix to have a great exercise regime that I can stick too and save money over annual gym membership.  But a newer and improved Wii Fit?  Crap on a stick!  Then I heard that the wii balance board was the same and that I could purchase just this software to upgrade my old Wii Fit to Wii Fit Plus.  Really?  Well after buying this I can say - yes, really.  Installing this new software was a breeze.  It took a minute to transfer all of my information from my original Wii Fit files and seamlessly add them to Wii Fit Plus.The problem with the old Wii Fit was that you could only pick one exercise at a time and there too much time spent recalibrating the Wii board between exercises - so it might take 1 hour to do 40 minutes of actual exercising.  I am not a big fan of wasting time.  The biggest advantage of Wii Fit Plus is the ability to choose exercise routines (Lifestyle, Health, Youth & Form) or create one of your own.  Wii Fit suggested combination exercises but you had to do them separately.  The ability to do a string of exercises together is a great feature!  Although I am not sure why only Strength and Yoga exercises are allowed when creating a personalized routine.The balance section of Wii Fit Plus has been updated to include fun balance games that make this a blast!  I know good balance helps posture but you are not going to break a sweat with any of these choices.  The balance challenges are pure fun and I love the new additions to Wii Fit Plus.  And the best part?  There is no need to unlock games - they are all available from the start (with Wii Fit you had to earn certain games).There are several other upgrades (the calorie chart for easy reference, etc.) that are provided in other reviews so I stuck to my two favorites.  For around $19.99 you can seamlessly update your Wii Fit to the newest version with all the upgrades and added features.  No need to spend big bucks for the newest version if you already own Wii Fit.  Thank you Wii for being kind to existing customers.  This purchase is a bargain and worth every penny.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2010"}

Ah...Miranda and Morrigan. Only in my dreams, baby!Game is great. Am savoring it. Got it's good points and a few bad points but overall..off to save the galaxy yet again....A hero's work is never done!Updated note: Am about 12 hours into it. I still love it. It feels a tad different then the 2nd game (my favorite) but I still am enjoying it. I could not stop. For me, if I want to keep playing, that is all the review I need. Only one real complaint....it will be over too soon. Wish it would go on forever. I will miss the characters. But, with this series, I will revisit and play over and over from the first game to the last minute of the 3rd. Thanks Bioware for many many hours of enjoyment. I have enjoyed the books as well.Enjoy everyone and if on 12/21/2012 the reapers come to end the world, well....we will be prepared! Ha! I can make a head shot very well. :DUpdated:I changed my star rating after I beat the game. I am completely confused about the ending. I am not even sure wtf I even chose. I feel exactly like I did at the end of the movie 2001 space odyssey. Dunno..maybe you have to either be a genius or on drugs to understand that ending. I am rather upset and speechless.My final update and ultimate conclusion:I watched the ending again and listened. Trying to fore go the emotions and just listening. I can understand the concept. Also, I did not know there was a cut scene after the credits. By chance, this time, I was busy doing something and did not stop game as credits rolled. Overall, I have enjoyed the series and don't regret playing it. I would have chosen a different ending, however, to leave fans more satisfied. But, without the knowledge as to what, if anything, Bioware plans on doing with the series....I can not give a complete opinion of the ending.Update:I tried playing the game again. I could not get into it. The ending has made the game (and the entire series) have no replay for me just like DA2 so I stand by my 1 star review.Update: 06/26/12I played the DLC just now. I changed my rating from 1 to 4 stars. For me, the ending was much better albeit not the perfect ending I would prefer. That being said...this is why I changed it.1. DLC was free (should have ended that way to begin with..just sayin)2. Conversation with the catalyst was more involved.  I was able to ask deeper questions to get a better understanding of what was what.3. Even thought another choice was given...it would not be a choice I would have chosen even in original ending. But, the choice I would have made and did make given the 3 choices, was more explained, heart felt, and most of all complete. Even though my Shepard perished, he did not do so in vain. He made a difference and that is all I ever wanted.I feel more satisfied now. But, am still a bit angry that it was not written more completely to begin with so no 5 star rating. I must admit, Bioware, with this DLC...has renewed a little faith with me. But, only time will tell if I completely trust them again. At any rate, Thanks for doing the DLC..I know it was not mandatory..but, is appreciated, all the same.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0001ADAME","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution. With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well. As if the technical edge wasn't enough of a reason to invest in the Xbox version, it's also Live Aware, and comes packaged with an exclusive multiplayer level (the Coliseum). Without the slightest hint of doubt, the Xbox version gets The Edge.Concept:Clean up the west as a merciless cowboy in this heavily influenced spaghetti western gameGraphics:The character models are not the most detailed, but the environments look nice and I love the cameraworkSound:A remarkable soundtrack lures players into the vibe of the westPlayability:Unnaturally short levels and satisfactory run and gun actionEntertainment:The stages should have been longer, but replay is abundant in the number of unlockables and enjoyableReplay:ModerateRated:8 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:Buck up, cowpokes. All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Ian","summary":"So close, but not quite","reviewText":"Short Review:Red Dead Revolver has a perfect atmosphere and fantastic soundtrack, but it's lack of checkpoints and brutal difficulty, along with unexciting story and characters don't make it worthwhile.Long Review:Video games are by nature, an industry that thrives on changing and evolving, in response to ever evolving graphics and more powerful hardware and technology.  Gameplay wise, it's now pretty much standard practice to have quicktime events, the ability to save where you like, make every other game a free roaming sandbox, etc.  Likewise, some events also die out, such as having to play through the game in one sitting, not being able to save wherever you like, and interactive movies.Why am I bringing this up?  Because Red Dead Revolver is a perfect example of how some ideas in video games should be left behind for good,and not carried on for years when they should have gone extinct and died long before.Red Dead Revolver is a third person western shooter has you running around the wild west as Red, a stereotypical bounty hunter who doesn't talk a whole lot and prefers shooting people to rationally discussing problems in the hopes of a diplomatic conclusion.  Years ago, your parents were killed in a fiendish raid on your house, and now, decades later, you finally have a chance to take revenge on those who tore your life apart.Like virtually every other third person shooter on the market, Red Dead Revolver (RDR) has you running around levels, shooting bad guys, taking on boss characters, gathering weapons, and going on sneaking and infiltration missions, among others.  In fitting with the western theme, you get to partake in numerous cliches, such as train robberies, ghost towns, mines, and desolate forts.  And just like with it's successor, Red Dead Redemption, RDR absolutely oozes atmosphere from every angle.  The environments you run through are distinct and varied, and it's always a treat to see what each level has in store, from a train battle on the wide open plains, complete with fields of golden grass, to outposts lit with an overcast sun, to ranches nestled amongst the mountains.  Rounding out the atmosphere is the spectacular musical score, which perfectly embodies the feel of classic Spaghetti Westerns, and the moment you hear it, you really feel like you're in a good, old fashioned western story, ready to hop onto the nearest horse and ride off into the sunset.Unfortunately however, atmosphere can only take a game so far, and when you start getting deeper into RDR, you begin to realize that it embodies some of the most hated tropes in the world of video games...a high difficulty level, and a lack of checkpoints.In fitting with the hostile world in inhabits, RDR is a really hard game.  You'll go up against entire armies of outlaws, militias, and private armies who would love to put a bullet between your eyes, and more often then not, they'll accomplish it.  In and of itself, this isn't a problem (save for those with low tolerance for frustration), but what makes it such a huge problem is the lack of checkpoints.  Despite each level being really small, they're packed with enemies and events that you have to take on one after another, and unfortunately, you often have to complete two or three objectives at a time before you get a checkpoint.  This sounds easy, but in reality, it's anything but.  I lost track of the amount of times I died, only to respawn at the very beginning of the level, thus making me fight through everything all over again, especially on some of the more brutally difficult stages.Unfortunitly, this is especially annoying when it comes to duels, another of the game's biggest problems.  Quick draw gun duels have never really worked in video games, and RDR doesn't break the trend.  The aiming controls are very loose and drifty, and you're always on a time limit before you get shot and killed.  As the game goes on, this limit gets smaller and smaller, until you have perhaps half a second to react, aim accurately, and fire before dying.  The second to last duel for example, took me well almost a dozen tries to complete, and even then, it was pure blind luck that allowed me to pass, not skill.Still, the difficulty and lack of checkpoints could be forgiven if the the story and characters were fascinating to follow, but RDR doesn't succeed in this front.  As the main character, Red is just not that interesting.  For example, he has just three facial expressions:1.  Neutral Smirk.2.  Smug Smirk3.  Angry SmirkCoupled with his sparse dialogue, Red just isn't an interesting character to follow, or root for.  The side characters fare slightly better (and in a nice touch, you even get to play as some of them at certain points), such as the Buffalo soldier, the English gunslinger, etc, but they don't get much in the way of development either, besides basic, \"I want to save my ranch from the evil governor\" motivations, and the whole story eventually finishes with an unsatisfying ending that fails to leave any impression on the player.In a nice touch, after you've completed the single player game, there are some really nice bonuses to unlock, the biggest of which is a duel mode, where you can play against up to three opponents at once in a big shoot out in stages that you can unlock/buy while playing through the main game, and in addition, you can also unlock pages in a journal that acts as a scrapbook.  And there's even a bounty hunter mode, which challenges you to complete levels in certain ways, such as not taking a single hit, finishing it within a time limit, getting kills only with headshots, etc.  Accomplishing such goals will get you some nice bonuses, such as turning blood into glittering stars, invincibility, etc.  All these unlockables really helps to give the game a lot of replay value that you don't see in many other western games, so it's a great touch.Overall, RDR has fantastic atmosphere, an amazing musical soundtrack, and some very nice unlockables, but the high level of difficulty, and uninteresting story ultimately makes RDR not worth recommending.  What's really sad is that the checkpoint problem shouldn't happen.  Checkpoints in video games should be frequent, not frustratingly sparse.  Never once have I encountered a review praising the lack of checkpoints, for everyone hates to replay segments of a game over and over.  Even hard games, like Limbo for the XBox 360, provide very frequent checkpoints, so if you die, you feel determined to try again, and don't feel like you're being harshly punished for failure.  RDR does give the impression that it's unduly punishing you for failing, even though it's the game itself that's brutally hard in the first place.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2010"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Subject7","summary":"Thankfully not as horrifying as I thought","reviewText":"I have always shied away from horror games, not because I'm a wuss or anything, I just don't like being on edge all the time. I was very dubious about picking this up as it's predecessor has one hell of a reputation for being scary. Thankfully while the game is still very creepy and there are a few \"WTF!\" moments sprinkled here and there, the ride was still a ton of fun. This is mostly due to the game's protagonist who's a complete bad@$$, so much so that most of the threats (save Alma the main antagonist...kinda) are almost harmless. He has the ability to enhance his speed thus slowing down the action on screen long enough to pump whatever's bothering him full of lead. The speedy regeneration of this ability, coupled with the copious amount of ammo and gun types lying around means that as long as you're careful, you'll never be caught in a fight you can't handle.Speaking of guns, this game has some of the most satisfying guns I've ever played with. Enemies meet their end in very messy ways with some even being torn in half. The game also includes levels (3 I think) where you pilot a mech which are equally as satisfying. Graphically speaking F.E.A.R 2 holds up well, though it's age shows a little. The story isn't particularly engaging but the action holds you till the end.Overall I liked this game, the scares are there but you never feel helpless. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes shooting things and don't mind 5-10 hours of almost constant goosebumps and an escaped girlish scream here and there.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

Never played the seris, only read about it or talked to people that played it. I know others came out before but I'm a quick learner and can easily catch up on stories, so there was no need or interest for me to get Halo 1-3 plus the other Halo games were in the RTS genre and that's not my cup of tea and honestly that is why I never deeply explored Halo thinking all of Halo was RTS.Halo 4 ended up being an empty experience. The game looks beautiful, music was perfect and the creativity is respectable. The developers deserve high praise for there hard work and they seem to take care of their fan base. That was 2 stars.When it comes to video games, I expect the experience to be addictive, fun, challenging, and of course strategist. Halo 4 had little of each. The MP portion I thought would make up for it because that would be the meat of the game for replayability and after an hour or so of playing Halo 4 overall, I knew I was thru. I took a break to rest my eyes, and that \"gotta play some more itch\" didn't show up. I was like, wow, this game is truly not for me, plus the MP didn't have that realistic feeling.Halo 4 truly is just a Duke Nukem game. Shoot, move to the side, shoot, move behind barrier, stand over enemies gun for more ammo, shoot again, slo-mo jump, enemy killed, cut scene move to next level.I never bought a game and wanted to quickly sale it the same day like I did today.

One catacomb after another. Another meaningless bandit fort. Lets conquer another dwarven ruin that takes 4 hours to get through. Alright...I'm officially insane now.Really: follow a talking dog 5 miles, only to have to have to run halfway across the map 2 times, just to get some weapon that I don't even use. That's a quest?I really did enjoy breaking into every single house in the city and taking everything (I mean everything). Baskets, apples, plates, bowls, everything! Until I couldn't carry anything else, and then going back for more. Everything I stole, I dropped in the middle of the street. Soon, houses were vacant, and the streets were full of so much miscellaneous junk that it was like walking through a garbage dump. Kicking things around and literally wading through piles of useless items in the middle of the city street. Clinking noises when I walk. Eventually I had to go back and pick everything back up (which took a considerable amount of time) because the game was going in slow motion. baskets flying through the air in slow motion, bouncing off of NPC's heads. Fun fun. It does the same thing if your house is too full of alchemic agents also. Or if you kill to many of your A.I. travel buddies in your dining room. Or decorate your house with piles of bones and skulls allover the floor until your kicking bones across the living room.If I was doing all these things, then I must of been bored, right? Maybe, and maybe not. Hey...getting your telekinetic ability up by throwing baskets at people can be a good time. Don't you think?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2013"}

It takes advantage of the touch screen very well.  I have to admit this game is difficult, but the more you play it the better you get at it.  Yoshi Touch and Go has 5 awesome modes which are all a blast.  The modes are Score Attack, Marathon Mode (my favorite), Time Attack, VS. (multiplayer), and Challenge.  It is so creative how you draw clouds and throw eggs, all using the touch screen.  I haven't tried Yoshi's Island DS yet, but since this game is so good I want to try it.  I got this game for $19.99, which is an awesome deal for a game this great.  Try to find this game used somewhere.  It's hard to find it because it was one of the first DS games available.

Love how you can craft just about anything from animal skins you hunt, holsters, mine holder, rucksack, etc.  LOVE the bow.  arrows are inexpensive, reusable and makes for great silent kills.  If you get all silent kills with the bow at an outpost, you get 3x experience.  Many, weapons and alot of them can be customized.  In addition to main quests, lots of side quests, not even including path of the hunter quests, radio towers, outposts, knife throwing, racing, wanted DEAD quests and help you can give to people as you are traveling from place to place.

GoW 3 is an excellent game all around and I enjoyed the ride for all 3 games with Marcus and the gang. As usual the campaign is theatric-like and feels like your playing a movie and with the Gears fighting the Locust/Lambent. 5 Star Story and Single-Player Campaign. The multiplayer is fun as usual, but I knocked a star because of the fact that the inevitable DLC is right around the corner and it is not cheap! I always have a problem with the fact that right after a major title is released, a $20 map pack with 5 maps (many of which rehashed from the previous games) a few weeks later. There is a decent default map selection, but obviously the DLC maps were ready for launch just not included with the retail copy.Overall, GoW 3 is a strong contender for Game of The Year (especially for Xbox 360 GOY) and I recommend this game to fans of the series as well as newbies to the GoW franchise.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2011"}

The price is actually not bad on Amazon right now. Other than that, the game is... where to begin.Deus Ex: Human Revolution was a game I was anticipating to play. The trailers were amazing, and it looked like it would be a nice return for a beloved franchise. One that I never got to play back then I'll reveal, but the story did look very captivating. However, I know for a fact that fans of the first Deus Ex are going to be very disappointed. As for me I'm a huge Metal Gear Solid Fan and I can't but help point out what I saw when playing from beginning to end of DXHR:The game will immediately try to push you towards stealth so you don't get flanked by cumbersome yet mean AI, like MGS. Guards have patrol patterns, there are panning security cameras, and tons and tons of sneaking opportunities with ventilation shafts. Oh yeah, if you do get noticed, go hide somewhere and wait for things to \"cool down.\"You need to eat food to replenish energy, like MGS.... I'm not making this part up.The game lets you \"choose\" how you want to play, but no matter, when a boss encounter occurs, it's figure out the weakness with guns blazing, like MGS. In fact I think you can complete the boss encounters with non lethal weapons. Like so:[...]Characters like Pritchard (spelling?) and Sariff just scream to me Otacon and the Colonel.Some story elements occur, particularly the ending that made me laugh out loud saying, for real? (Spoiler warning) I'm not talking about the end choice, I'm talking about the post credit scene, which was very much like MGS. There was even a battle for the elevator, then descend into the maw of the beast scenario. Plus, who is in control and how do we deal with it aspect of the game. One more time: Like Metal Gear Solid!And let's not forget about the cigarette smoking \"I didn't ask for this\" attitude from the main character. Hmm, oh yeah, like Solid Snake. I'm sure there are more here, but I have be honest and ask why video game critics didn't point this out. I'm not complaining completely, but I though this was supposed Deus Ex, not Metal Gear the First Person Shooter Role Playing Game.What's important though, is it a good game to buy? Of course it is, but for super cheap. The game still has major flaws. Even for mouse and keyboard, it controls very clunky with slight lag that you almost constantly adjust with sensitivity settings. Visually the game environments looks fantastic, but character to NPC dialogues cut scenes look awful when comparing to games like Mass Effect. The voice acting is very questionable. Adam Jensen's voice can contend with Christian Bale's Batman, except Jensen doesn't intimidate me. He sounds like he needs to clear his goddamned throat. It made me want to hear the Chinese dialogues more. Of course I was happy that there were lots of Mandarin languages spoken.The energy mechanic is the big downer. I understand the game would be really easy if we didn't have it, but eating to replenish your cool visual melee abilities?  This is a very dumb design choice for a game like this. Also, anytime you use the kill melee attacks, they somehow are louder. So basically doing the one thing you want to do to a lonesome guard is advised against. (sigh) This really hurts being a force to be reckoned with. So if purchasing this for the PC, find a Mod for unlimited energy. Hacking in the game can get boring with it's mini game aspect. It's nice you can choose to hack or search around for passwords. However, more than likely, you'll want to hack anyway then complain when it constantly says insufficient skill.Even though I thought this was not a unique game experience, this is still a fun Science fiction RPG. The game play length is decently long, but not enough as past Deus Ex fans will inform you. The praxis tech tree is neat and contains very nice upgrades for your choosing or whenever you have enough experience points. It's fun jumping off buildings Batman/Ghost in the Shell style, launching the area effect typhoon projectiles, punching through walls, and lifting heavy objects because you are cyborg. The choice of area progression with descent story elements was enough to make me purchase this very cheap through STEAM. I did like having plenty of choices for getting to my destinations. This and the #$%&ing; great soundtrack are my strong suits for DXHR. Like Vampire The Masquerade, I wished the developers delayed this and went back to the drawing board to either change or tweak what could have been one of the best games ever.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2012"}

{"product_name":"B002V16T0Q","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"Great atmosphere attempts to cover some gameplay blemishes","reviewText":"It is difficult to discuss Metro 2033 and not think about Fallout 3, however the games share very little in common outside of a post-apocalyptic setting. Th story goes that Moscow was obliterated by a nuclear apocalypse and the survivors must endure a harsh existence underground, while renegade gangs and bloodthirsty mutants roam the areas outside the occupied tunnels. That's the meat of the story and your character is one of the fighters who must venture out into both the dark subway tunnels and the nuclear wasteland that was once Moscow. As far as settings go, this is very atmospheric and you constantly feel a sense of dread and claustrophobia as you traverse the tunnels, fighting off waves of enemies while trying to stay alive and conserve ammunition.Metro 2033 is not your typical FPS in that it's not a strictly \"run and gun\" affair that you would expect from a Call of Duty game. You have options on how you want to approach a given situation, and while you can go in guns blazing, it's often better to be stealthy and pick off your enemies one at a time. Your headlamp also plays a big part in the action, since it lights the way but also leaves you vulnerable to enemy gunfire, and you must also be mindful of your gas mask and health needles, since neither are in infinite supply. Taking damage also causes your gas mask visor to crack, obstructing your vision and making it even harder to get around. Anyone looking for challenging combat will be very happy with this game. As far as exploration goes, the atmosphere makes up for fact that the game is totally linear. Unlike Fallout, this is not an open-world affair and there is little opportunity for exploration. Any such time will be spent looting bodies for ammo rather than looking for adventure off the beaten path. This is common for shooters, so I wouldn't qualify it as a weakness.Others have mentioned problems with the graphics and linear campaign, but the only real problem I have with this game is the shooting. The hit detection on the human enemies is terrible and you'll often find that it takes a lot of ammo to gun down one opponent, which is problematic because ammunition is sometimes scarce. It is also difficult aim at enemies with any accuracy, so taking down enemies with headshots and aiming precisely to take them out quickly is not easily done here. The scarcity of the ammo is also a problem since I've often found myself facing a barrage of enemies with only my knife, which makes for a frustrating and unbalanced experience. More attention to the shooting mechanic and hit detection would have vastly improved this game.For all it's faults, Metro 2033 is not a bad game by any stretch and fans of shooters or atmospheric survival games should find something to like here. However, the unrefined combat and unfair challenges do add plenty of frustration, so it's hard to recommend this above other titles, even newer ones like Singularity and even the Wolfenstein remake, which are better in my opinion.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0001VGFK2","reviewerName":"Rex","summary":"Do NOT Listen To Anybody Below 5 Stars or MAVV...","reviewText":"This game has now opened up a whole new breed of videogames. Grand Theft Auto III did it, Vice City continued it and now San Andreas is adding. This game is a combination of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, The Sims, Friday and Boyz in the Hood.Okay, you don't need a story but this is a brief summary. You are a guy named CJ Johnson who moved to Libery City and came back to bury his dead mother, andhe decides to stay because he is framed for murdering a cop by two losers and to \"help out the community\". You are apart of a gang called the Grove Street OJ's.So, you could do anything. This is somewhat an RPG, because you can improve your stats by going to the gym, swimming (finally), and riding bikes. This is no Final Fantasy crap RPG like that, it is a The Sims: Illegal Style along with the Rockstar touch.So, what can you do? You can do anything in the past Grand Theft Auto games, with it a little tweaked and better. They made it more realistic. First your character. You can have him get a haircut from a barber, and I got a fro :). You can go to the gym, and use different machines like lifting weights, dumb-bells, the power bike to improve your stamina and the tredmill. Swimming loses your fat, and you can swim underwater. You can change clothes like in Def Jam Vendetta, by having different combinations.For the other stuff, you got new weapons. You can use a spray can to \"tag up turf\", which is sort of like a hidden-package side mission. There is a fire extinguisher that you can use for both ways, a satchel explosive like from SOCOM, heat-seeking rocket launchers and new melee weapons like a cane, and a shovel. But the newest and coolest addition is the James Bond silenced pistol.You can also play little side games. You can play basketball, videogames in your original house (the best is \"They Came From Uranus\"), recruit gang members and have them peform drive-by's. Did you ever waqnt to dance in the Malibu in Vice City instead of turning around in circles or doing the chainsaw dance? Now you can finally DANCE!!! This comes later int eh game, and I am pretty sure of it.Instead of just being taxi, ambulance and fire missions, you can do extra stuff. The funnest is burglarly. You can go into people's houses and take away their stuff, and get some cash for it. Along with the original stuff like taxi, you can pimp (not sure about that), and be a trucker. Gambling is in the game in Las Vegas, and you can do anything in the casinos.This is just the little things you can do. The missions are great, and there are codes, so don't listen to some of these other people. All the weapon sounds were tweaked, and it sounds better. There are 3 times the amount of cars then in Vice City, and you can do low-rider missions, and a lot of cars trigger different things. You can go into most stores, and you can actually hold up stores without cops storming in. Little things added like shooting in the air and scaring people and other combinations of things like with the melee weapons makes this game much different then any other game out there.But, people, including MAVV, are trying to invade our living rooms. The language went up, but the violence is getting less and less. That doesn't mean it isn't like Vice City, but to nervous parents, this game can be fun for you. This game ain't racist, either. If you don;t want your kids to play violent games, don't let them, but don't drag other people into it. People should just mind their own business.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2004"}

I'll keep this short since many of the other reviewers hit all of my complaints.Overall combat is fun and engaging, graphics are good enough and the variety you get from the pawn system is pretty cool. It's more in the Japanese style, which frankly I don't care for, but it's still a fairly good game. Unfortunately the many flaws grind on you throughout the game and by the time you're finished, you're pretty happy to be done.The pawn system, which so many people love, has some problems. Namely, you can't shut them up! They talk and talk and talk, and it wouldn't be so bad if they had something useful to say, but that is very rarely the case. What's worse, you always have multiple pawns saying the same thing at the same time. It gets very irritating to have dialogue flooding your screen in the middle of combat when you're trying to stay alive.The lack of a good fast travel is simply insulting to players, and the \"vast\" game world is actually not that big at all. Its a few main areas connected by some very long, linear roads, which you unfortunately have to travel eight million times throughout the game. What's worse, to make use of the existing \"fast travel\" system, you have to pay a lot of money every time you do it.The inventory system is pretty bad and offers a lot of room for improvement. The healing system is aldo terrible, and made worse by the fact that have to run everywhere. The cumulative damage is a problem when you have to run everywhere--then back again. Often times, by the time you get to your actual quest location, you've been nickle and dimed down to half health, which can make for some very frustrating times.Side quests are pretty boring and repetitive, and given that you'll be so sick of running everywhere, you'll probably skip most of them, and you wouldn't be missing much.All in all, if you are looking for an RPG then this isn't a terrible choice, but don't be expecting something on the same level as Mass Effect, Dragon Age or even Kingdoms of Amalur. It just doesn't stand up, though it's worth a run through.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2013"}
{"product_name":"B003O6G6G4","description":"","reviewerName":"Core","summary":"Dragons Dogma A game that could be so much more","reviewText":"1st Their is a fast travel option. You just have to set it up and pay for it. Fine by me.Now moving on. Dragons Dogma, is a game that's like a project, the more time you add, the more fun a experience it turns into up to a point (For me that was like my fourth play through). At first things kinda move slow. Your fumbling trying to figure out where to go, what to do... But then once you catch on, and things start rolling along it becomes fun.The world's pretty cool and convincing in how its set up. Although now that I think about it, I am surprised their is no \"port\" at the capital.I'm just going to go down through here and make points.+StoryThe story is really cool. Once you play the game a couple times, you'll see things come full circle. Its really neat how they packaged it up. It was cool how they put little surprises in the game.+Weaponsweapons you can find in game, are really cool. Not only are they aesthetically pleasing. You can find quite a few weapons with elemental characteristics. Fire good for anything?For the most part, this follows the standard fare. Get better weapons, kill enemies easier, collect loot. But the thing about it is, some weapons are really really good in certain situations, so if you don't have the right class, you can go into some battles and they be a lot tougher than they have to be. So be smart about your fights.To give an example of this. Several times you have to fight a hydra in game. This is both awesome as well as a pain in the butt. And if you have a character class that can use Arrows, you'll be a lot better off in my experience than if you have a sword. Getting close to a panicking hydra.. is not fun.+WeightIn game, every item has weight, from armor to swords,potions, misc items you pick up. Gotta manage your weight.+Character/Class development:In game you get several classes to pick from. Archer, Assassin, Mystic Knight, Sorcerer, Magic Archer.etcSome classes are hybrids of existing ones.To level up your \"Discipline\" for a certain class, you have to use said class a lot. Knight? Go kill stuff with a sword, adventure, and you'll earn points, which you can spend at an INN to learn \"Core Skills\" and \"Abilities\". Its not as complex as it sounds, and it doesn't take a horrendously long time to do it as long as you give your character a little TLC, they'll return the favor to you.Some abilities will give you the capacity to shoot multiple arrows at an enemy, or do certain sword attack, etc.+Armor/ClothingArmor in game is very cool as well. All the layering effects of stats you can do is very nice.Plus a lot of the clothing is creative and looks cool.Clothing from what I can tell, with the exception of the cloaks don't really offer any like strength enhancements or anything cool like that.You can wear:1 piece of armor for the head2 items for Torso, Clothing and Armor1 item for wrist, Armor2 items for Legs, Clothing and Armor2 items for Accoutrements (accessories?) A cape of some sort, and Jewelry+Enemy difficultyEven with my fourth play through the enemies are a challenge, and that's using four pawns. Some enemies are more difficult than others of course. But their not crazy difficult. This game is hands down far easier than Demons Souls or DarkSouls, and in its own right is more fast paced. The game rewards you for being prepared when facing enemies, but at the same time, even if your not, theirs a little forgiveness.So as long as you invest in your armor and gear.. you'll be fine.+Save systemThe game has auto saves.+Pawn SystemYou can summon very talkative minions to aid you that other people have created for Rift Crystals or if your at the same or a higher level its free. Also if you choose to throw your main pawn off a cliff because they stepped on your last nerve. Don't worry, you can re-summon them.+UIThe user interface of the game is pretty good. Easy to navigate.It is odd to me though how they set up the (Select or back button) to be for your items, and then the start button is how you access saves and your map. I'm used to that being all in one area. But its something that works.+World of Gran SorenIs where the main story takes place. Its actually very small. The environments you can explore are limited. Another words, basically Its all hills. You don't go into any snowy areas.. or swamps. Its just bright sunny weather.+MapI like it, very easy to read and tell where you are in game. Its not cluttered.+Creatures/EnemiesQuiet a variety of enemies you can interact with. From cyclops to wolves. To deer. And those evil crapping seagulls. And these lizard creatures which crack me up when they try to escape.+Item creationYou can create a ton of potions in this game. The only bad thing is their is no in game book or guide that I could find.. that told you what was what. It was all trial and error.+QuestA lot of side quest to do.Main quest, I.e. ones not on message boards, You can miss them if your not careful because the game seems to have stages.. by stages.. I am referring to the story. So like if you go past a certain point story wise you cant do these quest.(although don't quote me, because I am not a 100% certain on this) You'd think with four play through I would have payed attention to this, but I was just exploring and trying to find loot.+GameplaySmooth and fluid. A bit fast paced. You can climb up on your enemies and even ox for that matter and kill em. You can use Harpys to traverse your environment.. etc. Very enjoyable gameplay. The team behind this game did an excellent job here.+CurrencyTwo types for some reason and you can't convert one in to the other.+Character customizationIts well done, you have a ton of options on making your characters. So you can get really creative. And they look human. (I'm looking at you demons souls,Darksouls....)+LoadingIts actually pretty limited. For the most part you can wander over the majority of Gran Soren without running into a load screen, which is really cool in a way.********Things I would like to see improved upon in the next game.***********-Jester, I would like the choice of feeding the Jester to a chimera.. kicking him off a cliff, setting him on fire and kicking him down a hill.. full of tall dry grass. *coughs* Lets just say it sucks that their wasn't further plot with the jester allowing me to pay the little guru back for his \"favor\"...-Gran Soren was too dang small. It needed more environments you could traverse and explore. Swamps.. Snowy mountains.. I wish water wasn't evil in the game.-Speaking of \"travel\" it would be nice if ever hill or rock in the game that was slanted at a 45 degree angle wasn't covered in moss. I really didn't like little hills and being so limited in how I traveled. A mountain in real life wouldn't stop me. It shouldn't in game. Now it might slow me down a bit, Everyone knows a straight line is faster, And a mountain is a broken line if you want to simplify it?-The fast travel spires were okay. That made sense. But the ferry stones in game.. make em cheaper... That was ridiculous cost to fast travel. Even at higher levels later on in the game, I'm limited because I can only if lucky purchase them from one merchant..  Fast travel was okay.. but it could have been a lot better.-Armor and clothing.... I hated how it was limited by class. That sucked. Because their was a lot of cool gear, and I liked the stat advantages it game me, plus it just looked cool and what limited me from wearing it was my class. I found this huge cool helmet with horns.. but couldn't wear it because I wasn't \"warrior class\" just a fighter.. That sucked. I can understand the design team wanting to be realistic.. but the main enemy of the game is a giant frickin dragon. I think realism was thrown out awhile ago.-Pawns.. Vendors.. Its great their so talkative.. but at the same time I want an option to shut them up.One can only hear \"There master works all you can't go wrong\".. or \"Master goblins\" I'm at a level 124.. my character can throw a mean glance at goblins and kill them, same with dire wolves..  I don't need to be told about an enemy I can see.I would like to see these options on the DPAD in the next game for pawns:Search, Aid, Fight, Stand still and don't freaking break anything I'm trying to use this box to climb up higher you stupid pawn, and finally but not least, SHUT YOUR STUPID TRAP.-CurrencyIt would be nice, if you could convert currency into rift crystals or gold depending on what you need in game. It would just be a nice feature. I have a ton of rift crystals.. can't really do anything with them.-I would have liked to see more weapons in the game. Just because the few that existed, they were awesome. The more the merrier.-Customizing some weapons and getting them up to snuff.. was a brutal experience. Too hard to get some of the obscure items you needed to upgrade gear. Mainly the drop rate from the enemies.-Accessories.. been nice if you could wear more. For instance, you should be able to wear a necklace and rings.. (you got ten fingers) Even if the gear did nothing it really allows for a unique character or pawn.-Clothing/Armor It be nice to see more layering options. If I was wearing a bandana.. on my character, obviously that wouldn't stop me from wearing a helmet. Things like this needed tweaking.-I would like real multiplayer.. It would of been great if I could of hopped into a friends game with my main pawn and help them take down a enemy. If you don't know how to do it, hire a consulting company.-Dragons dogma, has the potential to be so much better and more awesome than what it is today. It could be like a monster hunter for the US.-I hope to see the next game, and it be bigger, and better and come out on the next gen systems. I assume hardware was the limitations for the game. I want to see more armor and clothing and weaponry and environments, and monsters to face.That's one thing that got me after playing the game so much. I actually wanted more cyclops and maybe like mini hydras I had to face and more small Drakes and Wyverns to fight.. And like I said I wanted to be able to explore more. And why do wolves get all the attention? I wanted to fight some bear as well. Where were they?-Item Weight, please don't make it such a huge burden. If your going to have a game, where all these items are important.. please let me have some way of storing them.. like in a chest or something, or just make them lighter so I can carry more without any problems. How many times did I get over burdened...l even with my overly talkative pawns help.. they even got over weight while out in the field.-Also, in the next game I want a pet Harpy that I can call up on anytime. Now she/He might be quest based or something. But it would be great to have that ability to traverse across higher areas, or parts of the map.. It wouldn't be required, but it would make it a lot funner. A lot more stream lined. etc..  That would truly be awesome.-Some way of traversing the land, from a wyvern,drake to a mini dragon or to a bear I can give armor mount and ride across the land. Seriously.. Something. It would just make the game better.-Allow me to turn off the auto save. Seriously. Don't like this crap.To finally end all this. This really has been one of the best games I've played in a *long* time. I had fun. I was challenged.. A great experience. And I am really happy with my purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2012"}

{"product_name":"B007FMSDUK","description":"","reviewerName":"Gargus","summary":"Why you should buy the Vita version over the 3ds.","reviewText":"I will dispense with reviews of the game itself since there is overwhelming positive comments on the game across the internet and I for one share in them and do like this game very much. I will however give the reasons as to why I recommend the Vita version over the 3ds. I own and have played the Vita version and compared it to my friend's 3ds copy.1- The vita has superior looking graphics. Partly due to the fact the game was designed around the Vita itself, partly due to the superior hardware of the Vita and partly because the Vita version has uncompressed graphics. It looks much nicer on the Vita. The 3ds version has compressed graphics when in comparison don't look nearly as good and if you try to play it in 3d the graphics take a slight dip even further as do all 3ds games. The widescreen aspect of the Vita also helps a lot. The colors are just more vibrant and sharper on the Vita.2- The sound is better on the Vita. Again it's due to the sound being uncompressed on the Vita while being compressed on the 3ds. It's slight, but noticeable.3- Game breaking save bug on the 3ds version. The 3ds version of the game in Japan had a bug in it which would destroy your save file and it has carried over into the American game. It's not guaranteed but a lot of people have run into it. If you save your game during certain portions of the game it will corrupt your save and you will have to start all over again. It's been verified by myself and others that the Vita version does not contain this problem.Other notes- The Vita version has trophy support if you're into collecting them. People have claimed the touch screen on the 3ds is far superior but what they don't understand is you can use a style on the Vita and get the exact same results, a simple and very cheap capacitive stylus works just fine on the Vita touch screen. I personally liked having everything on one screen instead of a split screen. You can take screenshots in the game. You get more save game slots while the 3ds has only one.All in all this is a great game and worth playing on either system but at the end of the day I cannot see any reason to not play it on the Vita as it is a better experience in every way.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2013"}

I use to bring it to school and play it behind my large backpack as my teacher preached her head off. Got a B by copying girls. Life. Anyways.If you are new to pokemon, then this game should be great, why? A whole bunch of new pokemon. New stuff excites people, simple as that.However, unlike most people, I also see the negitive part in a game. Thats what makes a review useful.Bad Stuff:-For those who have been playing pokemon since the old times, you SHOULD be really bored with its game play now. Why? Let me ask you this. Has the game really change? To me, all it really did was add a girl rival, some new pokemons, new objectives, journey and settings, and new version name. TA DA. The game play is practically the same old game play it was from the first game. You catch pokemon the same way, pokemon fight the same way, same o same o. Just a little bit of added items.-Looking at some of the pokemons, you can tell they are getting desperate in creating them. Like they were in a rush. &quot;Oh I know, a bear pokemon, lets see, lets make it a teddy bear with weird patterns and call it this and that. Man I'm on a roll!&quot;. You should look at Gold and Silver version, wow! Desperate?-The pokemons are new but their stats and moves don't make them new. If you get my point. In fact, I think most of their lvl up moves are plain messed up and weak. Therefore making the game hard and even frustrating. The bug, plant, and poison pokemons are still stuck with extremely weak special attacks. The creators should play the game more before releasing stuff.Don't you ever wonder why the people with little imaginations are running the world and the ones with it are stuck on a computer typing reviews? The pokemon show is dying and they do nothing about it other than simply adding on more episodes.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2004"}

However, it tried to vary the gameplay (and failed) in the following areas:-Zelda-esque puzzles...accomplished in sub-Zelda style.-Voice-acting...it didn't sound like Jimmy Smits, Carrie Fisher, or James Earl Jones.Beyond that, a few thoughts:-Great insight into the period between episode III and IV.-A lot of fun playing as a Sith Apprentice.-***You can punt Jawas!!!***Unfortunately,-You can't punt (or even kill) those irritating Ewoks-Enemies become insanely strong as you gain force powers.

{"product_name":"B004CD9X2C","description":"","reviewerName":"eightysicks86","summary":"Great especially if your a fan of the original!","reviewText":"I don't know how I would feel about this game if I didn't love the original so much.  I still have the original PC game and played it many times, never actually beat it though.  I would pick it up from time to time, play for a little, put it down, and then would have to start from the beginning each time I picked it up again years later.  The original is a cult classic for me, a sort of enigmatic attraction that I can't explain.  It was way before its time visually speaking, and I always felt that it never really received the praise that it deserved.  Anyway...I looked forward to this game for about a year, ever since I heard that American was making a sequel.  Madness Returns (IMO) is still very faithful to the feel of the original.  I have played a good 3 hours into it so far.  It just has this quality that appeals to me.  I am more of a FPS shooter gamer and usually bypass \"Action\" or 3rd person view games altogether.  I am also a sucker for visually oriented games such as this one.  The story, dialog structure, and voices are totally captivating, but for me this games appeal is the eye candy and atmosphere.  Not to mention the battles mechanics are very fun too.AMR is creepy, action is solid, it is engrossing, challenging in parts, beautiful, and is just good old fun to play.  If you are a fan of the 1st - pick it up!  If you haven't played the first, I don't know what to tell you since my perspective is heavily altered by my love and nostalgia of the original.If you buy it new you get the free download of the original Alice.  If you get the game secondhand without the code in it, it will cost you a $9.99 DL from XBL.  The original game requires the AMR disc in the machine.  It is accessed through the main menu of AMR.I only played 10 minutes of the original Alice, just to check it out.  At first the quality during the intro movie was a bit iffy but once the game started I was very impressed at how good it looked considering it's a 10 year old port from the PC.  I can't wait to finally finish it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2011"}

Daneker","summary":"I wanted to throw something at it too many times","reviewText":"Dead Space 2 is a direct sequel that follows Engineer Issac as he tries to escape a space station over-run by the necrophage. It's more straight forward and less level oriented than the first game. This time around Issac has more personality, he has a past and he's more connected emotionally with what's going on. There's no more \"just do this so we can escape. that's done, now this broke, go fix it\" that drove the first game, nor is there a central point to keep returning to. This Dead Space just keeps following a straight line forward and the chapter changes are seamless.The graphics are more open, very detailed and more diverse than the first game giving the game a less claustrophobic feel but the player a less repetitive visual experience. For some reason Issac still walks half-hunched over for reasons I don't understand but he looks more nimble regardless.There's more weapons this time too and they're more diverse, it also matters more what you use what on since some enemies  barely react to some damage. And there's a lot of enemies and more ways to deal with them than the first game.The main issue I have with Dead Space 2 is how incredibly hard even casual mode can be at times. First, I found my self several times replaying areas because I'd get so far and run out of useful ammo and the game doesn't seem to have any idea of placing vending machines or crates with ammo inside at the right spots. I'd go from having more than I could carry to running out in the next area.There's a major, logical flaw than nearly ruins the game, enemies come literally out of NOWHERE. And I mean, NOWHERE. I was in a room wit one door, opened the door and started fighting a something kills me from behind, in a SEALED ROOM!!! Unlike the first Dead Space, I often can't find anywhere for the enemies to come from, they are just there, in swarms. It's very frustrating, you stand against a solid wall, in a corner with no vents ore doors around you looking booth ways and suddenly something gets you from behind??? I've had this happen several times and over and over again could not find where I was attacked from.Over all I want to love this game, but when I find myself out of everything but fire surrounded with enemies that are immune to it and I just walked and walked and walked with no store or crates to refill from and the enemies just swarm from all sides and I die over and over and over and over and over till I turn it off and go back 1/2 hour of game play to try and stock up on ammo then it's no damned fun. I work all the time, I have kids, I just want an hour or so a day to relax and play and instead I get angry and frustrated and play the same 45 seconds of game for and hour it just sucks.I've been playing games since Atari in the 70's and games like this suck to play because you get hooked just to find even the easiest setting can get unreasonably hard at parts and hours on the same few seconds of game is never fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2011"}

The third installment of the Resident Evil game series actually takes place before the second game, so you are writing the future, playing as the lead heroine Jill (who survived the first game). You start out on the streets of Raccoon City, which has been ravaged by zombies, and you work your way to the Police Station and back into the city streets, trying to escape the town, all the while being stalked by a huge ugly killer which appears every once in a while to give the player a scare. Unlike the other two games, Jill is armed to the teeth right when you begin the game.

In Resident Evil 2, there were only 4 types of zombies, with this game there are dozens of zombies, such as fat zombies, beautiful zombies and so on. There is also a new system where you can make bullets for certain guns, but there is no chance you will ever run out of ammo.

Killzone 2, from a technical perspective, is a masterpiece. The level of detail in the environments is very high, the sound design is stellar, and the lighting, in particular, is some of the very best I've seen in any game ever. The game performs admirably, and on the surface seems to be quite a fantastic game, but it's when you play the game, it is missing a very key component, and that is character. Killzone 2 just doesn't feel like it has any life to it.There is a story here with lore, there are characters, and there is a setting, but none of it feels significant in any way. In fact, it all feels instantly forgettable. And this is inexcusable when you have a game that functions such as Killzone 2 does, being a linear corridor shooter with very little variety to the gameplay. Sure, there is the occasional opportunity to pilot a vehicle which does well to break up the pace, but this is ultimately a cover-based, pop & shoot FPS that offers very little more. A meaningful storyline with better writing could have worked wonders for this game as it did with other games with similar campaigns (see Call of Duty 4 as a fine example of how to do this right), but ultimately, the essence of the game feels cold and distant. It feels like a game that exists simply because it can.The gameplay itself does have its moments of fun. Sometimes the sheer technical scope of Killzone 2's set pieces provides a setting for some enjoyable battles that are difficult to not marvel at. But even then, the gameplay never feels quite as good as it should, with an overbearing sense of weight and sluggishness that could have added a nice sense of realism had it not been so overdone. Also, the constant brown-toned coloring of the planet Helgen really starts to wear on you after a while, making things feel even more dull than they already are.It feels like Guerilla Games has a very good game in them that will be made at some point, but Killzone 2 isn't it. It's a technical marvel that just feels lifeless and fails to do anything to distinguish itself from the horders of other first person shooters out there.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2013"}

Now, for the first time, players can see true depth of their environment without the need for special glasses. Super Mario is a 3D evolution of classic Mario platforming featuring new level designs and challenges.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Handheld Mario at Its Finest","reviewText":"Back in the days of the original Gameboy, the Super Mario Lands were hailed for being relatively different from the usual Mario experience.  Sure you were still stomping and such, but you faced wildly different enemies and got some very different power ups.  Super Mario 3D Land is not a sequel to those games in anyway.  But like the Super Mario Land games, it takes a different approach to the Mario formula while keeping in sync with what has made it successful.  Here the change is mostly the fact that it plays like the 2D side scrolling games in a 3D world.  And for the most part it actually works.Mario has never been a game anyone has picked up for story.  We all know what it's about.  Princess Peach has been kidnapped by Bowser and it's up to Mario to go and save her once more.  It's pretty standard stuff.  As mentioned earlier it harkens back to the 2D Mario games in a way.  There's a straightforward overworld map to go through and you'll begin in level 1-1 before moving on to 1-2 etc.  At the end of each world is either a castle or an airship with a boss waiting in wait.  It seems traditional all around and like it offers up absolutely nothing until you're actually playing the levels themselves.  For a handheld game, 3D Land offers players quite a bit to experience.The levels here are well designed.  Each one ends when you find the flagpole at the end, but getting there isn't always an easy feat.  You can roam around in full 3D instead of side scrolling.  For the most part you can roam just about anywhere.  Throughout each level there are a lot of hidden goodies as well.  There are blocks that house powerups and plenty of enemies to stomp, but each level also has little goodies hidden off the beaten path.  There are secret 1UP mushrooms and hidden areas to explore in just about every level.  Each level is also uniquely different from the previous one.  The game often throws new challenges at you to keep you on your toes.The stages themselves are pretty short, however.  This is obviously due to it being a handheld and being on the go.  But there is usually reason to go back and play each one.  Like New Super Mario Bros. Wii, there are three Star Coins in each level.  For players who want to experience everything that Super Mario 3D Land has to offer, you'll want them as they unlock challenging levels later in the game.Mario 3D Land also uses the suit system found in Super Mario Bros. 3.  For the most part there's fire Mario and Tanooki Mario, but there are times when you'll find something to help Mario out in different ways.  For example, Mario can now find a powerup that allows him to throw boomerangs.  Much like the 2D games, Mario doesn't have a health meter or anything like that.  Rather it's done based on his power ups.  Taking one hit makes him lose his power, a second makes him small and a third does him in.  Super Mario 3D Land isn't a terribly hard game, but if you happen to fail too many times the game is more than willing to help you out by either giving suit that makes you invincible or by skipping it out right.  While this may seem like handholding, those who go about it this way will literally miss out on half the game by doing so.  As well as several secrets.  You DON'T get Star Coins by skipping a level.  On the other hand, keeping your lives in supply is rather simple.  There are 1UP mushrooms everywhere.  Each level also has a checkpoint.  Super Mario 3D Land can be challenging, but it certainly is in no hurry to punish the player.Up until now the 3D on the 3DS has seemed somewhat like a gimmick.  It isn't quite that way in Super Mario 3D Land.  While you can most certainly play through the game with the 3D off there are times when having it on will actually make a difference in the ease of play.  Certain rooms that contain Star Coins are actually puzzles where you must try and figure out the optical illusion.  With the 3D on it actually really helps.  You CAN solve these puzzle like moments without the 3D effect but it's much more difficult to do so.  The 3D is also done rather well in other ways.  Up until now a lot of 3DS games have either been obsessed with having things \"pop out\" at the player or making the game look more dynamic.  But here the 3D actually adds depth perception to the game itself.  Where you actually get a sense of just how far away a particular platform is or even how close an enemy in the background really is to getting to you.  It may not seem like much from the outset, but it certainly makes the 3D much more than just a gimmick here.  But the game is still enjoyable should you decide you don't want to play with the 3D on at all.In terms of visual appeal, Mario 3D Land looks absolutely amazing.  It is very similar to look and feel of Super Mario Galaxy on the Wii.  There is certainly enough here to give you a sense of what the future of technology on the 3DS can be.  There's a lot of detail to each level.  It's just easy on the eyes overall.  What may not bode well for the player all the time is the lack of control over the camera.  For the most part the camera sticks with you pretty well and moves perfectly in tune with where you are and where you need to go.  There are times, however, when the lack of being able to move the camera yourself can leave you baffled on where to go next.  It won't cause you to die much, but it will make certain platforming moments slightly more difficult simply because you aren't sure right off hand where the next platform actually is.Super Mario 3D Land doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it takes the best of the 2D games and combines them with the best of the 3D games and somehow makes it work.  The levels may be short but they're plentiful and there's a ton of replay value here.  For those dying to invest some time in a 3DS game, Super Mario 3D Land is well worth that time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001UWGBC8","reviewerName":"Morgan Cahall \"so many books so little time\"","summary":"A fun super hero brawler with a few issues","reviewText":"The story in this game apparently takes place after an event in the comic books called the secret war and during the civil war which is set off when a terrible accident (among other things) kills several hundred people and prompts the government to call for a super hero registration act  to hold all hero's accountable for their actions.  This of course creates two groups: one for and one against.  Without giving two much away if you don't know anything about the story the groups boil down to those that were \"ordinary\" people given extraordinary powers and want to protect their privacy and the privacy of their families and well the bad guys . The other group is composed of  mostly the super genius people (and those who have already revealed who they are, so they don't have much to lose) who have done some number crunching and don't like way things are going to turn out if some control is not imposed on the super hero community.  The time for talking is over and a side must be chosen. The only problem is that both sides have good intentions and that can only lead down one road.....----------------I liked this game. The story is actually somewhat interesting, not the heaviest thing in the world but if you do actually feel like paying attention to it, it does bring up some interesting ideas/points. If you don't on the other hand you can (mostly) skip it and go back to hitting things.  Some of the other improvements:The revival terminals are gone.  Teammates can be hot swapped at will most of the time and health refills are provided by defeating enemies and breaking scenery. Fallen teammates can be brought back with heal tokens which are earned by performing fusions.The graphics are definitely better. There is some slowdown when a lot is going  on though.No more orphan characters. You more or less level up the slot.  If a character is lvl. 25 and you stick another character in its place that character is now lvl.25. The only thing I noticed with this is that the game seems determined that you are gong to use auto level whether you want to or not. If you want to assign points yourself you usually have to beat it over the head a few times before that function stays off. The only way I found around it was to turn it off twice and then save. Not a big deal unless you have certain characters you want to control how they grow when you swap them around.The fusions are pretty and they can pretty well clear a room.  Which leaves you to go find more rooms to smash through and use fusions on  the poor helpl... I mean evil thugs trying to ruin your day.Now onto the  things I didn't like.No more item collecting.  In place of equipment you get \"medals\" which give your whole team some kind of boost (ex: +1 strike, +15% exp, etc), these are either awarded after a event or can be found. These are useful but it does take some fun out of beating up the enemies and smashing all the barrels and boxes to see what you can find.Like the leveling up your character is more or less a place holder in conversations.  With certain combinations you'll get different initial dialogue but that's it. The rest of the conversations are the same even if the wording shows a accent or has bub at the end of every line.  Some characters I couldn't see saying what they said.Last but not least, the fusions.  They are as follows: Clearing, Guiding, and Targeted.  The animation as far as I could tell was the same for each one no matter what characters where being used.  So don't expect any team combo fusions,  you got your three duo choices. The place holder syndrome strikes again.  They can also be used to blast through the levels.  I only had to really think about major battles toward the end when some enemies became immune.I did not play the online campaign or co-op campaign so I cannot comment other than to say the game is built around that which proably accounts for a lot of the place holder stuff.Altogether this is a fun game that warrants at least a play through or two to see what happens on both sides.  There are plenty of things to find and plenty of characters to experiment with.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a hack and bash with a interesting story and plenty of action to keep you playing. m.a.c","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2009"}

{"product_name":"B003C1I0CO","reviewerName":"Omnes","summary":"\"And at the end of Fear...Oblivion!!!\" - Jonathan Crane (alias Scarecrow) in Batman Arkham City","reviewText":"Although I do not read the recent Batman Comic books for they keep juggling around the continuity of their storyline so much that it becomes confusing, I have however nothing but respect for Paul Dini's interpretation of the Batman myth. Indeed, with the excellent scripts he did with his \"Batman the Animated Series\", \"Gotham Girls\", \"Justice League\", \"Superman\", and \"Batman Beyond\", Paul Dini has revealed, like Tim Burton did with his excellent movies, the troubled personality of Batman, his contradictions, and the darkness that surrounds Gotham, its citizens and its criminals. And once again, Paul Dini offers another excellent work with his \"Arkham\" Series, in which we are once again reunited with Kevin Conroy as Batman, Mark Hamill as the Joker, and Arleen Sorkin as Harley Quinn. In this first game, which entirely happens in the Arkham Asylum grounds, Batman tries to stop a riot that the Joker initiates after the Dark Knight brings him back to the Asylum for his murder attempt on the Mayor. Not only that, Batman has to fight off the Riddler's enigmas, along with Poison Ivy, Zsaz, Bane, Killer Croc, and Scarecrow, my personal favourite, along with a new enemy whose presence will be dramatic in the sequel Arkham City.After playing Arkham Asylum, I have only praise for this excellent video game. First of all, the voice acting of all the actors is perfect, not only in the game but also in the audio interviews that players can uncover. It was a clever idea to use those interviews since it allows us to learn other details about the characters. Indeed, the writing in those scenes is so good that I felt the Batman villains were like real people and their psychology is very powerful as we see some of them reveal how twisted they were. For instance, I loved Zsaz's interactions with Doctor Cassidy and I too wondered what happened to her, until I got to play the game further and read afterwards a special prelude Arkham Asylum comic book. Apart from the storyline, the game offers the possibility to play Challenge Levels, which include Fighting and Infiltration maps that can offer Ranked results when playing online. It is not necessary to play those sections to complete the story, but they are a great addition that will add further replay value to the game. For the gameplay, I loved how they used the Unreal game engine, which was the same one that the Bioshock game used, since the textures and model designs gave me the same amazement that I felt when I played Bioshock. For the gadgets, I adore the grappling hook, the Bat glide, but also the various batarangs such as the sonic Batarang which allows you to attract enemies and knock them out with a shockwave. Not only that, I love how you can use those gadgets in the exploration levels and in the fights. On a last note, I really love the tension of some of the levels, most of all the fight with Bane, but also the ones with the Scarecrow, which mix both surrealism and realism gameplay and I hope we will get to see him again in any sequels that Paul Dini and Rockstar would want to do.To conclude, this game is an excellent example that you can make an excellent super hero video game with both a great script and awesome level designs; a story that offers something more to the fans who think that they've seen it all with the Dark Knight.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2013"}

The first game that the system ran on was also a scream. It just sometimes comes to me as a surprise that a lot of these newer games that run on CD-ROM like the Playstation 2, and the XBOX may have faster and better graphics, but not likely with the actual loading time.Nintendo's Super Mario 64, remains as the most dynamic staple of any N64 system to date. The graphics are just completely amazing, and so strong from one angle to another. In Super MArio 64, you guide Mario through 15 terrific stages with exciting adventure around every corner. The object of the game is to try collect as many stars as possible that are hidden in the game. Each star is very vital inorder to help you save Peach, whom is still known as Princess Toadstool, from the vile Bowser. Each course takes you from all depths of the secret kingdom, from Sea, to the firey sky, and even in a spooky ghost-filled house. The load up time for this, and every other N64 game is much faster than the CD-Rom games for the PC, and the other CD-Rom console games.It is kind of sad Nintendo stopped making fantastic games on cartridge like this, and traded it for a CD-ROM gaming factory, with the Gamecube.

There are also more advanced create a skater and park editors with different ramps, hazards and schemes like a beach!

I'll get to the games themselves later.  First, however, is the presentation, which is the main draw of this collection.  The games are remastered in high definition during the gameplay sections, which look fantastic, but the cutscenes are not remastered and are of noticeably lower quality.  However, this doesn't detract from the overall quality.  There is added trophy support, which are a bit on the easy side.  Most of the trophies are story-related, however other trophies include collecting bonus items and beating challenges.  Basically, if you are fans of these games, you will enjoy this presentation, so stop reading and go buy it (or, buy the 5 game God of War saga collection)  However, for newcomers, here is my opinion of the game:You play as Kratos, a warrior with a troubled past.  Your quest consists of Kratos trying to appease the gods so they will rid him of the memories that trouble him.  Throughout this quest, you basically go down hallways and through rooms killing seemingly endless swarms of monsters.  You have a few weapons and powers to use in an attempt to fight off your enemies.  Occasionally, you come across a puzzle, which usually require pushing objects around, though there are a few others.  Some quick-time events where you have to push a button displayed on the screen during the cutscene.  There isn't much more to the game than going from room to room fighting the same few enemies over and over again with a puzzle here or there, so if that sounds like fun to you, by all means, get it.  I find doing the same thing in every single room to be dull.Overall, if you enjoy hack n slash action games, then pick up either this collection or the God of War Saga collection.  They are easily the best version of these games.  However, other HD collections that came later have better presentation (namely HD cutscenes) and more varied gameplay, so I give the collection 3 stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2009"}

My version came with the Command in Chief DLC, which included the 'Merica gun.

{"product_name":"B00G9AYVTG","description":"","reviewerName":"Live Player \"GAMERFIDE\"","summary":"PS Vita is a must have for travelers, and any Video Game lovers!","reviewText":"I waited a long time to buy one of these. I'm mainly a console gamer on my Xbox 1 now, but I must travel for work, and the Vita is the best mobile game system around. The screen is gorgeous, and the graphics are just as good as the 360 or PS3. This version actually comes with FOUR games (Uncharted Golden Abyss, Sly Cooper Thieves in Time, Retro City Rampage, Dead Walking Chapters 1-5). Once the unit is shipped you will get two codes from Amazon to enter into your PSN account, which is easy to sign up for if you don't have one.Whats in the box?  The System itself, a black standard vita system, the charging cable, which includes a USB cable for backing up onto computers, and a 4GB memory card which in my opinion is kind of useless, unless your going to buy only physical copies of games. Also in the box are these augmented reality cards, which I haven't really messed with.  But the Vita does have the ability to use the camera, and put things into your background (Little Deviants) that you can shoot and interact with.I believe if you buy this version anywhere else other than Amazon, you only get the dead walking game. Opening the box, I was slightly disappointed that it's just a regular black Vita.  I was hoping for a different colored Walking Dead edition, such as a blue color or red color. But what is nice, is that this is the 3G/WiFi version that used to cost $300!! The 3G services are only available from AT&T;, which kind of stinks because I have Verizon. I believe the plans are somewhat expensive starting around $14/month for 256MB. If you have an iPhone, you should be able to create a mobile hotspot (mobile WiFi) to connect the Vita to. I do this all the time with my laptop, and the Vita, so make sure your data plan is big enough.Functionality. The system is gorgeous to look at, and I plan to go over some pros and cons. What I don't like:1. No second shoulder button, this should be setup like a playstation 3 or 4 controller.2. The buttons, and thumb sticks are too small.3. The thumb sticks do not click in.4. Proprietary memory cards ($90 for a 32GB memory card!!) C'mon Sony.5. Placement of the speakers and volume level (not powerful enough). The speakers end up behind your hands.6. Placement of the headphone jack on the bottom is asking for trouble.7. The game loading slot is a pain to open, especially if you have no nails.What I do like:1. Huge game library; there are so many quality games to play now.2. Playstation Network - It's very cool to play other people, and be able to download movies, game demos, and full games.3. OLED screen is bright, big and beautiful.4. Graphics, the best graphics on a portable game system; it's super powerful.5. Battery Life- I'm average a little over 4 hours of play time.6. Apps-Netflix, Skype, and Youtube are just a few of the many apps you can download.7. Form factor- It fits nice in the hand and is very light; the dual cameras, and the touchpad in the back are nice touches too. It also has an accelerometer.So final verdict. Should you buy it? Well that totally depends on you. If you like gaming in bed, or are just a casual gamer and don't want to invest in a console then I say go for it. It's also great for those that are on the road a lot. I will tell you this; Sony is releasing a PS Vita 2,000 sometime this 2014 fall/winter, but it's main improvements will be a 1GB internal memory, and be lighter in weight. Graphically they will be the same power. Watching Netflix on a larger screen than my iPhone is nice as well.The games: So far I have played the Walking Dead which is amazing, as well as Uncharted which looks almost as good as the PS3.  I would recommend getting the PSN $49.99 yearly membership as you will get a nice instant game library to include games like Sonic Racing, Gravity Rush, Strangers Wrath HD, Wipeout 2048, and a few more I believe. You also get discounts (sometimes 50%-75%) on games. The PSN Plus is absolutely worth it if you have a PS4 or PS3.  You can also control and play PS3 games, and PS4 games on the vita as long as your WiFi connection is good. So basically you could play Call of Duty Ghosts on your PS4 even though your PS4 is back home in New York, and you're in California.The PSN Plus also gives you access to demo games as well. I don't regret my purchase at all, as I like the games on the Vita; especially all the indie games that Sony is so well known for!Update: 1/18/2014 - Playstation Network is currently doing a 14 for 14 deal where top games like Killzone Mercenary are only like $9.99 (still $39.99 at Gamestop).Update: 2/5/2014 - I forgot to mention the quick resume feature of the PS Vita.  If you tap the power button, the Vita will pause the game wherever you are, and go into a low power mode.  If you press the PS button or the power button again, even hours later, the game will be sitting there right where you left off.  I especially like this, because you may not be at a save point when you need to quit.  This feature reminds me of the instant features on the Xbox One.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2014"}

But for a game with no single player, this game should have a lot more multiplayer features.  Not to mention it should have more titans and more customization of said pilot/titan.15 maps is good for a game that has a single player campaign element.  But yesterday I found myself playing the same maps a lot.  We should have gotten 20-25 maps since this is all the game is.  Not a big fan of that aspect.  I know DLC will address a lot of the issues I have, but some should have been addressed prior to launch.You should be able to customize your Titan and Pilot with different skins, colors,  armor, helmets, something......but there really isn't any of these features included in the game.  Again, a multiplayer only game should have a ton of extras like this.  Also more weapons and perks would have helped make the classes more your own.There are not very many game modes.  I like the variety pack option, but it is very limited as to what they offer.Again I like the game a lot, but for $60 bucks I guess I was just expecting more.  I mean really the game is just the beta with more maps.  I was expecting them to be holding something back to reveal to us when the actual game shipped.  Sadly there wasn't much more to it than maps.Also I wanted like 6-8 different types of Titans at least at launch.  3 doesn't really allow for much differentiation between players.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2014"}

WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws.

{"product_name":"B002I0J82G","description":"","reviewerName":"G.P.","summary":"FPS of the year?","reviewText":"I've only been playing this game for about 48 hours but I'm having a blast with it so far. I haven't tried the co-op missions yet but I have played a good amount of the campaign. Anyone looking for a great campaign story shouldn't look here, it's basically just one big action setpiece after another. To be fair, Call of Duty campaigns aren't any better and are also one big action setpiece after another. If single player campaigns are your thing and you're not interested in multiplayer, you're better off playing any of the Uncharted games or the original Bioshock. With this game, just like any other game in the Battlefield series, online multiplayer is the main focus. I was a big fan of Bad Company 2 so the transition to this game for me was very easy as I was already familiar with the controls. I really like the fact that they added a server browser so that you can search for the gametypes and options that you want to play. Want to play hardcore mode? They have it. Are you new to Battlefield games and want to play a few \"infantry only\" games (no vehicles) to get your feet wet? You can do that too. You can also search for lobbies for specific game types (Rush, Conquest, etc.) or specific maps. I know that server browsers are pretty standard for PC games but they are very rare on console games. I don't know why more developers don't add them as a feature. The only other games on PS3 that I recall having server browsers are Killzone 2 and Unreal Tournament 3. Maps in this game are HUGE. In the Rush game mode, the maps are opened up a section at a time while teams attack and defend stations. In Conquest, the entire map is opened up and you fight over flags (similar to domination mode in Call of Duty). I'm not going to get into a war of words and say that this game is better than Call of Duty (or vice versa) because it all comes down to personal preference. I can only speak for me when I say that I enjoy this game (and the Battlefield series in general) to Call of Duty. Of course, I'll still also be picking up Modern Warfare 3 on Nov. 8th.

It reminded me a bit ofToo Humanin that way: just game made with a lot of love and imagination that falls on its face from time to time.Playing Nier can really be divided into two astonishgly different parts; the boring half and the fun half.The beginning half of the game - and it truly is half, it's the first 8 to 12 hours depending on how many sidequests you do- is just dry as dust.  Gameplay wise, you're given one weapon type and you gradually gain some different magic types as you fight through waves of really repetitive enemies.  There's a great deal of button mashing going on and it takes a lot of will power to keep playing.  You do level up, but it's in such a general and casual way that you often don't know it's happening.  You can level up your weapons, but it's hardly worth the effort of farming the really boring enemies over and over.  There are some pretty awesome boss fights scattered about that can be challenging and stimulating, but it takes too long to get to them.  And the sidequest are just the worst ever.  Countless hours of 'bring me ten of these' and 'bring this over there and bring that back', most of which lack even the most basic of context to make you care.  The notable exception is the series with the lighthouse lady, which I recommend seeing through to the end.  But other than that?  Almost entirely skipable - the rewards for them aren't even interesting or improtant.Also, Nier is the ugliest damn game in years.  If visuals are your thing, just skip it outright.  Locations are flat and texture less.  Rooms are blocky and repetitive.  Seriously, it's hideous.So, all that happens...  But then we come to the very middle of the story.  There's a pretty epic boss fight, a dramatic turn around, and some character low points.  The story flashes forward five years, and suddenly the game is much better.Little things have changed; two new weapon types are added and the enemies suddenly have a handful of new defensive and offensive skills.  It's just enough to make the gameplay that much more challenging and interesting.  The sidequest, while still less than great, now have stories attached to them that are worth seeing out and are much more interesting to do.It's the same game, but really, it's not.  Just enough layer is added to make it at leas 50% more enjoyable.  Honestly, if there were a way to flashforward to the middle of the game and start there, I would say do that.  Nothing much of consequence happens in the first half, other than that you meet the characters, which you could really do at any point.  But having to wade through ten hours of boredome to get to any part worth playing through is kind of a difficult thing to recommend someone try out.I would be a fool, however, if I didn't mention the strongest and most satisfying aspects of Nier: the character and the game world.Nier has some of the most memorable and unique video game characters I've come across since Final Fantasy VII.  The brutish, aging father.  The half-possesed, half-dead heroine.  The young magician with the secret past.  And the millenium old floating magic book.  The voice acting is really strong and it's hard not to fall in love with this band of misfit warriors fighting back a nebulous and hard to pin down evil that lurks in every bit of shade.I don't want to give away to much, because discovering the story is the most satisfactory part of Nier.  But, if you can force yourself through the dullest hours, the payoff at the end is (almost) worth it.  The truth behind the disease, the truth behind the monsters, the truth behind the characters: it's all really fun really imaginative science fiction.  Nier also has some very cool post-endgame material that makes a second playthrough (of the second half only, mercifully) very, very different and enlightening.I can recommend Nier, but only to the very patient and to those who fall in love with characters.  It's not complex RPG, it's not complex gameplay, but it's fun enough (sometimes) to see the story through to the end.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2012"}

I got to say, when I first started playing this game I really did not like it. It was hard to relate to the characters which didn't make it feel like a true Lord of the Rings experience. However, since I spent 55 bucks on it I forced myself to truck along.Eventually, I reallllllly started to get into it. The game play is pretty good if you give it a chance, and it is pretty challenging. The music score is amazing as well.However, after about 30+ hours invested into the game and I am stuck! Go figure that right after the battle with the Giant Bug, I am cursed with yet another GIANT BUG....GAME BUG THAT IS!This games has more bugs in it than the movie Battleship Troopers, but I was dealing with them because I was really into the game. But I am at a point where I cannot go no further after defeating the giant spider because I can not talk to the Eagle. The game isn't giving me the option to talk to him though. I tried playing the same sequence over and over, going to other parts of the world, playing some of the challenges, however nothing has fixed this.I was waiting to write this review hoping Snowblind would correct this problem being they have been fully aware of the issue since a week after this games release date, but STILL they have not fixed this issue.This is the last game I will ever buy on its release date. Especially after what I read what happen to Skyrim. These game developers don't give a crap anymore. They just want to rush and publish crap to make a quick buck.People are mentioning a work around for this bug by means of constantly checking your missions log and making sure there arent any discrepancies at any point along the way. If there is you are supposed to restart the game before loading from that save file, but that is a bit ridiculous.However, I am beyond that point now. It would have been nice to know before I invested so much time in the game, but I really do not want to start from the beginning.I do not recommend this game....at least until Snowblind gets their act together.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2011"}

As these survivors' allies mysteriously fall victim to dementia, it becomes clear that protecting a young girl granting them a bizarre immunity may be their only hope for survival in a struggle that could have implications for all of humanity.GameplayAlthough designed to preserve the feel of the action of the original game, gameplay inExtractionis also quite unique. First, the player perspective has been changed from third, to first-person, placing all the action right in front of you. Also,Extractionis a 'rail shooter,' meaning a shooter game where most of the action engaged in and paths followed are programmed into the mission play, instead of the freeform wandering ability built into the considerably larger Next-Gen and PCDead Spacerelease. The combination of these two changes funnels the players focus onto the combat options available in the game. In dealing with the danger of the alien Necromorphs swarming the game space,Dead Space Extractionutilizes the precision of the Wii Remote in variety of ways. Weapons like the Plasma Cutter can dispatch these enemies from a distance by taking advantage of the remote's pointing targeting ability, while a quick wave can activate weapons like the Ripper, a guidable spinning saw blade. The Wii Remote is also handy for picking up items and hurling them at enemies using the power of Kinesis.Other gameplay changes include new play modes. The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn't become too easy. In addition,Extractionalso features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed. Taken together all these changes add up to more action, more fun and moreDead Spacefor players on the Wii.Key Game FeaturesAn All-New Prequel Exclusively for the WiiFollow the lives of several different Aegis VII colony members as they carve a bloody path to survival.Meet a new cast of characters, destroy fearsome new enemies, and wield brutal new weapons.Real TerrorStunning graphics, panic-inducing audio, and a frenetic first-person perspective thrust you headlong into the terror.Play through an engrossing, interactive horror movie experience that raises the bar for storytelling in video games.Intuitive ControlsStrategically dismember your enemies with pinpoint control using the Wii Remote.Wield a powerful arsenal of abilities and weapons to freeze enemies, manipulate gravity with telekinesis, solve puzzles, and fight off attacks from every direction in zero gravity.Co-Op GameplayTeam up with a friend to fight off the invasion on the USG Ishimura with jump-in cooperative play.Combine efforts on engineering puzzles or determine specific roles to create a unique experience with each play session.","reviewerName":"Ferdy","summary":"I'm hooked!","reviewText":"I've never been much of a video gamer until we got the Wii system.  I started out with the sports and fitness games but then my oldest son gave me his Resident Evil 4 game for Wii.  I am now officially an addict.  There are so few good shooter games for Wii and I'm devouring them with a frenzy.Dead Space Extraction is a great addition to this line-up.  Although it is a bit slow at the beginning - at least in story mode- it builds very quickly to a nail biting, can't stop playing to even go to the bathroom, race to make it out alive.The graphics are good.  I had to change my picture in options because it's very shaky and kind of dizzying in the default mode.  Once that was done, I had no problems with anything.  The weapons are easy to use and change out and the monsters get progressively scarier as you move forward into the game.  If you played Dead Space, you're probably familiar with the storyline.  I had not so it was all new for me.  This story centers around a group of colonists who are trying to escape their planet after most of it's inhabitants have become inhuman monsters due to the effects of a large alien artifact which has been uncovered.This is defintely for players over 17 as there is a fair amount of gore as well as language that isn't appropriate for younger kids.  It's mostly a straightforward shoot'em up without having to solve any puzzles or figure anything out other than what type of weapon is most lethal to whichever monster you're facing.  I wish there had been some points in the game where advancing depended on solving some type of puzzle or something similar.I have to admit that Resident Evil 4 is still my favorite of the horror shooter games but Dead Space is certainly in the top 5.  I also loved the Dead Rising:Chop Till You Drop game.  I am now eagerly awaiting the release of Resident Evil 5 and the new Silent Hill for Wii.  Hopefully Nintendo will get the hint that adult gamers want more of this type of game for Wii.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2009"}

Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak.

{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","summary":"THE reason to own a Playstation 3","reviewText":"The Last of Us is a post-apocalyptic horror game made by Naughty Dog (the creators of the Uncharted Series/Jak & Daxter/Crash Bandicoot) which follows the story of two individuals, Joel and Ellie. Joel's purpose in the game is to escort Ellie across the infected continental United States, to a group called the 'Fireflies' in order to study and create a vaccine for humanity using Ellie as a catalyst to help understand what exactly sprouted the infection in the first place. Throughout the game, Joel and Ellie develop a relationship that takes 1 year (4 seasons) to tell, and to show how much they grow throughout their experiences together. Although a basic story, the game is told throughout a very cohesive narrative using beautiful cutscenes with realistic facial motion capture, incredible writing and voice acting, and tense easy to control gameplay.Pros:- Story - the story isn't anything new to be perfectly honest, but its the expert writing and character interactions that really grasp you into the story that is being told. The game took me about 16 hours to beat, and from start to finish I was completely engaged.- Graphics - This game is GORGEOUS, in every sense of the word. The environments and lighting effects really create an amazingly believable atmosphere, whether it be a jaw-dropping hallmark card scene in the woods, from the claustrophobic and dark spaces of abandoned buildings, this game is incredible to look at. The in-game cut scenes flow seamlessly from cut scene to gameplay (vice-versa). The facial motion capture are beautifully rendered, and are very realistic. Its really amazing how much video games have evolved over the past 10 years and it really shows the true power of the Playstation 3- Gameplay - This game is a survival action horror game, and a damned good one at that. Gun fights are simple, with a responsive cover system that works like a dream (better than Gears of War in my opinion) , constantly finding items in order to craft weapons is actually fun and easy (complicated upgrading systems and crafting options in games usually are a hassle, but not in this game). The zombie and human AI's can be challenging at times which is great, and Ellie isn't just a useless escort you have to hoard around during the entire game; she actually helps you!- Voice Acting - The rising star that is Troy Baker and the cunning Ashley Johnson simply MAKE this game. Their voice acting abilities can really move the players into a sense of believability and evoke real emotions. By the time you finish the campaign, I guarantee you will develop some sort of attachment to these characters.-  Sound - the soundtrack is minimalistic but perfect for the game. From the horrific sounds of nearby enemies finding your position, to the disturbing/beautiful music playing in the background, playing this game with the sound off would be a crime.- Online - this is truly one of my favorite online games of the year. They have 3 main modes, simple team deathmatch style matches, a &#34;Survivors&#34; mode where there is a no respawns, and an &#34;Interrogations&#34; mode in which players have to interrogate enemy players in order to find a location of a safe where the team is fighting to unlock. Online mode also keeps things interesting by adding a back story and an inventory clan which you have to maintain by winning matches and helping other teammates. So unlike pointless Call of Duty style online gameplay, TEAMWORK is IMPORTANT and there can be repercussions to losing matches. There is also a nice customization option in creating your character.Cons:- The ending of the game could've been done differently, but still good.- Online matches can be uneven and laggy at times.The Last of Us is a triumphant piece of video game entertainment that I'm sure gamers will remember in years to come. It is an astonishing piece of art, and just a great experience that all true gamers and maybe even non-gamers can appreciate. With the recent release of the PS4, it is nice to leave the PS3 era with a game of this magnitude. A true masterpiece in my opinion.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2014"}
{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","summary":"Brilliance","reviewText":"I'm almost at a loss for words with this game. In fact, it almost seems a disservice to just call it a \"game\". With so many of them going for the whole \"creating a fictional world\" thing these days..and yes some of them do it very well..this pretty much sits at the top of the heap. After waiting for this game for so long since info first started coming out about it, I was ready to be let down. I figured there was no way a game could live up to that much personal hype from me. But Naughty Dog came through. From the very beginning with the opening sequence, I knew I was in for something special. It's definitely one of the more beautiful games on the PS3. The voice acting is top notch. Certain controls took a little getting used to for me, but I adjusted fairly quickly. There's some pretty impressive AI for the enemies as well as allies. I got out of a sticky situation more than once because of help from who was with me. The atmosphere is great, and can be downright heart pounding at times. Not having regenerating health is actually a good thing here. I wish more games these days would go back to the ways of having to actually look for ways to heal yourself rather than just sitting back until the game does it for you. There's certain games out there that truly every gamer should play in my opinion and this has just been added to the list. I'm well aware that the game isn't for everyone, but if you can look past the violence and language, even though there's plenty of it, it fits the situation that these characters are in. After this, I can't wait to see what Naughty Dog will be able to do with the PS4. I'm sure Uncharted 4 is coming, but another new IP would be amazing as well.

I been playing Madden since the Sega Genesis days.  I still have Madden games from 2002-2009 on the Original Xbox and let me say for the record NONE of these NEW GENERATION titles come close to the Gameplay on the original xbox.  Madden 10 was my first next Generation installment on the 360.  It was ok.  This new installment is HORRIBLE.  EA Sports has gotten so CHEAP they wont even give a booklet with this new installment.  If you need to look up the control scheme you have to scroll thru the menu.  The CROWD is NON-EXISTENT at home or away.  They change the Kick Meter back to the old press \"A\" button which REALLY SUCKS.  The only thing that is GOOD is the presentation and the gameplay is AVERAGE but overall this game SUCKS.  They show 1 maybe 2 cheerleaders at the half, \"SOMETIME\" not all the time, and they look like CARDBOARD cut outs.  I mean here we are almost 10 years past Madden 2005 and EA Sports still cant match that year.  Madden 2001 on the PS2,  Madden 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 on the Original Xbox outshine any next generation installment that EA has put out.  I hope another company get some leverage and put some competition on the market.  EA has no intention on making a QUALITY football game.  One more thing, they should stop calling it Madden since John Madden has nothing to do with PRODUCTION of this CRAP....","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2011"}

I thought the NFS series couldn't get worse after the first Underground....I guess the dumbas*es at Electronic Arts proved me wrong. Its a pathetic excuse for a game. Hasn't anyone else found the connection yet. Hmm lets see when NFSU came out their was a familiar movie (Hint:Fast and the Furious). Ok so they copied the movie I can't blame them its hard to gain material for a game with a long history...But NFSU2 was a big dissapointment. The overall originality of the game was non-existent. Familiar enough the time NFSU2 came out so did \"Too Fast Too Furious!\" Wow... Thats really ironic. The game is full of advertisments which literally drive you away from the original concept of the game. As the huge NFS fan I was this just pushed me more towards Gran Turismo. Even Nitendo racing games like Formula One beat out this game on originality and gameplay. Playing this game is like playing a big advertisment...Not really my way of having fun. So if you want to join the rest of a**holes who enjoy playing a game with cheap graphics, shi**y music,no gameplay, and non-existent originality then by all means go ahead.

Getting off the skateboard? Driving around? HAVING AN ACTUAL STORY? In the words of Plucky Duck, &quot;Gasp and DA-ROOL!&quot;Well, I finally recieved it during my family's yuletide festivities, and, well, it's a great game. It's pretty cool seeing the character I created as me (I don't have the face mapping thing) actually speak (although I don't sound like that, but oh well), and interact with friends, pros, and enemies. It's a really great story line; young unknown skater makes it to the big time. Unlike THPS3 and 4, where they just throw you in a level and give you several random goals (I'm not putting them down, in fact, THPS3 is still my favorite), THESE goals actually tie in with the game, and the transporting from level to level actually has a story to back it. (the levels, by the way, are good too; my personal favorite is Hawaii.)So why did I give the game four stars as opposed to five? One reason: IT'S TOO SHORT. It took me five days to beat the game on normal mode, and then less than 24 hours on too easy mode. There ARE some challenging missions, but they are few and far between. I guess you could fix this by using sick mode, though.Still, though, I recommend this game. It's a blast, and if you like the other THPS games, you'll agree with me. At least rent it.

{"product_name":"B00005T7ZP","description":"Your name is Ryudo, and you've been sent to protect a young priestess journeying to a distant land to participate in a special ceremony.Grandia II, the new story-based RPG, features an innovative battle system that is partially turn-based, partially real-time. The entire world ofGrandia IIis rendered in 3-D, with over 1,000 characters to interact with. Audio voice-overs accompany cinematic cutscenes and serve to reinforce the strong cast of characters.","reviewerName":"Sixto Limiac","summary":"It Pains Me Not To Appraise Grandia II With 5 Stars","reviewText":"Grandia, originally for the Sega Saturn, is the essence of an out-and-out, underground landmark.  Riding along the celestial gamut with the likes of Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG, the first Grandia bought forth a skillfully representation of the hero struggle and an extraordinary battle engine.  However, GameArts' second attempt to reinstate their own Grandia principles doesn't rank up as climatic as the original.  Their dagger to live up to the name of Grandia II is simultaneously sharp and dull.  GameArts manages to rejuvenate the reincarnation of an unparalleled battle system and a fiercely polished graphical trimming, then leaving their previous strong points on plot and characters in the gutters of RPG degradation.Let's not dwell on the fact that Grandia II has a few shortcomings in its story presentation.  First, let's invest time on a breakdown on why Grandia II is noteworthy and slightly distant from a humdrum RPG.  What serves as its vantage side is the impressive and addictive hybrid of real-time and turn-based clash.  Ballooned on the screen are the selected combatants in a full-sized hoedown with enormous fiends.  Grandia II's system is based on a bar found at the bottom of the screen.  The bar contains Faces of each individual participating in the battle, enemies included.  Adjoining on it are the three segments of WAIT, COM, and ACT.  After the WAIT portion, a specified Face hits the COM, and an action for a character is selected.  The Face then advances to the ACT sector, where the command is initiated.  Technical actions such as skill moves or screen-bursting spells entail a longer delay to reach the ACT segment.  Each hero has his or her identifiable imperfection and assets.  Ryudo is best for fighting, Elena is ideal for healing the battered party, Millenia keeps an implicit armory of black magic, Roan attacks in impeccable speed, and the ferocious Mareg is frequently sent to deliver heavy duty damage.  Grandia II warrants a blessing for employing such strategic order.Gladly, monsters are visible throughout the game.  The player may choose to charge head-on or avoid and hurriedly confront the huge boss.  At times though, its mandatory to have a smack down with enemies when pulling some type of switch, but it sure beats the vexing randomness of countless RPGs.  Moreover, learning and acquiring skills are caught in a breeze.  Stockpiling MP and SP points from victories, the player determines the desired skills from Mana Eggs and Skill Books.  In general, the fighting is easy to manipulate and is an unqualified joy to take a womppin' on.On its graphical viewpoint the colors are crisp and super-clean.  The involvedness in dungeons are good, and works well with the line of heroes plowing through it.  In the battle shot, spells are among the most awe-inspiring and not as time-consuming as Square's ridiculous incantations.  A mix of polygons, extreme lighting effects, and animation is truly something still fresh and worth the mention.  Implemented on a quickie, non-sticky battle pace, Grandia II is pomp of what the Dreamcast could handle, but further indicates the force of the PS2.And onto the dark side of Grandia II.  To those who plan to seed hours on any RPG, it's estimated to read or watch a story of great magnitude unfold, but GameArts fails miserably.  Nowhere near the past scenario, Grandia II is an entirely new tale featuring a mercenary and his conquest to escort a Songstress to slay an evil called Valmar (with all the sidequests in between).  Slowly progressed, the story is a strain to watch and to scoop into.  The central hero, Ryudo, seems like a mixed bag of Cloud from FFVII and Squall from FFVIII.  Personally, I would love to see Cloud rip Ryudo from flesh and limb with his Limit Break, the Omnislash.  For Squall -- well, who really did like him?  The unceasing baddie, Melfice, though is not even worth a mention with his weak voice-over and boring intentions.  And don't get me started on Roan and his \"little secret.\"  It's been duplicated so many times that the astonishment was not intended for the character but for GameArts who actually had the balls to comprise the hackneyed bombshell.  And what's more irksome than predictable twists and the shortage of suspense is the dialogue that tries to be funny, clever, and philosophical.  The poor construction of reworked characters and plot robbed Grandia II of its ancillary star.Although feathery on the challenge, the weighty amount of dungeons will chain players down with the bulk of  time gorged on quests and dialogue. About 45 hours will shed off your ticking machines.  With all the hype and hope I had going for it, it pains me not to appraise Grandia II with 5 stars, but with all the chinks in its plot, justice has been served.  Grandia II is a marvel to play but a nuisance to read.  When all is said and done, the only thing that can really sweeten the Grandia pot is the wait for Grandia Xtreme, which is due later this month in Japan.  Hopefully, GameArts will take their tight spots into account and nurture a Grandia that revolves on the \"third time's a charm\" tradition.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2002"}
{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"Julie Hermonat \"Quality Counts\"","summary":"AMAZING!","reviewText":"More than any other game to date, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune seems to define the PlayStation 3. Naughty Dog's 2007 jungle romp starring the one and only Nathan Drake gave gamers a taste of what it would be like to play as an acrobatically-inclined Indiana Jones. With stunning visuals (that still rank amongst the best in gaming today), a fantastically told story, great puzzles and high-octane gunplay, it's easily one of the best titles of this console generation.Now Naughty Dog returns to the spotlight with Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. Both expectedly and amazingly, Naughty Dog has indeed bested Nate's first adventure and has created a sequel that is not only bigger and better in practically every way, but also packs a multiplayer component that could be released as its own separate, full-priced game and people would stand in line to hand over their cash.Yes, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is fantastic.Click the image to watch our in-depth video review.Trying to remain as spoiler-free as possible, I'll just say that the story starts off about a year or so after the events of the first game and begins with Nate and a few fellow thieves working on finding Marco Polo's lost treasure fleet. Of course, things aren't quite that simple and the cast winds up going on a much grander adventure, one that takes them half-way around the world.That's about as far as I want to go with the storyline, though some of the trailers out there actually reveal a little more than that. The important part here though is that this game doesn't just take place on a single island and instead changes locales a handful of times over the course of the adventure. The result is that the pacing feels better and faster, and even though you're technically doing the same sort of shooting, climbing and puzzle solving throughout the game, the different ways the scenes are presented gives Among Thieves a greater sense of gameplay variety than the original.The great storytelling extends to the character development, which has been turned up a good notch or two. Almost everyone with more than two lines of dialogue has an interesting reason for doing what they're doing (though the main bad guy is just bad), and the way that everyone interacts with one another is realistic and interesting. Almost every character is unpredictable in some way, but not in a forced or unnatural manner.The story itself twists and turns throughout the course of the game, as you might expect, and for the most part it's a solid tale. Nate and his pals go through a lot, so it does a good job of reeling you in and keeping you hooked until the end.While I'd say the story is quite good overall, I wouldn't say that it's perfect. Without giving anything away, while most of the story has solid footing in real-world lore and legend, it does start to veer away from this at some point in a way that could have been handled better. Still, it's told very, very well through the use of fantastic cutscenes and acting, and will keep you guessing at what'll happen until the very end.The graphics. Holy crap... the graphics.As for the gameplay itself, Uncharted 2 -- like the original Drake's Fortune -- tasks you with gunfights, environmental navigation or puzzle solving. While a lot of the mechanics are identical to the first title, everything has been blended together a little better, especially the combat and navigation.This is in large part due to the settings that you'll fight in. Whereas the first game generally had you walk into an area with lots of cover, set up behind a wall and then take guys out as best you could, Uncharted 2 offers a lot more variety and options in how these sequences play out thanks to the fantastic level design. Rather than fighting on flat ground, almost every battle scene features multiple levels and areas to use to your advantage. If you want to stay on the ground and take guys out the old fashioned way, you're more than welcome to. But you can also climb to higher ground and use height to your advantage, or flank the enemy by moving from cover to cover and changing your tactics as the battle unfolds around you. While the game is still very much a linear tale, taking you from point to specific point, you're offered many more options in how you approach and deal with battles.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2009"}

While I liked the free roam of Most Wanted, I'm not disappointed that is gone.  However, the regular races of days past are gone.  Instead of high speed pursuits where your luck is about as sharp as your driving skills, this newer version gives you gadgets to manipulate the race yourself.  It's a great concept, which could easily make for some outstanding matches, but somehow falls short.  The actual speed factor seems lost and instead of a while arcade-style ride, you get a moderately exciting run through some overall dull landscapes.  Being the cop is a hoot at times, but not enough to sustain playing for more than an hour or two at a time.  Out-running the cops is not even close to the sort of fun it used to be.  Another disappointment is no two-player.  While I play solo a lot, it would only make sense to have a two-player racing game where one person can be the cop and the other a racer.  Not sure why the mode is not available.  Online play is about as good as the regular game.  My biggest gripe are some of the races.  There are quite a few where you just race alone and try to get the best time without damaging your car.  Sorry folks, I just want to jump head first into being pursued or doing a pursuit.  I don't care for the progression.  There are no quick races like the old school NFS series.  The Burn-out series are far better in my opinion and this game was an unfortunate and guilty waste of my money.  With so many other great titles out there, spare your cash and get it used for $20, because that's all this game is really worth.

I've also used p90x, finishing two 3 month runs of the program.UPDATE: I think programs like p90x is better for overall fitness. Why? Because they have better emphasis on training with weights, which in my case lead to much faster weight loss. Cardio and light weight training just isn't enough. Still I feel that this product is a great start and it can substitute for times when I need cardio.Here are the overall points that I've found with the game when comparing it to the alternatives:[Good]This isn't really a video game. It's a work out program.There is a good variety in the workouts, and you can add more workouts through DLC. As of now I've added about 8 different workout DLC from Xbox Live. I really like the fact that the game can be expanded. Even with stuff like p90x, it does get boring after a while. Constant variety is a good thing. My only question is: can I import the DLC and old workouts into next year's Your Shape Fitness?  I wouldn't want to waste them if I upgrade next year, assuming a new version comes out.Freedom: You can mix and match workouts in what ever combination you want. Depending on what goal you selected in beginning, Your Shape will place a blue flag next to the workouts that are recommended for achieving your goal. This also has a bad side which I'll detail in the 'Bad' section below.Some of the workouts can be fun like the dancing portions and the jumping rope mini game, the most of them are pretty standard DVD or TV show workouts.The workouts can be intense if you like. Specifically the Gatorade workout as well as the Bootcamp segment are pretty good for it.  In my opinion it's a good p90x alternative.I do really like having feedback on whether or not my form is good. I think this is what makes Your Shape unique. It's the closest thing to having a personal trainer. It does a decent job at tracking your overall body movements, but it's not perfect. I have more details about the flaws in the 'Bad' sectionIt's great not having to log my workouts anymore. It does a decent job at tracking statistics such as estimated calories burned.The way you control the menu is just awesome. It's actually better than Microsoft's Kinect menu which is surprising. So instead of hovering over a button and waiting for the circle to complete, to signify selecting it, with YourShape all you have to do is push a button. I'm not sure why Microsoft couldn't figure this out for the main 360 Kinect menu(s).The DLC provides a set of scheduled workouts if you don't want to think about which activities you want to choose.It's relatively cheap if you just buy the main game, especially when you compare it to the alternatives like p90x.It's nice to pair video game achievements with the workout. It's a great motivator.[Bad]It's not really a video game, so it's not as fun as a normal video game. It's a workout program pure and simple.The way the game tracks your movement is not 100% accurate, but it's still pretty good compared to past attempts with camera accessories. Like everything else with Kinect, I'm sure this depends a lot on lighting and how your living room is set up. Currently there are certain workouts that just can't tell where my arms are positioned. I'm not sure how this game misses that my arms are down in certain workouts.While there are a lot of workouts that last more than 3-4 minutes, it would be nice if I can save a playlist of workouts. Right now I have to pick one, finish, then pick another. This kills both my time and my flow. When I'm working out, I just want to get it done and not have to think about it. This is something p90x has. It gives you a list of workouts and you just do it and get results.There is one soccer based workout that you need to unlock with a specific Gatorade bottle, a very specific Gatorade bottle; and not just any G2 bottle will do. You need a 'G Series Fit' bottle. I live in a big metro and we cannot find this bottle in the big chain grocery stores. In fact I can't even find it on Amazon, even though they have over 200 different Gatorade drink products. This annoys me enough to tempt me to knock off another star. I don't mind advertising (like the Humana branded workouts) or even buying a product to lessen the upfront cost of this game, but that aforementioned product needs to be available for me to buy. I feel like I'm searching for the Holy Grail. I don't really care which company is at fault, PepsiCo (who owns Gatorade) or Ubisoft. I just think this was a really extremely poorly executed idea that just makes me angry.Just like p90x, there are a lot of exercises in Your Shape that you can't really do if you live above the first floor of an apartment or condo, unless you have really nice neighbors in the floor below you. You will be jumping and stomping around a lot.I would like more detailed statistics that are logged.It can't seem to detect either my hair or my feet if i'm not wearing shoes. My image on the screen looks like a weird freaky blob. I would really prefer that they just captured my body, and just make everything on it one solid color like Green Man on It's always sunny in philadelphia.The DLC is expensive considering what you get. Still, it is cheaper than workout programs like p90x (if you don't count the cost of the 360 and kinect) and I guess it makes up for the low up front price.I really don't like the UPlay integration. It feels really tacked on.I think Ubisoft needs to provide the option of choosing a different workout moderator. While the default voice is great for a home theater, it doesn't get me motivated enough like p90x's trainer. Specifically normal trainers talk a lot more, for both motivation and good to know info. Sadly I don't think this is possible with this generation of Xbox's since not all of them have a hard drive. I think a lot the problems with this game are due to the limitations Xbox's hardware.While weights are in Your Shape, the focus is clearly on cardio, which is fine but it's not for everyone.For the segments involving weights, there's really no information on how much you should lift or anything related to safety; which to me is a bit strange. Then again as I've already mentioned the focus is on cardio.[Misc]To fully experience this app, you need a hard drive. I didn't list this in the Bad section since this isn't Ubisoft's fault. Every 360 should have a hard drive. This problem stems from Microsoft.Some workouts make use of free weights.[Verdict]This game has a great future. I would recommend it even with its flaws. Overall I think this is a good way to prepare for real workout programs like p90x, or for adding variety if you're bored with your current program. I think Your Shape can only be a full substitute once you have good discipline.I've gotten pretty fat again lately, so I will be putting this game to the test, and I'll be comparing the results to p90x. I'll update the review once I'm finished.UPDATE: So far I don't think this is a complete replacement for exercise programs like p90x. However I feel that this is a great gateway for those programs, as well as a good way to get variety.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2012"}

Using the extraordinary superpowers and amazing skills of Batman, Superman, Green Lantern, The Flash, Wonder Woman, and other favorite DC Comics super heroes, players must join the Justice League to ultimately save humanity from Brainiac and the dark forces that lurk in the universe.","reviewerName":"tvtv3 \"tvtv3\"","summary":"An Alternative to Marvel Ultimate Alliance:  Geared Towards Familes and D.C. Fans","reviewText":"To be completely honest, other than sport and racing themed games, the number of video games that two people can play together nowadays is quite small.  The number is even smaller if you wish to play a game that has an extended storyline with someone else.  Having grown up a fan of D.C. superheroes (instead of Marvel), I was quite surprised when my brother recently purchased JUSTICE LEAGUE HEROES and we were able to play the game together.The game features seven members of the Justice League that each person gets to play at least one during the storyline of the game.  If you choose to play the single player mode you get to play each character at least once, too.  The members of the Justice League played in the game are Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, and Zatanna.  As one progresses, other characters, including Huntress, Aquaman, Hawkgirl, and Green Arrow, can be unlocked and played at certain moments.  The game begins with a clip showing a mysterious meteorite landing on Earth.  Soon after Batman is called to Metropolis to aid the city in what appears to be a takeover by robots from S.T.A.R. labs.  Superman arrives to assist and game play is underway.  Villains fought along the way include Queen Bee, Brainiac, and a clone of Doomsday.The game is fairly easy to play with a storyline streamlined enough for even grandparents to play with their grandkids.  The game plays pretty much like a typical fight game, but there is some strategy has to be used throughout.  The game also features some basics from RPGs that break up what could have been some monotonous moments in the structure and format.  The visuals are well drawn as are the voice talents.  Also, unlike many games like this, there are no little boxes, thought bubbles, or speaking bubbles that have to be read.  The action moves fairly quickly and taken as a whole it seems very much like an animated film that one is being allowed to partake in.My brother and I found the game to be a treat.  It was the best video game of its type that we've been able to play together since the original NES Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle arcade game.  The characters (except for Wonder Woman) are animated really well and the costumes follow the classic costuming for all of the characters.  Superman and Flash are two of the most powerful characters to play from the onset, but I found it surprising to learn that after advancing just a few levels, Zatanna is perhaps the most powerful character to play (part of this is because of a heal spell she has that can heal both her and her partner if they are nearby).  I recently learned that though Zatanna is a secondary character in the D.C. universe, she has played a huge role in some important events and is viewed by some members of the Justice League to be almost too powerful.As much as I enjoyed playing the game, there are a couple of drawbacks.  Though characters such as Martian Manhunter, Green Lantern, and Zatanna are drawn correctly their darker costumes sometimes blend in with the game's background making it difficult to see where they are and who they are fighting.  Also, there are select times during the game that you are allowed to choose a character.  However, most of the time you are automatically given one of two characters to play (though you can switch between those two characters if you wish).  I liked it that everyone is given the chance to play each character at least once, but I wish there would have been a couple of more times to choose your own character to play.  The final drawback of the game is Wonder Woman.  Though her costuming is correct she doesn't have very many powers and she isn't drawn very well.  Wonder Woman is supposed to be a powerful goddess, but she is very, very weak in game.  Also, instead of a beautiful woman, she looks more like a middle-aged mother who would rather take a nap than defend the universe from an evil, hostile takeover.Serious gamers might not enjoy JUSTICE LEAGUE HEROES, but I recommend it for families, especially those with children, as well as D.C. fans who enjoy playing video games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2007"}

The game looks & plays noticeably better than PS3 versions (I played them all from 2K7 to 2K14).  The ball physics are great, there are many more animations & the PS4 controller gives a much better feel.  Also, this game is not a port of the PS3 version -- evident in the gameplay & the pre-loaded 9/27 rosters.  Of all the 3 sports games, I like this one the best -- it's a PS4 show-off for sure.  FIFA is also very good while Madden is ok at best.  Kudos to 2K as they continue to raise the bar with every release.

Sims 2 is a fun and (addicting) game despite a few bugs... (You can't change your younger Sims clothing in the dresser for instance), and the deletion of items the game determines are 'in use' is problematic. Sims 2 is infinitely customizable, and the characters look and sound great... My only beef? The system requirements are WAY too high, and its difficult for even the newer computers(especially those running laptops) to play. Also, the game doesn't offer the option of turning off aging in game which is annoying. Who wants to invest so much time and energy into a sims family, only to have them die? (I know there is a 'hack' for this, but I still think this should be a setting).Overall, if you have a robust computer with the right video card, and the numerous other requirements you'll LOVE sims2.

It was obvious that the game (which had a significant resolution boost but not much more) was being emulated by the GCN, and had not been really ported. It was free, so I didn't mind. All I needed to do as renew my Nintendo Power subscription, which I intended to do anyway. Now the game has been re released for GBA, once again, emulation, and not a port. I must state first that if you have the GCN Zelda Collection its not worth it to buy the GBA Legend of Zelda. Its fun, and the classic still holds up in its entertainment value even though it's a nearly 20-year-old game. I love Zelda to tears which is why I'm still giving it four stars, however, owning the GCN version and having played the GBA edition (courtesy of a friend who let me borrow it) I can honestly say that I don't think its worth paying the $20 to own this game yet again. If you don't have it definitely get it but be ware... The original Zelda was built on a relatively weak 8-bit console. The GBA is a relatively powerful 32 bit handheld specifically designed to take full advantage of sprite based games. The fact that Nintendo is charging $20 for such an old game but could not be bothered to eliminate the frequent and annoying slowdown really makes me mad. Capcom did it for Mega Man! Why couldn't Nintendo be bothered to do it for Zelda? On the plus side, they did remove the flickering that plagued the original and the GCN emulation. It would have been nice if the frame rate dips were worked out too. It could have been done; shoot it wouldn't have been much work for them to do it for the GCN. The difference is that now you do have to pay for this game, and Nintendo should be ashamed of themselves for not eliminating the frame rate dips, which can and do hinder the game play frequently.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2004"}

Just when you think DVD was a step above VHS, think again...it will make your regular DVD's look like VHS.  The picture is super crisp, colors are richer, deeper, and more realistic than before.  Subtle little details that you didn't notice before all of a sudden come alive.  For example since the HD player comes with King Kong, things like little air particles in the air become noticable.  The sound is also amazing...with surround sound and a large HDTV you're set for the theatre.If you are already using your 360 to watch DVD's this player will also make normal DVD's look better alot better.  Even though it'll scale regular DVD to look better, it won't compare to HD DVDs.  Comparing regular and HD on my Toshiba 34\", DVD's were tremendously grainy, blurry,  and duller.  High definition is definetly here and the way to go.  You might not want to bother with this if you don't have an HDTV, but if you do this is what is necessary for maximum picture and sound.The only downfall as most have stated is its lack of HDMI, currently it can only play high definition analogy-wise only not digital with HDMI.

If you love stealth or tactical gaming, then these games are for you. Never having played the originals, I was worried about how dated these games would look and feel. But it didn't take long for that fear to go away.To be perfectly forward about it, the graphics are hit and miss. Cutscenes are lacking in the HD quality overhaul, but the playable levels themselves all look beautiful. Had it been the other way around, then I would have been upset. But, having played a number of these HD PS2 to PS3 ports, I expected as much. As long as the stages I'm playing through are visually impressive, then I couldn't care less about the cutscene graphics. The contrast actually serves to show just how much HD has improved upon the original graphics engine.The controls are friendly and intuitive. They aren't perfect, but they work like a dream in most situations. And I've really enjoyed playing these games. People seem to be divided over their favorite, and I can understand why. Typically I could name a favorite, but I'm finding it troublesome with this collection. That's really saying something for the value of this trilogy. You can be sure you'll get three excellent games which provide an amazing sense of tactic-meets-stealthy infiltration of dangerous places. The storyline isn't always riveting and the cutscene graphics are often lacking in luster, but for the asking price I'd say that this package is wonderfully worthwhile.If you want a run and gunner with wildly impressive eye candy, then this may not be for you. But if you enjoy stalking danger safely in the shadows, taking your time to patiently form and exact a plan of action, then get you some Splinter Cell now!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2012"}

Heck, I wasn't even that much into Zelda at that time, but I remember when the whole Wii reveal was commencing, and the new Zelda game just blew people away. My roommate's eyes widened when he saw the first trailer in 2005 (he was a huge Zelda nut), and I knew I had to get into Zelda before TP (as it would come to be known). So, along with coming to know the Wii's hardware, I was excited about the game. Very much that I had to pre-order it before I even had the system; thankfully, I used a friend's.Come the release of the game, and I was shocked. Not by the greatness of the game, but how the Wii's controls didn't work as I expected. I thought it was the control itself--maybe it was faulty--but I learned that Link didn't have 1:1 movement. Heck, the Wii didn't have 1:1 precision. Still, that didn't deter me from playing and enjoying the game.I had played only Ocarina and the original Zeldas beforehand, so when I started the game and got a good ways into it, I I realized it was very formulaic, but still kept the edge by having Link transform into a wolf, not to mention it was the \"darkest\" Zelda out there, giving Hyrule a shadowed theme and having the characters look more real than ever (as real as they can look).The usual minigames were present, and the arsenal didn't feel entirely revolutionary. What was great, though, was fighting on Epona and utilizing wolf Link's abilities. The fights with wolf Link left me wanting to transform back to human, but it weren't entirely irritating. Midna is a great addition to the franchise, though she did, like Link's many female companions, become slightly annoying at times. The final fight was great, implementing a wide range of the installment's weaponry and the Wii's controls (considering it was an enhanced GameCube game), ended up being my favorite Zelda game--until Skyward Sword.On to Wind Waker!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2012"}
