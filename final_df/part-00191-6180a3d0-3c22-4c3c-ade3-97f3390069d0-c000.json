I was kinda disappointed with it considering I had really high hopes for it. The graphics are much better and the days are longer and in some ways it's good that they're only ten days in a month because you'd get bored looking at the same thing over and over again. I miss having holidays and my character moves so slow without the horse. A lot of this game is really hard to understand too. I can't figure out what to do with my cows because they won't give milk. I don't know what to do with my goat after it stops giving me milk because it'll be too expensive to keep.On the plus side the farm is a lot bigger and there's a lot of room to grow crops and to raise animals. It's really easy to feed the animals but it's hard to get the cows to give milk. Also you get married easier and yopu have a kid a lot faster and you're kid can actually talk. The cad part is your wife and kid really never leave the farm much.I think this game could've been a lot better but I still like it. I suggest renting it first and then seeing if yopu like it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2004"}

Rhodes","summary":"Unlike Anything I've Experienced Before","reviewText":"The Good:+A really compelling story with some really compelling characters+Gorgeous environments really bring the world to life+A great soundtrack+Fantastic voice acting+Often engaging gameplay that limits the player enough to make them consider their options, but provides enough that there are a variety of different ways to go about a situationThe Bad:-The Story will feel sluggish at timesNaughty Dog hit it out of the park with the Uncharted games. They were good quality games that were not just great in cinematic quality, but also in interactive quality. Beautifully bending the interactive touch of a video game with the cinematic trappings of a good adventure film. Sure there were moments when it was over-the-top and surreal, but they were good fun and delivered interesting characters and stories. The Last of Us strives to aim a lot higher than Uncharted, however. Instead of being an outright adventure, The Last of Us reaches a lot higher, is bolder and may be the best thing Naughty Dog has ever put out as a developer thus far.You play as Joel, a man who survived the end of the world. Twenty years after a parasitic fungus turned the world into a wasteland, Joel and few other humans are out for survival. And The Last of Us never lets you forget your goal is to survive. Joel and his ally Tess spend a lot of time trading goods with survivors outside of the city to make a living and to survive. Soon Joel is tasked with smuggling a teenage girl named Ellie to a band only known as The Fireflies. Joel agrees and thus the adventure of The Last of Us truly begins. The story is great, but only because the characters within it are great. The Last of Us makes no bones about what it is. It's a game that takes place in a dreary future where there is only one rule: To survive. You don't know if you can trust the people you meet. As the game is quick to point out that everyone is out to serve their own ends. Small factions have formed among humans, but more than that, Joel and his allies (and enemies) must beware the infected who are also lurking around.The story may be a bit slow, but it wastes no time trying to really develop characters. Like Uncharted many of the best moments are when the characters are simply having casual conversation amongst one another. Unlike Uncharted, though, the tone is a lot more bleak. It's a world that's been ravaged and ransacked and it shows. There is still humor from time to time, but the game never lets you forget just how the world is. The interactions between Joel and Ellie in particular are quite moving and telling of who they are. It's very hard not to care about them and their struggles. And The Last of Us has no issue pulling on your heart strings. It sets the tone and press forward unapologetically.The Last of Us is a pretty big game in and of itself. By comparison, the Uncharted games are a pretty linear affair. You'll never get lost or never know where to go in those games. The Last of Us isn't exactly non-linear, but there's a greater emphasis on exploring your environment for supplies, ammo and health. You'll rarely be confused on where to go or what to do, but if you're not taking the time to properly explore your locale you may that The Last of Us can be a challenging experience nonetheless. This is primarily because combat can (and often does) demand a lot of the player. Survival is the name of the game and The Last of Us keeps this in mind. Ammo is scarce a lot of the time. Just because it seems like you're finding a lot, doesn't mean it can't all be depleted in the next encounter. It's not unusual to use up entire ammo supplies in one encounter and be left to nothing but your supplies and fists in another. If you aren't willing to balance some of it out, The Last of Us can be challenging.The good news is that checkpoints are quite frequent throughout the experience. Should the worst befall you in any given situation you usually don't start too far from where it all happened. This often times means that you can try other strategies without too much worry.Exploring the environments is much more important than the game itself is willing to let on. While not every nook and cranny is actually crawling with infected or bad guys, you still need to search. This is especially true because The Last of Us is very serious about it's survival instincts. You'll find parts that can be used to create support weapons or items to heal you, but never both. You also can't load up on stocks and constantly save them as the game only allows you to carry around a very limited quantity. And everything the game wants you to do is done in real time. You CAN pause the game, but none of your crafting or looking at artifacts you may find in this world or using health packs can be done from a pause menu. Instead it's all done in real time, which puts a greater emphasis on finding safety when you can. You'll have to craft while enemies could be bearing down on your or still be within the area. You'll have to apply a health pack under the same circumstances. This means in the midst of a firefight this is probably going to be difficult to do. But when you have down time you'll relish the chance to prepare yourself for what may be lurking around the next corner. This also means that when you can, you'll be more than tempted to explore each and every environment around you.The combat is often smooth and keeps you on your toes. Many instances can feel overwhemling. This is especially true if you are very reckless with your supplies and find yourself lacking them for the next encounter. Enemies often rush you with reckless abandon. There is time to think and react, but no doubt you'll bite the bullet more than enough times on your first play through. Luckily the game gives you means by which to change or deepen the experience. When crouching, Joel can increase his sense of hearing and plan accordingly. You can often get an idea of where enemies this way. Likewise, if enemies haven't noticed you, you can go for stealth kills or (if you're really bold) try to sneak by entirely. The game encourages you to experiment, letting you know there isn't always a right way to go about anything. Don't expect your downed enemies to be riddled with extra supplies, however. They rarely (if ever) drop anything. Again, there's a neat little dynamic about The Last of Us as a result of all of this. Very few players will experience the game in the same way twice. The way you utilize your supplies often results in different play styles and experiences. Some players will find themselves forced into melee combat, while others will choose to do so in fear that they might not actually find supplies later. And sure enough, no matter how much you comb over some environments, it's actually quite easy to miss items.If there's one thing that can almost always be said about Naughty Dog, it's that they certainly know how to make a good looking game. The environments in The Last of Us look absolutely amazing. The world has a pulse and comes to life like so few video game worlds do. You'll find graffiti on walls that you can read, wanted poster, remnants of an old civilization are everywhere. Ransacked homes, broken televisions, destroyed buildings. The Last of Us is unapologetic about it's style and what it strives to convey. Nothing showcases this better than the environments in which the game takes place in. The world doesn't just look like a typical post apocalyptic world. It actually looks like someone's living in it too. In particular watching the prologue and then watching as it shifts showcases how much care and attention was actually put into each environments. But perhaps the best part about The Last of Us, is that the atmosphere rarely drops. The feeling of dread is surrounding the player much of the time. Not just because of how it all looks, but because of how it also plays. This idea that you might not have enough ammo for the next encounter. There will be moments in which the player may be feeling anxious or even unprepared for certain situations as a result. The end result is that you get a game where survival really is the root of it all as opposed to a game that often asks the player to run in guns blazing. You CAN do this in The Last of Us if you so choose to, but it's quite clear there is something discouraging about doing so.The production values are good on another level as well. The voice acting and sound are all phenomenal. The sound effects are startlingly real. The most rewarding part, however, is easily the soundtrack, which sounds nothing short of fantastic. Often times it sets the mood perfectly, as well as provides a certain amount of comfort, dread and loneliness that some of the characters most certainly feel. It's a well crafted and beautiful soundtrack overall.The Last of Us was a game that had high expectations upon it's announcement. Not just coming out after Naughty Dog's success with Uncharted, but also at the onset of a new generation of consoles. It delivers on multiple fronts. If anything The Last of Us can feel a little sluggish at times. This is especially true in the beginning when the game is teaching you how to play it and show you the ropes. The Last of Us will take its sweet little time setting the stage for what is to unfold, and for some gamers it will undoubtedly test their patience. Stick with it, however and the game comes to a point where it simply keeps getting bigger and better.The Survival Edition comes in a huge box.  Inside of it is a steel case that has a picture of Ellie on one side and Joel on the other.  It also comes with an art book and the #1 Issue of The Last of Us: American Dreams.  There is also a sights and sounds DLC pack with gives you the Official Game Soundtrack, a PS3 Dynamic Theme and PS3 Avatars of Joel and Ellie.  It's not too much more expensive than the standard edition, and actually includes quite a few extras for the extra money.Simply put, The Last of Us is a pretty bold game. It's more than just another run of the mill shooter. It's attention to detail and character make it a gaming experience worth having. If you have a PS3 it is definitely worth a look.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2013"}

The only problem I've seen in this game is that if you are not close to your friends or to the place you need to be, the story won't continue. It is well designed to be triggered at the right place of a mission. I have heard that the doors don't open or you keep randomly shooting people but they keep coming.

Your actions define your character, and your gameplay changes and evolves in response to your actions. Confront the assassins' guild, and they take out a contract on you; impress them, and they try to recruit you instead. No two sagas are the same in the world of Morrowind.Players can choose to follow the intriguing main story line or set off to explore the province of Morrowind and the many interesting people and exotic locations it contains. Vast cities and remote villages dot the landscape, each with its own unique look and feel. Hundreds of quests and adventures await as you interact with characters and learn more. Regardless of whether you play a murdering assassin or a noble knight, the game holds endless possibilities and allows you to revisit the main story line at any time.With Morrowind, the Elder Scrolls character system is coupled with an increase in the world's richness of detail. Utilizing advanced 3-D technology, Morrowind features hyperrealistic textures and polygon counts, real-time shadows, vast landscapes, skeletal-based animation, and a complete weather system. Gameplay is further extended with the inclusion of The Elder Scrolls Construction Set, which allows players to modify and add to Morrowind in any way they see fit.

The actions you take have consequences, you have complete freedom to roam wherever you want, and there's plenty of treasure to find to encourage your curiosity.  The graphics are high end (although they have suffered with age) and the lore is plentiful.  The design of the island is also mesmerizing.  You can walk through a wet marsh, sandy desert, or a massive city.The downsides to this game come down to the combat, voice acting, and amount of characters.  The combat usually comes down to frantic clicking and it can be tiresome at first as you hear a \"wiff\" noise every time you miss.  As you level up your combat, this problem goes away.  The voice acting is hardly there and you're forced to read through a massive amount of text to get anywhere.  And lastly, you'll be walking through a bustling city with nary a person around.  Considering the limitations at the time period, I don't think these things are that negative.  It just may throw off a modern gamer.However, for myself, I still find myself drawn to the complete freedom and wonder that permeates Morrowind.

{"product_name":"B001TOQ8J8","reviewerName":"Brendan Foy \"Foy\"","summary":"Fun for two, not for all","reviewText":"I'll just get to each gameplay mode the game offers and share my thoughts.  I never played the first game in the series, so I can not compare this sequel to the original.The campaign of Army of Two: TFD can be played either in solo mode or cooperatively via split screen or online.  Solo mode is acceptable and functional but on the bland side, you really need to play this game on coop to have fun.  Idealy you would want to play with a friend since there are so many hysterical moments to be had during all of the intense action but you can also enjoy yourself quite a bit if you can find a stranger online who is decent at the game and willing to work as a team.  The game is centered around team work relying on a simplistic but rewarding formula of distract and flank.  You have an \"aggro meter\" shown at the top of the screen for each character (Salem and Rios) which fills up when you fire at the enemy.  The louder the gun, the quicker the aggro bar fills up and the more attention you get.  The key is to manage these aggro bars effectively so the enemy's attention is on one of you while the other flanks them from one side, effectively surrounding them with only two of you.  It works pretty well and even though it sounds simplistic in nature, you are put in some pretty tight binds where some serious thought is needed to get through alive.  You can also lower your weapon aggro with silencers allowing one of you to quietly take out the enemy forces one by one as they rain fire on your buddy.  If things get too hot for your partner, you can remove the silencer with a simple button press and call some of the attention off him.Aside from the aggro system the coop moments are pretty basic and limited, but still fun.  There are only two instances where you are separated and must work your way to a particular checkpoint to reunite.  One of these was done quite brilliantly, I thought, where you must remain in constant communication with one another to point out where the enemy is in your path and hoping your partner can get in a position to provide some cover fire or clear your path.  Otherwise the teamwork mostly consists of step jumps, combining your strength to open a door, latching onto your partner while he carries a riot shield and two odd segments in the game where you must fight back to back and fire at surrounding enemies.  The first of these back to back segments is pretty cool, you really have no where else to go and have to stand back to back but the second made no sense as you are out in the open but are forced to stand there in one spot and just fire at enemies while exposed.  You also have a countdown to coop snipe or can mock a surrender and quickdraw your pistols together but it's nothing we haven't done in other games without it being touted as a game mechanic.The campaign is pretty short and not very difficult, though on Contractor mode some of the crescendo moments can prove quite frustrating.  Still, I mainly got stuck due to my partner's lack of skill than game difficulty.  The game has a cover system, use it!  You will be amazed what a little brick wall can shield you from.  I thought the cover system worked well enough and the controls took some getting used to but nothing I found myself wrestling with past the first level.  The only real issue I had with the controls is partner revival.  When your partner goes down, you have to wait a second or two for the game to prompt you to either tap button 'a' to grab your friend to drag him or hold 'a' to heal him.  As you can probably imagine, waiting for this second or so is not ideal when you are being sprayed with bullets, especially when your partner was downed out in the open away from the safety of cover.  I often found myself hitting button 'a' too soon which caused me to sprint away from my partner, and into certain death or to vault over an object exposing myself.  These cheap deaths were quite frustrating but other than reviving my partner the controls were just fine, they just had somewhat of a rough feel which isn't surprising as the entire game feels and looks a little rough around the edges, the budget for this one was clearly cut compared to other EA games.The best multiplayer mode by far is Extraction which is basically Ao2's version of Gears of War's Horde mode or Halo: ODST's Firefight mode.  It is not as good as the modes offered in those games but it is still pretty fun and definitely looks and feels more polished than the other MP modes this game offers.  There is a 50 point achievement to beat all 16 rounds of Extraction and though the difficulty certainly ramps up, it is doable.  I nailed it on my 3rd try, almost got there on my first.  You will find yourself camping in certain spots to escape death and notice that the A.I. is pretty stupid at times with enemies running right by you because they seem dead set on going after your friend instead, but this can be overlooked for the most part.  Having the achievement already, I'd be more than willing to hop in to help others get the achievement.The other modes offered in MP are Co-op Deathmatch where you and a partner take on other duos (you can also be your own one man team), Control where your team and an enemy team fight for a designated control point and Warzone which is a 5 round match of varying obectives from stealing intelligence, to protecting targets to arming bombs, pitting two teams of 4 against one another.  These MP modes suffer from lag, disconnects, freezes and just odd little glitches too frequently not to be mentioned.  The matchmaking is terrible where you can join a game and you are out numbered 4 to 2 but then 2 more prople join and the game adds them to the opposing team leading you to be outnumbered 6 to 2!  It happens all the time.  You also can't host your own public matches.  The game modes themselves are not all that fun either, the graphics take a serious downgrade and it feels clunky and tacked on.  There is an achievement where you have to win on every map (6 in total) in all three game modes but I can't seem to unlock the achievement.  This is a common problem, nobody is really sure why it happens, but I feel as if I am laboring through these matches just to get the achievement.  It is not worth it.  I have won everything on every map, but with the constant disconnects and host disconnects, getting a win to count seems like a crapshoot.So in short, Campaign mode on co-op is a lot of fun and it plays decent while looking pretty good too.  I wish there was some form of interaction with the environment but slapping your friend on the buttocks or punching him in the kidneys is a nice little touch.

Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game.

Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly).

{"product_name":"B003DNH95K","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Posey","summary":"First Impressions: Lord of the Rings - War in the North","reviewText":"As a Lord of the Rings fan, I pretty much assumed that most games would be movie spin off rubbish or past it's prime MMO games.  So, I was a little hesitant about picking up LOTR: War in the North.  After spending a solid night playing the game, the following are my initial impressions on the game.For starters, the game is mature in nature, which is awesome.  You hack and slash enemies arms off their bodies and blood is spilling everywhere.  You can turn this off, but in a universe that this rarely occurs in, I love it.  This isn't a movie rehash where everything is toned down to get a certain rating, you'll see blood in your travels, and that's a good thing in a world that is certainly violent by design.At the onset of the game, you'll be tasked with picking one of three characters.  A human Ranger, Elf caster, and a dwarf axe wielder.  Each class is similar in that they can do melee and range but they all have their own specialties.  I chose to go with the ranger.  While the game gives you a default look for your character, you can change it early in the game when you are in Bree.  I really liked this addition to the game since you can make the character your own.  My ranger has jet black hair and a square jaw.  Kind of reminds me Madmartigan from Willow (props if you remember that classic movie.)The gameplay in War in the North is typical hack and slash.  On medium difficulty, enemies take a good deal to bring down early in the game but after each level you will be putting points into stats that will help you bring down enemies faster (or to complement whatever play style you have.  The gameplay is indeed fun but by the end of the night I was getting a little tired of it.  There wasn't much in the way of variety to change things up.  But, I'm still very early in the game and this shouldn't be a huge criticism against it since the world is still being fleshed out and the characters introduced.If you are a Lord of the Rings fan, you'll really enjoy this game.  Being able to play as someone besides the main characters from the books/movies is a welcome way to enjoy the universe and you'll see things happening in the world from a different perspective.  New enemies I've never heard of pop up and all are involved in the story we all know and love in same way.  If you aren't too hot on the LOTR series though, your mileage may vary with this game.  Hack and slash fans will enjoy it but there are certainly better games out there to play.  Being a fan of LOTR gives the game the extra \"oomph\" needed to push the player along in the world.So, final though - Lord of the Rings: War in the North really good game that can get tiring if you aren't a LOTR fan.  Hack and Slash fans will enjoy the game, but their mileage will vary depending on interest in this beloved series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2011"}

And this is why:-Great Characters and character designs: From our hero to every single villain, even the thugs look great and right out of a comic book.  I especially liked Bane and the Killer Crock.-Detailed and rich environments, open world:  Gardens, hallways, offices, in short everywhere looks great, full of little details that pulls you into the gameworld.  Atmosphere is dark and just right.-Voice acting and dialogues are top notch:  Come on, how can it be bad, they got everyone on board.  I love the chemistry between the Batman and the villains.  Get a grip Batsy, have fun :).-Good AI, sometimes too good.  Boy, in this game I realised I suck at stealth.  Died many times because I missed my target couple of times. They came after me, in packs, with guns and no mercy!-No penalty for falling by mistake:  If you fall into a bottomless pitt, hit R1 and you're saved or if you fall from a ledge you glide and land like a feather.  I hated Tomb Raider for this, one step too many and good bye Lara...-Collectibles are rewarding, not just there to fill your trophy case:  Well, some are but mostly you get a recording, info, or my favorite, 3D models of the characters in the game. Oh, there are also maps for collectibles in the game, if you can find them (Not that hard). Here is a tip, partially a **spoiler** to solve some riddles, Tip1:use x-ray vision, Tip2:think magic ink, Tip3:connect the dot, I don't wanna say more.-Story has this faimiliar comic book feeling, which I liked, a lot.  No sub story feels out of place, the story just flows and so are you.  It's like living a comic book dream.  Nice length too, if you don't rush it.-Very friendly controls:  Your gadgets on the left, and actions on the right, that's about it.  Once you get used to it, it takes like 10 minutes, you will feel very comfortable with it.  I have a terrible hand eye coordination and even I got 20x combo points, go figure.  Just don't forget to leave your gadget set at batarangs at all times after using some other gadget.There is only one major flaw in the game, it ends.  Thankfully there will be a sequal, I can hardly wait but I'm not expecting it to come out soon.  I highly recommend this title.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2010"}

Romano \"Avid Gamer\"","summary":"Medal of Honor is not in the Same League as the Call of Duty Series","reviewText":"This review is based on the Single Player Campaign.  I really wanted to like this new Medal of Honor game.  I heard so much about it.  It was suppose to be one of best video games to come out this year. I preordered this game so I could play it on the first day it came out.  Well guess what?  After playing the Single Player Campaign, I can honestly say it is not as good as the Call of Duty Series.This game will definitely be coming down in price in the next few weeks.  First of all, the graphics are just okay.  I noticed right away the graphics are not as sharp and crisp as the Call of Duty graphics are. There is one mission where you play through an airplane graveyard like in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. You see planes lying around on the ground like in Call of Duty.  I noticed right away the planes are not as detail inside or out as in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.  In fact, I could tell right away that Medal of Honor is trying real hard to be almost like the Call of Duty Series.The story in the Single Player Campaign is heavily scripted.  You don't have a lot of freedom to do whatever you want throughout the campaign.  For instance, if I wanted to kick in a door to a building I want to enter, I can't do anything until my fellow teammates come up to the door. Then I am allowed to kick in the door.  Another time I was with a group of Army Rangers assaulting a machine gun nest in a Afghan village up in the mountains and I actually went by myself all the way up to the machine gun nest without my fellow Army Rangers teammates tagging along and threw a grenade into the nest and shot up the machine gunner with my weapon.  Well guess what?  Nothing happened.  I went ahead of the script in the game.  I was yelled and screamed at by my fellow Army Rangers to go all the way back to where they were hiding behind some stone walls and I was suppose to give them cover fire so they could assault the machine gun nest themselves.  I kept wondering why couldn't I assault the machine gun nest on my own?In Medal of Honor, you are not allowed to make decisions on your own.  I was in an Apache Helicopter assaulting some enemy mortar positions on a mountain side and I use a machine gun instead of a cannon on the Apache to take out the mortar positions.  Well I kill the enemy mortar crews with the machine gun and I knocked out the mortar positions but the game would not advance unless I used the Apache cannon on the mortar positions. Why can't I make up my own decision on what weapon to use and how to complete the mission?  Another mission I was on a cliff above some anti-aircraft guns.  I wanted to use a sniper rifle to take out the enemy anti-aircraft crews and the game forces you to call in air strikes to take out the anti-aircraft guns.  The game gives you no choice.  Why can't we have the freedom to make our choices and decisions in the game?  We are not babies that have to be held by the hand on how to play a game.At least with Call of Duty: Black Ops you have the freedom to pretty much do whatever you want.  I can't wait until that game comes out on November 9, 2010.  Call of Duty: Black Ops is already setting records before it even comes out has being one of the bestselling video games in gaming history.  Medal of Honor had a chance to be right up there with Call of Duty: Black Ops and the game developer and game publisher for Medal of Honor blew it.  What a shame.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2010"}

The main complaint that kept me from playing it for so long was that it was too much like the original.Once I actually began playing, however, I was pleasantly surprised by how much fun I had with the game.  I had been away from rapture for quite a while and it felt good to be back again.Adding to the fun is the fact that you are now a big daddy from the first game.  Being able to wield a plasmid and a drill at the same time is awesome.  The guns in the game are a blast to use still and setting up traps for splicers is as fun and pretty much as necessary as before.True, this game is a lot like the original.  It's the same setting and your fighting the same enemies.  What sets this game apart is the story and the context why you are there.  Learning about the history of your big daddy character and how you fit in the world is a very interesting topic.  The gameplay as a big daddy is also very fun and rewarding.  Right off the bat you are charged with finding little sisters to help you harvest adam from specific splicer corpses in rapture.  This is helpful because you need adam to upgrade your plasmids to make them stronger.That sounds easy enough but while the little sisters are harvesting the adam splicers are automatically attracted to it sending them right to your area.  This is where setting traps and knowing how to defend yourself really pay off. This is something you'll be doing throughout the whole game while unraveling the story.  Thankfully, it never gets old and is always pretty gratifying to see your adam count go up.The story in this one is also pretty darn good.  Its pretty basic but i liked it a lot.  I really like how good this game makes you feel every time you decide to do something like save a little sister.  If you remember the ending of the first game after saving all the little sisters you'll have a pretty good idea of the feeling it tries to instill in you.  The first game's ending is one of my favorites.Anyways, if you loved the first bioshock and still haven't played this one then you should definitley give it a go.  It's a lot of fun and will bring back the good memories you had with the first.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2012"}

But since I've bought so much and written many reviews on here, I thought I would write one anyways. I recently bought a DS because I dearly missed the Zelda series. I bought this at my local used game store because they didnt have Phantom Hourglass so I thought I should get this. I bought this and hurried home to play it. Within a minutes I fell back in love with this series again. Its been 5 years since I've touched a Zelda game. Last I played was Minish Cap. This game is crazy fun. It mostly utilizes the touch screen for everything from moving around, combat, and puzzle solving. As the sub name of this game is Spirit Tracks, you'll be comandeering a train to get from place to place. The story starts as you (Link or whatever you put your name as) and you're an engineer and you're about to go to Hyrule to get your certificate to become an official engineer. A familiar character comes to screen, Alfonso, whom I remember from Wind Waker. He's your mentor. So after you guys go to Hyrule via train (which you comandeer) you are certified by the only Princess Zelda. After that is where stuff happens.  Zelda wants to go to the Tower of Spirits to see why the Spirit Tracks are dissapearing. Along the way you, Zelda, and Alfonso are ambushed and Zelda's soul is released from her body and her body is taken by the bad guy. The bad guys are planning to ressurect the Demon King and he needs body and is gonna use Zelda's because she is the princess. The Tower of Spirits is seperated into four and need restoring to get Zelda's body back, thats where you come in and your journey begins. I had fun with this game. The train rides are actually fun thought some might find them boring. Later on you receive Zelda's flute in which uses the handhelds mic to play it. Using the stylus, move the flute to whatever color and blow to play, simple and fun. I will be playing this for awhile and when I'm finished I'll be getting Phantom Hourglass. This is a great game anyone. I highly recommend buying it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2013"}

This can be great or annoying depending on your point of view.You are playing a dark lord who looks very suspiciously like Sauron from the Lord of the Rings series. Your advisor and minions are straight from Gremlins, with perhaps a bit of Yoda thrown in for good measure. When you head out on your first world to conquer, you run into hobbits, who live in little holes with round doors, in a village named ... \"Spree\". Yes, the game goes out of its way to be cute and poke fun at all fantasy stories.Just like in Dungeon Keeper, you are in control of a swarm of mindless but generally loyal lackeys. You start with just the basic grunts, but as you progress you can unlock a healthy variety of creature types.Most of your tasks are typical - get 10 minions to push aside a blockade, send your minions in to raze a village, and so on. While you are praised for being \"evil\", you're also warned to allow at least some innocents to survive so they provide workers for your empire. Meanwhile, back at the Evil Castle, your progress means that they fix up the place so it is worthy of being your home.I do have to admit the little minions are quite cute. If you raid a pumpkin patch, a few of them will grab pumpkins and stick them on their heads. As they find weapons and armor, they'll equip them, so each minion becomes unique. If you need health, you have to sacrifice a few minions at an altar - and sometimes it's hard to do it, because you've become fond of the little critters. Still, that's the price of being evil. You can generate more, but they start out in their raw state.The dialogue is appropriately dark and wry, although not nearly as great as some of the lines from Dungeon Keeper. Some of your quests also seem not to make any sense. You have to *save* people from slavery?? You have to get food for people? These don't sound like very evil acts to me. Then, when you run rampant in their town, they whine about the mess. They should be quaking in fear!I found the Pikmin micromanaging a little annoying - an evil overlord shouldn't have to be telling his minions to clear the way to the next point of attack. I also found the camera to be quite more annoying at times.Still, since there's no new Dungeon Keeper game on the horizon, this fills the spot admirably and does have a lot of fun in it. Well recommended, and for people who enjoy this type of gameplay who haven't played the Dungeon Keeper games yet - go buy them! See where this genre came from :)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2007"}
{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"Charles \"Altered Confusion\"","summary":"Uncharted 3 Review","reviewText":"The new Uncharted has come out and you'll get to see some of your favorite characters. You'll get to play as Nathan Drake, treasure hunter, and all around finder of trouble. This adventure will actually have you reliving a little of your past, and also why you even got into the treasure hunting game. Once again you'll have to scale walls, figure out puzzles, and try not to die to get to the ultimate discovery for your character. That of course is what happened to Sir Francis Drake during his travels. You think you have half the puzzle, but that's only the beginning.Graphically this game contines to blow my mind. I seriously think that the team that works on the Uncharted series is always trying to find a way to squeeze just a little bit more out of the PlayStation 3, and they continue to succeed. The different locations that you'll get to travel through, and the effects are amazing. You'll get to see plenty of different looking climbs in this game, and the look and feel of the puzzles (or obstacles) set in your path. The character designs of course look amazing. The one thing that I think sets them apart from the rest is the fact that they modeled in imperfections, a not so nicely tucked in shirt, a little bit of extra hair on the neck showing that the last haircut Drake got was a while ago, and so much more.The sounds of the game belong in a movie, and sometimes I feel like I've almost heard the tune playing in a movie. The voice acting is also beyond solid. There is emotion in the voices, and with everything being voiced you really start feeling for the characters, be it love or hate, only you'll know as you go through the game.The controls of the game are the same as usual. I did feel that there were times where I felt like the controls got confused. There are times where triangle will do one thing, while other times it does something else, if you find yourself in a situation where you're faced with 3 choices at the same time, you might find that you just did the wrong action.I couldn't wait for this game to come out, and it didn't disappoint with its story. I was hooked once I started, and I didn't look back until the credits were rolling. I will say this though, there was a blemish in the game, and that was the combat sequences. You're going at a break neck pace through the game, where you're climbing, solving, and discovering what happens next, and then you get into a gun fight, and there were several times when I found myself in a gun fight that it felt almost random when it came to my chance to succeed. I know you can't go Rambo though the parts, though your first instinct might be to do so as you've just come off some high paced action, but those were really the only pieces of the game where I had to fight myself to try again.If you're looking for a action packed, adventure game, that feels like a movie, you need to check this game out, you might have trouble with the combat, like I did, but you're going to want to fight to the finish to discover what mysteries you'll be uncovering. This game gets a 9.0 out of 10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}
{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"Dr. D","summary":"Weakest Story of the Trilogy","reviewText":"*POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*Being a proud owner of the entire Uncharted series thus far, I must say that Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception has the worst storyline of them all.  What exactly is he being deceived about?  Maybe I missed something during the story, I don't know.  The knife fight at the end was awful, and the main plot about the enemies instilling fear in people through a hallucinogen in the water is straight out of a DC comics character.  Wait for it.......Batman's enemy, SCARECROW!  Sorry folks, but I sincerely hope this is the end of the Uncharted series.  It seems to have fallen victim to the Call of Duty Syndrome.  After the third game, hang up your jock already!As far as gameplay is concerned, I felt like this game was way too much of a Hollywood blockbuster film than a game in the purest sense of the word.  Uncharted 3's gameplay mechanics blended with cinematic cutscenes a little too much, and more so than the previous titles.  The graphics aren't bad, but I encountered a few glitches.  My game froze at the beginning of Chapter 10 \"Historical Research,\" buildings seemed to disappear here and there depending on your manipulation of the camera, and during the knife fight, Talbot fell off the platform and I had to restart the fight all over again.  Annoying!!!  The camera angles were also horribly executed during the platforming sequences (i.e. when Drake was a little kid in Cartagena and at the very end of the game when the city came crumbling down).With regard to multiplayer, I didn't bother with that since I'm a single player type of gamer.  Playing the game in 3D was somewhat cool, but I wish there were more pop-out types of effects rather than depth.  The only thing that seemed to pop out of the screen were the sniper lasers and bullets.  Ghosting was also ridiculously high in many chapters.I honestly can't see how this game can be a contender for Game of the Year.  That should go to Batman: Arkham City or Skyrim over this one.To sum it up, if you already have the first two games, go ahead and buy this for posterity reasons.  If you don't have any of the previous two titles, do NOT buy Uncharted 3 first!  If you do, it's an almost guaranteed trade-in.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2011"}

{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"Too Old for Games \"casualgamer\"","summary":"UC2>UC3>UC1","reviewText":"Uncharted 2 set the benchmark for the action/platforming genre so it was going to take a lot to surpass it, and not surprisingly, Uncharted 3 fails to do so.  The developers took the safe approach and basically remade Uncharted 2 with new locales and tweaked the fight mechanic a bit; however, something happened along the way and the end product just doesn't have the same magic that it's predecessor possessed.  They upped the wow factor with even better graphics (the forest in France was incredible) and huge cinematic moments (the plane and boat scenes were all amazing).  But these improvements failed to compensate for a paper thin story and the lack of cohesion that tied these set pieces together--the developers stated that they started development wanting a boat and plane scene and it feels like they forced the story together to enable this.  The enemy npc's are worse off, e.g., it takes more than a single headshot to take down mini-bosses that aren't even wearing head gear.  How does that make sense?  The \"maps\" within each setting aren't that well laid out, at least to me.  There was also a missed opportunity in that there are certain situations that it seemed as though you could sneak past to proceed a la Metal Gear or Splinter Cell, but you eventually get caught and have to kill everyone.  The side characters seem to be written into the story as an after-thought.  But what really took the cake was the transformation of Nathan Drake from treasure hunter to John Rambo/James Bond.  You will take down a whole platoon of enemies, which I accept as this is a 3rd person shooter video game, but you will escape inescapable situations and you will be weak to the verge of death, but defeat a squad of enemies. In a nutshell, the entire game can be summed up as Nathan entering a new venue, climb to get past obstacles and solve puzzles, take down a squadron of enemies, more climbing because that's what Nathan does, have the floor or hand-hold give out on you to create some drama not realizing that doing this 10 times kind of dilutes any tension whatsoever, escape the area to continue on to a new locale to repeat once again.  Yes, I realize all games can be broken down to a few aspects at their core, but the great games hide this from you with a great story and little nuances here and there to break up the repetition.  With this game, I felt the same act over and over with each new location.  I may seem overly harsh with this review so with all this said, I still feel it's a five star game and should be played at least once.  This review was based on the campaign only as I have yet to try the multiplayer.  What made UC2 one of my favorites were the co-op missions and arena modes and I only hope they are equally as good in UC3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2011"}

I had been truly curious about what type of story they have in this prequel and also to check out new multiplayer modes. So I have completed the story once and completed first 4 or 5 ranks in multiplayer and here is what I think.PROS.AMAZING GRAPHICS IMPROVEMENT: I remember seeing Halo 3 for the first time and my jaws literally dropped; however, that was because we went from Xbox to Xbox 360, a newer more powerful machine. Afterwards, when ODST was released, there was a slight graphical improvement, but now if you compare Halo to Halo Reach, you can see there is clearly a Major difference. Things look so much nicer, sharper. The different colors are very easily distinguishable from each other and most importantly, each character (specially their armor) and object is animated to the very last detail. JUST GORGEOUS.ARMOR UPGRADE: My second favorite thing in Halo. Completing story and competing online gives you credit and you can use this credit to buy armor, some equipments, logos and whatnot. This truly adds RPG element to the game. Promotes you to play more. Very important improvement.PERKS: I am not sure what they call it, but I will refer to them as perks. Basically, now your character, can either run fast, fly with a jetpack, have healing shield bubble, can create a decoy of himself or can create impenetrable shield around his body. I loved the jetpack and decoy perks. Just adds a whole new dimension to the play. Love how you can fly over a player and shoot. Love how you can  throw your decoy and attract bloodthirsty crowd to attack it from their hideout and just get them big time.MULTIPLAYER: To me this is the strongest aspect of all the Halo games. Each time they come up with something that will keep players playing multiplayer for ages. This time around you can have many of the previous modes (Equivalent to deathmatch, grab skull and such) ,  but on top of it you also have new modes such as Infection. Basically, you either have to defend yourself from other team that has vampire like ability (and a freaking awesome plasma sword), if you can't you become one of them. Pretty amusing. There are also other modes that will keep you engaged for a long time.DECENT AND SORROWFUL STORY: So Halo 1 starts out as Master Chief being the LAST SPARTAN alive. Don't want to spoil much, but Reach story goes into demise of Spartans and they have done pretty good job portraying it.NEW WEAPONS: There not that many new weapons, but once you get to use are pretty awesome. Don't want to spoil much.CONS.VERY SHORT CAMPAIGN: This was huge just huge disappointment for me. I was hoping since this is the last game in the series that have a long campaign for players like me who appreciate Single Player Campaign. However, at most it was 8 hours long. Honestly, I found it to be quite ridiculous. They still have all the awesome vehicles and what not in the campaign, but for most part it is just killing hordes and hordes of enemies.STILL NO DUAL WEILDING: What the hell? Why did they take it out since Halo ODST. I loved duel wielding weapons and 1-2 combos from needler and charge gun. Why Bungie? Why?VERY FEW NEW WEAPONS: Yeah I was expecting more new weapons than what they provided in the game. A bit disappointed.CONCLUSION:So if you are someone who really dig Multiplayer and not care much about single player that much ADD A STAR to my score, if you are someone who love mainly single player campaign and don't play multiplayer that much REMOVE A STAR. While I personally do wish they would have longer single player campaign, all and all I am happy I bought Halo Reach. Multiplayer truly makes it long lasting experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2010"}

Being a long-time player of first-person shooter games since the 1990s (Wolfenstein, Blake Stone, Doom), I've naturally played Halo, Halo 2, and a variety of other modern FPS games. However, I've not played Halo 3 or ODST, but I read other reviews indicating Halo Reach is by far one of the best Halo games to date. I have to agree with that consensus, mainly because Halo Reach takes many elements of story-telling, gaming, and immersing the player/viewer into a certain atmosphere and doing all of this quite well.Halo Reach differs from previous Halo games by introducing other SPARTAN characters that have unique personalities. The best way to describe it is to take Call of Duty Modern Warfare, mix in Medal of Honor 2010, and then give the main characters SPARTAN-III armor. You get to blow away enemies while using the guns onboard rotary aircraft (Falcon, instead of a Blackhawk/Little Bird/AC130), make near-impossible jumps onboard said aircraft (ala CoD MW/MW2), use aircraft to destroy ground targets (piloting the Falcon, ala Cobra/Apache/Hind), and even pilot spacecraft (Sabre) to engage in space combat (uh... sorry, no CoD/MoH comparison here).Some of the complaints I have are related to the vehicle controls. While Halo Reach does many things quite well, it still has the inadequate vehicle dynamics found in Halo and Halo 2. The warthog, Mongoose, and other wheeled vehicles don't \"drive\" like vehicles you typically use in other games. The split controls over the 2 analog sticks makes it confusing initially, but I am sure hardcore Halo veterans are already used to it. The Covenant vehicles are easier to maneuver because the controls feel more in tune with Descent (one of the first games to be truly 3D). The spaceflight controls aren't too bad, and it sort of resembles Descent Freespace or TIE Fighter.Another area that I'm not fond of is in the weapons department. I found myself often running low/out of ammo when I needed them the most. Examples include an Elite charging at me with an energy sword, or a Brute charging at me with a Gravity Hammer. The enemy shields are often a pain in the butt. It started to remind me of Republic Commando where your weapons inflicted minimal damage against shielded enemies and I often resorted to just using melee to take them out more easily.Call of Duty Modern Warfare / Medal of Honor offered better damage for friendly weapons, and granted this might make Halo \"easier\", but I'd assume the human race would figure out a new type of ballistic weapon that could penetrate shielding, penetrate armor, explode and set the enemy on fire in one single shot by the year 2552.I bought Halo Reach about a month after it was first released, and I received a redemption code for a free Spartan Recon Helmet. Unfortunately, this code did not work. I performed a Google search and found out that Microsoft apparently makes the codes limited use until a certain day or when a certain amount of people have received the avatar award. I just know that I tend to buy more stuff when they give out some freebies even though they don't have to do so, and it was disappointing that they gave me a code that wasn't functional.The sound effects and visuals are absolutely fantastic. Halo Reach is definitely darker and more immersive in nature than previous Halo games. The multiplayer modes offer variety and give a lot of replay value to the game. Some of the achievements were a true pain to achieve. For example, jumping off a cliff in the Pillar of Autumn map, and executing an assassination on an Elite just before you land took me about 90 minutes and hundreds of deaths! I still haven't had time to sit and earn 1,000,000 points in Firefight to get another achievement.

It's basically the same but this has bluetooth which makes this totally wireless. Lot of the Turtle Beach headsets requires a talkback cable from the Xbox 360 controller to the headset which can get annoying so the bluetooth connection is a welcome addition for me. I use this mainly for my Xbox 360 but also my PS3, Wii U (minus chat), smartphone (music and phone calls), PC, and TV. Had no problems so far. I already own the DSS for surround sound so I didn't need to get the XP400. The XP500 is an older model which required 2 AAA batteries which is a deal breaker for me. I've previously owned the X31 so it annoyed me. The XP300 has an internal rechargeable battery which can recharged from the bundled charge cable. It can be charged while still in use which is a bonus. For the price, I recommend this. If you want surround sound, get the XP400.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B001NX4DUQ","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"They are on the right track","reviewText":"With so many bashing reviews for this game, I was a bit hesitant to buy this one, but I played the demo and watch many videos and to me it seemed ok. So I gave it a shot and here is what I think after finishing the game once on the normal mode.*****************PROS:****************AMAZING VISUALS AND GREAT ARTSTYLE: Artstyle and graphics in this games are simply phenomenal. Depiction of seven circles of hell, design of various enemies and bosses as well as character are just amazing. This is the strongest aspect of the game and will truly promote you to go deeper into hell to see its sadistic beauty.DECENT COMBAT MECHANICS: Combat mechanics in this game is somewhere between Devil May Cry 3 and God of War. As you will see, they have borrowed heavily from both of this game (mainly God of War). For most part, it works great and you will be able to punish you enemies in decent number of ways. Fans of heck&slash; genre will certainly like it.DECENT PLATFORMING GAMEPLAY: Other than combat, what makes gameplay fun is its platforming aspect. Just like God of War, you will be jumping, hanging, swinging and performing various actions from structure to another. While it does have its downside (see cons.), for majority of game, the developers have done wonderful job. I particularly like the design how you are literally going down different circles of hell through platforming aspect.UPGRADABLE MOVES: In this game, you can upgrade your combat moves as well as your character's parameter by defeating enemies and collecting experience points. I particularly dig this, as I love the games that add RPG elements to it. Having upgradable character truly pushes you to go an extra mile to explore more and thus unlock more. Like it when developers add something like that.ABSOLVE OR PUNISH: I usually like choices in the game. While this game is no Bioshock or Mass Effect in terms of choices, you can at least whether you want to absolve or punish enemies. Doing either will eliminate your foe in unique manner, but more importantly allow you to upgrade unique set of moves depending on what choices you have made. Again another interesting addition.PLENTY OF INTERESTING DOCUMENTS: Other than new moves, there are plenty of other material that you can unlock in this game. For example, talking to a character you encounter very often will unlock different artifacts that gives you power. In addition, different souls you encounter in hell have their own story. Once you find them you can also read through all of it in form of document. So for those who are interested, this is definitely a plus.FREE DLC IF YOU OWN PS3 COPY: If you buy this game for PS3, you get \"Dark Forest\" free single player DLC. It is a prequel to Dante's Inferno story. Compare to game, it is not that great, but hey, it's free :)**************CONS.*****************DUMBED DOWN BOSS BATTLES: While certain boss battles are great, others just seem plain stupid. Imagine you are just fighting a bigger version of enemy and you are simply defeating it by plain button mashing. And honestly compare to its competition (God of War, Devil May Cry, Bayonetta), the boss battles simply suck in this game (with exception of final battle).FAULTY MECHANICS FOR PLATFORMING: There are certain areas where you will die even if you think you are jumping/grabbing correctly because of inherent imperfections of platforming designs or mechanics. The worst part is when you die, you lose everything you collected as these faulty designs/mechanics come not so long after few check points. Because this, you will find yourself going out of your way to absolve/punish same souls/finding treasure chests over and over again until you get everything right.**************CONCLUSION*****************So no, the game is not perfect, but it is not broken beyond hope either. It is definitely worth at least one playthrough simply because of it s gorgeous art and wonderful depiction of seven circles of hell. If you like action/adventure and heck&slash;, certainly do give this one a try. I will give 8.5/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2011"}

Utilizing the charging terminals at the bottom of the motion controller and the navigation controller, the Charging Station allows for  incredibly easy charging of both the controllers. It plugs directly into the wall, leaving the USB ports on your PS3 open and your entertainment center tangle-free.","reviewerName":"D. A. Theisen","summary":"First-Party, energy-friendly, hard to fault","reviewText":"The item pretty must as-is described! Appearance doesn't quite give the exact feeling as-shown on the box (the image of it standing alone is far better), but the presentation is as it should be-- matches and fits in with the overall piano black styling of the PS3, other accessories, and many Sony home theater products in general.First time I saw the product (stepping in fairly blind to the Move in general) it felt a little awkward, but I've come to love its power connectivity via a standard wall outlet instead of tagging along into the PS3's USB ports. Depending on PS3 model, number and position might change, but I'd wager the vast majority of players have their ports used and/or already have USB expansion hubs to try to get everything connected and charging at once. Best of all? With the charge being longer than the Dualshock 3 controller, this will happily juice up your power-munching Move's rechargeable battery with the PS3 turned off, which means less electricity used and less wear on the console.I've grown quite accustomed to first-party Sony accessories over the years, and this has the same pitfall... the price. It might be much for some people, or they might consider getting a larger charging station, but kind of like the price-gouging Sony official cables set, it can be worth the extra ~$10 for the piece of mind. Fortunately, sales seem common and prices drop over time.You'll surely want to use a power station if going with anything more than the sole standard controller, and especially with that Playstation Eye for the Move already crowding your wiring setup behind your TV as have more and more to plug in, it really is a great excuse to keep a more neat/tidy appearance and again, save your USB ports some work. Remember to set up the power savings settings from the XMB, everyone!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"Steven Rinck","summary":"Less fun than a sharp stick in the eye","reviewText":"Arguments have raged for decades about which Final Fantasy game is the best in the series.  Square must have been tired of this debate, because they put in what must have been an extraordinary effort to create the very worst game in the series, and a serious contender for the very worst video game of all time.  Truly, my command of the English language is simply not up to the task of conveying how awful an atrocity this game is.It's not merely slapped together.  It is clear that considerable time and talent was harnessed to shape this foul turd.  It manages to distill the very essence of terrible from every JRPG trope, while simultaneously eliminating every positive aspect and charm that is normally implicit in the genre.The irony is that FF games started out as &#34;the&#34; open-world free roaming game.  They are now as linear as it gets, with only rail shooters giving you less freedom.  This game furthers that sad trend.This game gives the illusion of freedom in how you build characters.  Unfortunately, it's only the freedom to choose wrong.  It would have been better if they just gave you rigid classes so you knew what they wanted.The grind on this game is ridiculous.  FF games have always had a grind in them but it's usually something extra, to get ridiculously powerful and two-shot the end boss or something.  Here, it's a necessary part of gameplay...unless perhaps you know the exact arbitrary build required in order to get through everything in the game ahead of time.Plot - Having a contrived and overly complicated plot is standard for these types of games, but at least you usually end up caring or having sympathy for the protagonist or their world.  Here: I didn't care.  All of the protagonists were so whiny, and the supporting characters so dumb I couldn't find myself caring about anyone or anything in this game.CharactersOk: It's a JRPG, so it's a given that you're going to have a group of annoying 2-dimensional characters with some overly overly pronounced character trait spelled out in 20-story neon lights that will go through horribly contrived and artificial character development steps* (if they even do develop) to become...slightly less annoying 2-dimensional characters.  They've managed to actually make this character development step* into a game mechanic in this game; Final Fantasy's usual 50-lb sledge of subtlety has been upgraded to a 500-lb sledge of subtlety.  Note, I have to say *step, because an arc would imply something smooth and potentially organic.Unlike most JRPGs, the characters are entirely devoid of any form of charm or charisma.  There's not even a single likable character in the bunch.  This is the only final fantasy game since the characters have had personalities (FF4?) where I loath each and every single character.Gameplay - The illusion of choiceThe battle system seems like an interesting idea and, credit where credit is due, I'm glad they do try to innovate the approach to combat.  The downside, is this one's junk.  You only have direct control over one character, and even then you're usually too busy juggling paradigms to assign their moves directly.  Therefore most of what your character does is auto-pilot, and everything your allies do is auto-pilot.  Allies are supposed to gang up on the enemy you are currently attacking, but it frequently bugs out so they start attacking a different enemy, or will even sit there the entire battle without using a single ability.So, the one thing you do have fine control over is the &#34;paradigm&#34;, basically a set of pre-made (you can organize) ability roles for the party.  You can choose which roles to have which party members specialize in, and form a group to your liking.  Sounds neat...But it's too good to be true.  If you don't level your characters up just right in a very specific way, you'll end up having to do several hours of grinding.  At too many points in the game, you'll end up fighting some boss with a pre-determined set of characters, requiring a set of roles that you may or may not have upgraded for them.  What's that, you were using that character as a commando?  Well, guess what, we're going to toss you into the battle where they are absolutely required to be a sentinel.  What's that?  you've been using that character as a ravager?  Well, the one ability at the end of the enhancer path is a requirement for this battle...looks like you're going to have to go grind for 6 hours and unlock that ability if you want to progress.If you've managed to avoid this piece of trash, then kudos to you.  I recommend you continue to avoid it.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2014"}

Six feet sounds like it would be long enough, but if you're buying this with the intention of plugging in your PS3 remote to charge it while still using it to play a game, you'll find it's a bit too short. When using this cord while the PS3 is hooked up to my smaller 32 inch TC it's not so bad, since it's a smaller TV to sit nearer to. But when using this cable while my PS3 is hooked up to our larger 42 inch TV, I end up sitting far too close to the large screen to view it comfortably. So if you're using this to charge with a PS3 hooked up to a smaller TV, or just for charging alone (not to use for charging and playing at the same time), it works fine. But if you're trying to use the controller and the TV is large, you'll find you'll have to sit too close to the screen and it makes it hard to view.

{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S.

The missions are dull with hardly any decent action.  The one quest that stands out in my mind the most is one where you have to find Mr. Yakamoto.  You are given no idea as to where he lives and go door to door trying to find him.  It always happens that his house is the last you look at.  Another problem is the fact that many of the quests are given to you at one time and you have to wait 24 hours before you can actually do them.  There is no way to make time go forward so about 35 of the 40 hours needed to complete this game will be on waiting around for the place you need to go to open.This game is very disappointing and if you are somewhat interested in it, borrow it from a friend.

It has that fast-paced (but non-realistic looking) Call of Duty quickness and the same \"everything's bright everywhere\" Call of Duty look with no HDR lighting.cons:- not many checkpoints, no autosave- the world looks like it might be big, but it's actually very very tiny. there are really only 2 cities, and although they feel very detailed, they aren't very big at all.- they're not many missions, not many side missions, many amount to simple fetch quests- repetitive monotonous vehicle combat actions- disc-swapping issue (may get patched) - kicks you out to the dashboard- vehicle camera is horrible, don't use it- some vehicle races (rally) seem difficult, random to win- enemy AI is somewhat varied (maybe), but each group seems to act/look and especially speak the same. they all have the same voice actors. hearing 100 enemies in a row speaking the same Russian dialog is weird- story is non-existent. there's almost no setup, just a 5-second cinematic, you're thrown into the world, it's only a detailed world to look at, nothing else. the main enemy (the Authority) is so generic. Why are they there? What do they want? What's their motivation? Just some mumbling about a \"general\" who you never see, never fight.- besides not having a story, the characters don't have much personality, no back stories, you meet only a couple of main regulars a few times, then you're done with them, never follow up with them, they're just gone- clipping issues- texture loading issues. very very odd, given the legacy of id.- whens the last time you played an FPS where you couldn't pick up a downed enemy's weapon? 10 years ago?- Short. for as long as this game was in the incubator, you'd think it'd be longer- idTech is an awesome engine for textures and framerates, but it doesn't seem to do much else. there's no/not much destructibility, not much ability to interact with the world, pick up objects and use them etc...- horrible, horrible, horrible non-existent ending. no boss battle, no final run. nothing. you fight a few of the same exact enemies you just fought 10 minutes ago, no different, no strategy necessary to employ. press a button, a short cut scene, game over. They gave me a specific kick-butt weapon to use for what I thought would be a big boss, but nope, no boss, never even used the weapon once. didn't need to. feels unfinished. like something got cut at the end either to sell as DLC or just simply cut.- i assumed comparisons to Borderlands and Fallout3 would be unfair early on, but they're totally fair. they game has a vault-boy-type story (they just call them Arks instead of vaults) like Fallout3, except 1% as fleshed-out as that world. the world itself is rocky and barren and you drive from place-to-place like Borderlands (the \"Vault\" coincidentally being the thing you're looking for in Borderlands)....Very interesting world to look at, it's too bad there isn't something more interesting going on inside it.3.5/5","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2011"}

You essentially have 7 levels before the boss level, and you have to beat each of these levels with 5 different characters. So, you have to spend your time getting all of DK's bananas and missing the other 4 characters' bananas, because only Diddy can get Diddy bananas, only Tiny can get Tiny coins, etc. This means you have to basically go back and re-do the whole level with another character all over again.Couple this with the fact that camera angles are constantly changing on you, it makes for a very ho-hum experience.At one point during the 30 hours it took me to beat this game, I turned on the game and found all my data was erased. At first I was angry, but then kind of relieved that I didn't have to feel like I needed to finish this game anymore. That's saying a lot, because I always finish games I start.

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"One of the greatest","reviewText":"A fantastic game that STILL continues it's legendary glory, you will not regret it when you buy this masterpiece!

{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"ooocarl06","summary":"a great innovation in its time","reviewText":"The first ratchet &amp; clank really helped PS2 in the sense of platforming, and just good old fashioned destruction.

I know I'm a little late to the game here (by a couple years!), but ever since Professor Layton hit the scene I've wanted to play this game to see what all the buzz was about.  So now I finally got my hands on a copy of the original \"Professor Layton and the Curious Village\".  I already know a bit about this game from personal research.  For instance, I know that this game is an interesting hybrid of the puzzle and adventure game genres, and I know there will be loads of brain teasers in it.  So, let's move onto the individual section breakdowns!Graphics (score 8/10): The art style in this game is very cartoony - everyone looks like a caricature with big heads or big noses, etc.  It looks fine and I actually find it enjoyably humorous and whimsical.  There are also some animated full-motion cutscenes which also look great.  There is really only one thing that bugs me.  I know this is going to sound crazy - but it's the Professor's eyes.  He's the only one who has beady black dots for eyes with no whites to them.  Everyone else in this game that I've come across has normal eyes with a white part and the iris/pupil in the middle.  Professor Layton is the only one with souless black shark eyes and it freaks me out.  If everyone in the game had the same style of eyes I could say it was a stylistic choice and it would be fine, but he's the only one!  Why?!  Well, anyway, I can't say that this ever really stopped bugging me, but the Professor's wonderful personality eventually won me over.  Sorry Professor...Music (score 8/10): There is some really lovely music in this game, although maybe not enough variety of it.  You almost don't notice the lack of variety though because of how nice the music is.  Honestly, I loved it!  There is also voice acting during the cutscenes.  The voice acting itself is quite good, but the sound quality sounds a bit strange.  I don't quite know how to describe it - all I can think to say is that it sounds sort of tinny and distant while still being loud.  I don't know how else to describe it.  I got used to it after awhile, but it just sounds different than every other voiced game on DS I've ever played.  The music doesn't have this weird sound quality to it, so I really don't know.  Overall, though, music is very good, so I can't complain overmuch.Characters (score 8/10): Well, despite his freaky beady little eyes, Professor Layton has won me over.  He just embodies every stereotype of a proper British gentleman you could ever want and I've just found him too irresistibly charming not to like.  Luke, his young boy assistant (no pedo jokes please) is also a likable character.  The great thing about Luke is that he's a child character who's not annoying.  He's energetic and vibrant, while still being a bit shorter tempered than the professor.  As main characters go, they have a good working dynamic.  As for the secondary characters, the town of St. Mystere is populated by many colorful townsfolk whom you will interact with.  I found them all likable too, although they are a bit freakishly puzzle-obsessed...  The only thing that bugged me was the introduction of Professor Layton's \"rival\".  They never explain his backstory.  It's almost like this game was a sequel to a previous story - except that it isn't.  Maybe this is explained better in a sequel.  As it is, though, this character just feels undeveloped.Story (score 8/10): Well, the story starts out with Professor Layton and Luke heading out to the town of St. Mystere in the middle of nowhere to help with an eccentric old Baron's request in his will.  Basically, he said that he'd give his inheritance to whomever finds a certain item.  This is the setup for the rest of the game.  Of course, as you go along, more mysteries pop up to be solved.  I don't want to give anything away, but the story is quite good.  I only wish that Professor Layton's rival was better explained (as I mentioned in the \"Character\" section).  That's all I'm going to say on that.  I do want to talk about the premise for puzzle solving though.  It is established that the town is full of puzzle-obsessed people, but it still felt really awkward stopping my investigation every five seconds because some townsperson just happened to have a new puzzle.  Having so many puzzles that are unrelated to the story bogs the story development down.  It's like the story is flowing along nicely and then bam - you run into another random puzzle like a brick wall.  I know that was sort of the only way for them to get so many puzzles into the game, and that puzzles are the point of this hybrid game, but it still bugged me a bit.  Anyway, more on that in the gameplay section.Gameplay (score 7/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Let's talk about the types of gamers who would potentially be interested in picking up this game.  There are fans of puzzle games who might be interested, and then there are your adventure game enthusiasts who might be drawn to this game.  I fall into the latter category.  I love adventure games but do not care for pure puzzle games.  While I do enjoy the logic and problem solving, it's the story that really pulls me in.  Puzzle game fans are probably accustomed to playing games like Brain Age or Puzzle Quest where you do nothing but solve various brain-teaser or math puzzles without any real story to really tie them together.  Being a fan of adventure games though, I revel in a good story, and I also prefer the \"puzzles\" to make sense in the context of the story.  That is to say, I prefer puzzles that are \"environmental\" in nature.  For example, the puzzles have to be related to a problem in the protagonist's environment.  For example, consider the difference between a problem like needing to pick the lock on a door because your protagonist needs to get into that room.  You might wander around, find a wire cutter, a coat hanger, and a hammer and use these items to make a lock-picking device.  That's an environmental puzzle.  Consider a second example, where you're in a freaky mansion and in order to open a door, you must gather the numbers for a combination lock and the clues are hidden in paintings around the mansion.  Once again, this still qualifies as an environmental puzzle.  Professor Layton does not have much of that at all.  The gameplay is such that you are trying to solve a mystery/problem, and then in order to get any information out of anyone, they force you to solve riddles/brain teasers that are completely unrelated to the task at hand and then they give you their info.  Although I got to a point where I enjoyed the puzzles, I must say that this still bugs me a bit.  I just would've much preferred more practical puzzles to solve.  For example, there's a scene at the end of the game where Professor Layton must build a hang-glider.  He just does this in a cutscene; it would've been nice to actually build that myself using items in the room (like an adventure game!).  However, if it were set up that way, it'd be more of an adventure game, and this is a hybrid.  So, does it satisfy pure puzzle game lovers?  Well, there are tons of puzzles of that sort - mostly consisting of a good variety of logic/semantic riddles, math riddles, spatial problems, and a variety of \"Get from Point A to Point B on a map without doing X\" puzzles.  All very well and good, but whether puzzle game lovers will enjoy this game really depends on how much they also like stories attached to their games.  If you prefer to just pick up and play some random puzzles then you might be annoyed by all the story in this game.  However, if you are already a fan of both puzzle games and adventure games, then you might be in heaven with this one.  As for the non-puzzle gameplay, it's your familiar point and click interface that is common to adventure games.  All the controls work fine and I haven't had any problems with movement or anything.  There's also a lot of moving between locations and talking to people, which is also common to adventure games.  Nothing really remarkable to comment on here.Overall (score 8/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  Well, I still enjoyed myself with this game even if I wasn't incredibly keen on the puzzle types.  I guess you'll have to decide for yourself whether or not you'd like this game; if you are not already a fan of either puzzle games or adventure games then this game isn't going to change your mind.  One more thing of note is that this is a short game (I finished in a couple days) so you may not want to pay full price.  All things considered, I enjoyed my time with the good Professor enough that I'm looking forward to playing the sequels.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2011"}

If you are still deciding whether to get this or not, I say go for it.  While GTA: LCS is not the \"killer app\" that GTA 3 was for the PS2, it's nonetheless tons of fun and endless excitment, coupled with lots of handheld violence and one-person mayhem.There's no doubt that this is simply the best PSP game so far, and it takes full advantage of the PSP's processing and graphic powers.  The graphics is fantastic on the PSP, and the framerate for the most part excellent.  A couple times you'll notice some choppiness, but otherwise it's just like on the good ol' PS2.  The controls are mostly good, except this game inherits the maddening aiming scheme from GTA 3, so when you are in the middle of a Godfather-like shootout, you'll wish for better aiming controls.  But that's just a minor complaint.What stopped me from rating this 5 stars -- my inclination is to give it an overall rating of 4.5 stars (90%) -- is the level design is just too similar to GTA 3.  You are back in Liberty City, with pretty much the same layouts.  Neighborhood names have changed, but otherwise the environment and the characters look (and sound) exactly the same.  The gameplay is also pretty much the same, which is great but at the same time a little, shall we say, hackneyed.Still, this is a must-have title for any PSP gamers.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2005"}

Honestly, the beauty of one the tomb challenges (its inside a cathedral) made it my favorite part of the game.Also, one part that I really loved was the absolute beauty of the cities in the game.

THIS YEAR!!!","reviewText":"Absolutely love this title thusfar!  This is one of the few games that I've played in recent months where I actually lost track of time and was playing a lot longer than it seemed.  The world in this game is massive.  You get the feeling that you could wander around forever in it.  Fantastic!!!  The graphics are pretty good, but I wish Bethesda had used DirectX 11 instead of DirectX 9.  (Not a big complaint, but I was really hoping for something that would make my Radeon 6950 earn it's keep.)  I do like the dual-wielding possibility in this game.  The ability to use two weapons, two shields, two spells, etc. makes for varied gameplay which most games seem to miss.  I do like how you keep getting skill point bonuses for only the abilities that you use in-game.  I don't particularly enjoy getting skill points which sometimes get thrown into a skill that I normally don't use like in some other titles.  The cut scenes during combat are an added plus for me.  I was battling a mage last night and he killed me.  Before respawn, I got a good look at my character lying on the floor with a glowing ice spike sticking all the way through her chest and the tip sticking out of her back.  Vicious!!!  The cut scenes during combat with the various creatures is especially gritty when using two-handed weapons.  My favorite thusfar has been using a large warhammer.  Nothing like watching the undead get their knees blown out just before the finishing blow is applied!  Give this title a serious look.  If you're even remotely interested in the RPG titles, this one is a winner!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2011"}

But I've got systemic lupus and an eight-year-old.  For me, the motion-sensitive wii games are not just luxuries or things I plug my kid into to get a break.  There are a lot of days when, because of a lupus flare-up, I can't go outside with my kid.I could just plug him into a game - or the tv - or send him on a playdate, but, with the wii, I can clear the room and play inside with him in a way that lets us both get at least a little bit of exercise.I didn't think this little gadget would make any difference, but it really did help in the wii sports games.  We're both more engaged in the process, now that gameplay is more sensitive, and, maybe it's psychological, but the games feel more real to me.Also, some of the games in which wiimote action used to feel sluggish or imprecise (such as boxing or the cake decorating mini-game in mario party) are much more satisfying.I could have lived without spending the money, but my wii is my lifesaver on some days.

I haven't played the previous version, but I have played Lego Rock Band, Guitar Hero III, GHWT, and GH5. I have a nice guitar controller and a really expensive drum set that I almost never use. So I come into this with at least a bit of knowledge of these games in general, even if I don't have any at all as it relates to the previous game. And with that knowledge I can say that this is a pretty darn fun game!You're probably well-aware of how the game works: you put together a band and go on tour, playing various venues, nifty songs, lots of different set lists and buying all the virtual crap you can get your hands on! It's very similar to what I experienced with Lego Rock Band, which is no surprise.The graphics in the game are good, but really they take second place to the music. I must say that I do rather like the set list here. I like it more than GH3 or GH5, and it's much better than Lego Rock Band (though for ten bucks you can import the set list from LRB to this game). You also get a voucher to download 20 bonus tracks. I wouldn't bother with them.The DLC here is quite good. Anything I've downloaded for LRB plays with Rock Band 2, which is good. I haven't tried the online play (I usually don't like 360 online experiences), so I cannot comment on that. The solo game play is wonderfully fun, though a bit easier overall than the GH games. It plays pretty much the same (notes scroll down, you hit them). I played with a friend of mine and unlike GH5 you can't both play the same instrument. It's a minor complaint, though.One bit of advice to would-be rockers looking to play this game: don't create a character to play that you find attractive. I made this mistake.

We are musicians and have a sense for how musical systems should work. We spent the months to fully evaluate Rock Band 2 against Guitar Hero 3 and to see how both held up for long term play. We also played both games both with other experience and novice players.Despite my appreciation for Guitar Hero, I find Rock Band 2 to be head and shoulders better for many reasons. First, simply in terms of playability, it is much easier both for newcomers to pick up and for experienced gamers to easily use. New players who have trouble can be \"saved\" by their bandmates and the song can keep going. When you're all experienced and playing on harder levels, the wonderful screen layout means you can easily keep an eye on how the group is doing and help each other out.I enjoy the way you progress through the different cities, unlocking physical gig locations, mixing up new songs, gaining helpers and items.The character customization, of course, is awesome. I like the detail I can put on my avatar and smile every time I launch back into the game and bring her up.The song list is great and I really enjoy that the songs I previously purchased for Rock Band 1 are right there, playable and waiting for me.I love how the band bus in the background goes by with my name on its side, the tiny details in all of the gig locations, the way the characters interact with each other.It all comes down to great gameplay, though. The game is simply SO much fun to play. I'll go back and forth between this and our other games, and while Guitar Hero can get frustrating, Rock Band 2 is always a joy. I'll play long past when my fingers are sore. It's that addictive.I really don't have any complaints at all about this game. As long as I can keep downloading new songs, and buy the solid drum kit so that I have the best drum experience I can with it, I am completely happy.Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2009"}
{"product_name":"B002I0F5M8","description":"","reviewerName":"Dr. D","summary":"Arkham Mayhem","reviewText":"Batman: Arkham City (AC) is a worthy sequel to its predecessor, Arkham Asylum.  In this game, you explore a city rather than a prison colony, and the controls are exactly the same.  The FreeFlow combat system is also similar, with the inclusion of new gadgets and double counters.As far as the storyline goes, I found Arkham Asylum's story to be better on the whole.  In AC, I did not like Hugo Strange's role in the plot, as well as his collaboration with Ra's al-Ghul.  Joker is the main villain once again, and that's definitely not a bad thing.  I just felt that all the other villains detracted from the focus on Joker (disconnected plot lines were apparent).Speaking of the villains, I'm glad that the designers decided to incorporate plenty of new bad guys in this game; however, I felt that a few of them weren't designed like they should be.  For example, the Penguin has this weird, cockneyed English accent when he really should be speaking with a nasal bird-like sound.  Also, his hands were not webbed at all.  For Mr. Freeze, he never spoke in a Germanic accent at all, although his robotic suit voice was pretty cool.The Riddler was also never seen as a physical entity in the game, other than in projection form.  Supposedly, he appears in the flesh at the very end of a side mission when you collect all 400 (yes, FOUR HUNDRED) riddler achievements.  That's not good enough for me, though.  No way did I go around collecting all the riddler trophies and solving all the riddles.Speaking of collectibles, there's a TON of stuff to find in this game, and I certainly didn't bother with collecting everything.  All I did was beat Batman and Catwoman's main storyline and called it a day.  All the other Riddler trophies, Riddler's Revenge, and side missions I found to be extraneous.  The other DLC (Robin & Nightwing) are completely useless and a waste of money, unless you're a trophy collector.When you beat the main storyline, that's enough to have beaten the game entirely (in my opinion).  When I beat 100% of the main storyline, my total progress was only 36% (according to the game).  According to me, I was at 100%.  My other statistics at time of completion included:  16% side missions, 25% upgrades & collectibles, 13% Catwoman's collectibles, and no Riddler Challenges.  I didn't even bother with New Game + mode either.  In fact, playing the whole game on Normal difficulty was extremely hard.  The fights are very tough on that mode!The Catwoman DLC package wasn't bad either.  Her main storyline revolved around her stolen goods with Two-Face.  As far as she is concerned, she wears these pinkish sunglasses on the top of her head, and I wished that she'd actually wear them on her face while you were playing.  You only see her put them on for 2 seconds at the very end of the game.  Such a cheap blow...  Also, her detective radar mode was very poorly designed.  You can't tell who's armed and who's not, which led to plenty of needless deaths.Speaking of deaths, a major character dies at the end of the game.  If said character is indeed dead, how are they going to make another Batman game?  They'll have to either bring the character back, or never make another Batman game again.  And IF they do make another one, I hope it doesn't fall under the Call of Duty syndrome (i.e. same old story again).Overall, I give Batman: Arkham City four stars (really 3.5, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt).  It's a 2011 Game of the Year nominee, but it never reached that iconic status this time around.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2012"}

The graphics are very good. The main character's skill profession training is interesting. He is mainly a swordsman, but he can throw daggers or bombs, uses toxic potions which he creates, can augment combat with select magic, (although he isn't and shouldn't be considered a mage,) and even set traps. Combat is both fun and challenging.The story is well told and captivating. Decisions you make slightly alter the story and impact the quests available to you. There is an easy crafting system and item upgrades are fun and frequent. Minor mutations can even be added to help. Some monsters drop trophies, and you can equip one for added benefits.I like the combat system. You may use a light or heavy attack. Blocking and dodging, as well as magic, bombs and traps, keeps battles fluid. Some opponents are better to attack with a light or heavy attack. Some battles make you really think about how to win.The Witcher 2 is not overly long to play, but it is not short, either. I really enjoyed this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2013"}

It's one game I can think of that can hold 4 sequels under it's belt and still not stink. From the moment you pop in this game into your cube, you'll love it. Me and my friend Bob were the first two to test it, and we found ourselves loving it from begining to end. Single Player wise, you might not be enthralled...so purchase/rent this game only if you have friends! I reccomend the first board you try is the future board, because it extremely helps you improve on your strategy. Another great thing is, with each combonation of characters you get on your team, you get a catchy team name. For example, Mario and Luigi together are the Super Mario Bros, and Boo and Yoshi together are Team Scary Dino. How cool is that? All of the new minigames will have you beggin for more, and you can unlcock them to play anytime you want. If you own a gamecube, you need to get this, and Mario Party 4.

For example, pushing up on your controller makes you sidestep your opponent&#x92;s attacks, yet also allows you to jump in the air by tapping up plus a direction. A revamped fighting system offers up three different styles for each fighter (one includes a weapon technique). The multiple styles provide countless varieties of attacks for any given fighter. Different combinations of punches and kicks can be combined for very lengthy and powerful chain attacks similar to those in theMortal Kombatof old. Fatalities are also back and rich in graphic representation.New fighters join the cast of old favorites such as Sonya, Kano, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Kung Lao, Kitana, Quan Chi, Reptile, and Shang Tsung. The lavish environments surround your fighters with animated backgrounds and rich skylines. On some levels there are even breakable objects and hazards that you can interact with, such as pools of acid--the perfect landing place for a thrown opponent.In addition to regular modes of gameplay (arcade, versus, etc.), there is an option called Konquest mode. This mode allows you to learn more about fighting styles, read up on each character&#x92;s personal history, and gain Koins. The koins can then be spent in the Krypt, allowing you to unlock a host of new characters, costumes, and early concept drawings. The plentiful additional content offered with this title includes special movies ofThe Making ofDeadly Alliance andThe History ofMortal Kombat.Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliancesuccessfully reinvents the series by offering up a unique mix of improved graphics and stylized gameplay without compromising any of the features that made theMKseries popular over the years.--Carlos RodelaProsComplex gameplayRealistic 3-D graphicsHundreds of unlockable featuresConsWeak storylineUnbalanced combo system","reviewerName":"C.

I've mainly played the Portal game, but it also includes Half-Life 2 and Team Fortress. Just for Portal alone, it is worth it. Albeit it may be a short game for some.As far as gameplay goes, Half-Life 2 is probably better on the PC. I don't really like First Person Shooters on the PS3 or PS2 (and there are far too many). Using the controllers are more difficult and inferior to the keyboard and mouse, which is ideal. Portal is also similar to a FPS, but you don't need good reaction time and precise aiming to kill enemies and you don't have a life bar, it is more of a thinking game. I had no trouble using the PS3 controller for it.If you have a fast enough and capable PC and don't mind the online Steam installation, I would definitely buy the Orange Box for the PC even if it were a little more expensive, Half-Life 2 would actually be fun on that. Half-Life the first one, was one of my favorite FPS to play alone in single player.

Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"Final Fantasy takes a spin on the DS","reviewText":"Ok, so if you are any kind of an RPG fan you've played Final Fantasy at some point.  And up until now, you had no options on the DS unless you picked up the ones for the Game Boy Advance.Square Enix decided to bring FFIII (you may know this from the SNES but that is called FFVI here in the US), which was never released on any system previously, as the first DS entry.  So how does it fair?  Let's take a look:Presentation:  8/10The game is fairly straightforward but can get downright frustrating at times (forget to talk to 1 person, your forward progress will be stopped in its tracks).  The menus are user friendly and the additional perks you can use through multiple DS's via the mail system definitely helps this game's cause.Graphics:  8/10Make no mistake, this game looks great on the DS, probably one of the best ones.  The cinema's are quite amazing for a small system.  Lots of detail in the towns and dungeons.  Especially creepy (at first) is when you cross into the dark world with your airship the first time.  Square (as with most FF's) has done a great job with the look of the game.Sound:  8.5/10Not as great a score as came with, say, FFVII, but when I have tunes from the game stuck in my head it means either I played it too much or they were really good.  Keep in mind the DS speakers don't do any sound justice so if you have a great pair of headphones that will definitely help the experience out.Gameplay:  9.5/10Now this is where this game kicks some serious butt.  The Job system in FFIII is awesome.  Want 4 black mages?  You got it.  4 warriors?  Ditto.  You get the selection of the original FF but the ability to have several different jobs leveled up on the 4 main characters.  This adds pretty much an endless amount of ways to complete the main quest.Now, why doesn't this get a 10 out of 10?  Well let's put it this way:  If you are used to be coddled in other FF's (FF II for the SNES comes to mind) you are going to be in for a shock in this one. Go off on your own early on (even later on) and prepare for a quick Game Over.  I saw more game overs in the first 2 hours I played this FF as I did in all of FFVII and FFIX put together.  To put it mildly:  You better level up or get smoked.  Often.Replay Value:  6/10 (9/10 if your friends have game/DS)Hardcore FF's and RPG'ers will want to try many different job combinations and Low Level games to see how many different ways you can win.  But for most 1 time through will be enough.  The mail system will allow you to open weapons, spells, etc. that are not available to a single player/game and offers a better incentive then most games like this.Overall:  8.5/10This is definitely one of the best RPG's you have for the DS.  Rumor has it that they are doing at FFVI remake (FFIII for you SNES types) that will be on the DS.  If that is the case you might just see that become the best one as it is rumored to have extras on it not available with the GBA or the SNES.If you are FF fan, this is a must play.

{"product_name":"B00BRQN2EM","description":"","reviewerName":"postman","summary":"If you liked 3 then you probably will like this one","reviewText":"I was reluctant to buy this game at first. I saw gameplay videos of it online and it looked to be EXACTLY like Saints 3. Considering I didn't have any new games I wanted to play I decided to go ahead and spend the 60 bucks this game costs. I thought I made a mistake in doing that. NOPE! I love this game.It is just like Saints 3. I'm not gonna lie. If you complained about Saints 3 and hated that one you will hate this one as well. This game takes place in steelport just like 3 and is the exact same size, the graphics are pretty much the same, all of the car customizing, gun, and clothing shops are still in pretty much the exact same locations, hell, I even seem some of the pedestrians from the last saints game in this one too lol.But what makes this game a tad different is that now you have super powers. I know, not a good enough reason to spend $60, yes, but it does add a little bit of difference to this game. The game takes place in a simulated version of steelport and your super powers can only be used there. There are a LOT more things to do in this game though so that adds to the fun factor. There is never a dull moment in this game if you enjoy it.The story line is pretty good but since this game takes place inside a computer program, if you don't know much about computers the story line may be a bit confusing. As stated the graphics are the same and so are the controls. You can now listen to the in-game music without the need of a car. There do seems to be a few new cars in this game that wasn't in the last one but other than that its all the same. Also the game does have a few bugs that needs to be addressed like sometimes certain missions won't start or my character will freeze in a certain position yet I can still move him around or the game will just freeze completely and I have to reset my 360. Just make sure you save a lot so you don't have to back track so far.I honestly don't want to say you should spend $60 on a game that is basically like Saints 3, wait til the holidays or whenever the price drops to about $40 or less, but there are some surprises in this game though that I actually liked so if you want to spend the 60, go ahead. I don't feel as though I wasted my $60 so I am happy with it. I never played Saints Row 1 or 2 so I can't say how much better or worse those are. But if you liked 3, then you will probably like this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00CRL9TU2","description":"","reviewerName":"Sreenadh","summary":"Go out and buy it","reviewText":"You see that game on your shelf called Gran Turismo 5? Pick it up. Now drop it in the nearest bin and forget it ever happened. Gran Turismo 6 delivers the racer we always knew the PS3 and Polyphony were capable of. In fact, it&#8217;s so good that even its minor annoyances can&#8217;t hold it back from negating the generational divide and snatching back its title of &#8216;best console racing sim&#8217;, next-gen be damned.Even on hardware from 2006, GT6 manages native 1080p, 60fps (except for replays and particularly busy moments), and grids full of immaculately-modelled, licensed cars. And it tops all of this off with day/night transitions and wet-weather racing. It&#8217;s the full package straight out of the box, making its next-gen competition (*cough* Forza 5) look like a demo. For lens flare effects. Yes, I just went there.The very first thing you notice when you take control of the initial race around Brands Hatch is the responsiveness of the steering. It&#8217;s all about realism, weight transferral, and inertia, yet there&#8217;s enough grip there to swerve around a slower AI car without having to cancel things in your diary to accommodate the manoeuvre. I cannot emphasise enough, driving a car in GT6 feels like no other racing game on the market, and I love it.Obviously the first thing you&#8217;ll want to do is turn off all the assists, which include the obligatory dynamic racing line, traction control, ABS, and what have you. The game doesn&#8217;t need them and neither do you. Why? Because the cars are so controllable in their natural state, so perfectly balanced between realism and accessibility, pinpoint driving is possible even with a DualShock 3.But while playing with the pad is perfectly enjoyable, purists will prefer a steering wheel. With a racing seat and Logitech Driving Force GT force feedback set, the experience is more realistic, but also far more physical, as you need to steer wildly just to catch an oversteer moment on full-lock. The force feedback is strong and solid-feeling, which couples with the game&#8217;s ultra-smooth movement to create a flowing sense of motion that you&#8217;ll want to savour.However, get a corner wrong with either controller and the resulting physics are pretty special. In some cars, the sudden lack of grip on the grass means a dinner trolley slide into the barriers. Conversely, in a 4WD Mitsubishi Lancer Evo, it means a few seconds of rally driving as you try to keep it under control and wrestle the car back onto the circuit. Both simulations are exemplary.Unlike many modern racers, there&#8217;s no rewind button. But that&#8217;s the cheat&#8217;s way out anyway. As a trade-off, impacts won&#8217;t end your race as thumping your car into the wall won&#8217;t affect your handling like it does in Forza or GRID. Damage is limited to a few scuff textures instead of a gearbox full of 3rd gears. You&#8217;re basically indestructible, which is one area the GT series still comes up short.That aside, Polyphony has clearly learned a stack of lessons from its GT5-shaped misstep. For starters, every track now looks worthy of its HD resolution. Foliage is more naturalistic (softened by a touch of bloom lighting), and the lighting effects add considerable atmosphere to even the most basic races. The game also looks demonstrably better in 1080p compared to 720p because the pixel meshes used for distant foliage are less noticeable. There are a few jagged lines that betray the game&#8217;s now last-gen tech, but it could feasibly pass for a PS4 game if you didn&#8217;t know better.All of this would be nought if the progression system was still completely broken, but that aspect of the game has received a major overhaul. For starters, the menus have been simplified, offering logical shortcuts like showing you which cars in your garage are available for the current event, or offering you &#8216;coffee break&#8217; events if you fancy something light-hearted to break up the tiered events of the main career. It&#8217;s almost as if it&#8217;s been designed with the player in mind and not just the enjoyment of Kazunori Yamauchi.Unfortunately, it&#8217;s still possible to enter an event with a faster car and win more easily, but nothing like the &#8216;miles in front by turn 1&#8217; madness of GT5. It does so through the new &#8216;PP&#8217; number, which ranks each machine&#8217;s power. Most events have a PP limit, so if your PP is too big, you&#8217;re not allowed to race (stop sniggering at the back). It&#8217;s not a perfect solution, but it&#8217;s much, much better.However, the AI is not better at all. The AI drivers do kick up some dirt as they venture off-line and there is a modicum of defensive driving exhibited by the leaders, but they&#8217;re still faceless and robotic. The oddest problem with their behaviour is the way one or two often dash off at the start into a 12-second lead then appear to wait for you to catch up on the last lap. You can see them taking corners at a crawl on the track map. Madness. The AI isn&#8217;t up to the quality of everything else, which makes it stand out all the more.I&#8217;ve never been one to champion quantity over quality, but GT6 manages ridiculously generous portions of both. I don&#8217;t want to sling mud at Forza 5, but where that game loops back to previously-visited tracks extremely quickly, GT6 just keeps chucking in new raceways. Not only does it have the likes of Bathurst, Spa, and Silverstone, it also has Monza, Suzuka, Brands, Motegi, and Daytona. And more. And that&#8217;s not mentioning the original tracks, rally stages, and karting events. Oh, and snow races at Chamonix. AND ALSO THE MOON. (Note: Moon events are stupid, slow, and stupid. But they are there.)While GT6 exhibits most if not all of the series&#8217; idiosyncrasies, it has deftly pulled itself out from its own exhaust pipe, dropped 99% of the pretentious jazz, and regained its mojo. With post-race confetti sparkles (a cheap effect, but I like it), harmony guitar fanfares when you win, and some stylish presentation, it feels like a video game again.GT is coming to PS4, but it no longer needs that machine to save the series. This is everything GT5 should have been. So forget that game ever existed, get this and enjoy it while you wonder why they skipped straight from GT4 to GT6.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2013"}

Massive environments, challenging missions and strategic team formations highlight this latest evolution in the Sonic universe!","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"Could've been better","reviewText":"Sonic Team brings an innovative plan to the hedgehog council but doesn't quite see it through. Sonic games are all about speed, instinct, and reflex-you run around dizzying loops, hoping you're fast enough to press the jump button before you fall on a bed of spikes. Sonic Heroes had the potential to take that concept to the next level, but somewhere along the road to change, Sonic Team seems to have gotten spooked by the unknown. Sonic Heroes' brave new conceit is that you're in control of three different characters at the same time. A team (there are four to pick from) consists of a Speed, Power, and Fly character, each with a different set of moves and abilities, and knowing which character should take the lead at any given time is an integral part of the gameplay. Like most Sonic Team games, Heroes gets high marks for replayability as the four teams have different quests, even though the levels and powers are fundamentally the same. Where this system is most successful is in the combat. You quickly learn to identify which combination of attacks will fell your foe the fastest (Sonic's tornado to rip off a shield, Knuckles' Jump Slam to hit the guy while he's down), and switching between characters becomes a matter of instinct thanks to a simple-to-remember swapping system. While there aren't a lot of enemy types, the game has fun with grouping them, and they're always fun to destroy.Strangely enough, Heroes doesn't always seem to trust its own character-swapping gimmick. Most of the time, it's too obvious who's supposed to take the lead as signs are posted that tell you straight-up whether Speed, Power, of Fly should tackle the next situation-and many times, it turns out, it doesn't really matter. Too frequently, the game takes control for you to hurl you through a section, and you're left feeling like you're watching instead of really participating. This can be frustrating on the flipside, too, when you're sure the game is going to automatically land you safely on a narrow tightrope after a blind 200-foot fall...and it doesn't.Though the Xbox version's visuals are a little sharper and the GameCube's controller is a little more suited for the action, the presentation is otherwise nearly identical-fast and colorful, but fairly simple with an overabundance of orbs and boxes, and an underusage of shadows and lighting. Sonic's trademark electric rock soundtrack is in full force (like it or not), and the repeated voice samples telling you what to do delight as frequently as they disgust. Sonic Heroes is a creative stab at reclaiming the essence of hog; if it only had a little more faith in its own clever idea, it probably would have broken the sound barrier.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2004"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXLQC","description":"","reviewerName":"Matt","summary":"Haven't I played this before?","reviewText":"I knew exactly what I would be getting into with Resident Evil 6, which is why I waited until the game dropped to about $20 on Amazon (I actually had no intention of ever playing it, but couldn't believe the price). I think even disappointing games are worth a $20 bill as long as they are playable.This game is not Resident Evil. I know that, and you know that. It's a third-person action shooter that just takes place in the RE universe and utilizes the RE characters. They really should've just created this game as a totally different IP and put the Resident Evil trademark out to pasture. If you're looking for the classic RE experience, just give up and go play the earlier games, because that experience is never coming back.So how does it fare as an action shooter? In my opinion, not too well. I personally can't stand how close the camera follows your character as he/she will essentially take up half of the screen, making it difficult to see where enemies and obstacles are, particularly in skinny hallways and small rooms, and especially when running. With some exceptions, the environments are incredibly dark, even with the brightness maxed out, making it all the more difficult to see what you're supposed to be shooting at. Given the outrageous scripted action sequences and active environments, there's not a lot of \"horror\" to be had here, and having to navigate unnecessarily dark rooms is aggravating instead of scary, and also led to some serious eyestrain.The aiming mechanics are clunky, and it can be very difficult to hit moving enemies (most of them are), leading to a frustrating waste of ammo, which is often surprisingly scarce for an action shooter. This can be counteracted, however, by utilizing a character's melee attack, which is almost too effective, but it's silly to play what is clearly a shooting game and go around throwing elbows all the time. You can at least move while aiming, and that's a nice feature than any shooter should have; however, the movement is incredible slow and is not really useful in most situations. Your character also has a nasty habit of automatically \"sticking\" up next to walls and other forms of standing cover when you get near them while aiming. With me this often happened suddenly and unexpectedly right in the middle of a huge firefight, leading to frustrating battles with the controller to get my character off the wall and back under control.The enemies you face this time around are, of course, zombies and a variety of strange, increasingly bizarre mutated things. Unfortunately, the term \"zombie\" is used more for historical effect, as the enemies in RE6 are a far cry from what most would consider zombies. \"Zombies\" now shoot firearms, including light machine guns and rocket launchers, as well as carry shields, and pop in and out of cover. How jarringly stupid is that?? As I mentioned above, this is a flagrant reminder that this is not resident evil, but just a Call of Duty-style shooter with a very thin coat of traditional \"survival horror\" paint slapped on it. Give me a freaking break, Capcom.As another slap in the face to \"survival horror,\" your character now has a constant companion (human or AI)that joins you. This is, of course, entirely for the purposes of human-human co-op gameplay, but it makes an already unscary game even less scary. I never played with a human teammate so I can't comment on that (although i suspect it's probably enjoyable), but I can easily say that the friendly AI player is incredibly useless. They can't seem to hit things a few feet in front of them most times, and it's not uncommon to see him/her go running into and through a room, completely ignoring the enemies within, only to stop at the exit and wait. At least they're seemingly invincible and you don't have to keep reviving them. And on no real surprising note, co-op events are inanely limited (as always) to pressing a button to open a door together or pressing a button to boost the other player up to a higher level.The graphics are nice and pretty, but that's about all companies like Capcom and SquareEnix are known for these days. The music and sound are fine but nothing to write home about and nothing memorable. The voice acting is pretty decent, but the dialogue is standard hokey fare.The plot is not noteworty by any means, unless you happen to be obsessed with the RE universe and its details. I followed along with all of the cutscenes and dialogue throughout the entire game, and I remember very little of why I was doing what I was doing. Who cares. Move from Point A to Point B and shoot at bad guys until a really large bad guys shows up, and then shoot at him. Do it again. Eventually the game ends. I've done all of this many, many times before in other games in the last several years.Fortunately, the cutscenes in RE6 are not obnoxiously long or even painful to watch as in some other games, but they still pop up during times when you just want to PLAY the game, not watch it. As in other modern games with cutscenes, there are many stretches during which you will sit through a cutscene, only to regain control of your character so that you can walk down a single hallway....... and into yet another cutscene. Sometimes rinse and repeat once or twice more after that. This has become somewhat of a staple of video games these days and is rapidly wearing out its welcome.  Scripted action sequences and scenes are plentiful but sadly very routine and lacking creativity, such as a helicopter suddenly showing up to blow up cars in front of you or a zombie magically appearing in an apartment window and blowing up something in front of you with a rocket launcher.The length of the experience is a notable plus. There are four campaigns, each made up of 5 chapters, and a good number of them will take many hours to beat leading easily to a total playtime of 20-30+ hours. If you're looking for a game that has a high time:money ratio, then this is a good pick.  I don't like multiplayer add-ons and cannot comment on those aspects of this game.-----------Overall, to me the problem with this game is that is does nothing new and nothing memorable. I've played this game many times before under a variety of names and titles, and God knows there are more to come. I get why developers are morphing popular non-action series into action series.... because they appeal to a broader audience and are more financially palatable to publishers and investors. But I can still express my disappointment with this \"evolution\" in game design, and I will still mourn the decline of memorable gameplay of many, many years ago.In my opinion, from a pure gaming point of view, I wasn't miserable while playing RE6, but I'm very proud that I only paid $20 for it. A rental over an extended weekend would have probably worked even better. There's just no reason to pay more than that for an action shooter experience that you can experience any other day of the week.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0053B7ICO","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Good fun","reviewText":"I've played a lot of HOTD games and when I first saw this on the Wii, I was disappointed, but now I have a copy on the PS3 I am enjoying it.The game is as simple as shooting games come - you'll be driven through the levels on rails, shooting everything on screen before it attacks you. At the end of every level is a boss. However, this is the first of the HOTD games to actually feel different from the rest and as I was such a fan of the earlier ones, I didn't like a lot of the changes. First of all, the game is full to the brim with swearing. Every cut scene involves so much bad language it's hard to take at some points, so you need a sense of humour to put up with this. The scenarios are also much less \"cheesy\" than before. Most of the supporting characters are very perverted. There's also a lot more realistic gore, so this is definitely an adult game, which is a shame as the previous ones could be enjoyed by anybody, but this would NEVER be allowed in an arcade!The gameplay remains the same, you still have to shoot everything, but avoid normal humans who occasionally pop up and need saving (they don't give you Life Ups though!). Something that I thought was missing though was the ability to obliterate the scenery - no more crates, padlocks, vases, etc to shoot apart, and even the zombie body hits don't really register gunshot as well as before - arms and legs don't seem to fly off, and I used to do this a lot with the ones holding weapons. Worst of all - no more branching pathways. There is only one linear route through each level, and that was a shame.However - there are improvements. Obviously the graphics look great...mostly: there are a few exceptions, notably Varla Guns' hair which is so bad it distracted me from everything else whenever she was on screen. The levels are all quite long and there are a lot of chapters and there are also mini games. For the completists there are things to look out for onscreen such as posters, figurines and comic books - shooting these unlocks bonus galleries and so on.Finally, on the PS3 version at least, there is one huge difference - there is no game over! Right at first play, the amount of continues is unlimited which I found really strange - so even the weakest player could make it through to the end on their first sitting, which really takes out the challenge. Very odd.Anyway, there are some new features in the PS3 version too. First of all, there are at least two entirely new chapters in which you play as Varla and Candy. These are full length levels and no less fun than the others, so I would say that alone puts the PS3 version head and shoulders above the earlier releases. Next, on completion of the main game you can unlock the Directors Cut. This is even better! Every level is slightly extended, with new areas. Most notably, the opening stage which originally started in the living room of Papa Ceaser's mansion, now begins in the garden and you have to make your way to the main house and get inside before the original pathway resumes. All of the levels have some extra parts like this. They also have more zombies! And they are a lot faster and meaner. This made a refreshing challenge after completing the main game - which actually felt rather easy. The Director's Cut is tough, and as a result, way more fun. Worth waiting for.After finishing the Directors Cut you get another mode - Classic Mode, which is simply the Directors Cut but played with only the default gun (in all other modes you can purchase and upgrade lots of weapons), and a Hardcore Mode, which I haven't tried yet.So if you think that shooting games can be shortlived, I'd say give this a try as it has kept me interested for a few weeks now. The levels are so long it's very hard to memorize them, which is what you could do in the older games. The Move controller works perfectly, so it's all good. Oh one more thing - don't bother with the 3D mode, it's not great 3D and you'll have a headache within minutes! But apart from that - well worth a purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2011"}

I know you hate to hear this sorta thing, but accept this:  That's your own fault, not Nintendo's.  See, in the world of video games, common sense dictates that if you're unsure of something you should do your research first, then spend your money later.  At least 60% of the reviewers for this item refused to do just that.First and foremost, regarding Mario... no, this controller isn't compatible with it, and no there isn't a reason why it should be compatible.  You're all complaining like the Wii U doesn't come with a controller.  If that's the case, then how come every Wii U comes with this giant slab with a screen, analog sticks, bumpers, triggers and buttons?  Isn't that a controller?  It's fully compatible with the GamePad and basic Wii remotes--and that's all you really need.  You can complain that another optional controller isn't compatible, but can you blame Nintendo for that?  If anything, I think they were helping consumers out by not forcing them to shell out an extra $50 to play Mario with their new console.As far as complaints about other games such as Arkham City and eShop titles, don't get mad at Nintendo for that.  Get mad at the game's original developers who decided to finish the games without Pro Controller support.  True, Batman is just as playable with a Pro Controller I won't argue that, but you can't blame Nintendo for a third-party decision.EDIT: I meant to address the lack of backward compatibility with Wii and Virtual Console games.  Yes, I know it sucks, but chances are that you've ported your Wii data to your Wii U.  In that case, your Virtual Console and Wii games are still just as compatible with your previous controllers.  Once again, there's not a whole lot Nintendo can do about that at the moment.  There's word that the VC games will make their way to the Wii U eShop, complete with second-screen mode.  However, there's no way to make the original Wii games compatible with the new controllers, because plain and simple, the Wii games were not designed with these newer controllers in mind.  To make the Wii games compatible with this controller would require individual updates for every game, and frankly that's too costly and time-consuming.  I'd rather Nintendo focus on bringing us more games for Wii U that make the console worth going back to than to focus on games that have already been released years ago.But, I digress.  Now I'll talk about why the Pro Controller deserves a better reputation.From the outside, the Pro Controller looks like an Xbox 360 controller rip-off but in all reality that's far from the truth.  Once the controller's in your hands, you feel the light-weight, ergonomic difference.  Some might complain about the stick placement in comparison to competing controllers, but it makes such  huge difference during a lot of games, such as with shooters like Black Ops 2.  Having the sticks close to the main action buttons (the bumpers and triggers) makes the gameplay a lot smoother and in most cases more precise.If I wanted an excuse to complain about this, I could complain about the lack of a headset port, but to be honest I don't really use voice chat during games anyway, so it's not a huge deal.  Besides, what really makes this controller stand out is its 80-hour battery life.  They're not kidding, either--I've had this for three weeks.  I've been playing Black Ops 2, Darksiders 2 and ZombiU like crazy since I got the console, and I'm just now scratching the surface of the second bar of battery life on this controller.My suggestion, reader: DO YOUR RESEARCH.  The sad reality is that at the moment, not every game will be compatible with this controller.  Before putting money down on this, make sure you research and find out which of your games can utilize the Pro Controller.  If you're like me and most of your games are compatible with the Pro Controller, go for it! It's totally worth it.  However, if you find that only a few (if any) of your games can utilize it, you might be better off avoiding it for now.But don't fret.  It's still extremely early in the Wii U's lifespan.  You know just as well as I do that more experiences are coming, and with more games come games that utilize this wonderful controller.  So in summary, research before buying.

Among other things, the Dunia Engine delivers realistic, interactive environments, special effects, real-time night-and-day cycles, and smart enemy AI.Expansive, Realistic EnvironmentFar Cry 2 is set in a fictional region of Africa where you are caught between two rival factions at war. The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah. Wild animals such as zebras, buffalo, gazelle are encountered during the game, with both players and enemies allowed to interact with them.Far Cry 2 features an incredible level of detail and realism, with a minimal in-game interface to detract from immersion. For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game. To fulfill your mission, you need to play the enemies against each other, using both strategy and skill.Huge Range of Weapons and VehiclesFar Cry 2 offers gamers a wide range of weapons, from a machete for hand-to-hand combat, to a sniper rifle that can stealthily pluck off enemies from afar. As weapons disintegrate over time, they might jam or even explode in your hand.There are also a large range of vehicles such as gliders, trucks, cars, and boats that will let you fly, drive, slide, and hover over the open landscapes.Multiplayer Options for up to 16 PlayersFar Cry 2 supports up to 16 players and has four gameplay modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond, and Uprising. Players can choose from six different classes in multiplayer, each with its own set of pros and cons. Just as in the single-player mode, multiplayer games will feature dynamic elements, making each session unique.You can explore the world of Far Cry 2 from inside a car or flying on a glider.","reviewerName":"ChomskyKnows \"ChomskyKnows\"","summary":"92% done, but game now freezes upon loading ANY game save.

Gonzalez","summary":"A NEW Generation Of RE.","reviewText":"I am still playing my RE 5 and after awhile playing I felt that I should come on here and add my review. I was really excited when I found out RE 5 was coming out. Now the test was playing it and seeing for myself how much it's improved since RE 4. One thing I am disappointed about is the music. RE games then were all about the really scary back ground music it made the game more deep and had you thinking anything is going to come right around the corner and jump at you. Sadly, the music lacks in the game and sounds more up beat action moment then scary and suspense. The controls were a bit difficult for me at first just like anybody but it's amazing that they tend to use every single button possible on the paddle making it twice as difficult. The graphics are are really good. The monsters were a bit over done. In previous games all it took was a simple tyrant to scare the heck out of you. In this game they go way beyond in making different creatures with names you can't even say right in english. They made it more into a theatre production then a RE game. Having a partner is not all that bad and actually works in this game but wish she wouldn't use up so much ammo. All in all I am going to say this is a fun game and I am glad they are revamping the games and making them so the new generations can enjoy this excellent storyline.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2009"}

I played it on normal but the only way to play on the hardest setting is to play the game on hard.  The good thing is that you can replay any mission on any setting and your stats will determin how many points you get in the end.  The points you earn could unlock the figures (acheivement related), Other outfits to play in the game (acheivement related), muliplayer characters (acheivements related) and unlited ammo for a gun that you have fully upgraded.  You can replay missions that have good items in the beggenning and just restart the mission to collect more items.  The co-op is is even better due to the AI parter being slow in reviving me when im injured and the time it takes for me to die is about 2 seconds on professional difficulty.  I recomend a good parter and to stay close.  The next piece of advice is you beat the game in under 5 hours (I think it was) to unlock unlimited ammo for the rocket launcher.  As i said you can re-do specific mission to beat the time you had before and it all counts for the overall game as well as using your ugraded weapons.  Its not really that hard and when you play the game on professional, its a breez, rocket launch all the bosses and any big group of zombies.I never plaid any of the other Res Evils but i like how you can upgrade your weapons in between the missions.The multiplayer should have already been added in the game since their is a similar version of it already in the game.Awesome gameplay and good replay value","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2009"}

R.E. 5 still holds its own as a terrific game with amazing graphics, a great pair of characters in Chris and Sheva, huge boss battles, incredibly tense moments, powerful weapons and a smoother, more streamlined way of managing your inventory.  So why is it that R.E. 4 still seem like the better game?I hate to knock such an obviously brilliant A+ game, but I can't help feeling that this game seemed just the slightest bit bland compared to its predecessor.  Perhaps 4 just set the bar too high?  R.E. 5 is still a great play-through, but it doesn't seem to add a whole lot that's new (other than a couple of open field chases).  There were just so many brilliantly memorable moments in R.E. 4 that unfortunately seem to have no equivalent here.  Once I finished the game, there really weren't a lot of memorable things about the experience that remained with me. (Other than the countless annoying Wesker battles-JUST DIE ALREADY!!!)Don't get me wrong, R.E. 5 is still an instant classic and an A+ game all the way-it's just interesting to me that even with better graphics, more action, etc.-I'd still rather go back and play R.E. 4 again.  Sheva is a nice (and gorgeous) addition to the series though.  Chris is pretty cool too-though he's still no Leon.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2010"}

The first is that if you've played RE4 the controls for arming, targeting, and firing are almost the same is the previous game which makes it a little easier,  and the second is that unlike the said RE4 you actually have a partner Sheva Alomar that helps you out in problematic unlike Ashley Graham(RE4).  The camera angle is also just like RE4 which looks over the shoulder of the character Chris Redfield when moving, running, or shooting.  The enemies are also as you probably guessed similar to the zombie like creatures of RE4 with the alien like heads popping out of certain infected people when you shoot them.  The extras are many and it'll take a while I think for anyone to unlock them all,  here's a little fun thing as well unlike RE4 this game saves in chapters that allow you to play any level you have finished again and again if you wish, you can also view the video cutscenes from levels you've also finished in the extra menu area.

The perk system has changed and that's not bad.What I don't care for is the fact that once you get a 5 kill streak, you can end up getting many, many more kills if you get a harrier or chopper gunner perk.  They've taken some of the skill out of the game in my opinion.  You can steal a teamates care package too.  I snagged a care package for a chopper and got 15 kills by hiding in a coner.  It took no skill at all.  There's always something in the air too with harriers, choppers and ac-130s being used a lot.Overall, I'm dissapointed in the game.

I still go back to it after several years for nothing more than the thrills and good times it has to offer. Bounty Hunter isn't perfect but it is one of the better Star Wars games I've played and its a great third person shooter. I remember how much the graphics, cutscenes, effects, sound, and dialog blew me away a couple years ago and all I can do today is appreciate all these things more. Every time I play the game (I've played it a lot) I find new things to mess around with, whether it be small rodent creatures to blast or secret areas containing heavy weapons. The worlds are immerse with detail and most are actually almost beautiful. The explosions and laser blasts that fill the levels all look great, as do the characters, who's lypsyncing and motions are excellently executed. The action gameplay is fast paced with a very high frame rate. The sound design sounds as though it was taken directly from a Star Wars film. And most of all, the story is very entertaining, from your first encounter with the villanous scum Meeko, to your stealing of Slave 1 from an astroid prision, to meeting Tyranus. The story takes you all around the galaxy and be prepared to meet up with some familiar characters such as Zam Weesel. Many have complained about the game's repetetivness and lousy camera and I will admit that the camera tends to work a little strangly at times, but it certainly can be controled and is not something to get all worked up over. Bounty Hunter's action has never boared me and I find it's controls to be intruative and easy to use. Star Wars Bounty Huter is an excellent game with high production values and many good things going for it, I truely hope Lucas Arts releases a sequel for it because it is one of the best games I have ever played. Thanks for reading.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2005"}
{"product_name":"B001AWBYNE","reviewerName":"Campy","summary":"CoD 4: WWII Warfare.. oh, I mean, um, CoD5: World at War.","reviewText":"So I finally got to play the three modes this game has to offer, and since it had been a hot issue, whether this game was just CoD 4 on WWII wheels, I think some things needed to be cleared up.- Graphics- this game doesn't look much better or detailed than CoD4. The difference? Much fancier settings lead to seemingly \"better\" graphics. CoD 4 took place in very droll settings (modern- day terrorists should get interior decorators, for reals) but the fact of the matter is, they look practically the same. That's a no no for W@W, 'cos they could have at least ....improved a bit. The water, in case you were wondering, looks good enough to drink, get some type of poisoning for drinking water where rats pee, and then die drowning in your own pool of vomit and bile right by the good looking water. (since water and face movements are two watermarks for how good graphics are)-Sound- the guns sound amazing...in the sense that most WWII weapons sounded like pop guns in comparison to modern guns. The voice acting is really really good. Like, really. The music in the Pacific Theater levels SUCKS. It actually sucks so much, it's overshadowing a very nice game. It's a faux pas comparable to using Godsmack for PoP Warrior Within. I dunno who Sean Murray is, but dude, you is the suckzors. On the other hand, Mr. Lost Boys himelf as Cpl-then-Sgt- Roebuck is EXCELLENT. And, not to be left behind by Gary Oldman as Reznov (who, for any of you who saw Enemy at the Gates, should have been called Koulikov, but I guess they would have sued)-Gameplay- Oooh ok, the nitty gritty. This game has way more...um...quirks than CoD4. Collectibles, and um, modes and stuff. So, if that's your tea in a cup, goodly.  But this game does not feel as tight as CoD4. The \"sloppiness\" isn't so bad that it detracts from gameplay, but it is noticeable. Right from the start. It doesn't help either that more often than not, there's a variety of paths to take... not that the game is not linear... it is, just, it's up to you whether or not you want to take it up through the trench, or whether you want to slap the bullseye on your helmet and go over the top. But, for the most part, ahem... yes, this is CoD 4 on WWII wheels. To me though, that's not bad. Is it worth shelling over $60? At first I thought no, but there's the issue of different game modes...Single campaign solo- This game suffers greatly from uneven level design. Let me specify...the game, unlike CoD4, doesn't follow a cohesive storyline...the problem lies in the fact that you're not pursuing two terrorists who have one common endgame...no, you're fighting the whole axis...so, when you take that from macro to micro, it suffers and the levels seem tacked on. Truth be told, every level feels separate from the next. Which, in retrospective, makes CoD4s SP truly shine, because it now seems like a great movie. W@W just seems like random WWII encounters put together. I LOVE WII so that's not a problem for me, but it might be for you. Now, the meat and potatoes,-Competitive MP- well. I am WOWED. It is very much so like CoD 4, but before you start complaining.... think about it: what's bad about that!? And what I've been hearing is true: Power Housing in this game is way more difficult, as is camping....because, it's easy to catch a camper sitting on his arse from behind. The level designs were thought in a more organic way... I think. War ravaged buildings= outlandish situations. Another, very interesting byproduct of this being a WWII is the weapons.  You might say \"huh??\" Well, WWII shooters have... WWII guns. What does that mean?? Well, by modern-day guns standards... a lot of the weapons used in WWII are underpowered. A few exceptions aside,  the weaknesses of WWII guns have been implemented in a way that it hinders you like it would in real life, something that wasn't really present in CoD4, because modern day guns are a progression of improvement in weaponry. The MP5 for example, is a powerhouse, because heck, it's a frickin' state of the art gun! But, for example... take the beloved M1 Garand. It's powerful, and it is precise. And you have to have a happy trigger finger to have a good repeat on it. And you have to take a frickin' clip out, and it goes \"ping!' when you're out, and that's gonna be every 8 shots. Shoot! Another example?  The BAR. Ooooh, chills. Well, it's slow going, and the clip is a measly 20 bullets. Shall we talk about bolt action rifles? Shoot, bolt, shoot, bolt... five bullets and megalong reload??? Oh noes! Also, the grenades weren't as powerful as they are now, and Tater Mashers are sort of a joke, unless you have the aim of William Tell.  So I think, for now, since I'm still starting, the gameplay has been kept level with the guns as well. Now, the pleasant surprise,-Coop MP- Well, I played with a friend, and WOW, we kept dying and coming back laughing. Talk about team work being important. It's similar to R2s co-op, but there are no classes, so every character is on the level, and every player can take care of their buddies with careful planning. But I gotta say, and hey, we only played about two levels, my friend and I , but this mode made me say \"well, I'm glad I didn't wait until it got down to $40\" Really. I mean, this mode of play overshadows the SP greatly, for the single fact that it's the same thing, just multiplayer.So, these issues taken into account, I still don't know if we could cut Treyarch some slack or not...they say plagiarism is the best form of compliment. These guys might not be the best developers around... and they are not far from being the worst, from what I hear ( I never played CoD3), but they sure know how to identify the features that make a good game and putting them together.As a sidenote, the first level you play as a Soviet is a dead ringer for the initial scenes from Enemy at the Gates, which had been somewhat depicted in CoD, but it didn't matter much to me, it was incredibly fun. Old timey sniping was good timey sniping.Btw- the flamethrower? Let's just say, I've rekindled my pyromania, at least in a safe way. Pun totally intended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2008"}

The game that is considered to be like a Zelda game. Yes indeed, it did infact star a young main male character who is mute, opens chest, dungeon-crawls and has the game-play of an action rpg. But unlike Zelda franchise Dark Cloud has no over world map to travel upon and a cast of other playable character which wouldn't be in a Zelda game. Not to mention the multiple variety of swords that can be found inside dungeons or brought at stores, while Zelda has a few selected traditional weapons.  With that in mind let us considered this a zelda-knock off with a sprinkle of Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts genre.The gameplay is standard in this game. Basically slash your way through the levels while searching for the missing pieces of the villages and solve key items and puzzles to move onto the next level. Nothing too interesting about the combat. As for the Sims part of the game your just moving buildings around. Take a building, and place it where you want it to go. Certain buildings may have additional keys or storyline available if you are able to obtain them inside of the dungeon's. There are tons and tons of monsters in this game more than there are NPC's. This is a heavy dungeon-crawler, enemies will \"reappear\" if you leave the area or wait around too long. There also is a leveling-up factor. The more enemies that are defeated, the stronger the characters will become. Certain characters can form certain attacks which is key for advancing in the later stages.On the other-hand the storyline isn't that much in-depth and grabbing. Prince needed power for kingdom, seeks a way to gain that power and in the result is cursed. Prince ends up killing the girl he's interested in. Prince vows to put an end to the evil inside of him and goes into the future. Main hero must go back in time to stop the evil in the Prince. Fat Dark-Genie was an imitation and a mouse. This game is also loaded with some cuteness factor.It's a nice game with some good ideas but there are other games out there now that go beyond what Dark Cloud was during its peak in the gaming world.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2009"}

With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents.

Pretty much every other game from Baldurs' gate to Icewind Dale to Dragon Age Origins I had multiple play trough but the first Mass Effect was pretty much was just one and done for me.The sequel pretty much improved everything I hated about Mass Effect, I love the idea of Heat clips it is much better than your weapons overheating with unlimited ammo. Your teammates are also so much better, I hated that I was limited to maybe 3-4 of my companions on the first one because of the inventory system. The sequel removes that inventory system, all you do is but upgrades to weapons and it applies to everyone on your team. On the first one you are pretty much limited to being a Soldier because using any other class is pretty much useless, the sequel don't have that problem; every class is powerful in their own way and each and everyone of your teammates are a force of their own. I played as an Infiltrator on my first run and now playing as a Vanguard on my second play through and plans to do a third one with an Adept.I hope they stick with this formula on Mass Effect 3, even if Sheppard's story ends at Mass Effect 3 there is so much they can do with this franchise.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2010"}

{"product_name":"B004FSE52C","description":"","reviewerName":"Michael","summary":"Breathtaking experience","reviewText":"I am not that big of a fan of the older games. The platforming on it was kind of frustrating at times. But this game excels in that and goes far beyond. In the credits, the game tells you the team put all their best effort into the game and it shows. On more than one occasion.  I am not going to get too into-depth in this review and rather will just recommend you buy this game. Right. Now. It's worth every penny of your investment to a team that clearly cares. I finished the game after maybe twenty hours, but I did all optional tombs, found all hidden items, did pretty much everything. So it's not that long of a game, but you will enjoy every second.The environments are breathtaking. While playing, I found myself pausing just to move the camera around. Just to look at the amazing detail. Not only are the graphics great, so is movement and overall feel. The movement is great. Contrary to most third person games, it doesn't feel like you're dragging your character around. Lara responds well and movement feels fluid. Apart from a few clunky times when controls respond incorrectly in the most annoying situations, it's a great game in that sense.The platforming is great. Challenging, but not extremely frustrating. Like mentioned earlier controls can get clunky at times, but not often.Combat got some much needed love. Rather than the usual signature double pistols, Lara's signature weapon is now the silent and deadly bow. This will help often because there's a stealth approach to several situations, though stealth can be clunky and frustrating at times due to enemies reacting in ways they shouldn't (seeing bodies in other rooms strangely far away from them when they shouldn't, etc.) There's also the shotgun, pistol, and rifle which each can upgraded by finding weapon parts and pieces you can acquire by exploring, opening up part boxes and looting enemies- making exploring much more rewarding. A huge part of combat is played by the skill/level system- gain XP to level up and unlock new great combat skills, as well as others. It does feel at times that quick time button mashing plays too big a role in several combat moments, and the game's combat can feel too easy at times. But you won't mind because everything else is just such a great time to play.As for optional activities, there's a few tombs and hidden documents that I HIGHLY recommend exploring. Each of the hidden relics/documents push the story forward and are actually very interesting considering the whole game's setting. The optional tombs give great rewards, not only in their interesting puzzles but their great interesting feel of exploration they give. Overall there isn't that much of optional things to do, but the ones that are there are so fun to do you won't even mind!The game isn't open world and is pretty linear but so much detail is packed into the game. You also have the choice to fast travel from campsites to other discovered areas to explore them over and maybe find things you missed earlier. I usually prefer open world games but this is a great combination of linear and open world that just makes the game that much better.Overall, a must-get. Beautiful, beautiful game. Multiplayer is bad, but forget that. Singleplayer is the star here, and this game is a solid 10/10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2014"}

Choose from Wolverine, Spider-Man, Thing, Storm, and many others!You can sort of consider this a Diablo style game with a much more upbeat style. You are one of four characters on the screen at any time, and can quickly flip through them. You go through the rooms hacking, slashing, slashing, and then hacking some more. Along the way you grab colored orbs and glowing coins to help you level up your own character and unlock goodies.It's disappointing that at the beginning your four starting characters are Spider-Man, Thor, Wolverine, and Captain America. As much as I like those guys, couldn't ONE of them have been female? Still, it's only maybe 10 minutes later that you get to the \"team switching\" spot and can begin to design your own team. They're not stingy with the characters. Right from this point you can immediately begin to use spider-woman, deadpool, iceman, colossus, elektra, human torch, iron man, thing, luke cage, invisible woman, storm, mr. fantastic, ms marvel, and moon knight. There's also other unlockable characters that you can get as you go.Each character can be levelled up to gain new abilities and outfits. You can choose characters that \"traditionally\" (in comic book stories) work together, and they will actually know to do combos in gameplay.The characters personalities really shine through in the cut scenes. Wolverine is stand-offish and a bit arrogant. Spiderman cracks jokes the entire time. Captain America feels he's in charge. I realize that it would be IMPOSSIBLE for them to have redone the cut scenes for every single combination of characters that you could have done! So again, I wish they had a woman in the set :) Maybe kick out Spidey and his incessant comments ...The graphics are rather good, from the flickering flame to the shadows and reflections. This isn't a game of subtleties, though. No textured fabrics or flower petals here. Everything is shiney and plasticky.On the sound side, it's a comic book adventure. You have incredibly cliched dialogue given by over-the-top voices, and lots of booming going on. It's to be expected.The storyline is also a traditional comic book story but heck, we all grew up with them! You're saving the world. Depending on how well you play, you achieve that mission to different degrees. They did a great job getting you to replay it over and over again in order to unlock the best ending you can.I really give the game great kudos for their multiplayer and online options. If you're playing at home, you can easily co-op in four people, one for each character, and go to town. There aren't many games where four people can easily have great fun playing together. For online, the same is true - you can really have a lot of fun conquering levels as a wide range of characters, interacting with players all over the world.This isn't a heavy thinking game, and it doesn't involve complex concepts. Instead, it's a game that adults can easily play with kids, and that can give you a few hours of fun relief from the real world. Well recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2006"}

And, even after you think you've got every move down, you'll find you need to learn methods, since these life-and-death struggles take place between you and a huge array of vicious, hazardous creatures, including wolf spiders, rattlesnakes, Gila Monsters, Tarantula Wasps, black widows, mantises, enemies of your own species, rats, and even humans.Beyond the immediacy of fighting for survival, this game features a story of greed and betrayal in the human world. Slowly unveiled from the disparate perspectives of the two headline creatures, this evolving storyline helps keep even advanced players engaged and guessing at the implications of their own actions.Explore Brutal, Unforgiving EnvironmentsWhichever creature you're playing as, you'll have 360-degree access to a wide range of 3D environments based in the harsh Sonoran Desert. You'll explore a gloomy maze of thorny brambles, forgotten underground tunnels filled with rusting pipes, an above ground wasteland packed with people's garbage, and even a desolate gas station. Each arena promises to challenge your skills as a hunter and a survivor in its own way, while unique angles and a sense of scale that turns small, familiar objects into major obstacles help make these environs especially prickly.","reviewerName":"Enjolras","summary":"Awesome","reviewText":"I used to love playing video games when I was younger, but nowadays the industry seems dominated by first-person shooters. When I read aboutDeadly Creatures, it seemed like a breath of fresh air. I love insects and wildlife, and this game lets you play two of the most infamous bugs around - the scorpion and tarantula. The game perspective really puts you in their (eight) shoes as you munch on crickets and battle other bugs.Here are my thoughts after playing the game for a few hours:GRAPHICS:Superb. Perhaps not at the same level of some other systems, but pretty darn close. The creatures, especially the scorpion and tarantula, look beautiful. You can actually see the hairs on your tarantula's legs. It almost feels like watching a movie - or a gory nature documentary. In fact, the game is so well integrated with the cutscenes that at times I couldn't tell where one ended and the other began.GAMEPLAY:Generally, all of the moves are smooth and easy to learn. The Wii controls really give it a more natural feel.There are some points when gameplay slows for a second as the game loads. Some other reviewers have complained about these issues, but they seem to only take about less than a second at most.REPLAY:I agree with the other reviewers that some of the levels are pretty straightforward and that it won't be much of a challenge for hardcore gamers. Although, I thought the tarantula's levels were cool in that they really took advantage of all three dimensions, with a lot of 3-D vertical climbing.I can't say you'll be playing this over and over, but it is fun to simply go around smashing bugs, even if there's not much more to discover. For a lot of modern gamers (like myself), a great 10 hour game is far better than a frustrating, lackluster 50 hour game.PLOT:As odd as it might sound, a game starring bugs does have a strangely compelling storyline. It's simply, but a lot of care went into it. Each level leads to the next, with various clues about the exploits of the two deadliest creatures in the desert - mankind.MUSIC:Creepy. You can actually download it on iTunes.Overall,Deadly Creaturesis probably one of the most original and fun games to come out in years. If you check out the interviews in the game and on their website, you can tell a lot of thought, passion, and care went into the making ofDeadly Creatures(including studying live scorpions and tarantulas in order to mimic their movements). I really love the idea of a video game allowing you to experience life as an animal. Hopefully, more game designers will explore that option (I'd love a game that lets you play as a hawk for example!).On another note, you can easily find this game for around $15 used or less. At that price, the game is nearly a steal.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2010"}

The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system.

A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck.

Capcom has awakened finally and improved not just the gameplay but everything about it and then some in Resident Evil 4. Better controls ,swifter and faster movement, more weapons, more enemies, more types of enemies, better storyline, more scares, better emotion from characters, and I can go on and on but the point is this game is not just better and more improved than the previous resident evils but it is unquestionably one of the best action adventure survival horror games out there if not the best. One of the biggest improvements in the game of many is the enemies. For example, not even a 3rd of the way into the game a zombie comes running at you wielding chainsaw and a paper bag on his head (looks like leatherface)and if you dont kill him quick enough he slices your head clean off(talk about jumps and scares)A little further along your way you have to fight is a huge swamp thing reminicent of the lochness monster while your driving a motor boat all the sudden the monster appears trying to eat you!!!This game is sick well done!!!

Despite the delays and concerns about the games exclusive status on Nintendos platform (don't worry, it will be released on the PlayStation 2 before the end of the year), Resident Evil 4 is a superb game that re-invents the tried-and-true mechanics of the series in important, innovative ways plus, it's creepy as hell. Resident Evil 4 picks up after Code: Veronica, with Leon Kennedy (from RE2) now a government agent sent to rescue the president\u0019s daughter who disappeared in Europe. Of course, her kidnapping is only a small part of the huge overall picture. The much-publicized absence of trademark zombies (and nemesis corporation Umbrella) was replaced by enemies that are far deadlier: crazed villagers and cultists (among others) who actually put up a fight. Enemies use explosives, weapons, and even bob and weave to dodge your attacks. They also set-up a variety of crude but effective booby traps.If the re-make of the first Resident Evil on the GameCube set a new visual standard for the series, then RE4 easily raises the bar. The game is gorgeous in a very effective way, with mist, rain, and other diverse weather effects coupled to immense detail. Static, pre-rendered backgrounds have been a love-hate relationship of the RE series, but number four wisely discards them with a new third-person view so you can see more of your surroundings, including attackers that may be lurking nearby.RE was frequently frustrating due to the limits on the play system, but not here. Characters can vault over rails, jump through windows, and even engage in hand-to-hand fighting when dry on ammunition. Interwoven into the play mechanics are Action Button sequences twitch-finger situations where you must press the button prompt that appears onscreen (two buttons simultaneously, or one button rapidly). Simple controls keep the diverse functions under simple command, and the various inventories are easy to access and navigate, but the inability to reload weapons in the menu screen or while moving can be a real pain. Speaking of weapons, the game serves up an arsenal Solid Snake would envy: Machine guns, sniper rifles, grenades, magnums, and other weapons can be obtained, and new ones can be purchased and upgraded by one of the many weapon Merchants at random spots throughout the game. If RE4 has any problem, it goes on a little too long (it spans two discs), with one boss battle and plot twist too many. However, there's an extensive reward system, including unlockable content that adds excellent replay value. It took time, but Resident Evil 4 finally arrived in glorious fashion, and fans of the series will be more than pleased. It's easily the best game in the series in recent years.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2005"}

Link \"wildfirelink\"","summary":"A Noctune to Old-style Vampire Hunting & A Symphony of Epic Gaming Proportions","reviewText":"\"Die Monster! You don't belong in this world!\"This was the sort of reaction many long-term series fans gave Konami circa 1997-1998, when they first attempted to bring the Castlevania series into a 3D world on the N64. It wasn't a much better reception a few years later either when Lament Of Innocence & Curse Of Darkness both arrived on the PS2. Even though the rest of the world opted to go into 3D gaming because it was \"the cool new thing\" back in the 90s, few companies such as Konami & Capcom stuck to their guns and kept pumping out some amazing new (new at the time) 32-bit generation 2D titles... and the mighty Symphony Of The Night stood as the proud flagship and proof that 2D gaming is here to stay, no matter what the trends are.\"Wait a moment! You look familiar. And yet.... What do you here?\"Sporting tons of monsters, RPG elements, outstanding artwork, Super-Metroid style gameplay, a killer soundtrack, and huge areas to explore (as well as the \"other\" castle later on), Symphony took most of the best elements of previous Castlevanias, gave the series a massive overhaul in the structural and aesthetic departments and started what is essentially the 2nd generation of Castlevania games. To this day, it remains a gorgeous feast to the eyes, ears, and gaming experience that does in fact, stand the test of time. Although at the time, it appeared that this would be the big hurrah of 2D Vampire Hunting... that is, until the GBA arrived years later heeding the cries for more Symphony:\"It was not by my(Team Symphony's) hand that I am once again given flesh... I was called here by humans who wish to pay me tribute.\"...Tribute in the form of \"Circle Of The Moon\". More titles arrived soon afterward such as Harmony, Aria, Dawn, Portrait, and the recent Excelsia, all of them spectacular in their own right, and yet still they borrowed heavily from Symphony's style, making this one the Granddaddy of Classic Metroidvanias.\"Tribute?! You steal men's souls and make them your slaves!\"Well... I'm not a slave to Symphony exactly, but I'll admit, this one's quickly become my favorite 2D game of all time due to the fact that I can keep coming back to it year after year and still find something new and fun about the game (try collecting all the rare items(!)). So I suppose it has stolen my soul. And while I can certainly see how newer generations of gamers could find so much to nitpick about it, this one remains a classic in my eyes... all bumps involved. So let's get the cons out of the way: Yes, most of the voice acting is terrible. Yes, the dialogue is cheesy as hell. Yes, the game's difficulty could be a little more challenging. Yes, the \"other castle\" is essentially the first one upside down. No, you can't get rid of all the inventory clutter of old items to make equipping items easier. But all in all, the gameplay stays amazing as it's ever had in the series, and a style that many gamers now follow to this day.\"Perhaps the same could be said of all religions...\"Controlling Alucard (and Richter) is as fun and fluid as ever, eliminating all the \"oh no!\" moments from previous games where managing your jumping direction was much more difficult. The animation of your character, the monsters, the castle details and even some of the 3D backgrounds are top notch for the PS1 as well. Definitely a labor of love. With all the special powers, relics & moves you can acquire throughout the game, you can turn your half-vampire/half-human from a simple dagger wielder to a force to be reckoned with. And by the time you reach your father Dracula, you too (along with Richter) will shout out:\"Your words are as empty as your soul. Mankind ill needs a savior such as you!\"And yes, for the first time in the series (aside from his small playable role in Castlevania III), you get to control Dracula's son. But when the Belmonts are essentially nowhere to be found upon Dracula's arrival (and thus, less whip cracking this time around), mankind seriously needs a savior such as Alucard to pick up the slack and put his father (along with Death, Succubus, and the Dark Priest Shaft) back in their places. Richter brought Dracula down years earlier, but it's up to Alucard to figure out why Richter disappeared as well. And so...\"Evil can only triumph when good men do nothing.\"And that leaves us with just one more question:\"What is a man(Metroidvania)? A miserable little pile of secrets!\"Secrets. There are LOTS of secrets. But this adventure is also an amazing ride into gaming history nonetheless. If you dig the Metroid style 2D gaming of the newer titles (or just any game like this period), then I HIGHLY recommend you pick up this game in any form you can. (It's also available on the PSP release \"Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles\" and Xbox Live Arcade, thus eliminating the need to hunt down the original for high prices [9/15/09 UPDATE: I learned that the voice acting changed in Dracula X Chronicles... for the worse. So it's your call]). I also suggest (if you haven't played them already):-Circle Of The Moon (GBA)-Harmony of Dissonance (GBA)-Aria Of Sorrow (GBA)-Dawn Of Sorrow (DS)-Portrait Of Ruin (DS)-Order Of Excelsia (DS)-Metroid Zero Mission (GBA)-Metroid Fusion (GBA)-Super Metroid (SNES)\"But enough talk...

And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive.

Think about it, the stand has to securely place the PS3 in its vertical position and withstand at least some minimum force applied to its sides.  ThePS3 Slim Vertical Standi bought first was nicely built and all but the fault is on the lack of lock in mechanism, so that if the PS3 is accidentally pushed by its left side it will come lose and fall off the base in a second so i sent it back.

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"T.

{"product_name":"B003O6E800","description":"","reviewerName":"dgdbear \"David\"","summary":"Amazing","reviewText":"Ok Now It is time for a Real Review!!The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was and still is considered by loads of people to be the greatest video game that has ever graced mankind. Its fully immersed 3D environments, revolutionary combat system, and in depth characters and areas captured the hearts of millions and set a key standard to the future of how all 3D environment games should be modeled.When I learned that a remake of this classic game was announced for the 3DS back on the system's launch, I was already sold on purchasing one. In order to prepare for my investment, I sold off some older gaming systems I was no longer using in order to save up enough money to purchase the 3DS and a copy of this game. I was a bit disappointed when that day came, for I learned that Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3DS was not a launch title, but I patiently waited. When the game was finally released, I received it as a Father's Day gift, and immediately began to waste all of my time once again playing the game I so loved and cherished.Now, while reading this review, please keep in mind that I will be reviewing this game as a REMAKE, and not as a completely new title. Being a remake, this title does not offer a whole lot of new content, so many comparisons will be made to the original version which was for the Nintendo 64. Keep in mind that this is a remake of a game that once received multiple perfect scores from many different gaming websites and won the Grand Prize in the Interactive Art division at the Japan Media Arts Festival. If you have yet to play this game, and need a review on how it works dynamically, please check a review for that version.-GRAPHICS-My Score: 8/10By far the most anticipated change to the game this time around are the Graphical Enhancements, and they are far from failing. The first big change to the Graphics is that the FPS has been bumped from 20 FPS to 30 FPS, making the game run much smoother then its original counterpart. The graphic developers at Grezzo made it a priority to model all of the characters and environments after their original artwork. Doing so has given us a Zelda experience that greatly surpasses that of the original polygons given to us in the N64 version of the game. Facial expressions are crisp, Link actually has fingers and hand movements noticeable while doing things such as playing the Ocarina, environments are no longer polygons on top of big background images, and entire areas of the game were completely reconstructed to look 100% better, such as Castle town and the entrance to the Temple of Time. After playing through this title, you will swear up and down that Ocarina of Time has always looked THIS good, but trust me, it hasn't.Small little details that have been added in on top of the entire reconstruction of areas and characters are also a very appreciated. Inside Jabu Jabu's belly, we can actually see strings of mucus hanging from his innards. Posters and flyers are hung around Kakariko village advertising some of the shops in Castle Town. The lava effects in Death Mountain and Dodogno's Cavern are fantastic. Particle effects, specifically from things such as Poe's and Bubbles, are completely redone and simply beautiful. On top of added things such as these, hundreds of tiny details have been changed to enhance the experience, one example being that the shadow of a Wallmaster is now in the shape of a Hand, and not in the shape of a giant circle.To be completely honest, I have felt that the 3D aspect of the 3DS was kind of a gimmick. Out of all of the 3DS titles I own, there wasn't really one title that I felt required the 3D be turned on to enhance the gameplay experience. Typically, at times I felt that this even seemed a bit of a burden, but Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3DS has completely changed my mind on this. When I play this game in 3D, it simply blows me away at how great things look. All of the environments work so well in 3D. Most other games I play I notice \"ghosting\" or outlines of characters and objects not falling into the 3D effect of the game, but I have yet to notice any ghosting problems with this game. For any gamers wondering if this game looks good with 3D, I honestly feel that thus far, this title offers the best 3D experience I have yet to see.Now, this isn't to say that the graphical updates to this game are perfect. because honestly, there are some flaws. In some areas of the game, it is noticeable that things could have been a little bit cleaner. Riding around in Hyrule field on Epona can be a beautiful thing, up until you see a straight edged cliff or part of the landscape that simply wasn't rendered correctly in order to keep the original form of the area. Staircases are also a bit of an eyesore still as well, as they aren't actually staircases, but an image of a staircase superimposed on a flat ramp, just like in the original. I don't feel that this would have been too difficult to fix, but this is what we were presented with.Overall, the new good changes to graphics far outweigh the bad changes. Simply, this is a beautiful looking game. Gamers old and new will not be disappointed with what they are given. Because it isn't perfect, and there are still some small detail issues, my score for Graphics is an 8 out of 10.-AUDIO-My Score: 8/10For the most part, Sound effects and music have remained unchanged, and I am not sure if this is a good or a bad thing. Before we can look at the audio as a whole, keeping in mind that this is a remake, how do we improve the sounds of this game without deriving from the classic nostalgia of the original? While keeping the original soundtrack and SFX line keeps the game at its core, it also denies us the pleasure of hearing any of the game's music orchestrated and remastered, which would have sounded beautiful.One song in the title was Orchestrated, and that was the song at the end credits. When I listened to the song and watched the ending sequences of the game, I thought to myself \"Wow, I really wish all of the music would have been redone like this...\" Had the soundtrack been Orchestrated, I feel the game could have been better, but I am not sure if this is true or not. Keeping the original feel really did play off of the nostalgia factor. I will admit, I still get goosebumps every time I turn on the game and hear the opening music, so maybe this isn't a bad thing.All the original sound effects stayed the same, with the exception of a few small differences here and there. Gorons don't moan as they get up off the ground anymore. Small little things like this are barely noticeable, but hearing all of those old noises definitely makes me smile.In the end, I feel it is a good thing they kept all the old SFX for this title, but am still not sure whether or not the Music could have been better. My score for Audio is a 8 out of 10.-GAMEPLAY-My Score: 10/10The definitive ground-breaking aspect of Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was and still is the gameplay mechanics it used. With Ocarina of Time, Link was placed in a full 3D environment, given free movement anywhere, interaction with environment and items, as well as the new Z-Targeting combat system made this THE defining 3D game that countless numbers of 3rd-person view games would be modeled after in the future.For this title, we are given that very gameplay system. All of the old mechanics are back, untempered, and work perfectly on the 3DS. Obviously we do not have a Z button, so instead it was mapped to the L button on the system, and renamed L-Targeting. Combat is still just as smooth as it was on the Nintendo 64, so new gamers and veterans alike will be able to jump right in and begin to play.Controls and movements for Link are smoother then they ever have been before. The range of the Analog Nub on the 3DS is much more sensitive then the Analog Stick was on the N64, giving the player much more precise control over Link then in the N64 counterpart. This makes precise aiming of Link's body in a specific direction much easier and smoother to do (Such as when playing the Bombchu Bowling Minigame).Just as in the older installments of the game, the First-Person controls have also returned, giving us the ability to view the environment in a First-Person perspective. This can be enabled by either pressing the Camera button on the top-left corner of the touch screen, or using any item that requires the First-Person perspective to be used, such as the Slingshot, Bow and Arrows, or the Hookshot. One very cool feature also added to the 3DS version of the game is the ability to control the First-Person perspective via means of the accelerometer built into the 3DS. By simply tilting the screen or turning it in any given direction, you can control where you aim. This gives very precise shooting, and is in my opinion much easier to use then the Analog Nub for targeting. I found myself completing minigames such as the Shooting Range and the Horseback Training much quicker then I had ever done in the past.Having a touch screen gives us much more item accessibility then we ever had with the original game. Item wise, we have not only 3, but 4 different places that we can map items to. First, we have the two button slots, X and Y, and two on-screen buttons that are found on the top-right and bottom-right corners of the touch screen. Not only this, but the Ocarina has been given its own location on the Touch Screen as well, making it much more convenient to map items for use in game. This means less item switching and more interaction with the Temples.Speaking of Item Switching, the Hover Boots and the Iron Boots have both been converted into Items this time around. Now, instead of having to switch to the Equipment Screen and choosing what kind of boots you want to wear, you can now assign it to a touch screen item button or onto one of the face buttons and simply click the corresponding button to equip or unequip your boots. This makes the Shadow Temple and the Water Temple that much easier and less tedious to complete.I think my only gripe about any of the changes to the controls would be about playing the Ocarina, but this is because I am simply stubborn. Not having the 4 C-Buttons means that the controls had to be completely remapped, and were mapped to the L, R, Y, X, and A buttons on the 3DS. This also meant that all of the songs I had memorized and replayed a countless amount of times had to be relearned. I won't complain though, because this was something that simply had to be redone.Overall, the same iconic gameplay has returned, and received some much-wanted upgrades, even if they were small. Because the system was already perfect, Grezzo decided to stick to the \"If it isn't broken, why fix it\" logic, and simply kept everything as close to the original as possible. Mix this with adding in new features such as the Accelerometer controls, and you have yourself a great game to play. My score for gameplay and controls is a 10 out of 10.New and old gamers alike, you will not be disappointed with Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3DS. This classic title now being available to play anywhere in the palm of your hands is a must have title for anyone with a 3DS. If you have never played the game before, I strongly urge you to pick it up and play it on the 3DS, as it offers the best Ocarina of Time experience available today. If you have played it before, I strongly recommend you pick it up and replay through it in its gorgeous new experience","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2011"}

Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Do and say what you want!","reviewText":"Indigo Prophecy is in some ways a very innovative adventure game, and in other ways, extremely old fashioned with regards to the devices it puts you up against to get you through the story. Luckily, the game as a whole survives the weird amalgam of new and old school, and makes for an intrigueing and exciting experience.The story is what makes the game stand out the most, though. You play as the hero Lucas Kane, who suddenly finds himslef commiting a brutal murder while seemingly under some kind of possession. It's up to you to figure out what made you (him?) do it, which involves evading the police and gaining the trust of people who can provide clues to unlocking the mystery. Gameplay is different to most 3rd person adventures I have played. You can control your character movements, but all actions other than moving around can only be performed when you see an icon on your screen that relates to a certain \"hotspot\" you have found. Opening a door, using the bathroom and pouring a drink are probably not the most exciting things you can do in a videogame, but they all have to be done in this one, and you do need to get comfortable with the quick response controls because when the tension rises, you have to start making some pretty sharp decisions. The best parts of the game are the bits where you have a crisis situation suddenly develop, such as suspicious police knocking at your door, or a pitch-dark basement crawling with escaped lunatics to escape from, and you need to think fast as well as control what your character does, often with an onscreen timer counting down on the time you have left. I enjoyed these sequences a lot, and you really do get the outcome you deserve based on the decisions you make in those vital seconds. This time-attack approach is also applied to many question and answer conversations with other characters...to get the most out of some encounters you must think quickly and choose appropriate questions (or responses ) from a limited choice before a timer runs out. This can be fun too, and as you can imagine, outcomes vary considerable based on your judgement.At other times, a different control scheme comes into play. At certain critical moments, the screen will present you with pictoral representations of directional commands that you must apply with both the left and right analogue sticks, to ensure the best outcome to a sequence. This could be Lucas taking flight from mysterious apparitions, or just playing his guitar tunefully enough to win back his estranged girlfriend. The on screen prompts can be quite punishing, as they invariably get faster and more complex as an action sequence nears its conclusion. Sometimes you are even told to repeatedly mash two buttons as fast as you can to perform some strenuous task such as lifting something very heavy - see what I mean about old school? All good finger-aching fun, though.The look of the game is fairly polished, although the graphics are not incredibly detailed, but the atmoshphere is quite impressive. The characters are particularly well rounded, with good looking and well animated faces. Lucas makes an effective and realistic hero, and he's not the only playable character. You also get equal playing time with two police officers, Carla and Tyler. All three of these main characters have subtle personality traits and distinct emotions that make them really come alive. The voiceover work in the game is excellent, and there is a lot of it, as all conversations are spoken in full by the voice actors, and they do really good jobs.I've enjoyed the experience of Indigo Prophecy so much I don't really want to draw attention to any flaws, but I think it would be positive to point them out as the game overall is so effective. Firstly the movement control for the characters is problematic. This is because the in-game camera is totally fluid, so it's constantly swooping around and changing viewpoint, which means your control over the direction you want to head in is continually and repeatedly undermined. In timed sequences (such as a flashback where the young Lucas must quickly find three boys hiding in a dangerous building before it explodes), this movement handicap is a hazard that can potentially ruin the mission for you. Secondly, the action sequences where you must move both analogue sticks in the directions flashing up on screen are some of the most exciting sections of the story...but you can't possibly watch the drama unfolding as your concentration has to stay glued firmly to the on-screen prompts so as not to muck up the sequence you have to follow. I only have a vague recollection of a very striking sequence in which Lucas' apartment literally disintegrates around him, because I was staring at coloured dots and trying to keep him alive, and I could not afford to blink and miss a single one. For the record, game designers, please don't show the best visuals in the game at a time when the players attention will be totally wrapped up in watching something else! A better idea would have been to run a \"wait for it\" visual sequence under the button pressing promtps, and then show the unfolding visuals as a reward.My last point is rather more of a niggle - throughout the game, you switch between playing as Lucas, and the two police officers Carla and Tyler - yet your motivations for playing them are in direct opposotion to each other! As Lucas you must evade the police, and as Carla or Tyler you must track Lucas down and catch him. Yet whenever you play as either party, you are expected to play your hardest to make that character succeed. This seems most nonsensical in one sequence when, playing as Lucas, you must hide in an apartment as Tyler searches it. If you are found it's game over - yet from Tyler's point of view this would count as a victory. I found this very odd. I suppose the idea is to keep both parties heading forwards, but on a parallel course, so that the mystery can be fully unravelled before Lucas is wrongfully incarcerated by the law. I guess it doesn't ruin the game, and as the characters were all so well crafted, I did want them ALL to succeed, so I always appreciated victories on both sides. Even the rather salacious ones like helping Tyler's attempts to get some lovin' with his girlfriend, which shows the lighter side of the developers intentions.I think Indigo Prophecy is a success, most obviously because I found it very hard to switch off every time I started playing, and if the few control issues are fixed, I would really relish playing a sequel. The storyline does take increasingly bizarre turns towards then end, and the pay-off is not as epic or rewarding as the mystery-filled early stages might have promised. Even so, with a \"choose your own adventure\" game like this, there's always replay value if you think you could have made better choices along the way, and I'm definitely glad I tried it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2006"}

After a wistful slumber, Marche awakens and realizes he isn't in Ivalice anymore... or is he?Alone in a foreign land, Marche quickly comes under the care of a helpful creature known as a Moogle. It doesn't take much to convince Marche to adopt a lucrative career as a mercenary.Gangs of IvaliceA quick stop at the town inn introduces Marche to his new gang. A motley crew at best, your associates include low-level monks, mages, archers, and soldiers. The only hope you have of finding your way home is to turn your ragtag group of misfits into a finely tuned fighting force.Begin your tour of duty by chatting up the local barkeep. He'll clue you in to interesting news bits, rumors, and job opportunities. Due to your severe lack of experience, early quests are little more than errands.As you gain experience and reputation, your job options grow as well as the rewards. You can also send one of your crew members on side missions for extra swag. You cannot use these members in your regular quests until they return from their mission.Rules of EngagementWhether your quest is to fetch rare herbs or escort the local nobleman, you can always expect bad company. The battlefield is set up from an isometric 3D viewpoint, allowing clear view of every character in play.At the start of a match, you must choose which members of your gang you wish to take into battle with you. You have a clear view of the enemies before choosing, so try to match your lineup to your opposition.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceintroduces an innovative law system to the series. During every battle, an impartial judge decrees specific rules, such as banning poison attacks or physical attacks. The judges' unpredictability requires players to keep a well-rounded group of characters at all times.Technically, you can break the combat laws, but it is generally not recommended. Even if you win the battle, any of your characters who breaks a law is whisked away to prison. They can only be released after paying a hefty fine.Fantasy FightingThe battlefield is set up like a 3D chessboard, with elevations and terrain types. In each turn, a character can move a specific number of spaces and perform a single action, such as attack or using an item.Most strategy games employ either real-time or turn-based action.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceemploys a speed-based system that is somewhere in-between.Characters still take turns to move and perform actions, but these are based on each character's individual speed ratings. Nimble characters like rogues and ninjas are usually the first characters to go and can usually move farther than other characters. The downside is that faster characters typically lack strong armor and health stats.Subtle details such as terrain type and attack proximity can have a direct affect on your ability to hit an enemy. Attacking an enemy from behind or the side will yield much higher hit percentages than head-on attacks.Job FairWhat you do off the battlefield is arguably more important than what you do on it. Thanks to a stable economy, your characters can usually change job classes once they gain enough experience.Need a little more magic in your life? Try turning one of your grunts into a mage. There are more than 30 different job classes available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.Even in far-off fantasy lands, commercialism is a way of life. You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll end up spending your hard-earned greenbacks on shiny new stuff. Weapons and armor serve not only to boost your stats, but also grant special abilities to specific character types and species.While one sword might grant tremendous attack points, a seemingly lesser sword may give its wielder access to a special attack that can tip the scales in your favor. Thanks to the law system, one should never get too attached to a single piece of equipment.Face ValueGorgeous character illustrations and 2D sprites harken back to Square's 16-bit glory days. Each of the shops, inns, towns, and fields is superbly detailed, with subtle background animations.Final Fantasy Tactics Advancemaintains the series' stellar rep for technically and visually brilliant summon attacks.Uniquely,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancefeatures three separate display settings, depending on whether you're playing on the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, or the Game Boy Player. Each setting offers different levels of brightness, contrast, and saturation to appease even the most fickle of gamers.The only thing that can rival the on-screen wonders is the audio candy. It is no surprise why Square Enix's soundtracks are the most sought-after in the video game community.Lasting PowerNeedless to say, there are hours upon hours of gameplay packed into this tiny little cartridge. Square Enix has done a tremendous job in creating an easily accessible yet incredibly deep gameplay experience.

It seemed way too difficult for me.  After getting killed three times in a row on the first level I gave up on it.  It was Christmas time after all, and I was had other games to play plus my old favorite Oblivion that I keep going back to.  (Yes, I must slip Oblivion into every review for an Xbox 360 game)  But later, when I heard people talk about how much they enjoyed it and read reviews about it on Amazon I decided to give it another go.  I read faqs about how to play better and my skills started to improve.  I began to better grasp the concept of cover, when to stay behind it and when to sally forth and kick some alien(?) butt.  I started  to actually get perfect active reloads.(That flashing bar when you get a perfect reload is quite satisfying.  It almost makes up for the fact that half the time when you finally get a chance to shoot something your temporary damage bonus is gone)  I persisted through the choke points where I wasn't entirely sure how to proceed.(In a fluid game like this strategy guides only help so much)  Even though I died (and got chunked) enough times to fill up a national cemetary I finally beat the game andit was one of the most fulfilling moments of my video game playing days.Why bore you with my life story(of this game).  It's basically a long intro for the theme of this review as stated in the title.  This game ain't easy.  Although I won't give it the satisfaction of putting it in the all time hall of hard games (Battletoads, ghosts and goblins anyone?) it still is a wake up call to die so many times before you even see your first boss.  A game like this isn't some fun diversion you tune onto just before bed.  You play this game sitting straight, hands clenching the controller tight.  This game requires commitment, this game requires dedication.  This game requires you to, I don't know, not suck at shooting games I guess would help.  This game is funner with two people playing.  Why exactly is it that you can resuscitate your computer allies but they can't heal you?  The good thing about this game is that it makes 'health hunting' irrelevant.  Instead of a health meter or bar you have an emblem that glows red when you get hit.  Your character is pretty slow, he can run but it is kind of wonky and hard to control.  All in all this is a good game.  It is a bit hardcore, even when it's not, ie casual.  But that makes beating it even more worthwhile.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2008"}

{"product_name":"B000084318","reviewerName":"Brendan L. Agnew \"rothwyn\"","summary":"Adventure Awakened for a New Generation","reviewText":"I'm the first to admit that when I first saw the new &quot;cartoony&quot; look of the latest entry into my favorite game franchise, I was astounded, disappointed, and rather furious. The realistic demo had held so much promise for a dyed-in-the-wool Zelda fan like me, and the cel-shaded visuals really came as a slap in the face to a fan who wanted more story and a darker tone for the next generation of Zelda.However, my fears were groundless, to say the least. In fact, this is perhaps the darkest, most story-heavy game in the Zelda series, and it is also one of the best games this generation.The game starts like most Zeldas. You're a young boy who has to go on a quest. However, in The Wind Waker, the beginning is a lot closer to home. Your sister is kidnapped, and it's up to you to save her, with the help of a talking boat and a mischevious young pirate queen. Of course, from there, you learn more about your water-coated world, what happened to the heroes and villains of the past, and the identity of a certain Princess. There are also some very dark themes than run just under the surface, and are an interesting counter to the game's lighthearted look.Which brings me to the graphics. They're beautiful. It's that simple. Everything from the weather effects to the characters to the battles to the real-time cutscenes scream Zelda in a way that even the hallowed Ocarina of Time never achieved. It seriously looks like someone ripped Link to the Past from it's roots and set it up in the 3rd dimension, adding so many little details and so much polish that it makes you wonder if a realistic Zelda could ever be what we thought it could be. To all naysayers (and I know there are still a few), give it a chance. By the time you witness your first thunder storm on the open ocean, or see a sunrise over foggy islands, you'll be convinced.However, no Zelda game would be complete without gameplay that is perfect to a &quot;T&quot; and Wind Waker delivers. Taking what was good from Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask and making it even better, Wind Waker stands tall as the best gameplay experience in the Zelda series. The watery overworld conveys a sense of size and potential for discovery that has rarely been seen in gaming before. The dungeons are bigger, the puzzles are more complicated, the boss fights are more rewarding and cinematic, and the standard combat is made even better. For instance, with the press of a button, Link performs a dodge maneuver that either sends him rolling out of harm's way or leaping over an opponent, then delivering a bone-shattering blow. This simple addition makes fighting even the most basic enemies all the more stylish and enjoyable. Add to that more side quests than you can shake two sticks at, and you've got the makings of a fantastic Zelda game.There are some gripes with the game as a whole. Considering the genius inherent in the game's six (or seven or eight, depending on how you count) dungeons, it would have been nice to see even more. Also, the final stage of the game, which sees you gathering pieces of the Tri-Force, can be tedious if you don't have a large enough wallet or enough patience. However, there are moments that offset this. Like the fight in the undersea castle after first reclaiming the Master Sword, or the final battle with Ganon atop a crumbling tower. There are so many great things in this title that harping on the small flaws seems petty at best.After all, if it were a perfect game, the faries would get mad.It stands as a testament to the quality of the Zelda series that a game as engaging and incredible as The Wind Waker can be viewed as having any problems at all. However, if you love adventure games at all, or have a soft spot for Nintendo, or have a tendancy to dress in green, carry a sword, and hit chickens, then this game is, without a doubt, made for your enjoyment. Don't deny yourself this entertainment. Purchase today.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2004"}

Well, I'd love to explain to you all the problems I had with this game, but unfortunately, I can only use a certain number of words for this review, so I'll cover all the main problems I had with it.First and most important is the ending.  The ending was depressing for anyone who's ever played a Zelda title.  Changing the ending alone would have been enough to make the game about 5 times better.  I won't tell you what it was, only that it was TERRIBLE.Secondly, the Gameplay barely existed.  I found that half the game was spent doing NOTHING.  I just set up my sail and waited for five minutes while the game propelled me to my next destination.  The other half of the game was spent fighting battles and solving puzzles that were so easy, no five-year-old would fail at them.Storyline-wise, this game is a flop.  It contains only one realistically-behaving character; Ganon.  The rest of the characters are the product of plot holes, and are moved along BY the story, not the other way around.  Big problem in any game these days.The graphics annoyed me, but only because the character models were very ugly.  And as for the music, it just seemed incongrous very often.Plus, none of the characters talk!  On the GCN!  That's laziness to the umteenth power from a game-design perspective.Still, although I thought this game was a piece of garbage, there are those who found it fun, so I would be being unfair to say it is IMPOSSIBLE to like this game, despite all the huge, gaping flaws and mindless tedium it showcases.  To make everyone happy, I reccomend that you rent this game once to see whether or not you'll like it.  Don't make the mistake of buying it right off the bat like I did.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2004"}

Well, to be honest with you....I took me all of 2 hours to beat this gameThe game is good, but by all means way too short. According to Steam, it takes the average person 3 hours to beat the game, the majority of those people play on medium difficulty. This is not enough content for a game. I would have been much happier if they boxed up episodes one, two, and three (2 and 3 have yet to be released) and put it into one good expansion instead of 3 short teasers.

Super Mario 3D World should help sales soar for the Wii U.  I thought the New Super Mario Bros U was fun but this one has even improved on top of that.  Getting four players running around through a 3D Mario level is so much fun.  You can work together or hinder your friend and family that play with you.  I love Nintendo because it encourages you to play the game with everyone on the same console.  There is a whole level of fun that is just not the same when you play online with others.  The cat suit is a fun addition that allows you to climb up various walls.  The levels are fresh and interesting.  I love the fact that you can choose between using the Wii U tablet, Wii U pro controller, Wii remote or Wii remote + nunchuk.  I bounce between the Wii U pro controller and the Wii remote + nunchuk.  The Wii U tablet controller has special functionality on some maps like turning the screen or powering wind lifts by blowing on it.  The ghost mode is also awesome to watch how someone else completed the level.I consider myself quite a heavy gamer and own the Wii U, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"Chef Sean","summary":"Sadly, the answer is no","reviewText":"Why Rockstar? Why? You took a glorious franchise and dragged it down into mediocrity. The innovation and freedom that was San Andreas has been stripped away. In previous titles, any question I had about what you could do was answered yes! Can I take a hairpin turn at 80mph using the e-brake? YES! Can I base jump off skyscrapers? YES! Can I ride BMX bikes, dune buggies, go karts, and jetpacks? YES! Can I wander the map at will without distraction? Can I steal a harrier jet and take out cars on the freeway? Can I customize my character? Can I steal a harvest combine and run people over with it? Can I buy houses and property? YES YES YES!!!! The fun of the GTA franchise was it's audaciousness, freedom and the ability to create and participate in over-the-top mayhem. Things like rolling down the Vegas Strip in a tank taking out everything you see. Sadly, this is no more.This time around Rockstar went with realism. While it is a very polished title it's just not as fun as the previous installments. In their attempts to create realism they made gameplay a cumbersome chore. First of all, you move too slow. And I mean really freakin' slow. They did create the most detailed and beautiful urban setting in video game history but exploring it on foot is completely out of the question. you wouldn't make it two blocks before your cell phone rang and sent you off to do some chore of a date anyway. They must have spent a year or more designing Liberty City. It's truly amazing. I think they slowed everything down so you would notice the city but it had the opposite effect for me. Free roaming is no longer fun if I have to do it at a snails pace. You can't explore it at high speeds in a car either because high speeds equals a quick death. You ran the risk of dying during high speed driving in the previous games but it happens here a lot more often which adds frustration without adding fun. Flying through the windshield was funny the first time but it became a nuisance after that.Gone are the wacky, over-the-top missions. No breaking into military installations to steal a jetpack. No planting explosives on an airborne jetliner then parachuting to safety. Wanna torch a field of weed with a flamethrower before the cops show up? Forget about it. Nothing here matches the innovation of the previous titles. This game is another \"next-gen\" casualty. All style and no substance. It's an OK game but I don't feel it lives up to the GTA name. While trying to make a realistic experience they removed the most important thing a game can have: fun. They created an amazing city but they made it a chore to explore. Personally, I'll take fun over great graphics any day. I hope we can have both someday. This game didn't make me lose faith in the franchise though. It's worth playing once and I have high hopes for the next installment. Visually it's great but when it comes to content this one is a big step backwards.Edit: The story. Yes it's good. I'll give them that. It's a cut and dry revenge tale though and the suggestions that it compares to 'Goodfellas' or 'The Godfather' are ridiculous. Comparing this story to the masterworks of Coppola and Scorsese is like comparing Dr. Seuss to Shakespeare. Get real already.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"Corey Turner \"The Musician\"","summary":"A Long Lasting Qaulity Title Worthy of the High Price","reviewText":"I'm always skeptical over games that receive high ratings especially when they are highly anticipated, this game is quite an exception.Grand Theft Auto IV is a gritty game with a superb cast and talented voice acting. The graphics although great in many aspects are not as good as big wig reviews would like you to think. The lighting is superb at night from the cop cars glow to the city lights reflecting into the ocean.The story begins with a Eastern European man named Nico, he is upon a ship traveling to Liberty City to fulfill the American dream. After hearing of his cousins success he too wanted in, only to find out luxury was nothing more then a cruel lie. Nico hides much of his background, the further you progress the more his mysterious back round is revealed. It's never too late to find paradise, but how far and what decisions have to be made to justify this?Just like previous GTA's before it you can steal cars, evade cops, go on hot pursuits and even spend some leisure time in the  New York based city.The emphasis of the game is to drive around completing objective based 'missions' and slowly work your way up into the respectable ranks of Liberty City's underground.While some of the old light RPG elements fromSan Andreas are absent many new features are present. The game is very open ended and very long, long games for next gen consoles have all but become a rarity. With a 60$ price tag a long lasting game should be key to success, and GTA IV is indeed successful in fulfilling this. The game offers many side objectives and pleasureful things to pursue, from bowling to playing billiards to going the 'internet'. You can even sit back and watch some t.v. So many little details are what really add to the lively experience one will come to see in the city's depths. The citizens speak to one another, some fight back when their car is being taken, you must hot wire some cars, being able to hear the bass sub woofers shooting sounds out of the car from a distance. You can obtain phone numbers on your phone and create little dates to go on, or meet up with friends of the city. The cars even have a GPS system! A variety of cars and guns and some helicopters are at your disposal mix some cheat codes in and welcome destruction.Liberty City has a grimy underside though, full of hookers, drug trade,murders, heavy cussing, mobster/gang turf, strip clubs, alcohol abuse and many other things to give for a tainted feeling. Not exactly the kid friendly ground, parents should keep weary of this title unless they have a mature kid and even then look out.The last thing I'll mention is the online supremacist.The online is brilliant, but often times clunky in some areas. Online has a lot of multiplayer modes to choose from and some slight character customization's options. You can free roam with friends or pit each other in a fight to the death. The Cops and Robbers variant is amazing where two teams are split and robbers obviously must endure waves of cops to reach their destination.GTA IV has a little bit of a frame rate problem, some popping up objects while driving, and sometimes a clunky online interface, but over all the game is moving, violent, and awesomely varied. The story is movie worthy,the hours put in this game are hours well spent for a game.

Graphically speaking, it is simply beautiful. its amazing how much attention went into every aspect of this world. theres cracks and pot holes ranging in depth in the road, and varying curb heights. vehicle damage is very impressive, from dents and scratches to a hole for each bullet that hits. the lighting system is amazing, with day/night cycles and a rotating sun throughout the day. naturally the game doesnt have the detail of say Call of Duty 4, but you could fit like 50 Call of Duty 4 maps in this city! its that huge. you have to take the size of a game into consideration when rating the graphics, thats been a given for how long now?? just to clear things up for the clowns complaining the graphics.when you walk out the door theres so much to be done you might want to keep a checklist for the days. although what you actually choose to do is up to you. causing chaos is always an option. you can go bowling, play pool, play darts, get drunk, go to a srip club, get some food, check out the in game internet, and tons more. you could always just surf the channels on your TV.your cell phone is a pivotal part of the game. you can call friends and girlfriends for various activities(some are listed above), and if you neglect them for long enough, they'll call you. you can also call potential employers for jobs.theres the standard \"go kill this guy\" and \"go get this\" but they have been very entertaining anyway so far. theres much more depth to many missions, including stealth. one example is having to steal a cop car, then proceed to pull over different shipping trucks until you find the one full of TV's.gameplay is vastly improved. the cover system is great, allowing you to quickly roll and protect yourself behind random cars, trash cans, and basically anything else thats big enough.the game has a much more realistic feel than previous entries. you'll find yourself making sure theres no cops around before committing crimes. the star system is still here, but this time your wanted level is radius based, and if you can get far enough away from all cops, or at leased out of sight, your wanted level will go down. its honestly genius. i narrowly escaped one by jumping the guard rail and running down a steep hill, only to see another driving my way in the distance. quickly ducking into the alley behind a dumpster, i watched him roll by and waited for my stars to begin to fade. some cars are locked and you'll need to break a window to get in and proceed to hotwire it.-for all you parents out there, the content is more mature than previous entries. you get a pretty good look at the in-car action with the street workers.. hehe.. and \"coarse\" language is used every couple minutes(at leased). the violence and blood looks more realistic now too. thats usually not what you guys worry about so much though.my only real complaints are the hand to hand combat(its the most solid of the series but San Andreas seemed to have more move depth), and the fact that you cant go into more buildings. dont get me wrong, theres TONS of places to go and things to do, but i was hoping for even more. there have been waaay too many things that made San Andreas great and were simply missing here. no car customization, less clothes, less weapons, no property to buy, and more.. in some ways its one step forward and two steps back.i wont elaborate on the story much, as its already been done heavily. basically your an illegal immigrant from eastern europe. your cousin convinced you to come to America with his stories of mansions and sports cars. when you arrive things arent quite as described. you start in the darkest, grittiest part of Liberty City. a pocket full of change and a head full or dreams. what happens next is in your hands..","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2008"}

The game while not open world like Dead Island still gives you vast room and items to use throughout your missions as opposed to the RE franchise where you had only two choices of weapons guns or knives most times even when you were surrounded by items that could used as makeshift weapons. The A.I. can be a pain especially for the survivors in the game,half the time they'll defend themselves pretty well other times they just seem to allow the zombies to have a bite of them and sometimes you're stuck having to go back for a survivor because apparently they don't know what to do unless you hold their hands for them. The boss battles are also insane,some being relatively easy others have you tearing out your hair as you try and land a hit on the boss.The time counter can be annoying sometimes too as you sometimes keep to much focus on that instead of the zombie trying to make a meal out of you. The weapons are interesting on how you use them and what they do but it can get a little repetitive as well when you use a lawnmower ten times with the same results.The graphics show their age,while not horrible you can't help but sometimes feel like you're playing an early generation game from the PS2/Xbox consoles though again expected.  The voice cast are also a hit and miss with the main protagonist doing a 50/50 job in his voice acting performance sometimes the voice acting is good sometimes it's terrible.  I got the game very late and relatively cheap as it was going for $10,so for a alright zombie game here's a good one to try out until the third one is released just don't heap too much expectations onto the game or you will feel some disillusionment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2013"}

Additionally the atmosphere is huge and is free roaming which makes it even better.My only negatives about this game is that you are not able to interact with the surroundings.  Yes you can blow up cars and stuff but it would be better if you could destroy buildings and structures.  Also, while GTA VC & SA expanded on this, you are not able to destroy other cars with your bare hands, the later games expanded an made this an awesome addition.Parents beware the game is rated M and there is sexual content and lots of violence in it, which is why it is rated as such.

It includes 7 main games, unlockable games, and lots of bonus material.Of the 7 games, Mean Bean Machine and Sonic 3D Blast are the duds. One is a tetris/puzzle bobble/tetris attack variation while the other is a pseudo-3D game from an isometric perspective. Its nice to have them for completion purposes, but thats about it. Sonic Spinball is a cool (if hard) pinball variation.The real fun is in the 4 traditional platformers, ranging from Sonic 1 to Sonic and Knuckles. All four stand the test of time very well, with catchy music, tight controls, and colorful graphics. Sonic 3 is probably the weakest, as it's rather short and seems more mean-spirited about where hazards are placed, but its still a fun time. As a side note, the variations of the \"Sonic and Knuckles\" lock-on cart are also included as bonuses.So what's missing? Sonic CD, which is rumoured to be on the next mega collection (the videos are here though). A save function (apart from Sonic 3) would also have been nice. Finally, the PS2 and X-Box editions have the Game Gear Sonic games as bonuses, but these can be found on the Sonic Adventure Director's Cut disc for those interested.

What made COD so great is also found here in this game.You have very intense action, great graphics and sound, and pretty good missions. The action was so intense at times that it almost wasn't fun because you couldn't really enjoy the scenery.I see some reviews talking about how they don't like it because it is scripted. News flash: Every game is scripted. Only the games that are coming out now (though not released yet) like Half Life 2 and Medal of Honor Pacific Assault are not gonna be scripted. As for all other like RTCW, MOHAA, and Doom 3, they are scripted. So don't let that deter you because this games action never stops.My only real complaint is that the SP is too short. You have 13 missions, but no mission last much more than maybe 30 minutes. You have maybe 6 hours of game time here not including the reloading you will have to do when you die. And this game is hard. That is probably why most don't like it. It is hard on every setting.As for MP, it is a little better now. The aiming of the gun for SMG's still sucks, but the maps are better designed and a lot better to play. Some of the new weapons are cool too. They also have a sprint key you can use now to run quickly for a few seconds until you are \"rested\". The new modes aren't anything great, but are still fun. If they would have just fix the aiming, this would be even better.Overall, this expansion pack rocks. If you haven't gotten the origianl COD yet, wait unitl they put both COD and this expansion together and buy it. It will be worth the money. If you have COD, get this expansion.

It has a somewhat deep combat system (not as deep as the Lord of the Rings games)The actuall combat moves arent mapped out like in the lord of the rings games, but different combos of buttons will produce different moves.RotS is a good looking game. Some elements arent particularly great, but it still looks good. The lightsaber animations are phenominal, although the majority of animations arent so hot. The character models are good, the enviroments are ok, some blanness shows here and there, and if there is a big explosion the framerate drops a tad.Now, while it is a good, even above average, game, I have to say it is one of the shortest games I have ever played. On the hardest difficulty, you can beat it in 5 - 6 hours. The levels were probably drug out as much as possible, but they could have added a space fight level, like in the begining of the movie, or levels that dont revolve around just Anakin and Obi-Wan. Like maybe some clone vs. battledroid levels where you play as Mace Windu, or a level where you play as Yoda and you fight Emporer Palpatine. Additions like this would have added serious time to the game, and a bigger fun factor.While the games combat has different fight combos, it isnt forced enough. You can get through the game by hack-n-slashing.Overall, if you are a fan of the movie, you will undoubtably love this great addition.Concept- Make the ultimate Jedi simulatorPresintation- 8.3- The box art is good, the menues are nice and polished, and there is scenes from the movie woven into the game.Graphics- 8.0- Overall, very nice.

I am happy they included the variety in gameplay.-Replayability: I found missions to be interesting enough so I could go back and play them over again.-Online Play: I like free for all mode. Good way to pass time.******************************Cons**************************************-Touch Screen Melee:  Touch screen melee is fun at first but it gets annoying afterwards and hurts the continuity of the heated firefight. Should be just hit triangle and kill the person then hit triangle, swipe on touchscreen then kill the enemy. But it does work well when it comes to interrogation.-Short Campaign: Wish campaign were longer, but unfortunately most first person shooters today have very short campaigns and more emphasis on online play. This game is no different.******************************Conclusion**************************************If you own a vita and like shooter then you should absolutely buy this game. I personally enjoyed it a lot and I still can&#8217;t believe how mindblowing the graphics are.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2014"}

{"product_name":"B0022TNO7I","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Beautifully done, good story, great action and a little buggy","reviewText":"I love FPS with a bit of role playing like Mass Effect, but generally like campaign mode of something like UnCharted, KillZone, COD series, SoCom, or Halo. The different of Max Payne with all those? Dark tales of the underground and brutally animated results from bullets. The latter was more than I care to see to be frank. But I loved the self-talking drunken Max, almost poetic at times!After playing through the campaign mode, I do feel pretty satisfied with the story and action to merit 5 stars, but there was a nagging bug that showed up throughout my play. When hiding behind a beam or wall standing up crouched behind some object, Max would be stuck. Any attempt to shoot, or get out of the position will just result in a slight shake of the character. 99% of the time the only way to end is to quit or get killed and restart from last checkpoint. The 1% of time that Max can get unlocked is when he got shot and get that one chance to hit his target or die. It's now late November of 2012 and I expect this kind of bug to be patched already.I played a little bit of the arcade mode, and it basically select various part of the campaign mode to test my shooting times. If I make it within allotted time for one scene, I get bonus time into the next sequence. It's fun. I haven't started with multiplayer on-line mode yet, and will update when I do. I heard it's a lot of fun.One small gripe on the controls. The focus/shoot on PS3 controller is L2/R2. This is against all convention of FPS on PS3, which is L1/R1. It took me an hour or so of painful adjustment, but I ended up OK. The location of L2/R2 happens to be where shooter games on XBox like Halo is at, so it was a good adjustment to play XBox FPS games. I just hope going back to L1/R2 of other PS3 games won't be a problem!All in all, with the price dropping below retail, it's a nice FPS game to pickup - if you like the dark story with grueling animated bleeding and up-close bullet rips.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYDEQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Joseph Sayre \"Venom Computing\"","summary":"Simply Epic.","reviewText":"Before I begin, this may get wordy, If you're experiencing a severe case of TLDR, head down to the bottom for a quick summary.  I tend to be thorough, and that can be long winded, and I apologize for that. Anyway, on to the review.So what do you get when you cherry pick programmers and artists from turn 10, Bizarre, Codemasters, and other racing studios, sit them down In front of a set of computers and give them Microsoft's Forza Prize winnings to design a game? Forza Horizon. A comprehensive, open world game that is accessible, exceptionally beautiful, delivers in all the fronts it says, and somehow does it with very few drawbacks. I guarantee you, this is the game Test Drive Unlimited WANTED to be. Enough! To the Review!Gameplay:Controls:Controls as you may expect are pretty straightforward. If you've played Forza, they're the same, word for word. If you haven't, the control stick (left) determines direction of the car, A is Handbrake, and the triggers left and right brake and accelerate respectively. It's straightforward and easy to use.Technical:When speaking on the technical aspects of the engine used to make this game, I have to admit this is one of the most STABLE games I've played, Literally ZERO framerate drops, no clipping,In addition, the Complete Forza Physics engine returns, the cars don't feel any different, the assists, like before can be tweaked. With all of them on, the game becomes very accessible, but when all of them are off, the game becomes hard, especially when racing very high powered machines. This game makes no compromises, its arcade on paper, but it's quite sim when you sit down and ask it to be.Menus:I can REALLY tell codemasters exercised their hands here. The menu feels like Grid, Dirt, and all of their other 4 lettered awesome racing games. The menus even so are coherent, deliberate, and very detailed and immersive. (It's odd how a race event becomes a bit more interesting when there is a sweet looking card thingie showing you the event.) The one gripe I have though is that the menu CAN be cumbersome, and I don't like how it has to load a car fully before you can buy it, but all in all, it's a minor whine, and even so, the menu looks and controls great.Cars:Overall, Forza Horizon Brings MUCH less cars to the table than Forza 4 does, but many of the cars in Forza 4 are recent saloons or hatches that aren't rare or impressive, the list brought here contains primarily the best of the best, and is a very refined list for manufacturers. For instance, the Dino for Ferrari does not make an appearance, but the GTO does, the Civic Makes ONE appearance, the Golf though, the Iconic Hot Hatch has multiple appearances. Still, many cars that MAY be your favorites don't appear, but even so, many excellent and Iconic cars do, and I'm SURE more are on the way as DLC. Still, the game is huge and well detailed, and even THIS many cars is a lot, you shouldn't get bored of them and you should have at least one or two favorites available to you.The Festival:To put this easily, the game begins at the start of the Horizon Festival, a Big event at the Core of the world this takes place in, very much so based on the Roads of Colorado in the United States. The festival is a celebration of music, cars and drivers and as such has normal and special events that occur over the course of the game based on your progression. As you continue racing, you'll earn more \"wristbands\" the corresponding color signifying your \"rank\" in the festival. People with a green Wristband have more privileges and can access more races in the festival than Yellow wristband holders do. To earn wristbands, you have to race in the festival events, based on your position, you'll earn more points and work towards the new wristband faster or slower depending on your placing. It's not the most riveting system, but I pushes you along. Obviously as you progress, races get more involved and the stakes get higher, and the ultimate goal is to Knock Darius off his high horse and become the new champion of the festival.The Rest of the World:The world contains a lot of stuff besides the festival, Barn finds which net you old cars for free, but you have to find them, 200+ Discoverable roads to drive on, Racers all over the place to find and challenge. Special Horizon Festival waypoints which have 3 events a piece and can upgrade your car, or be fast travelled to. The world also has 100 breakable upgrade signs, each dropping upgrade costs by 1% for each you find and take out, Colorado also has a fully integrated day and night cycle, with nighttime having illegal street racing to participate in, speed traps for stretches of road and cameras for high speed snapshots for leaderboards,  and Finally, the game has Street Cred, an indefinitely increasable skill point counter that keeps track of just about all the stuff you do, from sideswiping signs, breaking benches and fences, to just barely dodging traffic. Doing this earns you points to reduce your popularity rating from 250 (nobody on the subway) to 1 (the most popular guy in town) and also unlocks challenges which when completed earn you credits, and as you progress up the ranks you get to participate in more and more ridiculous invite only events such as racing planes or helicopters. In short, there is a LOT to do.What's the Same?Well, the driving physics is yanked right out of Forza 4, and its implemented perfectly, rollover returns and the full customization options that forza 4 gave return as well, from swaps to body kits, its all there. Damage is on permanent cosmetic though, which drops a bit of realism for the series, but in a game like this, it's almost necessary to scrap this. Still, it'd have been nice. The driving cockpit is also back; all cars have a full cockpit view. The biggest omission though is tuning, no cars are tweak-able, not even tire pressure. It's a big omission and I'm unsure yet how much of a change this will have in multiplayer.Can I play with other people?Yes, yes you can, though the interface is clunkier than it should be, and you can't go there from the Horizon in game menu and instead the title menu, the online matchmaking works, is fun and its exceptionally well balanced between funky casual stuff to do like infection and actual competitive racing.So how's the game look?The game is exceptionally pretty, with MILES of digital road; gorgeous lighting and super well detailed effects, cars, and feeling of speed. Forza Horizon is a great looking game. Not only that but its SMOOTH, no drops in frame rate at all even as Bugatti Veyron and SS Aero Speeds. I urge you, try the demo to see how it looks. It's exceptional.Summary:All in all, Forza Horizon is an exceptional Racing game that set out to deliver the Forza Driving experience, an Authentic feeling drive, with the virtual reality of being able to go anywhere you want however you want with no consequences. All the while give players the chance to drive their dream cars however they want, the ability to customize and drive them however they wish, and a comprehensive set of events and challenges that are entertaining. It also give you plenty to do, exploration, challenging your friends on and off the track, and In odd, addictive events. It offers the accessibility of an Arcade racer, with the challenge and feel of a Simulator. Not only that but It does all of that at a steady, great, non-dipping Frame rate with excellent visuals,  and though the story is a bit lackluster and the main opponents mostly punk-ish. The game is very solid at what it sets out to do which is create a fun, open world for racers and car lovers to explore and enjoy.It's truly an excellent title. Playground games did an excellent job with this game, lets hope they stick around.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2012"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game.

It had its downfalls (the MAKO and pretty much anything outside the main quest) but it provided a deep and engaging story, set in a universe that felt like STAR WARS mashed up with GEARS OF WAR. For everything it was, it was also just the first chapter.Was the aptly-named MASS EFFECT 2 the EMPIRE STRIKES BACK that Bioware constantly made it out to be?Short answer: Yes, go play this game.PROS:--Once again, if you play a Bioware game, then you play for the STORY. This time around, lead writers Mac Walters and Drew Karpyshyn have outdone themselves. This story is darker than the first, more complex, and actually had a better sense of humor about it. In conjunction to a group of party-members which, in my opinion, rivals the first (thank goodness Garrus made the leap), you've got one of the best video game stories since Bioware's ownDragon Age: Origins.--Almost EVERY GAMEPLAY hang-up that you might have had with the previous game has been wiped out as effectively as the Citadel Council.--Bioware has decided to tear out all of those stereotypical RPG elements that really had no place in this series. There will be no inventory management, as the armor, weapons, and upgrades have been minimized to an ASSASSIN'S CREED II-like load-out back on the Normandy. I was hesitant about this, but I came to enjoy not freaking over a small, overloaded inventory.--All of those pointless and dismal sidequests on those ill-inspired planets from the first game are gone. Mineral discoveries are reduced to a fun little mini-game, and the minerals themselves actually serve a purpose: they pay for your weapon, armor, and party-member upgrades. And should you accept a sidequest (or randomly fall into one) you will be treated to a unique experience every time. One mission involving an ancient spaceship teetering on the edge of a mountain was a high point for me.--The combat is more refined and much easier to use, thanks to an upgraded graphics engine and less emphasis on talent management.--The GRAPHICS are amazing. If you thought those of the first game were nice, prepared to be overwhelmed. Movements are fluid. Facial expressions are very dynamic. Each world you visit is unique and brilliantly realized. The bar has definitely been raised.--The VOICE-ACTING is stellar. Martin Sheen is surprisingly brilliant here, and I dearly hope that he's a recurring character in the future, or in other Bioware games. (Also, it was crazy having Trinity, Jayne, Worf, Six, and Colonel Tigh in the same game >=)--I've been waiting a long time for this. MASS EFFECT 2 is the first game that you can keep playing after you beat it. That means you can go back and finish working on those achievements or sidequests or explore at your leisure.--Again, NO MAKO!CONS:--The ending. If you're not prepared for it, then it could suck. I found the whole building concept of this dangerous end-game mission so intriguing, but even if you make all the necessary precautions like I did, some things might happen (won't say what) that could seriously tarnish the entire experience. Exhilarating as it was, I'm not sure I should be punished like I was for making a small mistake at the end of a 26-hour experience.--The ending was also too abrupt for me. It was like a big middle finger to the gamer that said, \"See you in two years for the resolution.\" Harumph.--For having such great writers for this game, I was astounded at how many family problems I had to resolve for my party-members. Almost every one of them. Whether it was their father, son, daughter, father again, or sister. You go from Commander Shepard, Savior of the Citadel, to family space-counselor.--A large percentage of the sidequests were little loyalty quests, where you run from planet to planet to appease your party-members. Combined with the fact that these often involved settling family disputes, these got repetitive really fast. I only found a few sidequests outside of these. I'm sure there are more, but if there are, they are very hard to find.--I ran out of conversation options for all of my party-members really, really fast. It became annoying to keep getting fed these really pathetic excuses to avoid talking to me. They didn't even have the courtesy to change their excuses. Garrus was making calibrations and Thane was meditating throughout the entire dang game!--The hacking mini-games were inventive at first, but they, too, got repetitive and almost annoying as the hours wore on. I started passing up chances at free credits just so I wouldn't have to open anymore.--Working Drew Karpyshyn into the games official canon was just shameless, lol.CONCLUSION:This game was well worth the two year wait. It showed that Bioware aren't afraid to change up their own formula dramatically, and they did it without making compromises to the story. This really is the EMPIRE STRIKES BACK of the series, and it has made me very excited about the final chapter in this saga.What's disappointing is that we've seen both DRAGON AGE: ORIGINS and MASS EFFECT 2 within months of each other. This means we could be waiting a couple more years to play the next installment of either series. Let us hope this isn't so.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2010"}

If you're like me, you will love this game.Catherine, as they introduce in the very beginning, is a strange tale. Well, it seems normal, aside from the supernatural phenomena.I'll break this down into sections:**Plot & characters: if someone is going to buy this game, they're doing it mostly for the plot. Because it is fantastic. The characters are broad and interact very gracefully with each other (by that I mean that it's clear who works together as friends and more than friends, and their compatibilities always match their relationships). People having these dreams change subtly over time, and people without the dreams do not. Everyone has their stories, and they go extremely in-depth into them--well, as long as you talk to them. Most likely, though, you won't figure out everyone's story until the second play through, at least. Also, what you do greatly affects the story. Not so much during the beginning or middle, but definitely the end. There are 8 endings, and all of them are worth playing the game through 8 times to watch. Trust me.**Graphics: They're interesting, to say the least. Most of the time it is 3D animation (and quite gruesome at some points, might I add), and it's basically decent. It is definitely not something to rave about. However, about 1/4 of the time, the graphics switch to anime style drawing. Those are my favorite scenes because the animation is so cool, it's like watching a Miyazaki movie. And there's one scene where the background is 3D and the characters are anime drawings. That's the best part.**Replay value: Very high, considering you're going to want to see the endings, as well as complete all of the levels with a Gold ranking (doing so unlocks a few other things). It's also difficult to learn everyone else's story on the first time through, so that's another perk. But they don't make it very tedious, because when you complete a level with Gold, you can skip it whenever you get to that level. And Gold is very manageable to achieve.**Difficulty: This one depends. The side puzzles are extraordinarily hard (I couldn't get past the fifth Rapunzel level on my own, and there are 128 of those). This includes Babel, which is another side puzzle, sorta, but unlike Rapunzel it is outside of the game. Babel is hard specifically because there isn't an undo option. These side games are horribly frustrating and really the biggest reason I didn't rate this game 5 stars for fun (not the only reason though). But since they are not a part of the actual story (you don't need to complete them to progress the plot), I didn't give it fewer stars for fun. The puzzles in the game are MUCH easier. I played on Normal the first time, and never lost all of my lives--even though I was trying (and succeeded) for Gold on all of them. I certainly wouldn't call it too easy, though. I had moments of rage and temptation of cracking my controller in half. If you are getting this for the story, the puzzle difficulty is perfect because you will never have to do Babel or Rapunzel. If you are getting this game for completing and getting all of the achievements...well, you had better be very good at puzzles.**Religious references: Yes, this is an extremely Christian game. There are a lot of crosses, and there's even Vincent (main character) hung up on a cross in a painting in the confessional (I'll get to that in a moment), with other sheep at his feet praying to him. Whenever you finish a puzzle, you reach closer to \"heaven\" (they even call it heaven), and when you fall, well, that's you going to hell. After each puzzle, you hit a sort of sanctuary for the sheep, and when you're done there you go into the confessional (and the answers you give also change the ending), and the person asking the questions shoots you up to the next floor. You will also get referred to as a \"lost\" lamb frequently, which just seemed religious to me. None of this bothers me though because they don't mention Christianity, nor do they force the idea of religion upon you at any time.**Random quirks: This game has plenty. Therefore, this will be broken down into subsections-------Cute graphics: there are sheep everywhere. I personally find it adorable. There are even sheep when the narrator is describing things. The text and loading screens and everything is specifically color-coordinated and theme oriented. It gives a sort of whimsy to the feel of the game.-----Other people: you can meet people, talk to them, change their futures, learn their stories, change your own future, help them or hurt them. Now I know this isn't very \"quirky\" because plenty of games have done this. But this game somehow makes it feel unique. Maybe because the game is so small and their stories are so deep. You basically have the opportunity to learn everything about them. Not to mention, there's texting in this game, which can also affect the ending of the story.-----Facts, quotes, and the loading screen: I had to say this, because it is awesome. Whenever you finish a drink at the bar, the narrator will tell you a fascinating fact about what you just drank. By the end of the game you will know a lot more about the alcohols, or at least I do. There are two different loading screens in this game--the ticking clock, and the quotes screen. The clock one starts out being quite annoying but it is easily adjusted to. The quotes loading screen is really cool because they say a quote (and trust me, they have plenty in their repertoire to keep it interesting) from either someone well known (Dante, Shakespeare) or someone not so well known. A couple are recognizable but most are not. They are all about men, women, and relationships--some are riotous, and others are insightful. Either way, they're a very good way to distract a player from the fact that they're anxiously awaiting their next scene to load.-----The \"Golden Playhouse\": the beginning of this game makes it very clear that the creators of this game are trying to make it resemble a movie, as if you're watching it from a theater. It's endearing (for some reason), and it feels a bit more cozy for doing such. It's not a big part of the game, but it makes it start out well.Overall:Pros: Great story, very good replay value, can be played casually for people interested in the story more, or intensely for people looking for a challenge. Amazing characters, cool graphics, and extremely deep, intricate stories. Very quirky game with a lot of trivia and quotes that make it even more memorable.Cons: The puzzles can feel a bit repetitive (however this might be a blessing, since then at least you'll know how to solve it), especially outside of the story. I hate Rapunzel (even though they gave that a deep story, too) and Babel with a passion, but thankfully I'm very content playing just for the story. The loading screens suck at first, trust me, but as the puzzles get more challenging, the breaks are a welcomed relief (because they usually come after you complete a level--I suppose this can be classified as conditioning), they also become a time to ponder the scene you just witnessed (once again, there are some pretty intense stories). Also, for people who care, the religious references might be a turn off. I don't care, because they really aren't overpowering in a bad way. They aren't in a good way either, but it's more like they're sorta there, and you can analyze them as you please.All in all, get the game if you love a good story. Don't get it if you get frustrated easily, are terrible at puzzles, and want to get all of the achievements. Because unless you want to waste too many hours to count figuring out all of Rapunzel on your own (Babel is entirely random, so there's no way you can look it up on youtube. I tried that already), you will not be getting the last few achievements.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00004U55E","description":"It's been nearly 10 years sinceWolfenstein 3Dforever  popularized the first-person shooter, and at long last everyone's favorite Nazi  killer, B.J. Blazkowicz, is back inReturn to Castle Wolfenstein. Set  during World War II,Return to Castle Wolfensteinfinds the Nazis  dabbling in the black arts in an effort to create an army of supersoldiers.  Naturally, Blazkowicz is the only thing standing in the Nazis' way, so he's set  behind enemy lines in an effort to end the madness.On the surface, the single-player game seems like pure gold--after all, everyone  loves killing Nazis. But the story jumps all over the place, the enemy AI is  less than impressive, and most gamers will be able to finish the game in a mere  10 to 15 hours. The single-player game falls short of the standards set by  titles such asHalf-LifeandNo One Lives Forever.In fact, the best thing aboutReturn to Castle Wolfensteinis its  team-based multiplayer mode. Each multiplayer adventure features Axis vs. Allies, and  both sides offer four character classes: engineer (removes obstacles), medic  (heals and revives teammates), lieutenant (calls in air strikes and replenishes  ammo), and soldier (only class able to use sniper rifles, flamethrowers, and  other unusual weapons). The game includes only eight multiplayer maps, but they  are all perfectly designed, and in order to be successful teams have to work  together. The result is a great gaming experience that fans ofCounter-Strikeor the Day of Defeat mode forHalf-Lifewill really  appreciate.Graphically,Return to Castle Wolfensteinlooks amazing. It uses the  powerfulQuake IIIengine to great effect, and the character models,  explosions, and lighting effects are all perfectly done. Alas, pretty graphics  and a great multiplayer game don't quite make up for an exceptionally average  single-player experience.--William HarmsPros:Amazing graphicsGreat level design (including secret passages)Awesome multiplayer modeCons:Lackluster AISingle-player game is very short","reviewerName":"Derek G","summary":"Worth the (expensive) price - single or multiplayer","reviewText":"(...)In any case, I can comment (objectively) on the game because I have played it and I can say without a doubt that it's worth buying.  Some of us can remember back to the Wolfenstein 3D which later led to Doom which revolutionized the shareware concept and finally brought the PC to a viable gaming platform.  Of course, some of us can remember all the way back to the original Castle Wolfenstein of the Apple IIc days, but lets not go there...Anyways, gamers have waited long and hard for the chance to battle nazis once again and this game delivers.  Castles are rendered in very nice detail on my Geforce, it almost starts to smell cold and musty in here (maybe that's me).  The cutscenes are also well done and provide a nice prologue to each mission.  The game's intro you'll probably only watch once or twice but it's one of the coolest ever!  The music is very atmospheric and spooky, reminiscent of Quake.  Whoever said the game crashes all the time must have a bad system or be using XP.  Anyone who has \"downgraded\" to XP should've realized that nothing's gonna run on XP for a year (you think people would've learned after Windows 95.)  In any case, I run the game on my non-XP system without problems.Who cares about all that, right?  It's the gameplay you want to hear about.  Again, this game delivers.  You start off as expected battling those evil nazi's as you escape Wolfenstein.  From there the game gets progressively creepier as you dive deep into the catacombs and discover both you and the nazis are fighting off terrors even more disturbing.  (...)Without spoiling too much, you find out the dead start coming to life and lemme tell ya, these buggers are tough to beat.  Ammo starts becoming a serious issue.  Not to mention some of the demons have shields that reflect the bullets back at you.  Once you meet the fire demon - that alone is worth the price of admission.Many of the zombies are just thick-skinned clods that are tough to kill, but don't think the enemies have bad AI.  One of the head nazi's, Helga, is protected by an elite corp of women who can dodge, roll and even double team against you.  Toss a grenade at em?  They'll just kick it back at you (and they'll usually wait until just before it's ready to blow up too.)  Very quick and very tough.  Not to mention, the first time I snuck up behind one of Helga's elite guards, I had to stop and admire the \"artwork\".Last but not least, the game borrows a page from the success of No One Lives Forever (another great game) by allowing the player to sneak up on the enemy and listen to their conversations.  It's also interesting to run into the occasions the nazis are too busy battling demons to worry about attacking you.  This is probably the first game that has made me jump since Doom came out.  The surprise factor is used a little excessively in my opinion, but you'll definitely get a few scares.Multiplayer is quick and responsive on a cable modem.  I, of course, get pounded on mercilessly by the thousands of kids who are much better than I.  The new interesting addition is the formation of team assaults where each member has a special ability (Lieutenants can call in airstrikes, medics can heal players, engineers can set dynamite, etc...).  I find this difficult when joining existing games where I don't know any of the other members, but I figure people will soon be forming clans, similar to Mechwarrior, to exploit the advantages team based assaults can provide.  No idea yet on invincibility hacks or other cheats, I get beat so bad it seems like they're all invincible to me.So there you go.  I was worried the emphasis would be on multiplayer and the single player game would be lacking, but that is not the case.  If you are into multiplayer battles, then you probably already have a copy of this game by now.Hope the review helped!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2001"}

It's a handheld game.  By default that makes it's hardcore gaming potential limited.  To most people anyway.  For most, handheld gaming is just a diversion.  Something to pass the time while on a flight or while waiting to get to grandmas house.  In this the DS is all over the PSP.  Yes for teenagers a PSP will be a status symbol.  \"My parents loved me enough to fork out $250 bucks on me!\"  To adults it will also be so.  \"I got so much cash I can blow $250 bucks on a handheld gaming system!\"  For someone that actually wants to fire up a portable gaming experience the DS owner will be the happiest.  The DS player will have 12 or more hours of play time without needing its battery charged.  The PSP?  Not even close.  In fact I have heard that a 2 hour movie saps most of its battery life.  Alot of that due to the 20 minute loading times.  Boy!  That sounds like fun!  The DS loads up in about 8 seconds.  The DS itself has a library of nearly 100 games to the PSPs 30 (14 are old ports!).  When you add to it almost 1000 gameboy advance titles you are looking at enough games to appeal to just about anyones taste.  Duribility!  The PSP does not have any protection for its screen while the DS folds neatly into a nice pocketsized package.  The touchscreen was to me the most insignificant part of the DS system when I got mine.  I assumed it to be just a gimmick.  Turns out it actually adds alot to gameplay.  In fact in games like Warioware Touched it makes the game.  Wireless.  DS has come out with wireless internet play.  Not only that, it's free.  The bottomline comes down to what you like.  If you like a variety of games.  If you like a proven company that knows what the handheld community needs.  If you like value for your money.  If you want a system that is gonna stand up to the rigors of portability.  The DS is for you.

It reminded me of a crysis 1 or 2 nano suit. (or the Vanquish suit if you have ever played that game, its fun and challenging to). It can be quite difficult at times depending on how you approach the missions. You can go in guns blazing but that can be quite difficult to win with. There is also stealth which is fun but time consuming to. There are little hacking mini games as well and the boss fights are okay (sometimes pretty challenging). The worlds you see can be explored but there isn't to much here or there to get other then keys, ammo, health and sometimes guns. The world looks cool at times but you can start to get tired of the yellow and gold look of some buildings and signs. Sometimes I would get stuck quite a few times when I would play the missions stealthy. Sometimes I would follow a LP of the game and think to myself  &#34;how would you have known to do that?&#34; or &#34;wow you would have to be really great at timing to get away with some of these things.&#34; The world isn't to big at times when you go exploring most of the time your stuck on a few streets to explore and in missions mostly always stuck in big buildings you have to make your way around.

I'm in the unusual position of having played this game right after finishing up Ninja Gaiden II. I'm afraid that may have made the problems with this game shine even more for me. First off is the combat. It's not bad but it's not great either. Everything felt bogged down and slow. Many things I would make my character do felt delayed. For action games like this you need complete control and I never felt like I had it in this game. The camera was also really bad. I could deal if there were an easier way of positioning it but when you move the camera yourself with the thumb stick it moves really slow (like the rest of the combat). There's a way to snap the camera to the player's back instantly which is great except that you have to click the left thumb stick to do it. Too often I'm running around and if I click the thumb stick the camera snaps to my back and immediately moves the direction I'm running so it's still not centered on my back. I found it better to start throwing force pushes and lightning in the opposite direction I couldn't see and hope I'd get lucky before trying to move the camera. The lock-on feature sucks but that's okay with me because if developers make these games right you won't need one anyway. The engine also seemed glitchy. There were plenty of times where I'd hang in the air. Sometimes the frame rate would drop and things would get choppy (although that didn't happen that much). Also, I know it's a Star Wars game and you don't want blood but give me something that helps me realize when I'm hitting something. Especially the bigger enemies. Give me some particle effects or SOMETHING. Half the time it doesn't look like you're hitting anything at all in this game. It's also difficult to distinguish when something is hitting you as well. There were plenty of times where I felt I was doing good and all of the sudden I died. Only then do I realize \"Wow I was getting hit by something the whole time\". This is offset by the feature of getting health back for every kill which is a must have for this game. You wouldn't need that feature if the combat elements were polished enough that a player could keep from getting hit provided he was skillful enough. Screw it, I'm just gonna post the pros and cons. If you are a big fan of Star Wars, I'd add one more star to my rating and that's probably the extent you'll enjoy this game.Pros:Force Powers are fun to play withStory is a decent tie in to the moviesCons:Combat is slow and repetitiveControls are iffy and slow to respondGame is short with little reason to play again","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2009"}

I very much enjoyed the voice acting, the explosions and the game play.I took a star off, however, because some of the controls are just wonky. For example, you can climb ropes manually or you can climb them by using the back touchpad, but if you are climbing UP the rope, you have to scroll your finger downward on the touchpad. Another issue was climbing in general, since the game says that you can trace out a path with your finger on the front touchpad. It would work and then there would be some ledges and sections that Drake wouldn't jump to no matter what I did. I don't think it's the handhelds fault; it had more to do with the game.Still it was a very enjoyable experience~! I loved finding all those hidden treasures and getting trophies for everything! I'll probably play through the game again, just to get more of the secret items that I missed in the first play-through.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"Jessie Scott","summary":"A Perfect Crime Saga and So Much More - An In Depth Review","reviewText":"**UPDATE**: The online is still being fixed and there are still frustrations, but I can finally provide insight into playing (not-so-nice) with others.From the time I've started this game till now, I have enjoyed every single second of my journey.  This is easily the game of the year, if not the decade.  It is stunning graphically, pushing the PS3 to it's limits, and the world is seamless.  If Rockstar never made another Grand Theft Auto, this could easily be the Magnum Opus of the series.**SUMMARY**Graphics: 5/5 - The game looks gorgeous.  Rockstar truly captured the feel of Southern California and made each location look unique and believable.  Cars, characters, waves, the city; it's truly amazing.Audio: 5/5 - Every sound helps make the city feel alive.  From the sound of foot steps to the hum of an engine, the acting and the audio is top notch.Gameplay: 5/5 - The improvements are immediately noticeable.  Any issues with previous iterations of Grand Theft Auto should be satisfied; the controls are tight and everything feels fluid and seamless.  It's a joy to drive, run, shoot, and travel around Los Santos.  Those with gripes about GTA IV: this plays and feels much better, cars handle much better.  You will not be disappointed.Story: 5/5 - One word - incredible.  Since the moment I turned the game on I was engrossed with each character and wanting to find out what happens next to our intrepid anti-heroes/criminal upstarts.  This is a crime saga that will not disappoint and the characters help to give the story depth and meaning.  The only real drawback is that the story moves fast and is over quickly.Online: 3/5 - Online is fantastic and fun, but there are some major frustrations too.  Other players will mercilessly hunt you down and kill you - over and over again.  You lose money each time you die, and players have become creative to bypass certain things like Passive Mode.  When you do find a group of players who aren't simply looking to cause mayhem and grief, the missions range from fun to extremely frustrating.  The ability to free roam with up to 16 other players is great, but Rockstar needs to make some changes in order to give the online portion long-term success.Overall: 5/5 - This is the game to own, regardless of what system you have.  With limitless replayability, a vast, realistic world to explore, so many things to do, and a AAA story, this belongs in the library of every gamer who does not mind an adult story and content.  If you enjoyed the other GTA titles, or you enjoy the action and gripping story of games like Uncharted, Assassin's Creed and/or Red Dead Redemption then get this game.**IN-DEPTH REVIEW**Beginning:When starting on the PS3 for the first time, expect a 10 to 15 minute install; story mode takes another 5 minutes to load.  Once that is through, the game thrusts you into a heist as you learn the basic controls, most of which feel similar to GTA IV.  You are also shown a new gameplay mechanic -- switching characters on the fly.  To do this, press and hold the down d-pad button, then with the right stick select the character in the wheel that pops up you want to control.  After the introduction, there are some cutscenes as the player is shown a little bit of Los Santos.  Once the scene is over, the player is left with a mission for Franklin.  Finish the mission, and the world is yours to explore.Story:Welcome to Los Santos, with all the glitz and glamor you've come to expect, but corruption and crime runs rampant under the surface.  Our -ahem- heroes are Michael, a retired bank robber; Franklin, a repo man trying to do right and make his way up in the world; and Trevor, an unhinged, unpredictable maniac who used to run robberies with Michael.  Michael is living the rich life with his dysfunctional family.  Trevor is running repo jobs with his friend for a shady car salesman.  Trevor is living in trailer park and causing mayhem trying to make some money.  Each character is distinct, unique and and extremely interesting.  You'll want to spend time with all three.  The dialogue is well written and I found myself waiting to finish a mission or move into the highlighted spot until the characters were finished talking so I didn't miss anything.Gameplay:There are numerous improvements and upgrades to the classic Grand Theft Auto, all of which help makes a satisfying experience:If you fail a section of a mission 3 times, can fast forward to next checkpoint - but don't have to.  If there was a frustrating aspect, like having to place first in a race to advance the story, now you can skip the frustration and move the story along; you can go back and finish it later, or not at all.Special Abilities and Character Switching:Each character has a special ability used by pressing L3 + R3.  As Michael, you can slow down time while shooting.  Franklin can slow down time while driving and gain extremely improved maneuverability (my favorite!).  Trevor can go into a rage reducing damage he takes, delivering more damage to enemies, and has a special melee attack.  The new mechanic of switching characters on the fly adds new gameplay possibilities, and lets you experience each character's unique perspective during heists.  This allows you to be flexible in approach, and when things turn sour, use quick thinking and reflexes to make it out alive utilizing each characters skills.  When not actively engaged in a criminal plot, switching the character zooms out on one, and then refocuses over the other character and zooms in.  The character is often just finished with something as you take control; for instance at one point Franklin was leaving a Strip Club and I switched to Trevor once to find him being thrown out of a women's clothing store, with a dress on, complaining about wanting to try it before he buys it.  These little things help to make each character feel alive and like they are all engaged in their own schedules when you're not playing them.Abilities:Performing certain actions improves your abilities.  These abilities include driving, shooting, flying, lung capacity and a few others.  When improved, the character has better aim, can run longer, or better driving skills.  Leveling each skill requires the player to perform specific actions, for instance, to get better at driving hit top speeds, have near misses and pop wheelies on motorcycles.  To increase each character's special ability, keep using it.  To get better with guns, either get head shots or head down to the firing range.  The different activities around Los Santos can help increase the skills.Shooting:Shooting is easy to do as well, and the targeting system can be customized.  A player can choose traditional GTA style shooting, assisted aim, and free aim.  Enemies can be quickly switched between by flicking the R stick.  I have mine set to traditional GTA, where I hit L2 to aim and it snaps to a target for a few seconds before going to free aim.  Holding L1 slows down time and brings up the weapon wheel: press the R stick to select a weapon, press the right or left d-pad button to change to a different type of weapon (for instance selecting to use a knife instead of fists).  Guns also can be customized once purchased and fitted with flashlights, larger magazines, and silencers.  The variety of weapons is quite large.Random missions are scattered around the map, which appear as question marks (?).  These generally have story elements tied to them and help flesh out the characters and the world.  There are also blue/red blips that will randomly appear and you can choose to participate by getting close.  One random blip early on had me help two morons robbing a store get away and one of them told me to call them if I ever need muscle.  You may encounter the same random event more than once, but there is a nice variety.  Purse snatching seems to be pretty common.Size and Activities:Los Santos is BIG.  Open the map in your game case if you have a physical copy.  One side shows the big city close up, with the other showing the whole area.  Once in game, looking at that map and zooming in, it was nearly overwhelming to see just how large the world is.  Better yet, there are no barriers.  You want to visit the mountains after the first mission?  Go ahead.  There is so much to do in Los Santos too.  Visit the strip club (WARNING: unlike Liberty City, Los Santos is a fully topless region), golf, tennis, movies, tv, etc.  You can shop to buy each character new outfits or visit a barber to give them a new look.  Suspend your disbelief as a beardless character can order up facial hair for a few bucks.  Invest in the Real Estate business and buy yourself an income property.  Play the stock market, and keep an ear on the fluctuations in game.  Some missions may have an affect on stock prices as well.  Take your dirt bike off road and explore the wilderness.Driving:Driving can still be a pain sometimes, but the mechanics have been vastly improved over the last Grand Theft Auto.  Top speeds in some vehicles are quite impressive, while driving large trucks is often very slow, but once at max speed it's hard to stop them.  Each vehicle handles differently, so you may want to experiment until you find one you like.  Pressing O locks on a target for a mission and it time is slightly slowed down to make maneuvering through traffic somewhat easier.  Couple that with Franklin's ability to slow down time while driving and it makes chases fun and exciting.  You'll be shouting with joy as you miss close calls and easily make that turn the biker just nailed at 90 degrees.  There is Cinematic Camera during some missions that allows you to actual enjoy the action that's going on without having to worry about crashing the car, dealing with traffic, look where you're going, etc.  It's easier to switch between the two modes with O.  When the action heats back up, switch the camera and jump straight in.Car Customization is in-depth with 15+ different categories that can be improved or changed.  Some categories have sub-categories as well, like choosing different color patterns such as metallic, matte, etc.  Some are cosmetic, but many have other benefits as well, like protective armor or better handling.  Car aficionados will enjoy tinkering every detail on their car.Missions:Missions are filled with great banter and are a lot of fun.  While difficult, they are still accessible for even casual gamers.  At the end of each mission there is a score based on what actions were completed, such as not receiving a single scratch on a vehicle for instance.  This score can range from 0% (though I've always gotten around 50% so far) to 100% for doing each action.  Missions can be replayed at any time, so don't feel the need to hit the 100% mark the first time through.  In fact, I'd recommend not worrying about achieving 100% and just enjoy the atmosphere and story and come back to it later.Heists:Heists are extremely enjoyable and you get your first taste in the introduction.  These are in-depth, multiple part missions that let you case the place you're going to rob, select a crew, and determine how you want to approach the robbery and get away with a lot of money.  Each crew member has pros and cons, those with less developed skills may take more time to break into a place, but ask for a smaller cut.  Likewise, the higher skilled, higher cut crew members could always break in quicker and allow for a bigger payout.  During the mission, you can switch between characters as desired to see from their perspective, or to help one of the other guys out of a jam.  Have Franklin run in and when he gets into a jam, switch to Michael to provide cover fire and support.  After the guys retrieve their score, switch to Franklin to land the helicopter and make their get away.Rockstar goes outside the game to have an application and website that affects the game, iFruit and LifeInvader (their version of iPhone and Facebook).  You can use iFruit to train and improve Chop, a dog that Franklin ends up with.  Use LifeInvader to get discounts in game by clicking on the links when logged in and associated with your Social Club account.Audio:Phenomenal job.  Every sound breathes life and atmosphere into the game, whether you're listening to the high quality radio stations or enjoying a stroll downtown.  A woman walked by on the sidewalk in high heels - I could every \"clack clack clack\" as she strutted by.  I'm playing with a basic stereo set up, so I'm sure it sounds even more vibrant and alive in a full surround mode.  The voice actors do a fantastic job bringing the characters to life.  I have no complaints here.Graphics:It looks like Grand Theft Auto, but better.  The structure design and layout is what you'd expect from a GTA, but the textures have been vastly improved.  Little details have been added to the world to make it feel more alive, I was noticing drains in the street and small potted plants.  These small additions might not seem much, but added up together really enhance the world.  I found myself looking at distant building with lights on during the night, or admiring the foliage as I drove down towards the beach.  Random NPCs walking around are a bit less detailed than main characters, but have a great variety of different models/looks.  The vehicles look better than ever too.  Random weather (slow down time with Franklin's special ability during a thunderstorm, it's pretty awesome), night and day cycles, lights with the right amount of bloom to look believe - it all helps to pull you into Los Santos.  Some of the textures are noticeably low resolution when close up, but thankfully the action is often to frantic and fast paced you won't have time to stare.  Also, I have not noticed any lag or hiccups while traversing the world.**ONLINE**You start by creating a player.  Choosing the grand parents from a set list influences the looks of your parents which will in turn influence your appearance.  You cannot make strange looking freaks ala Saints Row.  Once out of creation, you pick your skills by allocating what you do in a 24 hour day, in half hour increments.  These will decide your starting statistics which you increase like in the single player game, by using them.  They advance slowly however, so don't expect to max out the skills in a day.Once done with basic tutorial mode, you're free to roam around Los Santos stealing, robbing, and killing.  There are blue circles and indicators on the map where you can play missions, death matches, races, parachuting, and other activities like tennis.  You can kill other players you meet as well, though doing so might result in each of you chasing each other down endlessly for no other purpose than to \"get back at them\" - do so at your own risk.  And indeed, there is risk...Dying online reduces the amount of money you've accrued by a certain %.  This amount caps off at $2000, but that is still a big chunk and can fall quickly when caught in a griefing session another player or players.  Passive mode doesn't work exactly as intended either.  While players can't shoot you, stab you, or other weapon related activities, they can run you over and will.  This is frustrating, especially when you spawn nearby and they're ready to run you down again.Different types of activities scattered across Los Santos.  Take part in custom races (bikes, cars, boat), custom death matches (teams, free for all), survival (10 waves of enemies), and missions (objective and co-operative).  Races, parachuting, survival, and some co-op missions can be done solo.  You can earn money doing survival and co-op missions solo, but not for the races/etc.  You can rob stores by pointing a gun at the clerk (if you have a headset, yell into the mic for a fun surprise!).  Buy clothes at the different stores and make your online criminal persona a unique snowflake.There are a lot of little nuances as well, a staggering amount really.  You can charitably give money from your bank account to other players, drop a gun or ammo for another player, split money from a recent robbery/activity (or not and get hunted down by pissed off partners), put bounties on players so they are mercilessly hunted down, text other players in game, etc.  You can put a tracking device on your car so you can locate it easily, and buy insurance to recover it for a small fee if destroyed.  You can customize your ride at a Los Santos Customs garage.  You can also buy property: garages to store your vehicles are the cheapest, and apartments to relax or lay low in which also features more car space.  You can allow certain people to utilize your vehicle (like friends, crew, everyone or no one) and can determine who you want to hear you if you have a mic (same options).Doing jobs and taking part in activities earns a player Reputation Points (RP) which is like experience points.  When you reach a new rank, you unlock customization - new hairstyles, clothes, weapons, weapon parts, tattoos, car customization, etc.  The higher the rank, the more options available.  Higher ranks also allow players to take place in more missions and earn new contacts.  Some contacts offer invaluable services.  For instance, at Rank 10 you receive Lester as a contact and he allows you place bounties on other players.One minor note: I don't think the Stealth skill helps you against other players in the Free Roam mode.  It may assist in death matches (your blip not appearing unless you make loud sounds like firing a gun or running).  So in Free Roam, I would not be concerned with slinking around other players.  Still useful to hide from the cops though.--Rockstar is still working the kinks out and listening to player's feedback.  Some of the gripes/issues with multiplayer MAY OR MAY NOT be addressed in the future.  As of right now, this is how it was intended originally and what it's like.--**PARENTS PLEASE NOTE - THIS IS -NOT- A GAME FOR KIDS.  THERE IS EXCESSIVE CURSING, VIOLENCE, NUDITY, AND ADULT THEMES!  PLEASE READ THE LABEL AND UNDERSTAND THIS IS A MATURE GAME MEANT FOR THOSE OVER THE AGE OF 17.  PLEASE BE RESPONSIBLE WHEN HELPING TO SELECT A GAME FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN.**If you have any questions, or feel that I've left anything out, please leave a comment!

I got this game at a used store for $25.00 it was not sealed but the disc and manual were in an original Wii case. The Manuel was perfect and the disc was too so was the case.  This game is for the whole family to play and it's just awesome to play. What I love about it is the race tracks. Some of them come from Mario Kart 64 the first classic to come out on N64 and some of them come from Mario Kart Double Dash which was released on the Gamecube. The race tracks themselves are similar to their original some of them from what I remember were actually all original and had very few tweaks to them. Since some of the tracks that are similar to the N64 are tweaked since it would have looked awfully weird had Nintendo used a track from the first original game and made no tweaks besides the Wii is a highly more advanced piece of technology then the Nintendo 64. Where as if one were to take a track from the Gamecube then it would be more likely to be compatible because the Wii and the Gamecube graphics for a Nintendo game look very similar.

{"product_name":"B00000J2W7","reviewerName":"Carlos Santiago","summary":"Fun for all ages","reviewText":"I bought a used version of this cartridge after seeing my 3-year old son being hooked with it during a visit to my sister's.You have 8 characters to choose from with 4 additional hidden characters you can release after succeeding in various playing modes at specific difficulty levels.  Each character has its own set of special moves, sounds and taunts.The purpose of the game is to use your character skills and moves to knock off your opponent from the hovering playing field.  Damage to you or to your opponent builds up as you hit him/her.  Some punches or moves give more damage than others and as the damaged builds up, the character turns more vulnerable to being knocked off.There are a few moves that only give damage and other moves are used to specifically knock off your opponent.  This means that you cannot just push buttons at random, it requires a lot of patience and some reflexes to defeat your adversary consistently.The game is extremely simple to learn, yet there are quite a large amount of special moves to master.  You will definitely require all those special moves when playing the most advanced levels or when facing more skilled human opponents.I kind of sticked with Mario when playing, for me it is the most well-rounded character, although I'm sure  that some of the hidden characters are quite versatile as well.I found out that this game can be handicap adjusted, making it fun and fair for all ages and skill levels.This game is definitely more fun in a multi-player scenario, but it is also extremely fun using the computer as an opponent.  You can play a free-for-all match (everyone against everyone) with up to 3 computer (or human) controlled characters, having each one the same or their own unique skill levels.  There is also a Team-Battle, where you team up with a computer or a human to face another human/computer team.One small thing I did noticed was some slow control response in some instances, especially when playing the harder levels; it requires a little patience getting used to it.This game is very easy to learn, extremely addictive, colorful, fun, challenging and funny.  It has dozens of playing options and many cool sounds. It is quite entertaining with lots of clean fun for the whole family.5 stars and 100% recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2001"}
{"product_name":"B00000J2W7","reviewerName":"potato_salad \"Marqus\"","summary":"Why can't we be friends?","reviewText":"I convinced my cousin to rent this game back when it first came out because we were crazy about pokemon and I loved the commercial for it.When we first played it, it was hard. The controls were hard and there were too many moves to remember. But once you get around the learning curve, which only took a day or 2, the game is a great ride.The thing about the game is that it has everybody's favorite Nintendo characters in one game. It doesn't even skip on the moves. You can throw Link's boomerang, Samus Aran's morphing ball bombs, Mario's fireballs, Jigglypuff's sing, and many other characters moves. The graphics for the game were excellent at the time and still look better than any N64 game except Mario 64.Not only do you have every characters special moves is that almost everybody has their own level and music from their game. You can fight on a Pokemon Center, the Great Fox, Brinstar Depths, or in Dreamland to name a few levels. The only characters that don't have their own level or share one with another character are Ness, Captain Falcon, Jigglypuff, and Luigi. It also has weapons from each characters game. The Bo-ombs, Ray Guns, Poke Balls, Hammers, and others. If you don't like items then you can turn them off which is another cool feature.Another thing about the game is that you have to unlock half of it. You have to beat the game with everyone which makes you appreciate each character's strength and weaknesses. Yoshi doesn't have a triple jump so you have to play to that weakness while Kirby has about 7 jumps which a strength. You have to learn to take advantage of your enemies weaknesses. If you see Samus charging up be ready to reflect it back with Fox.The best thing about this game is that you have to unlock half the things yourself. You have to unlock characters and levels. It is fun, especially since the single-player is great fun.What do you do after you unlock everything? Play multiplayer mode of course which is the best part of the game.

Firstly, it is downright terrifying. Even in a room full of people, this game is still fear-inducing. The camera angles and general character control can feel a bit manic at times, which almost seems like a problem until you actually begin taking monsters out. Then you realize it was all just a clever design trick meant to freak you out as much as is possible. And the game will do exactly that. The story is great, as are the graphics, voicing, melee, shooting etc. This is Resident Evil 4 on steroids. If you're looking for scares and a great survival shooter, then look no further. Dead Space 2 is the game you've been waiting for.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2011"}

It kinda does, and it has a few other changes thrown in to boot.D-pad: better, but still not great.  It's a true cross design (well switchable from the standard pad to a cross), and it's also a bit more precise.  It falls short of other solutions, but is a noticeable step up from the usual 360 design.ABXY buttons: monochrome, which doesn't seem to make much of a difference for me, a 360 veteran, but may be problematic for newer users.  It does look sharp.Analog sticks: slightly different texture.  I hardly noticed, but others prefer this smoother design.All in all a solid effort.  I'd like to either see this to become the standard controller, or be more of an upgrade.  More robust switches, more solid feel, or even a more customization design would all help this be more of an upgrade.  As it is, it's something to consider if you need to add/replace a controller, but I don't feel it's a worthy upgrade.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00004SWL9","description":"Just when it seems 3-D fighting games have permanently made 2-D fighting  games obsolete, something likeMarvel vs. Capcom 2comes along and proves  just how deep and fun 2-D fighters can be. It's better than its predecessor in  every way, and arguably the best 2-D fighting game to grace the Dreamcast.The amount of playable characters is enough to put any fighting fan's salivary  glands in overdrive. Beginning with favorites such as Spider Man, Wolverine,  Ryu, and Chun Li, players can eventually unlock 56 characters. We had our hands  full just mastering a few of these fighters, and getting familiar with all 56  would take months of intense practice. There are almost too many moves, all  depicted with superb animation and augmented by several tag-team combos. When  the match begins, you can pick three characters. Once things heat up, you can  call in your pals to unleash a massive move on your opponent. This adds  immensely to the game's depth, and button mashers will be in for a shock when  they find that their mistimed tag-team moves backfire.Visually, this game is intense. The large characters are slightly jagged around  the edges, but that's more than compensated for by the massive amount of  animation frames, colorful special effects, and stunning 3-D backgrounds that  are loaded with detail.Marvel vs. Capcom 2also delivers a sonic  performance that is nearly arcade-perfect. This is a must-buy for any fighting  fan, especially those who have a couple of buddies to bash. Just be prepared to  put in a lot of time in practice mode if you want to get good.--T.

I object to the removal of medium  attacks, even though it does make it easier to play on the awkward  dreamcast controller.  Some characters suffer more than others from it (a  few have completely lost their ability to execute their launching move on  command), while others seem to benefit from it (Jin gets chain combos out  of the deal).  I can't deny that this game is a lot of fun once you adjust  to the new control style, but it still has problems.  No personalized  endings, gameplay which encourages cheapness over strategy, and pixelated  characters will likely dissapoint hardcore fans.  Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 does  include every character from every other Vs. game, and more, which raises  the fighter roster to an amazing 56 characters.  The bottom line is: If you  want quality, play X-men Vs. Street Fighter or Marvel Vs. Capcom.  If you  want quantity, play Marvel Vs. Capcom 2.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2000"}

{"product_name":"B00007B77T","description":"We could talk about theSerious Sambackstory, but that would be missing the point, namely to commit carnage on a galactic scale. The smooth engine, multiplayer options, and fast pace make this game a solid choice for fans of first-person shooters.The interface uses the tried-and-true Xbox formula for shooters: the left thumbstick controls movement and the right thumbstick controls the angle of view. The extensive arsenal is something special though, with each weapon possessing a different efficiency so you have to find the perfect weapon quickly for each situation. For instance, the shotgun is a great weapon for up-close fighting among a crowd of enemies, but it's horrible at a distance or when you're stuck in the middle of a melee. The enemy list is also quite extensive. You will be fired upon, stepped on, stabbed, slashed, and electrocuted. Enemies will appear by land, air, and water.What makes this game stand out and keep you interested, though, is its irreverent, offbeat sense of humor. Serious Sam makes outlandish comments throughout the game, rides cosmic surfboards between scenes, saves progress at Dr. Who-like telephone booths, and pays homage to the Indiana Jones theme song. And you can change the blood splatters between red, green, and hippy (flowers and fruit). Our only major complaint is level design. Even when you believe you've cleared a room, enemies can pop out of midair and injure you. By not allowing you to seal yourself off from the onrushing masses in appropriate spaces, a major strategic element has been missed.--Eric Franklin","reviewerName":"Dr. Freeman","summary":"Not Too Serious","reviewText":"Now heres one that has lots of shooting and not too much else but hey, isnt that why we like shooters?

Kingdoms of Amalur is a good game. Its art style is similar to Fable with more of a deeper RPG feel. The game has everything needed to keep players busy for many hours. There are multiple side quests, several ways to build your character from mages to warriors and rogues. The real fun of this game is the battle system and many weapon types. The combat isn't boring like some games get. The games crafting and smithing system work well once you level them up. You only get one point at a time so you have to decide what area you are going to focus on. This means you won't be both a master smith and alchemist at least not early in the game. Your level in each area determines what items you find to use so it's a bit restrictive. The dialog system is odd as sometimes you get a dialog wheel and other times you get one word to click on. It works but doesn't feel quite like you're having a conversation. The characters I've encountered have more to say so you get some background on why you are doing the quest un like Skyrim where people just said hey go get this for me. I recommend the game because its battles are fun the story has some detail and you can play how you want. The developer claims there's over 200 hours of quests and I believe them since there are quests everywhere.Update: You can redistribute your skills and change your character build for a reasonable fee. If you no longer want to be say a mage you can switch your skill set to something else. I am finding the merchants prices on items and to be a bit high on items though. Gold isn't made so quickly like some games so you need to spend carefully. The game has many spells you can learn but you can only map 4 at a time. It would have been nice if they made a way to map more spells for use.Update: There's a lot of side-quests lore and collectables in the game.  The main story is not its strongest point as most of what's going in the world is learned by exploring new areas and doing quests.  You can't really power level to max all skills nor do you need to. The weapon smithing and gem crafting are fun when fully leveled up.  My only 2 gripes with the game are its inventory system is severely limited for space and the menus are clunky to scroll through. The 4 spell limit is a bummer too because it forces you to really choose what spells you like.  (The way both Dragon Age games used the R2 button to double scroll the buttons would have have really helped this game out.)  I do really enjoy playing this game and recommend it to anyone who enjoys Rpgs.ProsMany ways to play the game mages warriors or stealth roguesPlay how you want...steel, sneak and many quests allow a peaceful or combative solution.Detailed alchemy crafting and smithing systemsFun battle systemMany side questsBeautiful environments with a huge world to exploreGood story and voice acting.100+ hours of play timeDoesn't lock up my PS3ConsRestrictive leveling only 1 point per level to spend on skills like smithing alchemy sneaking persuasion etc. It takes several points to max an area so you'll want to focus on being either a mage rogue or warrior. This can be changed for money but you still wont be able to max all skills until at very high levelsSome of the graphics on the characters look like they needed more polishSometimes the camera goes off into la la land in conversations.Load times are around 20-30 seconds when entering buildings (it varies some go fast some are slow)Some slowdowns with graphics engine when a lot is going on.Camera can blind you at times in combatI encountered a nasty glitch that made the whole TV screen twitch every 10 seconds and it would not go away until a previous save was loaded.

{"product_name":"B007A7UJ4S","description":"","reviewerName":"Graham Swearingen \"Graham1138\"","summary":"So Awesome","reviewText":"I am a fan of Studio Ghibli. More of a fan of Hayao Miyazaki (Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Howl's Moving Castle)  but he has had a hand in selecting animators for Studio Ghibli over the years and is himself an exceptional animator. So for that reason alone I have been anxiously awaiting to see the great animation cut scenes for this game. Not to mention music by Joe Hisaishi, composer for Howl's Moving Castle and Ponyo.I am by no means a fan of RPG's or JRPG's. I am just a fan of art and video games are one medium I really enjoy. Mainly because a big team of people make an entire world for us to explore and play in.  LEVEL 5 is a master at this. This is the closest I have seen a game come to looking like an animated film. Although I do have to note that the Namco's game Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm blew my mind with its cell shading and anime look, as well as Rayman Origins with it's wonderful 2D side scrolling animations. This LEVEL 5 production takes playing in the world of animation to a whole other level. Side note, like Naruto you can choose to have the English dubbed track or the Japanese audio with English subtitles which I think is great.I am not very far into this game and will update as I venture further into it. As of now, I have had no glitches or problems, load times are as expected. The controls are tight and responsive, the visuals are stunning of course.The inner kid in me wishes that they had released a game this massive and epic and cartoony when I was a kid. The main character Oliver and his guide Mr. Drippy are very classic Studio Ghibli styled characters and the animation cut scenes have been most impressive so far. The learning curve is pretty nice for this style of RPG. As my only familiarity with RPG's are Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy VII, and Eternal Sonata, and in that order, I can't really compare this to many other RPG's. I have read some things online comparing this game to Pokemon for the Gameboy (mainly because you capture creatures or \"familiars\" who help you in your battles), I can't speak to that. What I really like about the battle system is that it is not just button mashing or the regular RPG style pick and choose how to attack and then watch it happen, but being in real time and an open battleground, it is to your advantage to stay moving when attacking the enemy. So far I haven't found the errands (side quests) to be repetitive. Compared to the aforementioned games however, this will undoubtedly go down as a classic among them. I have heard this game can be beaten in about 40 hours if you don't do any errands and just stick to the story. Something tells me you can squeeze a good 65 hours out of this at least.Any fan of Studio Ghibli films, classic RPG's like Chrono Trigger and any fan of solid game design need to get this. Highly Recommended. If you are a huge nerd like me, you should try and get your hands on the Wizard Edition, it comes with a physical copy of the Wizard's companion that you use in the game.*UPDATE*I am a big fan of what they have done with the familiars in this game. There are a lot, 14 different genuses and each genuses (Arcana, Dracones, and Vermes to name a few) has countless different familiars within their respective class. Each with their own unique abilites which makes gameplay very deep when doing battle with enemies who's weakness may be exploited with a particular familiar.Like other reviewers have said, the world map is stellar and detailed and harkens back to old school RPG's. This game does take a while to get going, but if you played Assassins Creed III, then this game in comparison seems like it gets going immediately. So far I have not had to use the Prima Guide I ordered for this game. The in game Wizard companion book is very helpful. I can't wait to get my Wizard Edition to have the physical copy that will make it much easier to reference. The more I play the more I love this game. Unfortunately I am stuck at work, otherwise I probably would have played all night and would still be playing now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2013"}
{"product_name":"B001UWGBC8","reviewerName":"Michigoon \"tech geek\"","summary":"Not a great game, but good co-op fun.","reviewText":"Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 is a pretty fun party game. I went through the game with 2 players in co-op, and completed both storylines. For the second playthough, the game offers a \"Legendary\" difficulty which is sort of a New Game+ option where you keep your levels but get a correspondingly higher difficulty. I had a pretty good time, but I have to admit that it's an experience with plenty of flaws that could turn some players off.Let's just get this out there- if you're not playing this game in co-op, you're only getting a fraction of fun. This title does have numerous flaws, but most of them are outweighed by the fun of stomping around with a group of friends. Playing alone, this is only a mediocre title. Playing with four friends, this is an absolute party. I would consider at least 2-player co-op an absolute must for this title. You can play it alone, but really, try not to.The gameplay essentially consists of mashing buttons with some RPG elements overlaid to allow you to customize your heros. However, strict level requirements mean that the customization rarely goes farther than scaling back the one power you least like to make sure the other 3 are as high as they can go. You can leave the auto-spend option on and there's very little gameplay difference.You get to build your own team of heros, but there's a lot of problems here too. There's a pretty good stable of characters (23?), but this feels very constrained. Consider the Civil War storyline, and many characters will be unavailable due to picking sides. Thor and Hulk require collecting items, and Juggernaut is pre-order only. You'll really only have about a dozen characters to select from on your first playthrough. There are times in the game when you'll be hard-pressed to find healing tokens, so any character with a slim health bar is a major liability. Spider-Man and Storm for instance are both great fun to play, but bosses can KO them very nearly in one hit. Personally, I kept to tanks and regenerating characters (Wolverine, Deadpool), and I still had several instances where I had to wander around praying for health drops. (Random note: Hulk and Thor have to be unlocked, but there's a code you can input to unlock them at the start without hurting your game. I recommend this very highly- look it up).The game length is fairly short- even if you're really searching for all the items and spending a lot of time checking out bonus materials, I'd only expect 20 hours from the main story. You can replay the game, but 90% of the game is the same, with less than a handful of really unique maps per side. You're really only going to replay mostly for the few characters you missed out on based on the story choices, and as said, that's pretty limited anyway. And the story isn't great. Sure, it's fun comic fare with a few twists, but it doesn't even stay true to the Civil War storyline. This is not a spoiler for the game (although it is a spoiler for the comics)- in the comics, Capt. America actually dies at one point. In the game, that never happens. That event isn't changed or sidestepped, it actually does not happen at all. For all the hype about this storyline, it's puzzling as to why it isn't even carried through. The whole plot is basically generic and forgettable. Not bad, but not great.A final note is on the art. As a whole, the game has pretty good graphics. Again, not great but good. There's a lot of puzzling choices for character design though. Spider-Man appears in his modern form that everyone's familiar with, but Gambit appears to be some sort of Xtreme (and really terrible) version. Most every character has an alternate costume, and Spider-Man's alternate is his Tony Stark costume- if you're not a comics fan, you probably have no idea what this is, and it suffices to say this outfit had very mixed reaction from fans. Meanwhile, Venom's alternate costume is just a different art style, but Hulk's costume is the Red Hulk, which is technically a different character entirely. Things just feel really slapdash all over on this account- the artists really needed to settle on one era or aesthetic and apply it across all of the game. It's fun to have some options for the costumes, but often you're just praying the alternate costume is the \"real\" character design they should have used in the first place. (For fans- Jean Grey appears in her Phoenix outfit, but changes to her classic era X-Men outfit... where's modern Jean Grey?).So in the end, you have a mediocre game with some really fun multiplayer, and a lot of simple fun with selecting some of your favorite heros and stomping around the battlefield. If you've got some friends or a significant other to play this game with, it's a fully enjoyable co-op experience that's definitely worth owning. I'm sure there will be a downloadable pack with extra characters in the near future, and that could add even more fun to the mix. If you're going to be playing this one solo, it's really rental territory or a low-priority buy. You'll play it once, maybe twice for the other side of the conflict, and forget it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2009"}

LOVE IT!!!","reviewText":"Ages ago, when I had the original Playstation, my favorite game, hands-down, was King's Field.  Give me a guy who uses swords and explores some weird island and I'm in heaven.  This game NAILS IT.  This game is on the same level as Oblivion, although not as complex (which is a good thing!).  This is a third-person action-RPG and it's just so much fun to play and explore.  You wake up washed ashore an island and BOOM - go.  Pick up stuff.  Talk to people.  Learn what's going on.  Advance your experience.  Find a better weapon.  Watch your health.  It's just GREAT.I would like to point out a few things:1) The graphics are pretty good.  Sometimes you'll see the textures on walls are like weirdly stretched - but I don't mind.2) You don't have to worry about equipment breaking.  YAY.  Go have FUN.  No worries on busting that shield or sword!3) Sleeping is stress-free.  Find a bed?  Even if bad guys are nearby, you'll be fine and you can regain your health, no problem.4) Enemies are spaced so that they don't bother you unless you get too close.  And if you wander into an area where they overwhelm you, it's a tip that you're not tough enough to handle what lies beyond them in that cave or around the bend.  It's nicely done.5) Lots of quests and things to figure out and explore.  Just SO much fun!6) The world isn't as vast as Oblivion, but it's manageable, and to me it's perfect - that sweet spot of being huge enough to always wonder what's over there, but small enough that you don't freak about missing anything.---This game is my favorite type of 360 game: An action RPG with good graphics and lots to explore and do and collect and learn.  I play this for hours and get mad when I'm so tired I have to go to bed.  LOVE IT!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2012"}

The only reason I didn't give this game 5 stars was because of the multitude of problems associated with the game which were across all platforms. I got this game the day it was released so keep in mind that some of the problems have now been fixed. Joining games with friends was frustrating because you couldn't &#34;squad up&#34; and join one game as a group. My issue was that the game was released without being thoroughly polished. All of the problems have added up between BF3 and now BF4, so I don't think I will buy another Battlefield game again.Problems I personally experienced are:- Game freezing/crashing.- Lag AKA &#34;rubber banding&#34; even with great internet connection.- Campaign progress loss. (had to re-start the campaign 4 times)- Getting stuck in kill-cam after death or after a revive.- Loss of HUD after revive.- Revive not working.- Enemies showing 0% health after they kill you- Random death- No sound- No damage on opponents- Sinking into the map (can't move)- Delayed damage receivedAs stated before, many of these may have now been solved, but when I was playing this game for the first 3-4 months, it was incredibly frustrating to deal with all of the problems.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2014"}

The controls are pretty good though there is some problems with camera control in some areas which doesn't always help when you under a nerve wracking situation and are trying to stay alive. The story also feels more reminiscent of the Silent Hill story of 1-3 though of course those were far superior again at least this SH is far superior to Homecoming.Yes sadly I have done what other fans have and compared to much of this game with the previous three to much but that probably can't be helped.Still while this may no match up to those three at least you'll still have more enjoyment playing this SH game and the story and plots in it rather then the less then stellar SH:Homecoming.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2013"}

I've played first person shooters before, but not a hunting game.I have not finished the game yet, but I've progressed through the first set of levels.  And the first impression isn't that great.First, I haven't seen any fun/cool/useful use of the 3D graphics.  The gameplay seems the same in 2D and 3D.Second, some levels are downright irritating.  For example, one level you try not to shoot any deer for a few minutes.  Wolves and Moose attack you, you shoot them instead.  You can shoot 2 deer by accident and pass the level.  This level was really boring to me.  They should have just made it \"survive the wolf pack attack\" instead, and brought on more wolves and forgotten about the idea where you try not to shoot does.  On another level, you have to shoot the deer when they are \"far away\" but its not clear how far away they should be.  they run toward you and away from you randomly.  I guess thats the patient part of hunting.Third, I'm not really sure how I progressed from one phase to another.  It seems like I had to go through a lot of levels in the first phase.  If I failed to kill enough deer for whatever reason (like I didn't use the scope to kill them), I had to start the entire level sequence over.  I didn't like this, sometimes I wanted to go back and play a sublevel but there is no way to choose them.Fourth, the bonus items drop randomly, but start being used immediately.  Sometimes they are completely useless because they are targeting assistance that lasts for a few moments, but there are no animals on the screen because you just killed them all (duh).The game just isn't that good.  Its ok, you shoot some deer, reload, shoot more.  its very linear, you can't choose what level you want to work on.  If you fail a level you have to work back through the old levels to get back to it.Overall, I'm not very impressed.  I kinda want to play the gave until I go to some exotic location and get to hunt some exotic game, but I don't know if I want to bother playing it that long.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2012"}

I'm a huge fan of the series and this one bears the Ninja Gaiden name proudly. You can get an overview of the game in better places then my review, so I'll just get to the point:- Game looks and plays fantastic. No slowdown, which 360 owners were reporting, but just a minor occurence of screen-tearing, barely noticeable and does not affect the experience.- Difficulty. This is no easy game, but it's by far the easiest Ninja Gaiden I ever played. Veterans will find their challenge in difficulty settings that will get unlocked after you play through the game the first time. Newcomers to the series will enjoy the action without smashing their controllers when playing on Alcolyte and Warrior modes offered from the beginning. I think it was a smart decision on part of developers.- Blood and Gore. Many people have complained about the removal of over-the-top blood and gore that Ninja Gaiden 2 on Xbox was famous for. I'd say the level of depiction of violence in Sigma 2 is on par with Sigma 1 - some blood, but nothing like the Xbox version. What I don't understand is why this game is still rated M.- New Characters. These are actually fun to play with, not just thrown in for the sake of putting them on the game cover.In short, I recommend this to anyone who likes action games. Previous Ninja Gaiden games were not for everyone due to their crushing difficulty.

If not - get it, it's one of the best games this year.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2009"}

Am I missing something?","reviewText":"Please, don't mistake what I'm saying.  I say to you now: There is no greater Dragon Quest fan in the US than me.  Period.  I've played them all - even the terrible \"Monsters\" series.  I know the best of the series (Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen), I know the worst of the series (Dragon Warrior VII), and it seems to me that Square Enix has already forgotten what it taught inDragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King.  If you never played 8, know that you missed a classic as did most people who assumed it would be terrible.  8 had the best music, the best experience, cutscenes, good graphics, solid gameplay, a wide open expansive world...it just did everything right.  Even throwbacks to the old DQs were present.  TO date I have not found another game that managed to bring it all together in one comprehensive package.  Thus I was excited to see 9, though its presence on the DS rather than a regular console was disturbing.  I now know why I felt disturbed.A little backstory:You are a Celestrian.  Think of a Celestrian as an angel.  The Celestrians answer to a higher power, and are responsible for protecting cities and towns in what is known as the Protectorate.  They observe the humans from the Observatory, and go down to assist them when needed.  The humans can't see the Celestrians, but they experience their miracles daily.  Unlike DQ games of yore, you are not a young lad who finds a legendary sword and saves the world; this time, you're a Celestrian who one day experiences a major earthquake and huge light beams attacking the Observatory, and you are grounded in the town you are sworn to protect, Angel Falls (ironic name, isn't it?  More on that later).  You've lost your halo and your wings, and the humans can see you, but they just think you're another human who got lost and ended up there one day.  Your goal is to find out what happened to the Observatory and your fellow Celestrians, and gain back your powers.It's not the most common of stories, but it works for the most part, and I stress that last portion.At the beginning, you'll create a character of your own design.  You can select gender, height, hair, and some basic features.  You can also determine what your character's starting job is by what you configure.  As you go through the game, you'll come across an Inn where you will be able to create additional characters to join your quest.  If you have friends who have the game and have a DS, you can also go questing with them, either by them joining your world or you joining theirs.  Either way, you'll want to make sure you create and manage a party at your earliest opportunity, because this game isn't easy at times.Now that you've got the scoop, I'll save you the long note and just break it down for you, in my own opinion.  For the record, I do not game online; to me DQ is and always will be a single player game, so my score does not credit the online gameplay in any way.-=- What Dragon Quest IX Does RIGHT -=-* It's Dragon Quest.  Through and through.  A lot of the commonly known enemies make a comeback and it's good to see them.* The music is extremely well done, it FEELS like Dragon Quest music and that's important.* The battle engine is almost a mirror image of DQ8 which is a strong compliment.  It is text based, but you can see the animations of your characters and the enemies as they attack.* The game has a light-hearted nature to it that will appeal to most.  Town names (\"Angel Falls\" which is your protected town, given that you \"fall\" from the Observatory...\"Zere Rocks\"/Xerox, which is a stone copy of another town...and so on), light jokes, that sort of thing.* Certain plot elements were done very well.  Like the girl with the doll (can't say any more, it would spoil it).-=- What Dragon Quest IX Does WRONG -=-Oh my.* I know they were trying to keep everything light-hearted and that's fine...except the story.  To me, it's just not deep enough for a Dragon Quest game.  Even Dragon Quest III had depth to it.  This one is deeper thanDragon Warrior (Nintendo NES), maybe as deep asDragon Warrior II, but not nearly as deep as the others that followed 2.  This is my opinion and I stick to it.* LikeDragon Warrior III, once you get to a certain point in the game, you'll be able to change classes.  Unlike DQ3, you don't get access to the majority of job classes until you pass certain quests.  I wouldn't mind this, except for the nature of the quests (see below).  I consider this a negative though, because I don't like unlocking any class except the Sage.* Map is sectioned off, not wide and large.  I know this is due to the limitations of the DS which is why I would have preferred another system that could handle this.  Coming from DQ8 where the world seemed to have no end, this was disheartening.* The quests are extremely annoying, especially the ones that give you good stuff. I'm all for a bit of a challenge, but these quests are just irritating.  You'll find a guy who says, \"go defeat 5 wolves, they're tough\" and you're like, \"bring it on!!!\".  Then he says \"ah, but wait...you need to do War Cry first to terrify them, THEN defeat them!\"  War Cry is a technique that doesn't always work, and even if it does, it means you have to waste turns until the same person who did the War Cry gets the kill.  Of course, once you're strong enough to do this, they're likely to run away.  IRRITATING.  Then there was the Paladin one where you basically had to cover someone on your party 10 times; if this wereFinal Fantasy IV, this wouldn't be a problem since the Paladin will automatically cover anyone who's weak, but in DQ9, you have to randomly pick someone you THINK will get attacked, making it a 25% chance that person will be.  MAJOR TIME WASTE anyone?* Alchemy pot is great.  Finding recipes is not.* Inability to skip text faster than what the game allows.  Listening to the priest drone on gets really bothersome, always has.  It's not nearly as bad as Shining in the Darkness, but still.* The game just doesn't have the \"IT\" factor.  There's no real personality to anything.  I can't really explain it any better than that, it just feels empty compared to its predecessors.  In fact, I would go out on a limb and say it feels a lot like DQ7 without the dungeon crawling or time travel, and that's not a compliment.  I don't feel the same level of development effort in this game that I felt out ofKingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, DQ8, or evenThe World Ends With You.  Even the recent release of DQ5 was superior to this.* No air flight in the main story?  Really?* I saw people say these are the best graphics on DS.  Huh...seems like someone never played Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days.  DQ9's are okay - everything except the character models, which look muddy and not well done at all; definitely not the best Square Enix has put out as evident by Kingdom Hearts.

I would say this.If you enjoyed Dragon Quest 7, absolutely you should try this one.If you enjoyed Dragon Quest 8 BUT NOT 7, you're likely to be somewhat disappointed, but tolerant.If you hate Dragon Quest, you might like this one, ironically.If you're a quest fanatic, this game is for you.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002I0KP4G","description":"","reviewerName":"Thomas Riccardi","summary":"Starcraft from the Zerg point of view","reviewText":"When Command and Conquer was released it was the birth of RTS but other companies elevated this genre to new heights. Blizzard was a small company until they released a small game called Warcraft and it was an overnight sensation. A few years later they released yet another game called Starcraft that took place in the future. Recently there was a sequel released and it was just as good if not better than it's predecessor. Now the next chapter in the StarCraft II saga is released called Heart of the Swarm. But is this a game you should go out and get or avoid like a zerg rush?Heart of the Swarm takes place two years after Wings of Liberty as you will be in control of Sarah Kerrigan as you are not only trying to take over leadership of the swarm but to also exact her revenge on Valerian Mengsk and the Terrans. There are 20 single player missions that will tell this tale in depth as you will gain access to new units. The zerg , protoss and terrans will all have at least two new units each and you can use them to inflict pain in the single player and multiplayer modes as well.But the real update is going to be across the multiplayer space and the upgrades players are going to get when they get this game. Battle.net is going to be upgraded and you will be given tools to make your own maps as well as your own games! Yes you heard right the Starcraft II editor is going to be undergoing an overhaul making it more powerful and you will be able to develop platforming, action and puzzle games to name a few. Also added is a new community feature as you will be able to meet players of similar interest, join in private chat channels and also participate in unranked matches.My only problem about this game is that it is not a stand alone game (as you need StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty to play this). And $40 for an upgrade just for another single player campaign seems a bit steep. It is as if Blizzard is trying to nickel and dime their fans for everything that it's worth and I would have loved to see all the campaigns released in a year or so instead of having to buy each campaign separately.If you are a fan of the Starcraft II universe and want to see what happens next in this saga then this is a no brainer. Go online and purchase this game as soon as you are able!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}

{"product_name":"B003O6HDHA","description":"","reviewerName":"Matt","summary":"Boring, by Silent Hill standards","reviewText":"LIKED:Graphics engine does a reasonable job of creating believable fog/mist that provides an unnerving and creepy atmosphere which always keeps you wondering what lies out there just beyond your field of vision. Sound effects get the job done, although there's really little more than grunts, growls, screams, giggles, and animal noises. There's not really much of a soundtrack. The voice acting is actually pretty decent for an entry in this series (albeit with a couple of very poorly acted cutscenes). Storyline is interesting, but predictable early on.DISLIKED: The game is deceptively linear. At first it appears you have an entire city to explore, but in reality each street is prematurely deadended and connected to one other street by a single building route or alleyway. By the time you work most of the way through the game, you will have started in the bottom left of the town map and ended up at the top left corner of the map. If you decide to go back to where you started and explore, you can't just head directly south.... you have to trace your way back the exact way you got there, with complete linearity. There are sewer tunnels to use as \"quick travel\", but you can only use them if you first solve a set of vague puzzles, and they don't become available until late in the game. It's a shame the game couldnt' deliver on a true \"open world\" Silent Hill.As has been mentioned in other reviews, the combat dynamics and controls are total crap. Some people (obviously big fans) opt to defend the developers by saying that this was all done on purpose to encourage the player to run instead of fight. This makes sense in theory except there are far better (and less embarrassing) ways to go about this if you're a game developer. For instance, add more enemies to the fight or make it easier for your character to die.... players would figure out the ground rules easily enough. But as it stands currently, to me, the combat is clunky and obnoxious. I never once felt scared or creeped out or powerless when another enemy showed up (as the developers may have intended)... I just felt annoyed.The mechanics involved in lighting up dark areas with a flashlight are horribly implemented. You get a tiny circle of light to show you where you're going, and it almost never increases in size, even when you get close to a wall. So more often than not I found myself stumbling through a dark room running into every object possible. And I found nothing even remotely engaging about fighting several enemies at one is a dark corridor in which I couldn't see anything or anyone, although I guess some people would find that \"scary\".There are a few sidequests to undertake if the idea of a 5-6 hour campaign is not to your liking (yes, the game is pretty short). Some are interesting, but some are more like \"wander the town looking for 5 instances of this object and then hit the X button in front of each one\" fetch quests. Exploring isn't really rewarded, unless you're looking for a 14th rake for your collection or yet another brick/bottle/pipe to wield in ungainly combat. Or perhaps a 12th First Aid Kit?In general, Downpour just seems EMPTY. Even on the hardest difficulty, there just aren't many foes to encounter. And it seemed to me that once you eliminate enemies from a street corner, they never seem to come back. So by the end of the game when I was searching around for extra quests to extend my 5-6 hrs of playing, the town was completely VACANT. Others may feel differently, but I found this lack of activity to be incredibly boring. I even fell asleep accidentally while running through town once. That has never happened to me in the last 10 years of gaming, so I found that pretty telling.One of the big problems I have with this game is that I just didn't find it scary. Let's be honest: Most players probably play the Silent Hill games to get scared, just like going to see a good horror/suspense movie. And I found the first three Silent Hill games to have more than enough scares to keep me entertained. Attempted scares in Downpour are sparse, at best. The best thing about creating a creepy atmosphere is that as the player you never knows when the game is going to try and outright scare you and when it is going to do nothing at all. This keeps the player on edge throughout the entire game, and makes the real scares all the more startling when they happen. Downpour pours on the creepy atmosphere but VERY infrequently attempts to scare you. Seriously, after about one hour into the game I came to realize that most of the town, buildings, and alleyways were going to be essentially devoid of enemies and that nothing was ever going to jump through a window or hop out in front of me or anything, and I completely relaxed. I never tensed up throughout the rest of the game and as a result found myself extremely bored.Oh, and the saving/loading system has problems. Whether it's an autosave or the game is loading textures/upcoming environments, it will make the gameplay freeze or stutter for several seconds and usually leads to a tremendous drop in framerate, which is very distracting. Not a huge problem, but there's really no excuse for this kind of issue in this era of gaming._____________Overall, I found this to be a very average videogame, one which bets almost everthing on the \"creepy\" foggy town and dark cavern/building atmosphere to make the experience seem worthwhile. Unfortunately, creature encounters are generally uncommon, and outright scare attempts are practically nonexistent. It's a better game than some of the recent Silent Hills, but it doesn't even come close to the first three entries, which is sad and frustrating. Most importantly, I didn't find it all that scary, which for a survival horror game, made me question why I was even playing it.It's a shame the Silent Hill HD collection is a lazy mess, because Downpour left me with a major hunger for some old time survival horror.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2012"}

In some ways, it was better, in other ways it was worse. Story wise, it takes a step back. Don't expect to be blown away or scared by the game (there was only 1 moment where I was startled by the game). The game more than makes up for this by having an online multiplayer mode. The dual wielding system and ramped up difficulty are welcome additions to the game. Overall, it's a solid game with no noticeable drawbacks.

{"product_name":"B002I0J9M0","description":"","reviewerName":"Michael","summary":"From an extremely dedicated fan","reviewText":"I love Portal. The universe is both very unique and interesting, but also has lots of small detail and secrets.A continuation to the original Portal, but improved in literally every aspect. The graphics are much better, environments much more detailed, and there's many more new puzzles and tools to use. If you felt the original Portal lacked character, story, or wit, Portal 2 gives you a huge portion of all of those. There's a story that holds together the whole game, not just simple puzzles. Because of this, huge portions of the game are just getting from point A to point B, but the environments and contributions to the back stories these locations give are a treat on their own! These each make room for character development and revealing things that will make you question the entire story in the game.If you are wondering if it will be full of puzzles and chambers to complete, there's a healthy dose of both these and just wandering around, discovering more and more secrets of Aperture. The puzzles do feel a little less difficult than the original, but there's many more interesting ones that for the most part make up for this.It's much longer, and lasts around 10 hours if you rush through it, but I urge you not to do so; this game is riddled with Easter eggs left and right; each connect to very interesting and hard to decipher back stories, or even into the Half-Life universe! I have many theories about the origin of the character or even the whole company due to the various clues the game gives you. I won't reveal any, but I'll just tell you this; check every little writing or seemingly meaningless little script that's given to you; or even yet, go beyond- check behind walls, scout your environment and see if there's anything of interest. This game has brilliant, brilliant little side clues or hidden things that each connect flawlessly and tell a whole new tale of their own! If you've played Half-Life 2, (which you should play first for the sake of the story), you will recognize many references. This game is not one to be rushed through, doing so is just disrespecting the developer! I myself missed one or two big easter eggs, but try to find them all yourself and your experience will be much better than mine if you connect the dots.There's also a cooperative mode that I hear is quite fun, but I haven't tried it yet. I've already played the main storyline twice and have discovered all known secrets, and have even found a few of my own I'm trying to piece together. Excellent game with amazing hidden stories that change your whole view of the game's universe and storyline.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2014"}

The control and game setup just felt a little bit overwhelming and too vibrant. So I did not anticipate much when I first ordered this collection. But I was so impressed now with the 3 remastered HD games that I honestly think this series (first 3 games) is better than Sly series and even the Jak and daxter series (I also own the other two collections). Although it's been several years since the three games were made and a generation falls back, its graphics do not remind me of the fact it was last general game at all.

It's quite obvious that QuanticDream spent a lot of man hours developing this game.  The characters are seemingly more life-like than most HD movies I've watched, and the atmospheres this game use really do add emotional depth to an otherwise shoe-strung story (see below).  Despite its flaws, I do like how your actions determine what ending you get.  Bioshock had this kind of an element, but in the end your choices didn't really make a huge difference aside from Trophies/Achievements.  In Heavy Rain, your choices determine far more than what trophies you take.  Games like that are far and in between, and that's where the two stars in this rating come from.  Production value and Interaction.  Also, the piece of paper that came with it to fold up was a neat way to spend time while waiting for the obnoxiously long install.Otherwise, let me explain why I wish I just bought Battlefield 3 or something else:Nevermind what your choices determine, the road to getting there is a short but tedious and boring one.  The game can be completed within a 12-hour time-frame, so if you actually DO like it and you feel like trying it all over again to change your ending, suit yourself.  This game is advertised as a taut psychological thriller, and yet I couldn't help but feel like I was spending 3/4 of the game doing menial tasks like brushing my teeth and opening doors (or figuring out how), not to mention all the times out of frustration I couldn't figure out how to, uh, NAVIGATE.  It's very important in these kinda games to give your character a way to walk EASILY.  The only way someone should be holding another button while walking is for either \"RUN\" or \"SHOOT.\"  I need to hold a button to walk around, WHAT THE F***?!  Also, about the origami I mentioned earlier... it's too bad this didn't come with at least two more--that's probably the only \"replayable\" aspect of this game.Other than that, it's unfortunate that this game probably won't get me squat for trade-in value when I bring it to my local game shop in the coming week.  What an utter disappointment.  Next time I want a psychological thriller, I'll browse through Netflix.  In the end, this game feels more like a tech demo that was pushed through as a full game to boost sales... I cannot help but feel like that's all it is.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2011"}

The walking in the game sometimes gets inverted when the camera changes. It's nothing too bothersome, but it is annoying. The facial animations are some of the best I've ever seen in a game. The emotion in this game is amazing. It really helps you connect to these characters and feel their pain. Some of the environments could have been done better though. The objects in the game are not well done, almost ps2 quality. Thankfully the characters are very well done so it distracts you from the low res objects that appear around them. The story has a lot of twists and turns that changes based on the choices you make. There are multiple endings and it really helps the replay value, as you try to achieve them all.

The color is appealing and doesn't show any dirt or fingerprints, all buttons, switches and openings work well, and though they might be thin (as another reviewer noted) they are nevertheless easy to use - not requiring much strength or ingenuity to open and close.The battery charge lasts a long time and can be extended from a convenient birghtness button located on the front of the PSP. The system has a standby mode which makes it easy to pause in the middle of practically anything and resume from that exact point - in a matter of seconds either way.The UMD is a little noisy depending on the game and your environment. If you're in a car or other such place it isn't noticeable, but you will hear the UMD disk moving and tracking if you're in a quiet area.The 1Gig memory is excessive for games - unless you save in multiple slots for numerous games, so you might want to consider the media management options available and load it up with pictures, songs, movies ect.One last thing to be aware of when purchasing this excellent bundle is that most cases and such on the market right now are for the 1000 series - not the 2000 series. Just make sure the case you buy for the PSP is compatible with the slimmer size. If you're careful all I would recommend is a screen cover - they apply easily, do not interfere with viewing at all, and are definitely important - the beautiful screen picks up dust and finger prints magically and in large quantities.Overall a wonderful system, a great deal here (Daxter is a fun, funny and surprisingly more mature game than one might think) and with a vast quantity of games out there for the PSP you can't go wrong getting this system.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2007"}

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-Fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.Xbox LIVE support including LIVE Achievements.","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"Eh, It's Not Bad","reviewText":"My biggest problem with this game is that there aren't any options for subtitles; this is the only game in my recent memory that has ever not included subtitles. Not only are the developers spitting in the eye of deaf gamers, they're also annoying all the people (like me) that may not have the game on blast while they're playing it. In fact, even when I did turn it up to try to figure out what was going on, the voices were very muffled and hard to understand. Because of this, I just ended up muting the game completely and ignoring the story, which actually may have improved the experience. As far as I can tell, the people ordering you around like their gopher aren't who they say they are, and they've had you going back in time to change the future for various nefarious reasons. There's nothing you can do to change anything, and the only real choice you have is who to kill at the very end (here you can even go back to the last save and try out the different endings I believe) the story seems to be just very linear and convoluted. It was also a bit annoying that there isn't any sort of final boss, the ending is more similar to Fable 2.As for the actual gameplay, it works very well and is similar in my mind to a combination of Bulletstorm, Call of Duty, and Fear. It's classic first person shooting (CoD), with a bunch of crazy weapons (Bulletstorm), a shifting disturbing environment (Fear) and uses the classic health packs instead of the modern regenerating health. The human AI isn't too intelligent, but some of the monsters could be very annoying, with very high attacks that can kill you in a few hits, they also like to flank you. Also, there are these flood-like creatures that would swarm and then explode when they're near, they weren't too difficult to kill with a shotgun, but they were incredibly annoying especially in areas where you can't put a wall behind your back. There are some cool bosses, but they all use the cliche glowing weakspot that you see in every game. The health system works pretty well once it's upgraded, it's an example of how a system other than magical regeneration can work in a shooter. The save points in the game were ok, but much too often they sent you back too far after a spot that was obviously going to cause lots of people to die. There were also some very annoying points when you're trying to save an NPC, and multiple times right before I hit a save-point it would be game over because I stopped to grab some ammo/health/collectibles. It was ridiculous.Overall, it was a decent game for the cheap price I got it at, nothing amazing but it's definitely still playable for an interesting 10 hour (around) main story, however there isn't much there for replayability.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2011"}

Lots of gore in a 3D setting with the awesome monster design from the classic arcade and Sega Genesis games. Man, was I wrong. This game is full of so many flaws and good ideas gone wrong that just a little play testing and polish could have made this game great. It tries to be a modern action/adventure with a bit of softcore porn and (a lot) of ultra violence thrown in. The story is somewhat interesting with H.P. Lovecraft inspired mythos and art style, but you won't care because most won't even finish the game.Splatterhouse is all about combat so let's start there. The combat is just seriously flawed. I can't explain enough how unbalanced and frustrating the combat is. If the developers only tweaked it some it would be just right, but there's so many little nuances that drive you crazy. Firstly, you never feel powerful enough. You can acquire new moves, but you never increase in strength. These moves just add to your arsenal of weakness. Even the smallest enemy needs a lot of pummeling before they die. This gets really frustrating when the game throws a lot of enemies at you. You are just so overwhelmed and you rely on your Mask powers which uses the poorly balanced blood meter. This meter can be increased with upgrades, but it takes three slots to activate Mask mode. In Mask mode you can slaughter enemies easily, but it doesn't last long. A poor use of this meter is when you do temporary Mask attacks like Splatter or Smash. They each use a blood slot. Why?! That is so frustrating because you need to use it because the regular attacks aren't powerful enough. If you use these special attacks you will never be able to enter Mask mode when you really need it. Highly unbalanced and frustrating.If that isn't enough let's talk about the weapons and 2D platforming sections. They tried to be cute and go back to Splatterhouse roots, but they just ruin your precious memories of that game. Whenever you just touch an obstacle you get hurt. The jumping is terrible with no momentum at play. The run button is flawed because you can't interrupt it so you have to remember how far you run because Rick just stops and it takes forever for the animation to end. This leads to cheap deaths which leads to horrendously long load times that can take up to a minute. You will die a lot in this game so expect to endure long load times after each death. If that isn't enough the weapons break just after a few hits, and instead of creating more interesting enemies the last four levels of the game are just ridiculously difficult because tons of sub-bosses are thrown at you to compensate for lazy enemy design. There are only about 6 different enemies in the whole game and they are not any fun to even kill. The Splatter Kills are fun during the first level, but there are only about 4 different animations! This game just wants you to hate it.So if that isn't enough to keep you away I don't know what will. A few of the bosses are pretty fun, but towards the end that kind of stops. There are some interesting combat puzzles, but are flawed due to poor hit detection. Even if you beat the game why would you want to come back for combat arenas? The combat system is just slow, unresponsive, full of uninterruptible animations, and just not fun at all. If you really want to play you can pick up the nude Jenny photos along the way, but it isn't even worth it for that. Splatterhouse has a lot of potential, but ultimately fails due to lazy game design and unbalanced everything. The story and art are nice with a lot of gore, but even the graphics are lacking due to using the outdated Unreal Engine 3. I honestly can't even recommend a rental. Stick with the three Sega Genesis games and forget this even exist. Maybe next time? We will have to see.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2012"}

This is that kind of game. This is a game that combines a revolutionary battle system, beautiful visuals, heart-warming story, and vibrant, charming characters, all into one game.Like most Japanese RPGs, this game is heavily story based. You will follow a group of soldiers whose goal is to defend their small nation from an overwhelming superpower. You create your own squad by handpicking soldiers to use in your battles. The battle system involves controlling your units on a map like pieces on a chess board, except there's a twist. When you move a piece, you go into a third party view of the character and control them yourself. This calls upon both your strategic skills and quick reflexes in order to win battles. If you have not seen this battle system yet, go on YouTube and look it up. It's honestly the most genius innovation in gaming I have witnessed in a long time. In short, I absolutely love it.Each solider you can choose has their very own voiceovers and all look unique so you really get to know them as the game goes on. You learn about the different perks they have, like if they like to hide in the grass or if they have a strange allergy to metal. You learn which teammates they like to be with and which types of people they want to avoid. By the end of the game, you'll have felt like you've created you very own family of soldiers, people you really feel are part of your squad, and people you don't want to die, because in this game, they will die, and it will be sad (unless you saved the game beforehand :P).If you enjoy anime you will absolutely love Valkyria Chronicles. The cell shading done by the Canvas graphics engine is superb, it almost really looks like an anime. Watching the story unfold with no overly dramatic scenes or outrageously embarrassing dialogue is something a retro gamer like me has longed for. This game will make you feel sad, happy, surprised, and most important of all, it will evoke emotions out of your without trying to bash the story into your head like other games. In the end, the story is beautiful and presented in modest and humble fashion.This game has fallen under the radar like many other Japanese games but if you are reading this then that means you have been given the chance to be one of the few who experiences probably the best game on PS3 as of this writing. The only con I can think of for this game is that the sequels 2 and 3 are to be released on PSP, which actually isn't much of a con. I'm really serious here, you owe it to yourself to get Valkyria Chronicles.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2010"}

Combining three of the most powerful game creation software systems into a single game - Digital Molecular Matter, the Havok physics engine, and Euphoria - this game somehow manages to both work beautifully and suck terribly.1. STORY: The story is supposed to \"stand on its own\", but instead it feels somewhat like the middle season of a soap opera with no ability to see the beginning or ending. The concept as it stands now comes dangerously close to breaking the \"cloning\" lore created in the early nineties by Timothy Zahn - that Jedi can be cloned, but it does not work very well - and so one is left hoping that this \"clone\" is merely a mind-wiped Starkiller. The story itself is poor, underdeveloped, and a haphazard mess of cliches and awesome action sequences. Instead of \"stand[ing] on its own\", it barely stands with the first game, the story of which was infinitely better, though still worse than most games of today. Also, the ending Light/Dark choice is made by pressing either the R1 or L1 shoulder buttons. It feels like a complete cop-out. (1/5)2. COMBAT: Much like the first game, this title is filled to the brim with it. While it was somewhat easy to handle in TFU, in this title it gets annoying very quickly. From point A, the intro, to point B, the ending, there is nothing but combat. For some, this may not be such a bad thing, but when you're surrounded by some of the most beautiful scenery ever seen in a game, the lack of opportunities to take a breather goes from annoying to nightmarish. However, unlike TFU, Force powers feel considerably more powerful and useful: Force Repulse in the first game felt like a joke, while here it actually has a decent use in either one-hit-killing enemies or at least knocking them over. Lightsaber combos feel much more fluid, as well. The targeting mechanic, however, feels clumsier than in TFU: rather than using a standard reticule, an outline appears on the target, which is harder to see and harder to direct. Also, if there are enemies about and you want to toss some containers at them for a quick kill or stun - too bad, the game fights with you and likes to target the enemy instead. (2/5)3. CAMERA: The camera is neither improved nor worsened, though occasionally it got hung up on walls in tight spaces. It never gets hung up on enemies, which is nice, and has less of a tendency to \"pop\" from place to place than it did in TFU. (4/5)4. GRAPHICS: Quite honestly one of the most beautifully-rendered, highly-detailed games on the market to date, and it benefits wonderfully from the PlayStation 3's Blu-ray capabilities. From sheets of rain pouring down Kaminoan windows to the shine on Vader and the Stormtroopers' armor to the atmosphere of Dagobah, the game never fails to disappoint. For this alone it is worth a day's rent. The three engines only make the graphics stand out even more wonderfully, and honestly, the graphics tend to make an otherwise highly linear and cramped game feel bigger and far more open. The vistas on Cato Neimodia alone are enough to make your jaw drop a little at times. The uncanny valley feeling of the first game has been toned down; the contrast between the in-game graphics and the pre-rendered cutscenes is virtually nonexistent. (5/5)5. LENGTH: As has been said by many other reviewers, the game is horribly short. Tearing through the single-player campaign, without taking detours for collectibles or what little exploration there is, takes about five to six hours on Easy. TFU was only about eight to ten hours with a moderate replay value; while TFU2 has replay value, it is a little bit lower than for the first game, if only because many of the PS3's trophies will be received within the first playthrough. Some of the trophies provide an entertaining experience, however, considering that one of them requires you to cause a certain number of Stormtroopers to jump to their deaths. The \"challenges\" available from the main menu also add entertainment value, with the ability to log in to the PlayStation Network and rank on the leaderboards. (3/5)6. DIALOGUE: both improved over and worse than the first game. Starkiller is about as annoying as Anakin, especially during the final level, though what he says when tricking Stormtroopers into doing his bidding is quite amusing. As always, Rahm Kota is entertaining and snarky, though his constant demands to do what he's telling you to do can get extremely obnoxious after the first two or three times. \"Stop Helping Me\" comes into effect fairly often - you are never given the chance to really figure out anything by yourself. Juno Eclipse was virtually nonexistent throughout the game, so her dialogue was, in that way, far improved. Boba Fett's voice actor also does a great job, but Yoda just sounds like bad fanfiction. The return of a certain Ensemble Darkhorse from TFU was like a breath of fresh air. Overall, the whole thing is really hit-or-miss - even Vader gets obnoxious really quickly. (3/5)7. PLAYIBILITY: The controls feel much smoother and tighter than in the first game. For the PS3, the controls are wonderfully intuitive, though the lack of Sixaxis support make the falling sequences a little tougher for some. Starkiller rarely goes hopping off ledges or straight into the path of death, as he did in the first game. The only real complaint, as before, are the controls used for the Force Grip - it is more difficult to toss things around now, though easier to remember which stick does what. (5/5)OVERALL: Definitely a renter, this game is not worth its full price. It is worth getting for its status as, honestly, a work of art, though it suffers from length, dialogue, and continued Force Grip issues. May the Force be with you.

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. Get ready to jump out of your couch cushions!--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessGreat cooperative modePlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multi-player options","reviewerName":"G","summary":"A little worried","reviewText":"Now let me state, that this is a good game on the most part. I have played the Alpha and things have really been strolling along on the game. I have a few concerns, although. But let me start with the good things:This game is following the story of the original DoomThe graphics and sound are INCREDIBLEBesides that, there really isn't any much else. This game is more like a demo showing off a new graphics engine than a full new game. To start, it has the same boring gameplay as the original doom. Get real! FPSs have changed a lot since 1996! People don't want to go searching for keys anymore! We don't want to type in pass codes! This game should really be called Doom: Revised. If they didn't base the game off of the original doom, they would have had a lot more flexability for making the game true to the times. But because of that, they can't do it now.Another complaint is that the multiplayer is only going to support four players. I couldn't believe I heard correctly when I was told this. 4 PLAYERS?! I mean, comon, you have to be kidding me! FPS games are supposed to have good multiplayer, and four players is not going to cut it! If they want you to have only four players in a multiplayer game, its like having a 10 player match in Unreal Tournament. It just can't happen! Multiplayer servers are supposed to sport large player capacities, and if Doom 3 (or should I say: Doom: Revised) cannot even support a good ammount of players per server, what is that going to say about other games using this engine? Quake 4 is going to come out with this graphics engine. Does this mean that we can only have four players in our deathmatch games in Quake 4? I will go mad if I have to have a match against ONLY 4 PEOPLE in a server of quake. Quake is KNOWN for its extreme deathmatch games. I would not tollerate 4 player games.To conclude, this is a must have for any doom fan. But it really needs some work. We don't want key searches in single player, and we want A LOT MORE players than 4 per multiplayer server.~Andrew","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2003"}

An engaging strategy epic where you try to survive battles against secret cults and powerful, mysterious wizards.","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Best RPG of '04","reviewText":"Last year did not see too many great games until the final 4 months.  During that time we saw some some great FPSs (Halo 2, Half Life 2), a new entry in the Grand Theft Auto saga, a new Metal Gear Solid and two really good rpgs, Nocturne and Shadow Hearts: Covenant.Covenant is a direct sequel to Shadow Hearts 1.  While you don't have to play SH1 to understand the story to SH2, it really helps because it explains the backstory of the main character Yuri and why he is who he is and why the world is at the stage its at.  What's interesting about the story is that, for those who have played SH1, everything you know from the first game changes.  Motives are more fully revealed and twisted, people who you thought were evil were actually trying to do something good and some characters make surprising returns.The story is so good, in fact, that it has become my favorite RPG that I've seen in ages.  Not only is it good but it is emotional and actually has a heart.  I don't want to ruin too much of the plot because it really is a thrilling story; however, there are moments of emotion that hark back to days of FFVII and the death of that pivotal character.  Along with the story, the characters are some of the most unique ones ever seen in an rpg.  From the puppet master who has to find \"stud cards\" to give to tailors so they will make him new outfits for his dolls, to a vampire wrestler with the unfortunate name 'The Grand Papillon' (The Great Butterfly), they range the gamut from hillariously absurd to strikingly original.Also back from the first game is the Judgement Ring.  This is part of the reason a lot of people were turned off by the first game.  In fact, while the first game was a chore to play at times because of the wheel, the Judgement Ring makes the combat in Covenant fun.  The wheel is now customizable so that you can increase the number of attacks, make the target areas smaller or larger to deal more damage.  It's pretty easy yet complex and fun.The graphics was another sore spot for the original especially since it came out mere weeks after the release of the beautiful Final Fantasy X.  Yet here in Covenant the graphics have had a major overhaul so that it is just as good as FFX.  Fully voice dialogue helps move the story along and excellent voice actors round out the aural qualities.  It's like the developers realized they needed to step up their game to compete.  And compete they should because this game has a whole package.A third game is in the works right now and I am anxious to see what new twists will enter the picture of what's becoming a historical fantasy saga.  For those looking for a unique and very good rpg, I would whole-heartedly recommend this game.  My only complaint for the game is that it seemed toned down from the first Shadow Hearts which received a Mature rating.  This game still has some tongue in cheek and darkly humorous moments, it is restrained in a way the first game was not.  But that is a minor quibble.  This game is excellent.  I cannot think of a reason those who love rpgs should not play it.A must buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2005"}

It was one of the old PS2 games I'm pretty sure. Although I remember it being quickly a waste of my time because I hate games that leave no room for creativity and ingenuity. The last Splinter Cell game I played there was one way to progress through the nighttime scenarios with the conveniently placed and actually pretty stupid terrorists, yet it was the lousy controls that caused you to struggle to move through the environment and actually get shot without any cause for prevention by the stupid terrorists.Forget that for now. Thankfully, through my own good fortune, I managed to get my hands on the newest version of \"Splinter Cell: Blacklist\" for the PS3.  Once again, this game is incredibly difficult and the scenarios range from hard to impossible to navigate, but this time it is for all the right reasons.It's hard because it's real. The tactics you must use and the intelligence of the terrorists you are dealing with are the best I've ever seen from a game. You die, because you should. That was a stupid move to go there and because you can't heal yourself from a single bullet to the skull like most games allow you to, you died. Within 5 minutes of the game, I had forgotten about that awful experience I had with a previous \"Splinter Cell\" game and even though I was dying left and right, it was because, quite simply, I deserved to and I got better at it. Now, when I complete a mission, it's because I know that I've learned tactics and wrongfully so, believe that I am ready for real blacklist situations. Sign me up.The animation is absolutely fantastic, the realism is top notch, the language is aggressive (not for young kids) and the violence is realistic, bloody and again, not for kids. The only downfall I would attribute to this game is that it is extremely difficult, but I've never had so much fun failing at something in my life. It's your terrorist situation and there are multiple ways to achieve that objective, but the danger is real and mistakes are costly; exactly the way they should be.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2013"}

It looks and feels pretty much just the same as a standard Sony controller, but the wireless performance is fantastic, and It's still on the first set of batteries that I put in it about 4 months ago- even with an average of about 3-6 hours of gaming for about 5 days a week. It should be noted that I turn the vibration function off, which supposedly makes the batteries last MUCH longer. So far this seems to be true. The controller goes into sleep mode if you go 5 or 10 minutes without pressing anything so batteries are conserved that way as well.The performance is outstanding. In our room, the PS2 system is fully blocked from plain view by a large bedpost, and therefore the wireless receiver is blocked along with it. Yet this controller still works, with no stalling whatsoever, even though it's blocked by a solid object (and even if I don't point the controller anywhere near the receiver). In fact, the controller has passed the ultimate test I could give it. My girlfriend often sleeps while I stay awake at night to play the PS2. The buttons are a bit clicky, so to not wake her up I've folded a blanket on top of me to muffle the sound. Yet the controller still works perfectly as well as a connected one. Under a thickly wadded blanket, from ten feet away, with an object in front of the receiver. The controller STILL works. I just have to make sure the receiver senses the controller at first, and then I'm free to move around with no problems at all.This is the best wireless controller I've had for a system, period. It's just as solid as a default Sony PS2 controller but with the addition of full, forgiving wirelessness. I haven't had a single issue or problem with it, and if I can play it under a thick blanket, with the receiver blocked, without even pointing the thing at the system, I can't imagine that it won't meet anyone's gaming needs. I swear by this one and won't get another wireless brand again. In fact, I've since bought the Logitech wireless Xbox controller, and though I've only had it for a couple weeks, I'm getting the same results. Fine build from what looks to be a solid company. Definitely reccommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000IONGVI","description":"THE LAND OF MYSTERY MEETS THE LEGEND OF SPEED. Sonic races through the exotic world of the Arabian Nights to harness the awesome power of the secret rings before they fall into the hands of the evil genie, Erazor! The blue dude is unstoppable with the new ability to slow time and boost forward faster than ever, but he's never gone up against a genie before!","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"Sonic steps up","reviewText":"Sonic hasn't aged very well. His fast, hyperactive youth has long since been replaced by mediocrity and disappointment. Once an A student, this hedgehog was sent to the counselor and in need of serious changes, lest he be shunned further away from his gaming peers. SEGA and Sonic Team seem to have done just right with their little blue guy; Sonic and the Secret Rings marks his first appearance on Wii and he shows a lot of promise and improvement.Our hedgehog friend is awakened one day by a genie named Shahra. Her dilemma is that the Erazor Djinn is erasing pages right out of the book Arabian Nights, and without Sonic's immediate help, Erazor will destroy the story in the book and begin dominating Sonic's world. The story is a departure from the typical Dr. Robotnik schemes of the past, but familiar characters make an appearance in the Arabian-themed world. Unfortunately, the story doesn't take advantage of Wii hardware as much as it could. Similar to Elebits, Red Steel, and Trauma Center: Second Opinion, the majority of the story is told in artistic frames rather than real-time scenes.Sonic's disappointing line of recent games have shared similar problems; bad camera angles, terrible controls, and uninspired level design have since been thorns in his shoes. Sonic and the Secret Rings fixes this problem by being much more like the hedgehog's two-dimensional adventures. In fact, it is accurate to say that the game plays like the 2D games, only turned forward so that Sonic is running into the screen rather than to its side. Using Wii's motion-sensing controller, all of the gameplay is done by turning the remote to its side and tilting it, pressing buttons to jump, brake, and activate special moves. Moving Sonic around the screen as he constantly runs forward is a breeze, and feels similar to but better than games like Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam and Excite Truck. Not all control mechanics work so well, but I'll get to that in a second.The gameplay is fleshed out in Adventure Mode, which features seven different worlds and more than 100 missions to play. Missions range in difficulty and ask different things of Sonic. Some simply ask that he reach a certain point, others have him collecting rings, defeating enemies, or racing against the clock. As Sonic completes missions and earns experience points, he can earn and equip different skills that let him become an even more agile character. These skills vary in utility: some expand Sonic's homing attack range or increase the smoothness of his running and sliding, others aren't as useful and allow him to do things like hop backward and harm enemies. Adventure Mode is quite deep and offers, at the very least, 15-20 hours of gameplay. Earning gold medals on all of the missions would take much, much longer.Sonic's only gameplay flaws come from some of the inconsistent mechanics. Sonic's homing attack is sometimes wild and uncontrollable and often sends him flying past enemies or objects that he's locked onto. Jumping is done differently here than in any other Sonic game: rather than pressing the 2 button to send Sonic into the air, Sonic has to \"charge\" his jump with the press of the 2 button. This makes jumping a heinous task that it shouldn't be. Moving backward at any time during the game is particularly annoying, since the camera doesn't reverse or even pan out to allow for an improved view of what's behind Sonic. Stoppage in the fast-paced action is abrupt and sometimes forced; for example, the camera mechanics and level design go hand-in-hand. Some obstructions were intentionally placed in the levels to slow the game down and allow the camera to catch up; this certainly detracts from the fast sense of speed and seems like a cheap way to put in difficult jumps and platform sequences. These gripes actually don't harm the overall experience much, but they come along and are definitely worth mentioning.Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is the only Wii title to date that looks better than Sonic and the Secret Rings. Sonic's Arabian surroundings vary in design and detail. The levels are all quite different in theme, and therefore look nothing like each other. The floating sky levels, sandy deserts, the pirate ships-they're all fun to look at and run through. Special effects are done very well for the most part. Unfortunately, the soundtrack is among the worst in video games. I'm not sure why Sonic Team and SEGA are adamant about featuring such crummy music for their spunky character, and Sonic and the Secret Rings has quite possibly the most annoying background menu music I've ever heard. Fortunately the voice acting isn't as miserable as it has been in the past and the sound effects are appropriate.Sonic's Adventure mode isn't the only noteworthy feature: there's a four-player party mode that has around 40 mini-games to play. It's a very nice addition to the game that would almost make a fine game on its own; in fact, the only multi-player games on Wii that offer more are Rayman Raving Rabbids! and Wii Sports. The multi-player offering doesn't ever feel shallow, either-in my experience, the game lasted for quite a lot of time and never ceased to be entertaining.Sonic still isn't quite up to grade with his peers, but at least he's managed to get around the harsh reprimands of his critics (mostly). Sonic and the Secret Rings is a great addition to one's Wii library. I'd hope that in the future, SEGA and Sonic Team work on improving this formula rather than that used in the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 Sonic the Hedgehog title. Sonic on Wii is much more entertaining, accessible, and most of all, fun.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2007"}

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization.

After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists.

But, I can say the game has kept me engaged, and coming back for more. I wish the story, or npc characters on Pandora was the reason I played.. but owell.The environment is kind of Blank though. Which looking at it from a logical way there are all of these large animals around the planet. There's several large bodies of water, you'd think there would be more vegetation. and in general more critters.Liked the style of the game. The whole 'Concept art look' made what would of been an otherwise monotonous grind, in to something a little less monotonous. Again, would have liked to of seen more vegetation, and just a more lively world. A little more story. Let the world be more of a character.I loved the opening song of the game. That was awesome. And the intro in general was okay. But would have liked to see the space ship landing or something of that nature. Because your referred to as an \"Off Worlder\" but you come riding in on a bus. Wtf?I don't know about all of the characters history. But I will say if there as Shallow as Rolands, I would have much preferred no character story at all, especially if they can't pull it off as good as Fallout 3 did. And would of rather just had some kind of character customization feature. Design my own character from the ground up, set up my special attack, of my choosing.. (Ie the characters special moves like in game). And been on my merry way.It sucked that I couldn't just buy pouch upgrades from the store, and it sucked I had to be at a certain level, to upgrade my ammo slots, since money seemed to be such a big thing, it'd been much nicer if I had the money I could get the upgrades. Level should not have played a part in that. As a matter of fact, I needed more ammo at the beginning when my proficiency was lower. Not having pouch upgrades available earlier in the game like I mention is a huge pain in the ass.  I also would have liked to have a Claptrap as a sidekick in the game. That followed me around like a pack mule. Playing some kind of supporting role that I could customize at a shop or tune up place. Example: Attack, heal, defense, Precision shots increase...something of that nature.Speaking of the Claptrap, god those little robots were so freaking annoying, and not very useful at all.I hated the fact the whole planet was apparently a prison planet or something like that...  because it freaking sucked constantly fighting the local. I'd rather just fought monsters.. that you know, coughed up valuable items.. from the previous treasure hunters they had eaten.  It really became a chore fighting bandits all the damn time. It was like there was a lack of virtual human contact in the game. The characters I met, didn't really have much to say. The characters that I met, who actually had something say, were usually the ones trying to kill me.One thing I really did like, that I thought the game developer pulled off very well. Was vehicle control. Excellent job on that. And Excellent job on the first person shooting bit. And the whole gun system. Top notch as far as that goes.Although I do have a small complaint about the gun aiming system. If I have have the cross hairs of my gun, aimed right at the spot between my enemies eyes.. I should hit them. Stats, should not play a part in that. That was pure torture, having a sniper rifle.. and it having an accuracy of 98.7 percent, but because my proficiency in that area was low. I still couldn't hit my enemies as well as I would have liked. That was frustrating.I\"m sure the entire planet of Pandora wasn't explored... It has a lot of potential with the right people.I give em A+ for effort. Because design wise the game is really well done I think. It's not perfect. But really well done.But the world, the story.. it feels tacked on. And its shallow. This game really seems to be all about grinding and gun collecting. Its fun in its own way. But you have to stick with it for awhile. Those first few levels.. clawing your way to the top. And ammo upgrades. Well you have to work for it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2009"}

Everything else, not so much.  However, I'm not going to make this a direct comparison between the two consoles.  Because right now, in my mind, they are two completely different consoles for two completely different audiences.The 360, as it stands right now, is by far the leader in gaming.  Better games, better game play mechanics, etc, etc.  However, for someone who can't play games all day, the PS3 is the clear-cut champion.  The built in Blu-Ray drive, Wi-Fi, and Web Browser make this machine a winner for those of us who enjoy playing games (just not all the time), and want a center for our next gen media center.Again, I'm not saying that it will always be this way.  Who know, maybe Microsoft will put out an attachment for Blu-Ray?  Or maybe they'll add another SKU with built in Blu-Ray and Wi-Fi. And maybe, just maybe, the PS3 will come out with one killer app with mass appeal.So, if you're into gaming, get a 360.

( another thing if you dont have a mic, dont be a squad leader your not doing anyone anygood if your not talking to your team) as leaders in some matches you have airstrikes, and morter attack, and the ability to lead. if your doing what you squad leader tells you to do u get double the points, but if he messes up its not your fault you lost. enter this game to work as a team, and work together. ive won 31 out of 35 matches because we worked as a team. if you do teamwork it can help your team out alot. every time you rank up u get a skill point that u can use to upgrade weopons or buy new weopls. or even buy the ability to heal people( whitch is a good way to rank up u get 10-20 xp per person you heal) the maps are nicely done and arnt to big but arnt to small. sometimes nothing might not be going on in your area at the time. but i promise you when it does hit the fan its crazy, granades going everywhere, rpg, people nifing, just a great experience. dont miss out on this great experience, but if you looking for a run and gun, dont get this game, but if you wanna work as a team, and earn you victories. pick this up and if not its atleast a rental for everyone.you will not regret this game and please regret the one star reviews because even the people that gave it one star said the game was good, they were just mad the server was down for 2 hours whitch is dumb to me but who cares im having a blast.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2010"}

I started with Leon's campaign and honestly almost quit twice because I was so bored with it during the first part of the game.  There are so many cut scenes that interrupt gameplay and so little action or decision making.  At times it almost felt like a rail shooter because it's just walking from one point to another and shooting things that pop up.  It wasn't scary and the graphics, sorry to say, are pretty crappy.  Things do get better as the game progresses and in other campaigns but there are still way too many cinematic sequences and the ammo is in super short supply through all campaigns. At times it felt like I was watching a movie rather than playing a game. Through the first at least 20 minutes of the game, you have nothing more to do than press A or X or toggle the left controller as the action takes place on the screen.  Just prior to getting RE 6 I played through Borderlands 2 and there is no comparison.  Borderlands 2 blows RE 6 out of the water in terms of gameplay and graphics.  I have been an RE fan since the beginning of the series back on GameCube but after the disappointment of Operation Raccoon City and now this, I don't think I'm going to be so quick to order new releases.  If I had waited and bought a used copy or until the price went down, it wouldn't feel like I'd been cheated.  For $59.99 I want to be impressed and this just didn't do it for me.  My advice is wait.

BADER \"Q8  AL BADER\"","summary":"This game rocks!","reviewText":"Although the reviews by the critics are bad, they really have no right to say thoes things. this game is a mix of racing, police pursuits,upgrading your cars to be the best of the best, betting your cars in pinkslip wagers, burinig up the freeway just to veer onto the wrong side and get into a 250mph head on crash(but that just might be me) and so much more. with only a small part of the storyline actually sequenced, you can race through the whole game with as little as 10 cut scenes! this game is one that opens a door into the future of racing and NOTHING i have played even comes close to being as good as this. It is money very well spent and i would recomend this to people who like suping up their lambroghinis and taking them out for a 200mph cruise down the 101 freeway just to end up with a cop pointing a shotgun at your head yelling for you to put your hands up and step out of the car!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2009"}

The graphics look better, the combat has improved, there is more to do in multiplayer including several different game variatians and 9 maps to begin with! This is the final story of Ezio Auditore Da Firenze and Altair, so if you havent played any other AC game, then I strongly suggest you start at the beginnging. For the yest of you, get ready for a huge treat. Constantinople is a huge breathing city with many elements returning from Brotherhood such as assassin recruitment (even though this is more detailed by far), and buying out old properties to gain your own money for weapons, capes, other building etc. A new edition is the hook blade which is nice to reach higher ledges and slide down ropes from building to building, and the new bomb crafting system which is extremely cool. There are over 300 different combinations of bombs you can craft yourself, but the system is easy to learn so dont feel intimidated. Bottom line this game is packed with things to discover, people to meet, and stories to conclude. This is the greatest AC game YET!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2011"}

The graphics are vastly improved and the gameplay feels more fine tuned than ever. There are a ton of unlockables and things to do with the modes that are available. Online I had problems and I think it was my Internet not the Nintendo server (I have the slowest DSL there is). But what few matches played lag free for me were a blast. This game is just mainly improvements to the original formula and with online it extends that formula even longer and also there's even more characters and one that I am glad is in this game is Solid Snake! One thing I find odd is a lot of people hate the subspace emissary mode but I thought it was a great addition as when I was growing up you had side scrollers and this is what Subspace Emissary is and the controls are spot on. Man if the controls to sidescrollers were this good when I was a kid I probably would of had a few less NES controllers. Anyways Subspace has cutscenes to move the story but It does not do a whole lot for the experience but at the same time adds a little more to it. For the most part its hard not to recommend Brawl the game is just plain fun and with quite a few more characters than there was in Melee I can say Brawl is an awesome game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2009"}

Loved Arkham Azylum GOTY and now took this one!Well I just should have wait a little more to get it for less, but it's a great add to my collection, I were playing Uncharted 2 and 3 weeks before get this. Now I'm playing this every time I can. Love the game as it is. Well, concerning the catwoman DLC, yes loved to play as catwoman, diferent moves mean more challenging... By the way as other reviewers say, it doesn't add to the story. Really liked to play as Robin. I will update my review after finish the game and play some challenges.You can get an own experience by downloading the game demo. Batman moves are incredible! Much more enhanced than Arkham Asylum.Update: Concerning the DLC's I got some troubles as I were getting platinum in uncharted both 2 and 3, I stopped playing Batman Arkham City for about one week. I came back to it and it appears me that my save data is corrupt. Well I went to internet to solve it and as I did not wanted to delete all my progress, the solution been delete the saved game in game data utility. So I installed it again and worked fine, there are people saying that you can solve that by copying the saved game from saved data utility to a USB devise and then delete your progress and copy/paste from your USB (did not worked to me).A game like that GOTY must be fixed AND DO NOT PRESENT SUCH OF THOSE PROBLEMS. All in all it's a great game but because of that issue I rate it with  four stars.Sorry concerning my english.Concerning the cover, Both Arkham Asylum GOTY and Arkham City GOTY covers are full of things, well I don't care; but if you want, you can enhance it by taking the one that comes inside the game as a cover to your bundle (it's not thick at all).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0053BSNZU","description":"","reviewerName":"Zalmorion the Fantastic","summary":"Authentic UFC Fun","reviewText":"This has got to be the most realistic fighter since the Fight Night series.  In fact, it is feels like a combination of Fight Night and WWE2k14.Like Fight Night, the animations and game play are slower, your character has to train to improve his skills between fights, and the character models range from perfect to a bit goofy (Brock Lesnar, for example, looks a bit too thin and like a monkey.  lol).  Like the WWE game, there are a lot of customization options and techniques to choose from.  So, no two fighters you build ever have to play the same way.  You choose which techniques to learn and level up.You manage your training, your camp goals, your game-plans, and your sponsors between fights.  The results of your choices and your training performances determine whether or not you get stronger, get faster, improve footwork, learn moves, etc.The sound in incredible!  The actual voices of Joe Rogan, Bruce Buffer, Mike Goldberg, the refs!  Rocking soundtrack music, authentic tunes that the UFC uses to this very day, and excellent sound effects in the ring.The roster is full of big names you will know, even if you are only a casual MMA fan.  If you have been paying attention since PRIDE, you are going to love the fighters offered.Presentation is authentic UFC.  It gets you pumped up for the fiight, features pre-fight commentary like every UFC Fight Night.  A lot of nice touches here.  It feels like you are fighting on a card in the UFC.  (or Pride)The only CONS?  The training between fights gets tedious and frustrating.  Movement inside the octagon is slow and sometimes frustrating.  Load times are a bit too long a bit too often.  Some moves are difficult to pull off.  The ground game is not as exciting as the stand-up.BUT, everything else is nearly perfect and the game is a lot of fun to play.  Also, I wish they would have given us a few fun treats, like letting us play as Joe Rogan, Dana White, Bruce Buffer, and Mike Goldberg!!!Ultimately. this is a nearly perfect game that needs very little improvement.  Once the UFC games get a strong women's MMA feature and improve gameplay issues, this will be a franchise we'll a;; buy every year the way we do WWE games, COD, Battlefield, etc.BUY IT.  Worth three times as much as is being charged now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0002CNUN0","reviewerName":"Bill.B \"Bill\"","summary":"Another Great Tony Hawk Game!","reviewText":"I've been playing Tony Hawk ever since the original on the Playstation and Nintendo 64.  The franchise has gone a long way since.  The Tony Hawk Underground games seem to be going with a good formula that works.  This game has a very funny storyline and a long line of selectable characters.  There's two different modes which are story mode and classic mode which has the old tony hawk goals with the 2 minute timer.  This game has awesome graphics and you can keep adding on to your tricks with long combos.  You can throw a tomato at a guy, spray paint, go in the new slow mo and walk for a while all in the same combo.  The goals are pretty good and very.  Some of the goals are really hard and challenging.  There's a lot of levels in this game including 15 in classic mode alone.  So if you think about it there's a lot of changes in this game.  It still feels like they could of done more in a way but it's kind of hard for this franchise to get new ideas because they already have a perfect formula going.  If you enjoyed the last underground game or any other tony hawk game you should definitly consider giving this a rent or buy it like me.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2004"}

IMO for the most part it has been for little kids. But in the back of my mind i knew they would eventually shift away from prime and go back classic metroid and when that day came i would be forced to humble myself and buy a wii. well that day came and i found myself purchasing a console for only one game and i don't regret a penny. this is samus better than ever with next-gen treatment. gameplay reminds me of final fantasy 13, its linear but in a good way. i LOVE that its not an arcade-style story. while super metroid is arguably the greatest game ever made, lets be honest, there was little story if any at all. other m has beautiful cutscenes and really cool environments. i only have 2 complaints. one is the replenish system, i do miss getting ammo and health from killing bad guys, in this you can only do it at save points. the second is a minor one to me that seems to have upset a lot of people in that the d-pad is the only controller option. i hate the wii controls period but i would have liked to be able to use the classic controller. neither of these robbed this game of being great, they just would have been nice. all in all this was an excellent game and a must buy for any wii owner","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2010"}
