{"product_name":"B000R2XJJK","reviewerName":"Michael D. Cooper","summary":"Excellent Story, Excellent Visuals, Excellent Dialogue","reviewText":"As a fan of some European games such as the Gothic series, I got my hopes up pretty high when I heard this one was making it into the States.  I was a bit disheartened to learn that the U.S. version is somewhat censored (self-censored by the publisher, not the government or ESRB), and owning the uncensored version I can tell you that the differences are mostly minor and do not detract overall from the story.Being built on the NWN engine, you wouldn't know it.  The entire rendering engine has been replaced, the control scheme is very different, and virtually the only thing I can say I recognized were some of the item highlights and inventory selection.  Instead of tilesets, the developer designed each area in 3DSMax, and imported them into the engine.The results are very fresh and unique areas, and each area has the 'look' that the developer envisioned.I have not read the books by the Polish author who came up with the idea, and I do not believe they are yet available here in the U.S., but I do have to say that the story is very engaging, the characters are believable, the interaction and choices are real, and this is a very 'deep' RPG which forces you to make real choices that have no apparent right or wrong answer.The world isn't black and white, and most RPGs are.  Not this one - every choice is shades of gray, and you will find it difficult to make decisions, sometimes which bear down to the lesser of two evils.If I had to compare it to other games, I'd say you had the story telling ability of Gothic, the feel of Knights of the Old Republic, and a bit of unique feel to the game.I believe this is worth the purchase, and even though I think the title of the game might put some people off, you won't be disappointed.There are no bugs to speak of, though a patch is available for download which fixes some minor annoyances.In all, I think this is a gem that may be overlooked by some at first glance, but for those who pick it up it will be one of those games you fondly remember as among your favorites.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2007"}

Game is a classic. NO SPOILERS","reviewText":"Don't believe 1 word you hear from those criticizing this game. They're completly unfounded. As someone who has played the vast majority of RPGs ever made i can tell you first hand that the Story in Suidoken III isn't just great, it's one of the best ever. In fact when judgeing all the RPGs available on the modern systems (GC, PS2, XBOX) Suidoken III in my book is tied with Zelda The Windwaker for best RPG.The trinity sight system is simply an amazing concept, and works well throught the game. Just playing the first chapter the player goes through a rollercoaster of emotions seeing the opening events play out through the different perspectives of those involved.The combat has very little of a hack and slash feel - it's very much turned based, with a realistic real time feel. What does that mean? It means that you direct your characters to perform actions, attacks are done in turn (based on individual speed) and characters will redirect attacks as practical based on changing battle conditions (formation changes, deaths etc.) The battle system blends real time action and strategy very well (erasing the down side of turn based combat - realism and the lack of strategy that comes with real time combat) and this just scratches the surface, there are also individual duals, and military comand combat (where you direct groupings of soildiers)The only real downside of this game is what is often a lack of direction. I often seemed a little lost trying to figure out what to do next, but this really does little to distract from how great, and addictive this game is. This game is a MUST BUY, especially if you love games like Chrono Cross, Zelda and Final Fantasy","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2004"}

Now he's chasing them across the Game Boy Advance inCastlevania: Circle of the Moon. He'll use his trusty whip, as well as a few magical items, to combat Dracula and more than just a few foul minions. The game takes advantage of the GBA's rich color palette to create detailed, moody environments and intricate spell effects.","reviewerName":"John. N","summary":"Replicating the magic of Symphony is not so easy...","reviewText":"Castlevania: Circle of the Moon is a game with which I have a checkered history. The first time I played Circle of the Moon the experience was not positive as I got to an antagonizing boss fight (which is the \"polite\" way of putting it) at the halfway point, quit and sold off my cart. However, since that point I've been making it a point to get all the Castlevania releases (don't ask me about putting down the massive amount of money Dracula X costs) and well, I figured this was just one bridge that had to be crossed... even if I had to use the cheapest tricks in the book to cross it. Needless to say there were certain parts I still felt were incessantly cheap when I replayed it - and I replied in kind - but I did manage to finish it. However, I can say right now it's a game I will not be revisiting much.But why? At first I couldn't really but my finger on why Circle of the Moon is such a chore but the closer I got to the end of the game the clearer it became. Unlike Symphony of the Night (which is good but is psychotically overrated by the series fandom) Circle of the Moon wants to be more reminiscent of the pre-Symphony titles (mostly in the difficulty department) while making use of Symphony's gameplay. This odd concoction of old and new is simply bizarre and is reflected in nearly every aspect of the game from its somewhat depressing color palette to the fact that the story is barely existent/important. Additionally, as trite as it may seem for an action game of this variety, I think I might have cared more about the game if I actually cared about the game's protagonist. I can't really point the finger square at Nathan being a bad character due to lack of development as this is fairly commonplace in Castlevania games - here's a castle, go kill Dracula - but the fact that Nathan isn't a Belmont is a pretty big blow to the setup.There are few other irritations to be encountered as well. Personally I found the copy-and-paste-from-previous-games soundtrack to be very disappointing as half the fun of Metroidvania games is hearing the new tunes. Then there's the fact that half the time I spent playing the game was dedicated to grinding for DDS cards which just brings the game to a halt (which the Underground Waterway does a good job of as well) and the last two boss fights couldn't possibly be more night and day from one another - e.g. you better be good at dodging Dracula's ultra damaging dash attack or you will never beat the game.In the end Circle of the Moon isn't a bad game, but to me it just does all sorts of little, irritating things (there are unfortunately many more I didn't mention) that add up to a massive migraine. Personally the game's only saving grace is the fact that it is inexpensive and easy to procure but if I was going to play Castlevania on the GameBoy Advance I'd rather play Aria of Sorrow any day of the week. I can't hate on Circle of the Moon that much, or suggest that people avoid it, but the truth is Konami has done much better than this - even if you exclude Symphony of the Night.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2013"}

GOTY in what century? At first I thought it was a joke and I am talking about the graphics. In this genre ala Just Cause or Metro 2033 or Armaggedon or Serious Sam or any of those near future scenarios you do expect SOME diviation of sorts but this thing is so appallingly bad that it almost takes your breath away. Shocked comes to mind. It flat out looks cartoonish. And it goes down hill from then on. I always try to find the good in a game but this thing just plain sucks. The goofy robot, the goofy characters, the weapons, it just goes on and on. Now mind you I can see where a three or four year old would love it but c'mon man. Think I'm kidding? I wish I were. This is truly a game that you have to demo first and am kicking myself for not doing that. I did read the reviews but must've missed something either that or they were written by the developers. Yep just looked at 'em again and 104 people gave it an overall 4 stars. I feel like I am from another planet. In all fairness when taking the CD code and pasting it to Steam it did add all the DLC content, big deal, I am giving this one a thumbs down. I am going to try and pawn it off on some young relatives. This is my second 1 star rating after appoximately 50 or so pc games.***UPDATE***10/06/2012 After further review and everything that I said I reluctantly have to agree that I erred in my first take. This game is and probably will be a money maker in the future simply because of how it plays and the way you can co-op online and it is NOT about how it looks but more about the fun it is to play. Sorry if I stepped on a few toes along the way and I agree it is a solid four star game. And btw got BL2 and it is a blast.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2012"}

Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life.

The plot isn't going to win any Pulitzers but is good by video game standards - it divides the game into seven or so smaller adventures on different worlds, and each one of these worlds is well-put together with a lot of atmosphere.The main question is if it works on a 360, and the answer to that is...almost.  Maybe 20% of the dialogue stutters and 10% of the dialogue is interrupted by spikes of static.  It doesn't hurt the actual gameplay, but it doesn't help the immersion of what's supposed to be a cinematic game.  Also, the game was seriously buggy, which I guess was also true when played on the original XBox.  The most serious bug was on Tantooine, after dealing with the sand people.  After walking around town for a few seconds, the game would suddenly freeze.  I wanted to throw the controller for a second, until I realized if I dashed inside another location nearby, and then walked back out, the error would go away.

It's a detailed, overly-long but well-made RPG. You can assemble a group of Star Wars creatures on your team and run around the galaxy. Or take tiny races on a pod, but it's more like a chore. The dialogue is often dry despite the comments you can choose, a lot of the aliens go on and on about pride/loyalty and boring [stuff] like that. One thing I found dumb and unoriginal was how this story takes place before Ep. 1, and yet the universe looks so much darker &amp; grittier than even ESB. The Jedi haven't even been offed yet and everything is just as dirty as Vader's reign. Things look like a Babylon5 episode. A lot of the aliens are different colored versions of critters from the movies with names like Davik, Zaalbar, Juhani, etc. There was also glitching and a troubled save system. It's what you'd expect to get, at least --and that's the best we've gotten from Star Wars in years. =D","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2003"}

All the aesir can do is fight the machines to a stand still which apparently is causing their world to slowly be consumed by winter. In this backdrop comes Baldur who suffered somekind of accident that badly injured him and killed his wife. He is convinced that there is a new threat lurking out beyond the \"wall\". He is soon proven right and soon discovers a third meance that may mean the end of the aesir race if not stopped.===========If the above is a bit confusing and vague, then hopefully it gives an idea of trying to make out whats going on when actually playing the game. Now on to the game. I think this is what happens when a developer trys to take all the games that were popular over the last 10 years (with a heavy emphasis on diablo) or so and mashs them all together. When it works it works, when it works great Baldur is walking, air juggling death machine that that smashs through anything and anyone that gets in his way. Unfortunatley when one of the bits that didn't mash quite right pops up it knocks down the whole house of cards. Just about all of the issues have been mentioned else where, in great detail with with much description so I'll let the reader go find them, elsewhere. My main complaints with the game are the pacing, the dungeons and the controls. The pacing is more or less the story mentioned above, to me there was no real reason to want to go to the next dungeon or to want to go onto the next cut scene. If your going to copy Diablo then at least figure out what made the formula work and why people still play the thing. The story may not have been the most orignal or the greatest, but it made sense and finding out what happened next fit perfectly with finding a ton of interesting loot. Secondly the dungeons, for starters the ones I played all kinda looked the same, go down hall fight small monsters and then go into a big room where you fight a lot of small monsters and a couple of big monsters and then repeat until you get to the end where you fight a really big monster that is a nusiance to beat. Don't worry though you can't really die, it takes you more or less 30 seconds to respawn. This may not sound like a long time but when you keep getting killed because you get swarmed it adds up. Which brings me to the controls which lead the player to seeing the valkeryie slowly come down and slowly go up alot. If baldur is being nice to you then the sword work (mark of kri)and the gun play (DMC)actually work togther to make a fairly enjoyable combat experience. The problem is that pesky camera issue some game makers get and some game makers need to get. The actual problem is that the player does not control the camera. You have a choice of near, far, close and hit the Left Bumper if you want to spin the camera in the direction being faced by Baldur and if you happen to hit an enemy in the opposite direction of you have fun shooting or slicing air unless your lucky and the auto target decides to work. My usual luck was that I would knock the enemy in the air and the halfworking auto target would miss that and I would shoot up the scenery. Also there does seem to be an emphasis in this game for co-op, one of the pop up tutorials even says some of the bosses are better taken on with another player. All in all I had to give up on this game around the time Loki escapes just because the dungeon following that brought all of these issues to a head and had me banging my head against the wall. If you like diablo and don't mind dealing with a wonky control system and/or you have someone to play this game with in on-line co-op mode then you might get a good time out of it. Everyone else should rent before buying, I'm glad I did.Graphics: GreatStory: Would proably be interesting if it made some more sense, apparently at the end there is a shocker/cliff hangerControls/Camera: Hopefully they will make sure this actually works right when they release the sequel.

Gibbs \"Horror Soundtrack Collector\"","summary":"Good movie to game","reviewText":"Now that the price is down on TRON, it's worth a buy.  If you like the movies and the look of the TRON world, this game nails down both very well.  The movement of the game takes a bit (no pun intended) to get down, but once you are in swing, it's pretty easy.  Yes, there are a few frustrating moments, but honestly, I never gave up.  I was reminded of old console games where you just couldn't make that one jump, but you were dying to see what was up ahead.  The light cycles in the multiplayer are awesome and represent the wall-making-crash very well.  The tank sequence plays out nicely and the graphics overall are pretty flawless.  The music comes straight from the movie (daft punk) and seams together some fairly nice action scenes.  It's aminly a fighting game and while you'll earn upgrades, they can only be used in multiplayer.  The multiplayer is fun enough to keep you busy for a while, but overall is nothing phenomenal.  It would be cool to see a retro-TRON arcade game add-on, but I don't think it will happen with the licensing.  If you dig TRON and want to inhabit it's lair, this is actually a great movie-to-game.  I recently played Captain America which got high reviews and despite it's outstanding graphics, was instantly bored with it.  TRON delivers especially at this price.  On a final note, the MOVE controller has no use in this game that I am aware of, so if you think you'll be tossing discs with your move controller, you won't.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2011"}

Denick","summary":"Drenched in style and saturated with speed, this is a Metal Gear like none other","reviewText":"Being a long time MGS fan, my hopes were not particularly high with this game. The absurd title, the ludicrous box art (which looks like something from the 90s), the temporary cancellation of the project, and the departure from the MGS tradition, all led me to believe that this was a disaster in the making (despite Platinum's fine track record). Fortunately, I've been pleasantly surprised by the quality of this game... \"Rising\" is a blast to play for anybody who enjoys action games (whether you're an MGS fan or not).Foremost, the game does manage to retain the feeling that it's actually occurring inside the MGS universe, despite its over-the-top nature (and in terms of physics, anything our protagonist does in \"Rising\" is not far from what Vamp achieved in MGS2 and 4). Longtime fans will be pleased by the inclusion of familiar sights, sounds, and themes, even if the gameplay is radically different. Raiden, of course, returns, and his inclusion as the protagonist is bound to please any MGS fan who has wanted to step into the shoes of a ninja on the level of the legendary Gray Fox.The heart of this game, like any action title, is its combat mechanics, and here \"Rising\" shines. Raiden moves with an effortless grace, and when he strikes, it carries a convincing \"weight\" that exceeds even the likes of \"God of War\" and \"Bayonetta\". His \"ninja run\" while goofy in name, is a blast to execute, as are his assortment of magnificent combos.When it comes to Japanese wackiness, I've pretty much seen it all at this point in my life. Giant robots, ninjas, and cyborgs generally come off as tired and cliched to me, but somehow, \"Rising\" makes these concepts seem fresh and EXCITING. What's the secret? The game uses a beautiful style of presentation that is incredibly slick, resulting in an artistic, vibrant mode of visual storytelling that is a pleasure to behold. Despite the ludicrous dialogue, mediocre voice acting, and marginal plot, the game's visual flair picks up the slack, and makes this somewhat-cheesy story work. It takes cyborg-ninjas (the \"Winds of Destruction\" are on par with finest of MGS bosses), and makes them viable, turning them into showmen that are simply a blast to watch and engage with. The gameplay is nicely balanced with expertly rendered cut scenes that always impress, and are kept to lengths that are actually appropriate (another breaking from MGS tradition). This game is so visually impressive, it actually made me want a bigger TV, to better digest the spectacle!The limitations of this game are as follows: The camera will fight against you a bit too often, particularly during blade mode, when it will inexplicably perform a 180 and send you facing the wrong way (while you're using your limited energy to pull off this special move). I hope this is corrected with a future patch. Another weak spot is that the mechanics, while largely intuitive, could have been explained much better during the game. I must have missed the part where they tell you how to parry (a skill you need in order to even get past the first boss, much less complete the game), and I actually had to go online to figure out how to do it. There is no explanation of parrying anywhere in the menus. Hint: Press \"square\" (X on the 360) and flick the analog stick at the incoming attack at just the right moment, in order to parry.The greatest weakness, however, is an ill-fitting soundtrack that simply does not fit with the world of MGS. Fortunately, you can go into the options from the menu and turn the music level down, while leaving the sound effects at their normal level. The soundtrack was a point of contention where Platinum butted heads with Konami. I feel that Platinum should have yielded to the judgement of Kojima and Konami on this subject, and once more retained the superb services of composer Harry Gregson-Williams.I rate \"Rising\" at 4, possibly 4.5 stars. Depending on the enjoyment that can be gleaned from additional play-throughs and the acquisition of unlockables, I may bump that rating up to 5 stars. This is by no means the best Metal Gear game, but it's a fantastic, thrilling ride by any measure.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000R0SRNU","description":"LucasArts LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga 33076 PC Games","reviewerName":"D. Surine \"Stanley\"","summary":"A Classic","reviewText":"I played both trilogies on my original xbox \"back in the day\" and I was thrilled to see both sets in one game on 360.  More importantly, I was very happy to see that the retail price had been reduced to a very doable $20, making it one of the best values for your system.Star Wars fans have been disappointed in the past with some of the games that have come out in recent years.  Force Unleashed was disappointing, Knights of Old Republic was just weird, Jedi Knight academy, the list keeps going.  In addition, most of these games have been their own separate story, and few have actually followed the plot line of the movies.  It's refreshing to play a game that's this much fun and also stays true to the movies.I can't think of another game (other than maybe another LEGO game) that appeals so much to both kids and \"grown ups\" alike.  I greatly enjoy this game, but I've also seen kids as young as 4 get hours of enjoyment out of this.  With that, I will say that the biggest con for this game is that sometimes it feels way too easy.  When flying, you could pretty much let go of the controls and rarely crash.  When up against 20 storm troopers, just hit X repeatedly.  Supposedly, the adaptive difficulty is intended to detect how good you are and adjust the difficulty accordingly.  Thus far, I don't really notice a difference.  But this set back is not enough to take away a star.Lastly, I think there's something to be said about a game that gets this high of marks that isn't shooting zombies or stealing drugs and money.  True there are blasters and light sabers, but the stylized way of bursting into LEGO pieces when you die is much less gruesome than seeing the blood spatter on the wall.  Lately, I've notice my game collection is filled more and more from the \"shoot-everything-that-moves\" genre, and it's nice to play something a little more wholesome.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2012"}

RPG games like X-men Legends and Jade Empire are better because although the characters in these games too have many abilities and options to choose from, I can easily access their choices very quickly, and fighting the enemy flows more smoothly and the characters can also battle on their own without me having to think for them all the time and dictate their every move.  I also don't like the fact that I have to level up level up level up in final fantasy games. Spending hours and hours leveling up makes me forget about what the story is all about, but then again, final fantasy has never been great on story telling.  Honestly, how many amnesiatic orphans exist in the world of final fantasy?  It's a good game though.  Sometimes it's fun to play final fantasy games, but sometimes it's not.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2010"}

Unfortunately, the gameplay kind of stinks.  The only thing that kep me going was the engrossing story.  The annoying fighting interface was sad.  The \"investigative\" tools and situations felt forced and contrived.  I get that the idea was to have a great story that you could interact in and drive as the main character.

Since then, government forces have managed to control the zombie threat and Leon has become a Federal agent. When the President's daughter is kidnapped, Leon tracks her to a remote, hidden fortress in Europe - where he'll relive the horror he faced six years before.   Players will face never-before-seen enemies that make Nemesis seem like a kitten. You'll be wishing for the usual Resident Evil zombies!","reviewerName":"tvtv3 \"tvtv3\"","summary":"Unravel a Worldwide Conspiracy","reviewText":"In RESIDENT EVIL 4, Leon Kennedy, the main character of RESIDENT EVIL 2, returns.  Leon is now a special agent of the U.S. government.  The President of the U.S. has had his daughter, Ashley, kidnapped and Leon is sent to rescue her.  Her location has been determined to be in a small, remote European village.  Leon is dropped off at the location by two police officers. Leon attempts to communicate with the locals but they try to kill him.  Leon survives the initial encounter, but the police officers who dropped him off meet a fate far worse.  It turns out that the local citizens, ganados (which is Spanish I believe for cattle), have been infected with an alien parasite.  Once infected the parasite eventually kills the person and takes over the body and those who are controlled by the parasites are under the command of certain \"leaders\".  The leaders of the ganados cult have very big plans for world domination and Ashley is an important key in those plans.  So Leon sets forth killing the villagers as he first finds and rescues Ashley.  It turns out that he and Ashley have both been infected with the parasite and before they can escape they have to find a cure.The game is pretty exciting and takes between 25-30 hours to complete for an average player. It also has a lot of replay value.  Most of the time you play as Leon, but sometimes the player plays as Ashley and there are a few instances where both characters must work together.  Out of all the weapons in the main game, I preferred to use the shotgun for close range fighting though Leon also has a knife which I would recommend, in order to save ammo, using for close range fighting with just one enemy.  Enemies aren't completely mindless in the game and reveal some intelligence, such as dodging attacks, carrying shields, and joint attacks from different fronts.  In my opinion besides some of the bosses the most difficult and frightening characters to fight where the chainsaw ganados.  Those things just freaked me out and it is worse hearing the chainsaws but not seeing where those particular enemies are.  Every time I heard that chainsaw noise while playing the game it gave me the creeps.The graphics are pretty decent, but it was the music which I found most haunting.  There were many times when Leon would commit a certain action and this haunting music would begin that gave me goosebumps because I knew some enemy was going to appear and sometimes they would just appear out of nowhere.  Something different from many other games is that you can't always relax during cutscenes.  Sometimes you have to perform actions that appear on the screen or Leon dies.Upon beating the game, several extra features are unlocked including different costumes for Leon and Ashley; a shooting mini-game entitled mercenaries where you can unlock up to five different players; a separate mini-story line entitled \"Separate Ways\" where you play as Ada Wong and learn more secrets that weren't revealed in the game; another mini-game entitled \"Assignment Ada\" where you play once again as Ada, but on a different assignment than the one in the main game; a movie browser where you can watch all of the cut scenes from both the main game and \"Separate Ways\"; and a list of Ada's files from \"Separate Ways\".A very entertaining game that is a nice addition to the Resident Evil franchise, even if there aren't any zombies.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2008"}

I knew the game was a prequel to HALO and that is was the last game in the Halo franchise the Microsoft allowed Bungie to develop. Since the game features a squad of Spartan soldiers, I knew that at the end of the game everyone was going to die. In that sense, the campaign mode is like watching TITANIC, you know everyone is going to die, but you don't know exactly how or where. At the same time I knew there had to be more to the campaign because there had to be a reason that the game revolved around this particular group of Spartans.The game begins when your character, known simply as \"6\", joins the elite Spartan team called Noble. 6 is a replacement to the group after the death of a previous member. Team Noble is sent to investigate why a relay station went off line. It is suspected that rebels are the cause, but as Team Noble discovers it's actually Covenant. The team discovers that the Covenant aren't just sending out a few strike teams to Reach, but that they are planning a full-fledged invasion of the planet. The game play takes you into space as you seek to board and infiltrate a super carrier and destroy. You return to reach and assist in the evacuation of civilians and are then summoned by Dr. Catherine Halsey herself to deliver a highly important package to the ship \"Pillar of Autumn\".As far as the campaign is concerned, I was disappointed by HALO REACH. I realize the events take place over a short period of time (just a few days). However, I was able to beat the campaign in just a few hours of gameplay. For a game that revolves around the fall (and massive battle) of one of humanity's last outer worlds, there wasn't enough action.With that said, what little of a campaign you do get to play is exciting. Even though you know the ultimate outcome of the game, there is some mystery going on. For instance, why is Team Noble and only Team Noble sent back to the former military Sword base after it falls and is taken over by the Covenant? Outside of the original Halo trilogy of video games, I don't have any knowledge about the Halo universe and I kept thinking that maybe it's because \"Noble 6\" is actually Master Chief; that this is his origins story and the events that make him become the hero he is in the original Halo trilogy of video games.I also really enjoyed the space fighting. It was great to actually be able to play some combat away from the surface of a planet or inside a ship and fly around and fight in a small fighter jet. That was a new element to Halo game play that I very much enjoyed.There are some new weapons and vehicles and some other weapons and vehicles have been modified, while others remain the same as they always have. For instance, the Warthogs, Ghosts, and Wraiths are all back but they have been modified; they aren't as impressive as they are in later Halo games. Meanwhile, the old standby shotgun is the same as it always has been. I liked this retro-feel of many of the vehicles and weapons because they really look and operate like earlier versions of the forms we see in later Halo games.Like most Xbox 360 games, the big selling point behind HALO REACH is the multiplayer experience. However, I'm really not a multiplayer person. I've played a few times with family members, and the options and advancements are impressive, but it's really not my thing.In short, the multiplayer experience is spectacular, but the overall campaign comes up a bit short. That doesn't mean HALO REACH is a bad game, it's just not as good as it could have been.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2010"}

Unfortunately it includes a few big (to me,anyway) missteps that are just plain uncool.The Good: 1. Incredible graphics. I own Assassin's Creed 4 on PS3 and took advantage of Sony's upgrade program to get it on PS4 for $10. The differences are very real and tangible, right from the get-go. From the stubble on Edward Kenway's face to the sight-hindering cannon-smoke during naval battles this game took beautiful to gorgeous on the new system. Call of Duty: Ghosts (while being a bit of a disappointing game) looks simply amazing. Killzone: Shadow Fall gives us players a glimpse at what next generation gaming should look like.2. The system user interface. Unlike many others, I though that the Xross Media Bar was pretty tired and needed some updating. Which Sony has done, in spades. Very intuitive and user friendly; everything I want is right there in front of me.The Bad:  1. Not such a big fan of the DualShock 4 LED light bar remaining on at all times. Can be a little annoying when you're playing Outlast in a dark room and your TV set is reflecting blue light back at you.2. The lack of any real mind-blowing launch titles. Yes, I realize this was a race to get a system on shelves to compete with XBox One, but come on Sony. You could have let your third parties in on the secret a little earlier, maybe?The Ugly:  1. No 3D Blu-Ray playback at launch. While I do realize this is a minor complaint for some people, I actually do enjoy watching the occasional 3D movie on my big, beautiful 3D TV. Which the PS3 has been allowing me to do for ages. Not including this functionality in the PS4 right off the bat is just Sony ignoring what they assume is a very small contingent of their gamers.2. The ever popular backward compatibility issue. Excuse me? My new $400 Sony monolith does not play CD's or MP3 files? Come again? PS3 games are also a no-go? This made some sense back in days that PS2 games were formatted for DVD and PS3 introduced Blu-Ray gaming, but the PS4 STILL USES BLU-RAY. Why am I going to have to wait for some cloud-based pipe dream in order to play games that I already have on disc. I guess by now I should expect this type of thing from Sony, but I still feel cheated.Anyway...overall a good system that could have been great.

Suffers from the same debilitating game mechanics and design.So, ultimately, this is mall number 2; just with some casinos in between. The mall is about the same size as the first. The weapons are much improved, the combo system is a nice first attempt, the graphics are great. The story - meh.For those who haven't played the original, your goal in this game is to go from point A to point B, and then (most of the time), escort someone from B back to A. The problem here is that the person being escorted is often more combatant than a child. So sometimes you have to bring them a lollipop or fifth of vodka to cheer them up first, enough to wanna go walkies.In between A and B are zombies. A crap ton of zombies. And you'll need to pick up just about what ever you can to destroy or avoid them (note to Capcom, you DESTROY a zombie, not kill it - shesh). Here's where the games most FRUSTRATING (yes, all caps). This game suffers from animation-lock. You know, like in Street Fighter (hello again, Capcom!), when you perform a power move that doesn't connect, and your guy spends the next hour dancing the samba, until your opponent does you the favor of knocking you out of the animation sequence. So, you get the a ability to jump kick. Awesome? Not really, because after you jump kick your character lands and has to animate the landing, which takes about two seconds, which is ample time for more zombies to bite you.Same with using most weapons. You swing a bat, well, slugger here want's to do it with a flourish, so you have to wait about 2 seconds after you are done swinging; again, plenty of times for zombies to creep up and chew on you.Sometimes B (as in from A to B, mentioned above) gets more complicated... Say you get to B, and B is a crazy axe wielding maniac. Time to put them down. The problem here is that all the Bs are way more agile than our protagonist here. They roll, dodge, tackle. And worst, when you are hit, your stagger time is about two seconds.Now, here is another major downer. Sometimes whilst needing to get from A to B, you also need to get from A to C, and A to D, you get the point. Well, B is clear on the other side of the mall from D, and C, well, I know it's right next to B but I know that Fudge Pants the Clown (TM) is there, and he wants to do me in, death by chocolate. So I can't take B or F there. Now you've got to choose. Do you save B, save D or kill Fudgy? Oh, and don't try to organize, because often it turns out that one of the letters requires you to go to E, F and G, however, you had no idea, so you tried to get some of the other letters done first, on the way. Now you've lost the game, and you don't know why.This game also suffers from excessively long save, load, and start times. We are talking about minutes here! Seriously, I spend the load times reading or working on my own programming. However, loading between areas isn't too bad.Look, I'm a huge Romero fan, and I think this series has serious promise. They are obviously copying Dawn of the Dead, and I apprecaite that. Mostly, they've done a right bang up job. They just need to stop programming, and PLAY THE GAME!

{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Jeff Carter","summary":"PSP","reviewText":"To people considering buying the psp I would recommend this.The video and picture quality on this thing is great with 3-d graphics on games.I've only got one game for it right now Twisted Metal and it looks great on the psp.I haven't seen the dead pixals a lot of people are talking about on mine yet.I don't have the Nintendo DS but I do have the Gameboy Nintendo SP and the graphics are as different as night and day 2d on the GBA SP and 3d on the PSP.The only problem I have with the psp right now is that that the price is too high and there isn't a lot of good games to choose from right now.Here is some pros and cons of this system.Pros1)3D Games on a portable system and a Lcd screen for beautiful graphics.2)The backlight is much brighter than the GBA SP.You will have no problem seeing this in the dark as the light is very bright.3)Movies are coming out on it for example Spiderman 2 and soon Triple XXX.Cons1)Not a lot of good games yet.There needs to be a jet fighter game like Ace Combat.There is one called Project Interceptor but the date hasn't been announced yet.Also I would like to see the upcoming Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction come out on the psp which is streeting on the ps2,xbox,gamecube and pc in August.2)Price is too high for a portable system.3)Dead Pixals even thou I haven't seen any on mine yet Sony needs to correct this problem or recall these when and if corrected units are released.4)The UMD disk cases are not replaceable.When I bought Twisted Metal the little plastic on the hub was broken and the disc wouldn't stay on so I had to exchange the whole game for another one.Sony please make replacement UMD cases because like regular Dvd cases they can break as I have already found out the hard way.I highley recommend this system as better games will be coming out soon and the price will probebly drop by the holidays.Hopefully in the future a lot of the ps2 games will be on the psp.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00005NZ1G","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play. However you choose to hero your way throughHalo: Combat Evolved, the action should break in your new Xbox in explosive style.","reviewerName":"Brendan L. Agnew \"rothwyn\"","summary":"Not Perfect, But Oodles of Fun","reviewText":"A lot of people would disagree with me on this subject, but Halo is NOT a perfect game. There are problems with the level design, and the graphics are far inferior to what they should be. However, this game is still a truck load of fun.Do I really need to tell the story? Sure, why not. Earth is at war with the Covenant, a bunch of bad alien dudes (like there are ever friendly aliens in video games). After Reach outpost falls to them, and most of the Spartans (superhuman battle cyborgs) are destroyed, the Covenant is at Earth's doorstep. Desperate to draw them off, the PILLAR OF AUTUM, along with the last surviving Spartan, jump blindly into deep space, and come out near the world Halo. After a crash landing, it's up to Master Chief (the player) to help lead the guerilla war against the Covenant, and find out what Halo is.This is, in the end, an elaborate excuse to kick some serious alien but. And kick it you will. The idea of only being able to carry two weapons at once was genius and makes the player think about what they're likely to need in a certain part of the level. The weapons are all nifty. None really stand out, (except the needler) but they all get the job done, and the ability to use Covenant weapons provides some cool variety.However, the graphics really disappoint, which is sad considering all their hype. For a system that is touted as the strongest in the current console war (of which there has yet to be definite proof), this game sure doesn't impress. The animation runs at a mere 30 frames per second, and sometimes dips below that. The textures, though used well, are far to few, especially for what the XBOX is capable of. However, things like this happen when a game is switched from one medium to another during development (Halo was originally going to launch on the PC). The visuals aren't bad per say, but they aren't anywhere near what the system can and should handle. Luckily, Bungie has learned from their mistake. Check out the videos from Halo 2 and you'll see what I'm talking about. Still, there are certainly some great animations in here, and the lighting is really good.Unfortunately, the level design gets repetitious, especially past the halfway point of the game, where you essentially play the first half of the game again in reverse order, as you try to escape from the facility on Halo. It's still fun, but it would have been nice to switch pace from \"Here's another room full of aliens to kill\" every once in a while, although the vehicular levels almost make up for it. It doesn't kill the gameplay, but it's kind of a let down after all the praise the game has been receiving.However, Halo truly shines in its gameplay. It controls like a PC game, and the XBOX pad, provided you have the smaller version, not the building-sized original, works very well. It takes some getting used to if you're more used to Goldeneye-style settings, but it really is the best it could be on a console. The aiming is easy, and the weapons all have secondary functions. The ability to use vehicles was a nice touch, and adds a nice layer to the experience. And the AI really is impressive. Your fellow soldiers will lay down covering fire for you, accompany you in vehicles, and even dive for cover when grenades are thrown. The covenant troops will hide behind shields, rocks/trees, or other troops, throw grenades back at you, and even imitate the death screams of the marines. Listening to the grunts will provide some of the best laughs of the game (\"Ahh, they're everywhere!\" \"We're all gonna die!\" \"Little people first!\") There are some truly great moments to be had just from watching your opponents.Halo's second, and arguably greater feat, is the multiplayer. The maps are huge, and the game modes are many. Not only that, but the vehicles are all available in multi as well, adding all the more to the carnage you can inflict on your friends. However, it would have been nice to see some bots added, using the excellent AI from the game. Sure the multi is fun, but deathmatch can get old after long enough, and it would be fun to sit down with four friends and just wage war against a squad of Covenant troops. Luckily, for gamers who actually have friends, there is a great co-op mode, with the entire game available to play through with a buddy. It's a nice touch, and adds a feel of being part of a team to the gameplay, and a human will be an infinitely better back-up man than your unfortunately human marines.All in all, anyone who enjoys shooters should already own this game. If you don't, go pick it up, and you won't be sorry.Hail to the Chief.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2003"}
{"product_name":"B002I08VXI","description":"","reviewerName":"J. J. Burtch \"In Life, Try to be the Type of ...","summary":"It's Pretty Fun...","reviewText":"After much deliberation, I finally decided to go with \"Steel Diver\" as my first game for my new 3DS.  It came down to this and \"Super Street Fighter IV 3D,\" but this won out for a couple of reasons.  First off, I generally like my handheld games to be a bit more unique.  I've found in the past that I generally play games on a handheld device (DS, PSP, iPod Touch) the more it seems to try to be a \"console\" game, the less I end up liking it.  Basically, I want my games for my handheld devices to be something that really can ONLY be found on a handheld device.  The other reason it won out is because I'm not very good at fighting games.  I figured that I would go ahead and get \"Street Fighter\" later, but for now I wanted a game that wasn't going to make me frustratingly angry.So I took the plunge and ordered \"Steel Diver.\"  It arrived quickly, like everything I order from Amazon, and I opened it and threw it into the 3DS right away.I was impressed by the menu.  It's basic, but really easy to navigate and understand.  The game responded to taps on the touch screen instantly with no lag or anything.  The game starts and gives you a really basic (and pretty generic) you're fighting against some random rogue bad guys.  That's really about it.  It doesn't give you much of a story, and that was a bit of a let down to me...but not enough that it actually detracted from the game at all.I fired up the first mission, which is a training mission.  It's basically just there to show you the control elements.  It teaches you how to dive, surface, move forward and backward, fire your weapons, and use your countermeasures.  It was during this first mission that I really started to enjoy the game.  Controlling the sub takes a little bit of getting used to, but it works, and it works surprisingly well.  In no time I was moving my sub around under the sea, destroying enemy ships, and blowing boulders out of my way with well placed torpedoes.I found myself really enjoying the sound effects in the game, even though they are quite basic.  The sounds it makes when you are moving the controls are just like the sounds you hear in a movie when a captain is steering a submarine.  I was really impressed by how authentic it sounded.I also discovered that I really enjoyed the look of the game.  With the 3D slider adjusted, it really does give you a sense of depth of field.  You can see schools of fish and underwater plants in the background and your submarine glides silently by them.  It really is pretty amazing to look at, even if it doesn't truly further the game experience at all.  What I mean by that is, playing the game in 3D is fun to look at, but you won't be missing any of the real gameplay elements if you turn the 3D off.  With that said, I highly suggest playing with the game in 3D.  You bought a 3DS, you might as well use it's main function, right??I played through several missions in my first sitting and enjoyed every one of them.  The environments were all great looking and unique, and although the missions were fairly similar, there was just enough difference to make you feel like you hadn't been doing the same thing over and over again.  With that said, I'm not the biggest fan of having to finish each of the first five levels with all three subs just to get to the last two levels.  I would have rather had those last two levels just unlocked as soon as you finished the fifth mission, or even better would have been if there were 15 total levels before unlocking the final two.  But it is what it is, and I'm also not letting that detract from the overall fun that this game has given me.In between levels you get to go to a periscope mode where you use the screens on the 3DS as if they were an actual periscope on a submarine.  You even have the option of spinning your body around and using the gyroscope inside the 3DS to aim the torpedoes.  These missions are timed, and they are pretty short.  I'm actually glad that they are like that.  They give you a sense of urgency while playing, and make it seem pretty hectic.  You can play these levels as a stand alone game if you like, but I prefer to play through a mission before giving them a go.  They seem like a perfect way to end the mission you've just played.I find that the thing I like the most about \"Steel Diver\" is the way it controls.  It's totally unique and something that really could only be done on a dual screen device, like the 3DS.  I know that this game originally started out as a tech demo for the original DS quite a few years ago, but I'm glad Nintendo gave the go ahead to turn it into a fully fledged experience for this new 3DS.  The whole package, in my opinion, comes together in a way that can only be experienced on the DS, and for me, that makes this a five star game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2011"}

It's like God Of War, button mashing square, triangle, circle, I have yet to win a fight for the fumble.  The cut scenes are a little too abundant, you can't pull instant replay whenever you want (I like to see how close I missed a catch, or if I was really out of bounds or was is it a CPU error, that kind of thing.  The menus aren't as easy to navigate, they are a lot different, not that you can't find what you are looking for, but just not as easily.  It's a touch glitchy as far as framerate, and online play, but I discount that because there are 50M users for online play and the improved all access franchises, it's going to take some adjusting server wise on any online game in the earlystages.  EA is the best at being on point, where smaller companies take a lot longer to get it straight.Good & Bad: The SPEED has been turned down, GOOD: No more glitch cheesers in the backfield at the hike ready to sack your QB on the drop back, your QB is able to make his reads, which also works well due to the improved pocket. BAD: \"New speed\" kills your running game more than ever and defensive pursuit is frustrating.I'm in a online franchise league and I am practicing.  If I was a better Madden player I'd be even more geeked, but I'm sure soon I'll be getting crushed more than most.  Lastly I'm VERY picky with video games, this is one of the few that I really like and don't want to return the same day.  I'll be playing this up until the next release.  Go Ravens!EDIT:  It's a 4 game.  I just sold it for $45.  I got tired of getting destroyed I just don't know the defense like I should.  Upon further review the \"new speed\" kills running games more than ever and pursuit on defense.  Much easier to pass however.  No one runs anymore it's too difficult with the new slower game speed.  Other than that, it's a very good game, but I change it to a 4.  Online you can't change speeds and that's all I do is play online.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2009"}

When I got \"Spider Man the Movie\" for PS2, I was equally blown away by the opening movies, but then it all became quite familiar.  The game boasts of being able to swing freely throughout New York, but there ARE limits.  If you go too far, Spidey will suddenly turn around in mid-air and say \"Whoa, where am I going?\", and put you back the other direction.  The controls are similar to the PS1 version, and anyone playing it will have very little problem adjusting to the new game.  It's fun to play, but often the camera angles are just impossible to work with (Batman Vengeance has a button that automatically takes the camera to directly behind you if it gets too far out - I wish this one did too).  Many times I was fighting villians that were off screen because I was facing the screen and nothing I did would move the camera behind me.  This gets frustrating very quickly.  Plus, while you can see the streets below you, don't think for a minute you can reach them.  If you swing too far down (and your guess is as good as mine on how far that is supposed to be), you'll suddenly find yourself dead.  Still, this is a very fun game, and I do like the fact that you can shoot webs at villians even while you're web-swinging.  A lot of good points to this game, and I do look forward to a sequel (hopefully with more villians in it).  I especially have to complement them on getting the game out right when the movie came out, rather than 6 months later after the hype has worn off like they're doing with the new Star Wars games for PS2.

I loved the first Spider-Man game.  The graphics were crisp and detailed, the story was deep and involving, and the controls were precise and tight.  Then Grand Theft Auto: Vice City came out, which completely re-wrote the video game genre.  Games like True Crime and The Getaway were released that practically copied the GTA formula:  Free roaming cities, mini-missions, mayhem and violence, etc.  Add Spider-Man 2 to the list with mediocre results.I admit that I was initially excited when I heard that Spider-Man could now swing freely through the city and bust bad guys on the streets below.  Though the former is exhilirating and excellently implemented, the latter is dull and repititious.  Like GTA, there is a mini-map of the city in the upper right hand corner of the screen.  Whenever there is trouble, a green icon will appear in the location where a crime is taking place.  Unfortunately, there is a lack of variety in these missions.  You will either have to prevent a robber from getting away, take an injured civilian to the hospital, catch a civilian from falling to his or her death, or save people from a sinking boat.  After a few of these, you'll begin wishing that the game would just get on with the story.  Solving these missions contribute to your \"Hero Points\" which allow you to purchase moves and combos from a Spidey Store.  Since when did Spidey have to buy his own moves and combos?  Strange...Unfortunately, due to the heavy reliance on memory and processing power to produce the massive scope of the game, the graphics are the first to suffer.  In most instances, the game resembled a Playstation 1 game.  Spidey generally looks good, but the other characters in the game look like spray-painted cardboard boxes.  I would have preferred a much scaled-down city in order to boost the quality of the graphics because quite frankly, Spider-Man 2 is an ugly game.Fans of the first game will most likely be disappointed with the sequel.  Though the ability to explore the city by swinging from building to building is a treat, the gameplay and graphics truly suffer.

{"product_name":"B002I0F5M8","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Lethal","summary":"This game lives up to the hype in every way","reviewText":"I really enjoyed Batman: Arkham Asylum so I expected big things here.  Thankfully, Arkham City keeps all the good elements of the first game, makes some improvements, and adds enough new elements that the experience still feels fresh.The one major downside to Arkham Asylum to me was the need to almost constantly use the X-ray vision mode to see where thugs were lurking around corners in order to plan stealth attacks in relatively small spaces.  This time around, the city environment allows for much greater movement, and the lighting makes it easy to see enemies without going to X-ray mode, while still keeping a dark atmosphere.  Strategy is still needed since some of the bad guys carry guns, but I no longer feel like I'm playing the role of a ninja, taking out one guy and scurrying back into the shadows.  It's very cool to look to the sky and see the bat-signal indicating the direction of your current primary objective.The number of melee attacks you can unlock is so extensive it felt overwhelming at first.  Fortunately you have the option to have a prompt come up at the bottom of the screen when your combo meter is high enough to use advanced attacks.  The more sophisticated and varied your fighting style, the more XP points you get to unlock more abilities and upgrade your armor.Then there are the hundreds of Riddler trophies to obtain.  Some are merely hidden from sight, while others are in plain view but require solving a puzzle to free them for collection.  There is even a device that involves chaining letters together to form words to solve some of the riddles.  There are also various challenges like gliding a certain distance, performing certain attacks successfully, and destroying Joker teeth, each of which awards a Riddler trophy.  Just collecting all the trophies is like a game in itself, and is a nice way to break up the action.  Also, you can hold down the L2 button to mark a Riddler trophy on your map if you can't currently retrieve it.  Tip: If there is no evident way to get to a trophy, mark it and move on.  Many require gadgets that you may not have yet, and the red ones can only be obtained by Catwoman.Catwoman has really nice martial arts attacks, can use her whip and other weapons, and can make repeated jumps to scale a building in place of Batman's grappling hook.  She definitely feels fully developed and in no way tacked on as a promotional gimmick.Batman's gliding ability combined with being able to grapple from midair makes it easy to get around the city.  It's fun, the physics are well done, and it is practically useful.The graphics in this game are some of the best I've ever seen.  I never have that sensation like in some sandbox games where the buildings look painted into the background and unrealistic.  It really feels like a living, breathing world, especially since there are always optional side missions popping up and bad guys lurking and chatting about what's going on.  The voice acting is very good, especially Mark Hamill's portrayal of The Joker.AI in this game is impressive.  If I take out one in a gang with stealth and the others find him, they go on alert and actively search.  This means altering their patrol patterns, staying closer together, and turning around much more often to watch their backs.  It's a refreshing change from games where guys go on alert for a minute, then return to mindlessly walking the exact same path and begging to be picked off.  The game is challenging but never cheap, and if you have trouble with certain elements of fighting you can upgrade accordingly.  The ability to throw down a smoke pellet when coming under gunfire is a great addition.I don't have a bad thing to say about this game.  I'm not one to go overboard with praise and ignore flaws, but there are no issues here.  No bugs, no collision detection problems, no slowdown despite the huge scale of the city, no painful logic gaps in the story or motivation.  You can tell Rocksteady had a great engine to start with, and spent their time fixing issues and expanding gameplay in creative ways.  Too often I get frustrated during a game and wonder \"didn't the developers care if this is actually fun to play?\".  During the many hours I've spent in Arkham City, I have only asked that once, which was when I was first learning how to glide.  There is no tutorial and I had to go online to figure out how to dive and pull up.  That temporary problem aside, the game is nonstop fun, with enough challenge that I've died numerous times in ways that left me saying \"I need to plan better next time\".  This is the sort of game where you're saying goodbye to months of your life when you pick it up, which you should do right now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0009SQFHK","description":"Sega Sonic Rush Adventure 67001 PC Games","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"Sonic rushes back to his former glory","reviewText":"Sonic must have run through a few too many loops on his early Genesis exploits, because he got dizzy and lost sight of what made him so great when his games popped up on 3D consoles. Since the Dreamcast's Sonic Adventure, I've felt that the blue blur's been suffocating and he needed to find that elusive air bubble to catch his breath and float back up to the top. With the DS's Sonic Rush, he's done just that. Sonic Rush is the best Sonic game since the Genesis.I have to admit that Sonic Rush has a story that bored me to death. It's the same idea as every other Sonic title -- Sonic has to chase down Eggman in order to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds and stop his evil plans. The only real difference is the introduction of Blaze the Cat, who is basically a female, pink, feline version of Sonic that is a little fireier than her blue counterpart. She's got a separate, equally-long quest of her own with a slightly different story, and she searches for the Sol Emeralds rather than the Chaos Emeralds. When it comes down to the gameplay, though, I didn't really worry about why I was running rapidly through forests and deserts. I didn't have time to.This game is just as fast and smooth as any traditional Sonic fan would want it to be. Each of the seven Zones (which feature two Acts each, making 14 levels for each character) is comprised of several different paths, loops, elevators, bumpers, pits, and more. Simply put, it's one of the most frantic games in the series. The action plays out on both the top and bottom screen of the DS in every level, and you'll always have to watch out when you hit a bumper and fly into the air or dive underwater and explore the depths. None of this detracts from the speed, and the game runs very smoothly regardless of how fast Sonic or Blaze is running. The use of both screens as well as the levels being a bigger challenge makes the experience slightly harder than I expected. I had frequent deaths, annoying restarts from checkpoints, and the like. This stuff was pretty grating but it just pushed me to play better, and there wasn't a single death that made me want to stop playing the game. It's only seven Zones long, which means that a single sitting could be enough time to finish the entire game, but earning grades on each of the level and trying to achieve a high score was enough incentive for me to replay most of the levels.Despite all of this crazy speed, the game controls well. There are a few new moves that differentiate the \"hold the right button and jump occasionally\" control scheme of past Sonic games. Sonic and Blaze can bust a few tricks in the air that fill up a meter on the left side of the screen. This meter allows both characters to execute a dashing move that kills enemies and propels you forward even faster than normal. Each character also has their own attack that is mapped to the right trigger button. Sonic does his dash-jump made a staple by Sonic Adventure, and Blaze does a little hover move that kills enemies. Combat in Sonic is a little difficult at first, as the game moves so quickly that it's tough to even see enemies on the screen. It eventually turns into a twitchy reflex to hit the dash button and kill enemies in your path, and in the closed-in areas of the game, finishing off your foes is as simple as using the R-trigger attack.I have to mention my favorite part of the entire game. Actually, by \"part\" I mean \"parts\". In every Zone there are hidden objects that propel you into the half pipe coin-collecting stages from Sonic the Hedgehog 2. These stages are controlled using only the stylus, which makes them a lot of fun to control. By collecting coins and attacking enemies, as well as dodging obstacles, you finish these stages and find the seven Chaos/Sol Emeralds in the game.Visually, Sonic Rush brings the beautiful, colorful 2D style of past Sonic games to the DS with polygonal, detailed character and enemy models. Adding to that are 3D boss fights at the end of every Zone. As I said, the game runs very smoothly and never hiccups, even when I would slam into enemies and lose all of my coins. The music goes well with the game, as it is a fast-paced rock and electronica mix that stimulates the action even more. The only annoying factor is the voices in the game. Sonic Rush is simple, fun and visually appealing to any Sonic fan. It isn&#8217;t perfect; the game is definitely too short. For the gameplay found here, though, it's one of the best DS platforming games out there. Sonic fans, grab a DS and enjoy yourselves.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2005"}

Gears 2 improvements may not be so obvious if you are not intimately familiar with the first.  Regardless, Gears 2 is an excellent game.  It's a must have if you are a fan of the first and a must have if you are a fan of shooters.  If you are not a fan of shooters, or at least 1st person shooters, then maybe you will find Gears of War more appealing as it is a 3rd person shooter.Let me quickly recap what this game is.  Skip this paragraph if you are already familiar.  Gears of War is an over-the-shoulder shooter that heavily utilizes cover and dodge techniques.  You can take cover on just about anything and you can jump out of the way of attacks.  This, at the release of the first game, was quite innovative.  Only Rainbow Six Vegas had a similar cover system, but no dodge.  Since then other games like Dark Sector have taken on the Gears of Wars style gameplay.  Gears of War is a gritty and violent game -- not intended for children at all.  One of your guns has a chainsaw bayonet, for example (one of my favorite features by the way).  You can carry 2 large guns, a sidearm and grenades.  You are heavily armored and if take hits, you can retreat to cover to regain your stamina.  If you lose your stamina, you drop to the ground and crawl where you are prone to enemy finishing moves.  The enemy is a horde of humanoid creatures that live in the ground called Locust.  They employ all sorts of brutal techniques with the hopes of eliminating humanity from the world of Sera.So, the game is a great improvement over the first.  There are a few new weapons, such as a flame thrower, a high caliber burst pistol, a large chain gun (that you don't have to drop your current weapon to use) and a mortar cannon.  The new weapons are great, and the mortar makes the first appearance in any game that I am aware of.  They implement it nicely too -- holding down the trigger for a duration to set the distance.  There is also the ability to use enemies as human/meat shields, and they also include a large metal shield that works similar to the meat shield.  These new additions on gameplay add greatly to the strategy involved in the game.They also included more finishing moves that you can execute when your enemy is crawling along the ground.  Each gun has its own move. You can still curb stomp or you can climb on top and punch them to death.  And of course you can pick them up and use them as a meat shield.  Each of the face buttons on the controller are mapped to one of those 4 different finishing options.As far as gameplay tweaks go, the cover system is vastly improved though it may be a subtle difference.  You can take cover on just about everything where as the first game it only worked on certain things.  Jumping in and out of cover is also more friendly.  Previously, the chainsaw kills were frustrating when 2 people went at eachother with the chainsaw.  Now, they included chainsaw duels where you have to rapidly tap the B button faster than your opponent.Basically, the gameplay is nicely improved.  It's hard for me to think of way to improve it further.The new multiplayer modes add tremendously to the replay value of the game.  My favorite new mode is Horde, where you take on wave after wave of increasingly difficult computer-controlled Locusts with up to 4 buddies or comparatively matched people on Live.  This is a feature that has long been lacking in shooters.  Tom Clancy games have terrorist hunt, but it's nothing like this.There are of course the tried and true multiplayer matches like king of the hill and this and that.  Gears 2 certainly includes all of that, and I am very pleased with that as well.I highly recommend this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2008"}

It picks up where the first one leaves off and has a bit more of a fleshed out storyline. And if you have been paying attention with some of the reviews, the story actually does make you feel more of a dire urgency to play this thru and save SeraThe new characters are cool and I got a bit attached to one and when it was their time it was a \"Awww dang ...\" kind of moment...on the other hand there was the return of a few characters that really made me feel that this game was done some justice.Quite frankly, there wasn't too too much added into the game, but there are few standouts.- If you thought the 1st one looked good, then this one surpasses that one....some spots do experience a bit of a drop in framerate but you will be so busy killing the Hordes, you may not have time to notice.- A few new weapons are in the game, I won't spoil it too much or say beyond what you may already know...but I will say that the mortar attack is really of the chainz.- The Brumak....nuff said- The cover system is not as bad as the first one but sometimes can be a bit funky in some spots_ Newer vehicle modes gives this game more variety alsoA few lowlights- right now, MP playing is still a bit laggy and glitchy...hopefully this will be patched pretty soon- Dialogue is still cheesy at bestOne thing I did enjoy about the multiplayer is for one....there are 5 downloadable maps right off the bat. The practice mode is cool too....you can even set up a room with yourself and some bots so you can try to suck much less against the pros. The new modea rae a blast such as Annex almost a throwback to BF 1942 and then there is Horde mode....when it works...But between this and Call of Duty 5....you will have your hands fullscale of 1 to 5 -  4 (until they get the MP patched!)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2008"}

We get the dopey 1 star reviews for whatever insane reason and dismiss most of them. GoW2 is a great game and you can see where the people that created this game put their time and effort into especially Multi-player which is better than anything currently on the market. I was always pi$$ed that games had a shelf life and by that I mean you couldn't play all the maps on-line because not many or no one was playing the damn game. While this isn't much of a problem with this franchise it did bother me with other titles. GoW2 you can go Local / Elimination (or other arena)and pick a number of maps and have \"bot players\" come into the map so that you can play 100% of this game without having to go online. HORDE is another crazy part of the game, ghost camera and taking photos , then upoading these shots to [...], checking matches , scores and top player names and rankings. Some new weapons in the game, unusual characters and story arcs \"explained\" although I never got caught up in the Dominc/Maria saga.Worth the money hands down. Having said that I have experienced some problems trying to find an online match, but if friends are on it isn't a problem getting into the room. &lt;&lt;&lt;*SPOILERS*>>> No Berserker battles, walking carefully over wood planks, a rock dislodging at an opportune moment, some joker turning out the lights in the house, ending Boss Battle w/General Raam. None of these things are in this game. Cliff B. going on and on about Skorge and you see him once at a cut scene with Dizzy, who you don't see again, and another scene in a ballroom like setting where you fight Skorge for all of 2 minutes. Not enough to knock the game down, but none of the edge-of-your-seat-moments like the first game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2008"}

And I even looked it up and several other people had the same problem and the only solution Bethseda gave us was to make a new game file! AKA start a new game!! Ridiculous! I started a new game but I was soo pissed that I just sold it because I had put so many hours into the game already. My favorite game would be Skyrim if it actually worked. I could easily keep playing it and reach level 50 again but what if a different mission decided not to work??

{"product_name":"B000069BD9","description":"Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliancebrings theMortal Kombatseries a new 3-D fighting engine, adds tons of features and extras, and still offers up classic gameplay.This installment features a 3-D battle system that still manages to maintain a 2-D feel. For example, pushing up on your controller makes you sidestep your opponent&#x92;s attacks, yet also allows you to jump in the air by tapping up plus a direction. A revamped fighting system offers up three different styles for each fighter (one includes a weapon technique). The multiple styles provide countless varieties of attacks for any given fighter. Different combinations of punches and kicks can be combined for very lengthy and powerful chain attacks similar to those in theMortal Kombatof old. Fatalities are also back and rich in graphic representation.New fighters join the cast of old favorites such as Sonya, Kano, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Kung Lao, Kitana, Quan Chi, Reptile, and Shang Tsung. The lavish environments surround your fighters with animated backgrounds and rich skylines. On some levels there are even breakable objects and hazards that you can interact with, such as pools of acid--the perfect landing place for a thrown opponent.In addition to regular modes of gameplay (arcade, versus, etc.), there is an option called Konquest mode. This mode allows you to learn more about fighting styles, read up on each character&#x92;s personal history, and gain Koins. The koins can then be spent in the Krypt, allowing you to unlock a host of new characters, costumes, and early concept drawings. The plentiful additional content offered with this title includes special movies ofThe Making ofDeadly Alliance andThe History ofMortal Kombat.Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliancesuccessfully reinvents the series by offering up a unique mix of improved graphics and stylized gameplay without compromising any of the features that made theMKseries popular over the years.--Carlos RodelaProsComplex gameplayRealistic 3-D graphicsHundreds of unlockable featuresConsWeak storylineUnbalanced combo system","reviewerName":"Samario C.

This means I got the sewer mission and bonus gear DLC codes included.  It was a limited edition... so if you order now you still might get it.Hello boys and girls I hope this review finds you doing awesome. I want to start off this review by saying that I love the game Rage but it has a few very big flaws.I got rage because I wanted to see id's Tech 5 engine (the future engine of many videogames that we know and love today) in action. And I played it on the PS3 but I feel Xbox is very similar in look and feel.The good: Rage is just plain simple fun! The feel of the guns the quest the different missions they are a good time. the ability to build many different types of gear is great. If this game can be had for under $25 I think it's a deal and well worth it. And if by the time you're reading this they have added some DLC (downloadable content) that expands upon the single player campaign and definitely buy it.The bad: unfortunately this part is good to be a lot longer than the good portion of my review. Rage is an unfinished game on many levels I feel that id didn't have enough time to complete the game. By all respects rage could have been an epic game but really it only feels like half a game. It feels like they did not spend the time or have the time to complete it. For example there are many doors that seem like they were going to be used to go somewhere but cannot be opened and thus are left wondering what's behind all of these doors. And the ending is synonymous on the web for being one of the worst ever. It sort of creeps up on you and then all of a sudden the game is over. Now if they fix this was some downloadable content that would be very very much appreciated.Also some areas that you venture into once you exit them you can never return which is kind of a bummer and it would be nice to go back and replay some of the levels. Also the mutant-TV portion of the game could also use an DLC to expand it as it would be really fun to replay over and over again and with friends.Unfortunately as you can see there are many things that detract from rage and one of the biggest is that it seems id is not going to be adding income of DLC to this game as they have been pretty silent up to this point (2 months after release) about any up coming DLC in their schedule. But here's to hoping you're reading this in the future and they have released some DLC and were all enjoying this game even more.One thing to note the co-op mode can be played by 2 people and expand on the single player story some and definitely add some replay value when you're playing with a friend. And the multiplayer focuses on the racing aspects of rage which can be fun but is nowhere near as cool as a first-person shooter version of team death match or the like would have been.Thanks for reading I hope this helps once this game hits 20 bucks or below grab it I think it's worth it you'll enjoy it.Game on gamers peace in your crease!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0002CHJAA","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Nothing on the original game!","reviewText":"Xenosaga Episode I Der Wille Zur Macht, was a breakthrough in gaming!  It had deep characterization, a deep storyline, innovative battle system and a soundtrack that blew you out of this world!  It was a plot driven game with an intoxicating storyline.  Episode II doesn't compare to the original in very many ways at all.  Things have been changed that shouldn't have been changed, and in all essence, it's more like watching a season 2 of a declining TV series.Xenosaga Episode II isn't a bad game.  It's actually really good!  It's just that it suffers from the sequel syndrome.  The first one hit a level that was so high, and now this one has to compare.  Either you'll be quite surprised by where it goes, or quite disappointed.The game opens up with a flashback of Chaos being sent to Miltia with a realian named Canaan to see why all the Realians have gone berserk.  Chaos and Canaan meet up with only one who still seems to be in control of himself.  General Jin Uzuki, and to prevent spoiling more, let's just the say we rejoin our main cast from the first game in mere moments.Where as Xenosaga Episode I put an emphasis on storyline, Episode II seems to put an emphasis on character development.  It does a fairly good job too.  You'll learn more about these characters, and be able to cope with them.  Unfortunately, if you haven't played the first game yet, it's all mysterious to you.A few things about the gameplay have changed.  The battle system is refined just a bit.  Now enemies are in \"zones\".  Either Zone A, B, or C.  Depending on the zone they're in they could take a lot of damage from your attacks.  You can also knock them in the air, or down on the ground.  You can also link attacks together to perform devastating combinations.  Characters attack using points.  If you decide to \"stock\" (by defending) you can attack more times in one turn.Xenosaga Episode II is not an easy game.  You can't just mash down on buttons and expect to win battles.  There does need to be strategy involved.  Without strategy, you'll more than likely lose.The character raising is different.  In the first game, you had Ether Points (Magic), Tech Points and skill points.  In this one you only have ether points to improve your magic skills.  Truthfully, that's sad since all your characters learn the same skills, and once you've learned everything (being that there are no Tech points and Skill points in this one) you'll have a bunch of Ether Points sitting around begging to be used, and they never will.The graphics in the game have been updated from the first one.  I personally didn't think this was neccessary.  They tried to make the characters look more \"human\" and I personally thought the anime look of the first game was just fine.  Some of their actions look a little strange, mostly because the dubbing of the game to English was terrible, but otherwise, the graphics are smooth and rich.  KOS-MOS looks the nicest out of all the characters.The voices, for whatever reason, have also changed.  I was not too fond of this.  The voices from the first game were perfect. These voices are either superb, or they're terrible.  MOMO for example, has a terrible voice actor, while Chaos has a fairly good one.The music is no where near as good as the first game.  Actually, to be truthful, the music in this game is forgettable, and you won't care too much for it in the end.  It's not the first one.There aren't as many cutscenes as the first Xenosaga, and while the story is intriguing, the cutscenes don't flow quite as well.  Also, it's sad to see this game isn't as long as the first one, and there aren't as many secrets.  I thought the game would have more secrets than what I got.It's also very disappointing with what you get from having a save file at the end of the first Xenosaga.  Just a bunch of skills and whatnot.  Nothing more.  No impact on the story or anything.  Really, the save file is useless.Xenosaga Episode II does work, but it's sad that it can't live up to the first game.  It had potential to live up considering how long it was in development, and what the first game gave it to go with.  I just wish it could've fallen through.If you loved the first Xenosaga game, pick this up.  You won't regret it, but you probably won't remember it as well as the first game either.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00BRQN2EM","description":"","reviewerName":"Alucard \"xNosferatux\"","summary":"TONS OF FUN!","reviewText":"First of all, I'd like to point out that I have played all the games in the Saints Row series. It started off as a copy cat to GTA. Then, it became less serious than GTA and added more humor. This fourth one moves away from the regular gang versus gang type of story and adds a twist by adding amazing superhero abilities. Before I purchased this, I told myself not to judge it immediately and to give it a try since I knew the game had superhero abilities and more silly stuff.After playing it for a few hours, I was having tons of fun. There are a lot of things to do, and now that you have superhero abilities, you can do whatever you feel like doing. Use telekinesis, race around running at super speed, jump from a skyscraper and bring wrath to your enemies with a \"death from above\" nuclear explosion. I enjoyed the storyline. Everything about it made sense. It wasn't like they came up with ridiculously crazy stuff and did not have an explanation for it. I also enjoyed hanging out with your homies and the option to romance them(LOL). Got a thing for Shaundi or Gat? Go for it. Hahaha. It was fun to chat with your homies and bring the fight to your enemies with superpowers or funky weapons. Believe...there are plenty of FUNKY weapons. I won't spoil too much, but you'll definitely have tons of fun with them.Moreover, if you enjoy games that have references from music, movies, or video games...this is definitely for you. I could not help but laugh at all the funny video game references throughout the game. As with the other games, you're still able to customize your character and your crew. I wish they had added something to customize your ship, but since you're at war, I guess there is no time for that. The graphics are an improvement from the past games, and the soundtrack is great.I have no regrets in purchasing this. If you want a serious game about gang versus gang type of story, this may not be for you. But, if you enjoy sarcasm, other types of humor, and twists, this is your game. My only real pet peeve is that some of the side quests get a bit repetitive, not all of them, but some. I wish there had been more diversity with the side quests.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2013"}

The developers just disabled the right thumb stick, which makes it a fustrating game... but not hard at all. And it's not the first time i've ever played a game where the developers disabled the right thumb stick, (ninja gaiden black, metro prime), thereby not allowing me to control the camera so that I could adequately play the game. The other platform game, (Sly Cooper), allowed me to move the right thumb stick \"UP AND DOWN\" so that I can effectively make jumps.  Jak 2 however, doesn't allow me to move the camera up and down, and this resulted in me making a lot of \"BLIND JUMPS\" which sent me back to the beginning of EVERY mission. The game also could have benifited from having a camara system that didn't get stuck a lot and follows the movements of Jak faster, weapons with lock on features, and the ability for the player to strafe around an enemy (like in the Zelda series).  The fights in the Zelda series were balanced enough in a fair but challenging way that made fighting all the monsters in that game fun.  In Jak 2 however, it was more of a chore to move through the game, and not all that much fun.Ok now, let me put the brakes on the bitching for a moment. Jak 2 is \"not\" a terrible game.  There are some fun and funny moments to be had in the game. The open world enviorments are great, the music is cool, the pretty much non-existant load times are fantastic, character graphics are good, the story is decent, and amist the many chaotic scenes in the game that involves you fighting in various places and moving through the city, there's no slow down.  And, most importantly, since I only paid $7.76 for this game, I don't really have too many complaints. So the game does have a lot of good points about it.Even though I beat both Jak 1 & 2, (hooray for me and everyone else in the world that did beat them. I have Jak 3 and im going to play that one soon), my only wish was that the developers had allowed me the abiliity to move the right thumb stick \"up and down.\" Games are supposed to be, (first and foremost) fun. They can be challenging, annoying, difficult, and enemies can be redicilously powerful or whatever.  I really don't mind being taken down by an enemy or a boss in a game. However, I feel that I should have a fair chance of fighting against any enemy in any game.  Disabeling the camera stick in any way that makes it annoying for me to \"SEE\" what im supposed to be fighting in the game is not fair, and this is what makes Jak 2 waayyyy more fustrating to play than fun.So... in order for me to lift my review past 1 star and recomending any Jak & Daxter game to anyone, if any of the creators of the game is reading this review, I want to see YOU play \"ALL\" of the missions in Jak 2 \"WITHOUT DYING ONCE ON ANY ONE OF THEM.\" ( since I died on them all and had to replay them all, YOU have to survive them all, without replaying them). Show me how it's \"expertly\" and \"professionally\" supposed to be done. If I see you do this, then I will lift my review to 5 stars, buy all the other Jak & Daxter games, you'll have my utmost respect as competent game programers and designers, my sincere and deepest apology for bashing your game a bit.... and... i'll buy you all a cookie.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0009UBR3A","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Gamecube's Last Epic","reviewText":"Nintendo has really shown this past year, that there is so much hype going on with some of their greatest video games. Although more of the emphasis has been around the Wii, and the redesigned Nintendo DS Lite, the other systems still showed they had some light around for die hard gamers. That has been the case with great games like Need For Speed: Carbon, Madden '07, and especially the return of Link. Since the last major Zelda epic came out for the Gamecube a few years ago on The Wind Waker, eager Gamecube fans have wanted more. Twilight Princess made a smashing stand for the Wii as the premire launch title. Thankfully, Gamecube owners don't feel left out this time.The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess has been a long time coming for the Nintendo Gamecube. It has been a long time coming but it was worth it. The gameplay follows Link as he goes on a journey, trying to battle the fierce Ganondorf who has caused trouble around Hyrule. In the story, Link is transformed into a howling wolf, and uncovers the mystery of the twilight. The gameplay and the storyline are absolutely gorgeous, and the surroundings are absolutely filled with life. The control is also a bit easier to pickup for Gamecube, compared to the Wii, where it is more about accuracy from the controller. There is one main disadvantage with Twilight Princess for the Gamecube, compared to the Wii version. The maps and levels are all mirrored to seperate the two versions from one another. In other words, if you had to go left to a certain point on the Wii, Gamecube players would have to go right, which to Gamecube edition owners might find a bit confusing if they've bought the strategy guide Nintendo made.Despite that one big difference, The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess marks the near end of the Gamecube era, but it remains one must buy for die hard Zelda fans that is worth the effort. If you own a Gamecube, or the Wii, and you can't find the Wii edition, than I definitely recommend the Gamecube version. This is one that the tri-force is behind Link for eternity.Graphics: ASound: B+Control: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B 1/2+Overall: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2006"}

It extends a bit if you've a larger TV (not box size, mind you, you wouldn't need one if you had such a TV) and the Kinect &#34;screws&#34; in as well to help keep it in place.My TV is a flat back, so there's not much for the back part to grasp on to, but the rubber like material holds it nicely so it doesn't slip or fall, gravity plays a key part (at least for my and my TV). I frequent;y rotate my TV and it has yet to fall or even give the impression it will. It (Kinect) can also be adjusted, as you'll need to do re-calibration, to get the perfect angle.Overall, this is a very nice mount, I don't use the privacy slide, I don't care if the NSA sees me watching TV. if you need a good, inexpensive mount, look no further.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2014"}

Within its realm, you will have to assume the burden of choice.

You're a Witcher and it is your job to maintain order","reviewText":"The Witcher Enhanced (mature audiences recommended) is an amazing genre of game that combines some elements of role-playing with elements of twitch combat.  The storyline, one of the finest written for a single player game, outside of the vast and beautiful Elder Scroll series, keeps you engrossed from beginning to end.Unlike many games that are very linear and require very little thought from the player, the Witcher series gives the player the ability to pursue the main story line, side quests or even just adventure a bit without penalty.  You can spend countless hours in day/night wandering the countryside and seeing some very amazing sights.  This game also is scripted to allow certain things to only happen at night, or when you are affected by a certain condition, etc.  This is certainly not a game that one can simply click &#34;Accept&#34; for a quest and go, go, go.  You will have to do some planning and make choices that can change the outcome, reward, and even your status in the area.I purchased this particular game on Steam and acquired the Enhanced Edition as a bonus, which improved some aspects of the game, gave the Directors Cut and added a little &#34;adult&#34; content - which is tame, but worth noting for parents that want to watch what their kids play.  Overall, I'm very happy with this game and have to complete it through a few times to get real feel for all the options your character can choose from and paths you can pick on quests.  If the price is right - and you're looking for a great game - consider picking up Witcher - and remember, Witcher 2 is out as well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2014"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Sonic still rules","reviewText":"Anyone old enough to remember SEGA's glory days with their 16-bit Genesis system will no doubt remember the old Sonic the Hedgehog games.  Sonic Mega Collection Plus features all of the SEGA mascot's appearances on the classic console, as well as six titles from SEGA's portable Game Gear system.  Genesis titles include Sonic 1, 2, and 3; as well as Sonic & Knuckles, Sonic Spinball, Sonic 3-D Blast, and the puzzler Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.  The Game Gear titles include Sonic 1, Sonic Labyrinth, Sonic Drift, Sonic Chaos, Sonic Blast, and Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine; and there are unlockable games including the Knuckles add-on stages as well as Comix Zone, Ristar, Flicky, and the Ooze.  The games are wonderfully emulated and the Genesis games still look crisp and respond well, but not all the games here are great.  Sonic 3-D Blast (one of the last Genesis games) is abysmal, and most of the Game Gear titles, specifically Sonic Labyrinth, Sonic Drift, and Sonic Blast, are pretty shoddy.  Despite that, there's plenty here for longtime Sonic fans to love, including the big plus of having the underrated classic Comix Zone as an unlockable, and a horde of extras as well.  However, there are some glaring omissions here, such as the Game Gear title Sonic Triple Trouble, the Sega CD title Sonic CD, as well as the Saturn racing title Sonic R and Sonic the Fighters, and the 32X title Knuckles Chaotix.  Despite all that, Sonic Mega Collection Plus is a must own for Sonic fans or for fans of retro gaming, and for the price of what you get here, this is a deal that can't be beat.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2006"}

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone. To help you maximize the potential of this setup, two-player online and offline co-op modes ensure that you have options when picking a partner.Steel yourself Against the Harsh Reality of KijujuAn advanced version of Capcom's proprietary MT Framework game engine brings groundbreaking graphics and effects to Kijuju, the highly-developed environment where this game's action takes place. New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"Michael J. Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"The Bar Has Been Raised...Again!","reviewText":"This game is so good, it made me a Resident Evil fan.I've never really liked the Resident Evil series.  The dubbing wasn't particularly good, the characters weren't very compelling, and the scares...I'm fond of running and gunning, not sitting around waiting for the scary monster to jump out and eat me.  Resident Evil never offered the kind of zombie-blasting experience I craved...until now.Resident Evil 5 has a plot, but who cares about the plot?  It's all about Chris Redfield and his superhot female companion, Sheva Alomar, blasting zombies away.  Oh sure, there are nuances here and there: the zombies aren't really undead but infected with weird worm-like parasites, the zombies move fast, they're smart enough to drive vehicles and fire weapons, and oh yeah...the majority of them are Africans.Whether or not this matters to you depends primarily on your discomfort level with a white guy attacking red-eyed Africans with a machete and stealing their gold.  Yes, the zombies actually drop gold.  My suspicion is that most gamers simply don't care, because the bad guys are zombies and thus fit into the same category as orcs in fantasy - faceless villains to be defeated in great swaths of destruction.The problem is that Resident Evil's graphics are now so good that it looks like the real thing--if the real thing was villages filled with rotting animal carcasses and glowing red-eyed zombies. In fantasy gaming, we don't have a real orc to compare our opponents to.  This is the burden of Resident Evil's hyper-realistic modern gaming environment.If you actually play the game, it's clear that there is not an intentional bias against Africans.  There are African military allies who are just as empowered as the zombies are moving targets.  And Sheva is from the region, although she's admittedly lighter skinned than many of the other African characters.Resident Evil isn't above breaking the rules to keep horror top of mind.  Chris and Sheva can't simply run-and-gun.  They have to stop and aim, which gives zombies plenty of time to sneak up behind them.  Inventory is limited, ensuring that you will frequently run out of ammunition.  There are cinematic sequences that have nothing to do with shooting in which you simply die if you screw up, like giant man-eating crocodiles and chainsaw wielding zombies.Although Sheva is in the game regardless of whether or not you play-cop, the co-op mode elevates Resident Evil 5 from a beautiful but standard zombie shooter to an awesome gaming experience.  The game has mechanics to specifically encourage teamwork, ensuring that you come to the rescue of Sheva when she's grappled by a zombie, heal each other when you're hurt, or hurl the (presumably) lighter Sheva up on rooftops. Who says having an attractive female companion doesn't have its perks?Resident Evil 5 has a limited cover system, awkward reloading, and an aggravating inventory system.  But that just heightens the tension. The zombie co-op bar has been raised...again!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2009"}

This is as linear as it gets, folks.  It's just not nearly as memorable as the original's story.Multiplayer- This is where things really go south.  The new weapons, perks, attachments, and killstreaks are a TON of fun.  But the multiplayer is absolutely broken:  the map design is of no resemblance to the original.  The maps play very much like World at War, in that they are really just showcases of eye candy.  Too many buildings, windows, vertical levels, etc, make for a camper's dream.  In addition to be exposed in virtually every direction, they've also drastically reduced your health.  One or two bullets and you're dead.  This might be more \"true to life\", but it's certainly not as fun to play.If you enjoyed the tactical nature of the original and the flow of the maps, then you will find yourself very, very frustrated.  That doesn't mean MW2's multiplayer is bad, per se, but it's definitely aimed at a different crowd than it's predecessor.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2009"}

{"product_name":"B007FTE2VW","description":"","summary":"UPDATED DROPPED 5 TO 1 STAR (PHYSICAL CD) Very fun and what can you expect on day one?","reviewText":"I have been a Beta tester and seen this game develop from the very start. DRM in my opinion is a bad thing to have in software, and on launch days this is apparent with all the various server issues. This is simply because everyone is trying to play at one time over the next few days these issues will be for the most part gone. This game is overall fun, and a good reboot of the older versions I wish the maps were larger but then I think in real life its often a region that is known not just a single city. This game will be a top seller and has the potential for some good updates I see a free-play mode with a larger map and no region or online play in the future as well. As I play more a more in depth review will be added!UPDATE: After 3 days it has only gotten worse I have lost all my saved cities and can no longer connect if I do it wants me to replay the tutorial and its impossible to get through before the server crashes. This is honestly a 5 star game when it works, and I expected some server issues at launch, but this is too extreme.Ill skip pointless details graphics and basic features and gameplay have already been discussed and can be seen on YouTube.Some Bugs: (Besides servers!).Water is incredibly limited for a large city on every map I tried I have lost a good chunk of my population once I hit 40,000 people or so..Sewage unless in sandbox mode you can only dump sewage creating a ton of ground pollution and decreases the amount of clean water you can pump..Online play its great if you have friends horrible if you don't.An example if everyone does not coordinate you cant all be casino tech or university cities instead someone needs to be the polluted resource producing region until someone else gets the tech to replace it also in turn killing the economy of the old style resource producing city.This is a great game despite the negatives I have said just wait to buy it as of now hopefully in a month they have these issues fixed and I will return my review to 5 stars.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002I0JAVK","description":"","reviewerName":"stevie","summary":"Really fun but not as perfect as they say.","reviewText":"After playing this I regret I never got the chance to play the first one. Well, it has been fun so far, but it is not the gem that all the review sites have said it is. Its technically an open world game. You are confined within the boundaries of arkham city. This works well for the story because it allows the developers extended liberties with the villains as they are all working with and against each other inside the city. And they are all worked in fairly well, despite the focus being primarily on the Joker. The story itself isn't really that hard to follow, but I found myself losing interest sometimes because of all the different characters there are. Its also one of those games where you take two steps back and one step forward at every plot point. A task to go find freeze turns into first running into the penguin who has actually captured freeze, fighting all the penguin bad guys and then finding freeze. But then Freeze can't help you until you do Freeze a favor. After you help Freeze (who helps you then tries to kill you), another villain pops up and you have to go chase them. Batman also appears nonchalant when running into these various enemies. However, this does keep things fresh despite their disjointed feel. You run into Robin, Killer Croc and rescue vicki vale from a helicopter crash. Sometimes I wish there was more dynamics in these interactions. Robin is there almost as lip service to the character. If you have the dlc, you can play as him, but he is not a big part of the story.The game also suffers sometimes from (what i like to call) random good guy appearance to save the situation mode. You know, where you are in trouble and then someone just shows up off screen to save you. I see it as a failure to take a risk with the characters. And its something we have all seen way too many times. However, the game will have different endings based on a choice you can make as catwoman to either save batman or not save batman. Its kind of interesting and a nice change of pace to give the player the option to choose a plot point.Everything about the game you heard was great is in fact...great. So I won't spend too much time on them. The gameplay is solid. Fighting mechanics are fun. Grappling and gliding around is fluid and looks cool. The gadgets are cool as well as actually serving a purpose in the game (you really feel like batman). The game will often just leave you alone with no idea of really where to go next. Thinking like batman will often get you of the situation.There are two things I didn't like.1.) The environment is too dreary. Its not fun to explore like in other open world games. You do a lot of backtracking, but its difficult to recognize places. The color palette is all greys, blacks and dirty browns. Everything is crusted over. I think they went a little too far with the destruction of arkham. I know it should be like that because of what is going on, but I would prefer sacrificing some of that for some color. This also makes the game graphically difficult to judge. I dont think its graphically as good as red dead redemptions environments or character models. But its hard to judge the environment because everything is so downtrodden and the broken buildings start to look the same inside and out.2.) There is a certain part of the fighting system I don't like. You have to beat up an enemy severely until you knock them out (because batman dosn't kill people, however, he has no problem breaking limbs and landing punches that would probably cause brain damage anyway). Often, they will lie on the ground unconscious but still able to get up. You have to do a ground slam to finish them off. Imagine playing uncharted, but then the guys you punch just lay there for awhile and then get back up. The game compensates by eventually letting you level up to perform \"critical strikes\". Critical strikes are basically finishing moves so you can string together as many as possible landing knock out blows. However, you can only do this after a 5 times combo where you then have to press X immediately after you finish one move and before the next one. This is actually more difficult than it sounds. At later points in the game, you will be surrounded by 20 more bad guys. If you button mash, which you almost do anyway because there are so many, you will miss the critical strike. Thus, you will be knocking guys out, but they will get up and keep fighting you. In the meantime, you are being attacked by 20 other guys. The guy you just knocked out then comes to fight you again and you have to keep punching him some more until hes finished. I wish they would have just let you knock guys out after the first series of punches.But if these issues do not bother you, then the game is basically a ten as far as tens go.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I0JAVK","description":"","reviewerName":"Too Old for Games \"casualgamer\"","summary":"Grand Theft Batman","reviewText":"Batman as a superhero is anything but. He possesses no superhuman abilities like strength or flight; rather he is an ordinary man with athletics, an unlimited bankroll, and a higher sense of purpose. Because we can empathize with him more than all others, we have seen Batman featured in the best superhero movies from Keaton to Bale's Batmen (I'll conveniently leave out Kilmer and Clooney), and the best superhero games in these two Arkham games.In Arkham City, the developers have created a city so impressive and imaginative that it's bursting at the seams with panache. Similar to the GTA and Yakuza series, you feel like an inhabitant of their respective virtual worlds. In this case, you are the caped crusader. You travel to and fro by diving, floating and zip-lining which are all very well done and relatively easy to pull off. You skulk around the city taking out the baddies. The combat is visceral and satisfying. The game is a brawler at it's core so you can mash \"x\" and \"y\" and get by if you don't want to incorporate any technical moves to your combos. Of course, there are the stealth moments where you have to clear a room by taking enemies out one by one.  There are also so many side missions and distractions in this game besides the main mission that it often times seems overwhelming. The best way I would describe this game is that it is a stealthy brawler wrapped in an open world game.  If all this sounds good to you, then stop reading now.The problem with this game has nothing to do with the game itself.  The problem is that it's predecessor, Arkham Asylum, is so good and set the benchmark so high that anything resembling it would come off as a bit of a letdown.  My thoughts after my playthrough of Batman AA was that it was one of the best games that I'd ever played.  How am I to conjure up those feelings again?  And that is the problem I have with most sequels from Modern Warfare 2 to Infamous 2.  Again, that's a me problem--nothing against these games.  And Arkham City added so much more that you really have to applaud their efforts to avoid that stale feeling that you've been here before.  Unfortunately, it didn't work for me.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005V6BB","description":"Medal of Honor: Frontlinemarks the debut of the Medal of Honor franchise on the PlayStation2. InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"Matt Mabry","summary":"Good...Not Great- - Loads of Room for Improvement","reviewText":"MoH:Frontline looks like one of the best games, especially at the beginning when you're thrown into the storming of the normandy beaches.But then you go on all of these &quot;Bond-like&quot; Missions, I mean who in WWII fought alone, who broke into a secret U-Boat factory ALONE?There is no way a person could take out that many people. It's possible...If I wanted a 1 person, alone shooter, I would have bought 007:Nightfire or one of the other Bond series.I wish that MoH:Frontline was a tactical sqaud-based first person shooter, I mean even when you're teamed up with a group of people they never kill anyone, just recklessly shoot.In the end Metal of Honor: Frontline  could have been the coolest game invented, if it wasn't so &quot;Bond-like&quot; It gets really old having to kill everyone yourself, without the help of your so-called &quot;Commrades&quot;.MoH: Frontline is only cool if you really like 007 or something like that, but if you're looking for squad-based, REAL war, I recommend Ghost Recon.Here's a breakdown:Graphics- 10/10 this is one of the best parts of the game, it all fits together nicely and looks seemless.Gameplay- 5/10 It's o.k., but machine guns have infinate ammo and it's just really shotty, AI is completely awful.Difficulty- 5/10 Too mixed, there's no feeling of levels getting harder or easier, The beginning is hard, but then in the middle it's really easy. And at the end you face off with tons of germans with one bullet...HOW STUPID!!!Fun- 6/10 gets really hectic and just really stinks that you're on your own facing tons of Germans...it seems kind of futile. You don't even get to fly the cool plane, seems like all of the hours you've spent on the game have been fore nothing.This game could have been great, but it wasn't.

Even with the strong feeling that Bethesda Game Studios just copy/pasted the gaming template from Oblivion onto Fallout 3 and just made everything look crapier, Fallout 3 still captivated many new fans to the franchise ultimately leading to the strong number of pre-orders and subsequent sales of Fallout: New Vegas a few weeks ago.After obtaining the game on release night and putting in almost 70 hours since then (it's November 11th as I type this, so I've had it for only a few weeks, you do the math), I can safely say I will easily put in triple the amount of hours before I'm done.  To compare, I put in over 200 hours to get 100% completion on Fallout 3.  Fallout: New Vegas is a great game that I will continue to enjoy till I get 100% completion... but the game is not without its horrible faults.Let us begin!StoryFor those of you new to the Fallout franchise, the game's setting takes place in a post-apocalyptic United States where the government has fallen and nothing but lawlessness and tribal feudalism rules in the nuclear fallout (hence the name).  Fallout: New Vegas (Hereafter to be referred to as \"New Vegas\") has the player assume the role of a courier that has been ambushed by mobsters and tribal gang members, is left for dead, brought back to health by a sympathetic town doctor, and sets off on a journey to track down your attackers.  As you progress, you realize that your trivial venture of revenge is marginal compared to the grander scheme of things at work and that you will play a pivotal role in its conclusion.Among the vast Mojave wasteland are several main factions vying for power; the two primary powers being the New California Republic (NCR), dedicated to bringing back the world of democracy and individual liberty, and Ceasar's Legion, dedicated to the principles of \"Pax Romana,\" or the assimilation of all things to the central national identity of Rome... at all costs.  However, despite the seemingly obvious lines drawn between the forces of good and bad, ultimately siding with either faction is not as easy a decision as it sounds for either side has their clearly distinguished pros and cons and contain hidden sides permeated by greed and ambition.  For instance, while the Legion may be extremely draconian akin to the same level of brutality as the actual Romans were, they completely wipe out all disease, purify crops, and stabilize crime while the NCR does not.This is only the tip of the iceberg pertaining to the overall plot and background, but it's obvious that the dichotomy of good versus evil is not nearly as black and white as other games such as the Light and Dark Side portrayals in Knights of the Old Republic.Game PlayTo say that New Vegas' game play and environments were inspired by Fallout 3 would be a gross understatement.  The controls are identical to the point where I started playing as if I had just popped in another expansion pack to Fallout 3.  The interface and even the main menu, personified by a wrist-mounted Personal Information Peripheral or \"Pip-Boy,\" is also identical minus a few minor adjustments such as the adding of attachments to weapons or the utilization of special ammo.Players can equip special ammo such as incendiary rounds or hollow points for added effects on targets and can even install special weapons parts such as scopes and barrel rifling.  This allows more customization, not to mention makes New Vegas feel much more like a true scavenging experience by allowing the player to scavenge for parts.Similar to Fallout 3 (you'll hear this a lot), the player can gain experience points of XP to move from level to level and attain perks that enhance your character.  However, unlike Fallout 3 where perks are awarded every level, New Vegas grants them every other level or so.  To me this was especially irritating as maxing our your character in Fallout 3 was one of the biggest highlights since you can go from absolute weakling to \"I'm the Juggernaut!\" in under 30 levels flat with little thought to planning your character.  In New Vegas, with only 15 perks to attain throughout leveling, you REALLY have to plan ahead.  By the way, experience awarded per action or kill is the same in the Very Easy difficulty as it is in the Very Hard... wish I would have known THAT about seven hours in!Now, at this point I must state how you can gain perks through in-game \"challenges\" such as killing 75 `abomination' enemies such as Death Claws (easier said than done).  This doesn't really make up for the fact since you'd need a player's guide to even figure out how to get what rather than spending 10 hours shooting random enemies and downing 25 buffout pills in a day to \"see what happens.\"Another nice addition is the inclusion of followers.  Granted you could do this with a few characters in Fallout 3, but not to the extent and control as New Vegas... but not without a price (see bulletined glitch section below).The newest big addition to the game play from Fallout 3 was the introduction of \"Hardcore mode,\" where you have to stay hydrated, fed, and well rested less you become another statistic in the Mojave Wasteland.  I thought this would be a fun challenge and I wanted the 100 point gamer score achievement (Bleep-bloop!) but, after trying it for a few hours, I said the proverbial \"forget this\" and stayed in Very Easy for the remainder of my gaming experience.  Since when does drinking a soda make you more thirsty?!  Granted it makes you need more water in the long run, but not in the immediate aftermath of enjoying a nice, chilled, irradiated Nuka-Cola!  I just kept yelling out \"BS\" and stopped playing in Hardcore mode, which I probably will not pick up less my inner S&M; is reawakened by solving the Lament ConfigurationOverall I enjoyed the game play and still log in waaay too many hours when I should be either working out or enjoying time with my lady by inviting her over for \"cake.\"  However, all my praise cannot be complimented without addressing the looming miasma that is the stability of the game mechanics, or lack thereof.Anyone reading this that has played Fallout 3 will cringe when anyone mentions the word \"glitches.\"  Fallout 3 was EXTREMELY glitchty.  The glitches ranged from poor walking animations to dialog lock-ups (especially when installing the Broken Steel expansion pack), to flat-out system freezes during loading screens that corrupt the auto-save data.  New Vegas not only inherited these traits but it seems as though the glitch gene has mutated into something far more sinister like the Ebola virus meets a the worst computer virus known to man (aka Windows 95).Where to start?  There's so many glitches to cover, it's not even funny.  How do I adequately explain all the BS I had to deal with in under a page?  I know!  Bullet format!1:  The rendered layers of the lock picking and computer hacking minigames often loaded wrong placing the background over the game itself, making playing them near impossible until your turned off the system and reloaded (hereafter to be referred to as \"reboot policy\" because you`re going to see it a LOT).2:  Followers, if they fall far enough behind, will get `stuck' in the environment and if you're not paying attention you will lose them.  I had to retrace my steps several times and lose valuable time to find my followers.  It was just annoying.3:  You can get stuck in the environment just as easy as your followers.  Twice have I gotten irreparably stuck in the environment that I had to resort to reloading the auto-save file.4:  As you play for a while, you'll notice the loading to gets progressively, and ridiculously, LONG.  I conferred with a lot of other players and this seems to plague most gamers regardless of what system they're running.  Simply refer to the reboot policy and start over again... and again.5:  This may be me but several times the NPCs missed their ques and the quests didn't continue.  For instance, I was trying to recruit a warring tribe to fight against Cesaer's Legion and couldn't because the second-in-command missed his mark but, since I saved LONG after figuring out how to get the no-Khan-left-behind game engine to see the gaming trigger dancing right in front of them, I missed my opportunity and had to resort to something else to complete the quest.6:  Is it just me or does the automated aiming system (VATS) unable to shoot over rocks even though you're clearly aiming above the rocks?7:  Repeating dialog.  Sometimes those pesky card-carrying union NPCs get so nervous about being \"disenfranchised\" by their local order of Teamsters that they didn't notice that they're repeating their lines in critical dialog over and over and over.  Reboot policy.8:  Auto-save freeze.  This is probably a 1/10,1000 thing but I've had it happen three times when the game froze during auto-save and corrupted the saved data.  To avoid any complications I had to rely on the Chicago-style of saving (early and often) less I lose up to several hours of game play in a corrupt save data.9:  Faction reputation glitch.  \"Good, bad, or somewhere in between,\" you are judged by each faction by how you deal with them.  However, I've heard two complaints about factions just randomly attacking the player for no reason at all.  My little brother, for instance, was \"idolized\" by the New California Republic and stopped a high profile assassination attempt but, for some weird reason, still gets randomly attacked by NCR troopers at a critical point in Hoover Dam meaning he cannot progress in the game.In short, New Vegas has more glitches than a Walmart.com kiosk that runs Windows 2000 while the website is optimized for Windows 7, utilizes a Pentium 2 processor, and has been running for foru years straight (District Manager Kristi!  Please, for the love of GOD, get our systems upgraded!!).  Many a night, like last night with the excessive loading times, I found myself cursing out loud to the screen and discovered that trying to beat Call of Duty: Black Ops on Veteran was less stressful (review coming soon!).GraphicsThey are virtually unchanged from Fallout 3.  The character graphics are still a solid mash of rendering akin to World of Warcraft.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing as the game itself is insanely vast, particularly the environments.  One look around outside and one will see just how much effort was redirected from character and weapon designs to the actual environment.  It is the 1960s Rat Pack era Mojave Desert with the mobster themes.  All the same, the graphics are nothing truly to marvel at.Music and SoundAlso virtually unchanged as the music is direct copy/paste with a few new additions such as the NCR music at Hoover Dam.  This means you get treated to hearing the same wandering music and horn blasts as long as your system won't crash.The biggest differences in the sound is the voice cast and licensed tracks.  The voice cast is completely different so you don't hear Generic Voice Actors A, B, C, or D speaking for 60+ different characters... instead you have Generic Voice Actors E, F, G, and H speaking for 60+ different characters... and Mathew Perry of Friends.I liked how Ron Perlman reprised his role as narrator, and Michael Dorn is ALWAYS a welcomed voice actor among video games (Loved him in Saints Row 2).  It was interesting having Mathew Perry, an actor typically reserved for wussy roles, serving as a sinister and malicious gangster that tries to kill you... twice.  Wayne Newton (aka Mr. Las Vegas) plays the perfect role as \"Mr. New Vegas,\" a DJ that broadcasts Frank Sinatra among other Vegas favorites that seem more suited for Kill Bill than new Vegas.  BTW: is it just me or do all three radio stations play the same thing?OverallOverall, the game play is virtually identical to that of Fallout 3, debatably placing New Vegas in the realm of a highly glorified expansion pack.  This is not necessarily a bad thing if the game can stand up on its own, which New Vegas does despite its copy/paste appearance and extreme array of glitches.  It's still super addicting as my number of logged hours prove.  However, given the extent to which the game is made and the amount of hours needed to beat the game, replay value is actually lower than one would think.  Most gamers, even hardcore ones like me, despise doing highly tedious tasks over, especially if they take a few hours.  I only played through Fallout 3 twice and that was for achievements, a feat I believe I can recreate with New Vegas.All in all though, despite its abundance in shortcomings, New Vegas does pull itself off as a great RPG in the Fallout arsenal.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2010"}

It has it all: a good story, great characters, and a beautifully designed world. Mostly it's the characters that draw me in. Lloyd is the main character and he's kind of an idiot. He's always getting really obvious things wrong and always needing basic things explained (which is great from a storytelling perspective). Genis is his best friend and an elf. He's just a sweet innocent kid, but put the two of them together and comedy is bound to ensue. Raine is Genis' big sister and the schoolteacher. She has a teeensy little obsession with archaeology that has inspired my friends' battle-cry \"For History!\" Then there's the romantic interest: Collette, the chosen one who is destined to become an angel and regenerate the world. For the world is dying and the last chosen of regeneration failed, leaving Collette with a lot to live up to. She avoids the typical chosen one cliches by being quite a ditz and having a real propensity for being kidnapped. The final character (for quite a while at least) is Kratos, the stereotypical powerful samurai-type character who says little at all times. I love these characters, right down to their names. Genis was called Genius in Japan and lives up to his name as does the ruined city of Luin (Ruin in Japan), Kratos is Ancient Greek for strength, and Lloyd is... um, probably Mongolian for a stupid person or something. The enemies in the game are an organization of half elves who are intent on farming humans for a reason as yet unclear.Gameplaywise this game is excellent. Instead of the turn based combat common in most RPGs of this age it features real time combat. Actually, the combat system on here is quite hard and I almost gave up due to the difficulty of the bosses. This isn't a game for those without good abilities monitoring multiple characters. Random battles are avoided in place of visible enemies on the world map. You can't avoid all of them, but it does at least allow you to limit the number you encounter. The design for the towns (while simplistic) is quite well done. Copying Wind Waker everything in the game is cell shaded to give it the look of a cartoon. They even have anime cutscenes, albeit all too rarely. This makes the game quite beautiful and gives it a real sense of style. At various points in the game you will see a little text pop up and if you hit Z then you can watch a short conversation between a few of your characters. These are short, often funny, and contribute nothing to the plot. They are however great for character moments. They're some of the most entertaining parts of the game.It does have to be said that this game runs a little long. And there are story problems too, which are exacerbated by the length. Any game where there are half a dozen characters on your side who could have told you the entire plot at any point but don't, and where the main characters don't think to pose even basic questions is bound to seem annoyingly artificial at times. It should probably have ended a good ten hours before it does. The story is ridiculously complex with character motivations and plot points coming out of seemingly nowhere. Some of these are really good, but some are quite odd as well as being needlessly convoluted and unclear (I'm thinking of a certain tree in particular). But nevertheless the game does an admirable job at fleshing out an entire world that feels very real and complex.So to conclude: Excellent game with great characters and a fun plot but too difficult in some areas and starts to drag by the end. Hopefully you can work your way through the problems because these are some truly wonderful characters. Admittedly there are two or three I don't care about, but the rest I absolutely love and I never got tired of watching their interactions. A great game and I'm sorry to be finished with it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2012"}

The upgrades to running, sliding, climbing obstacles and shooting plus the souped up graphics and new weapons make this the most beautiful and addicting COD multiplayer ever.  I can't wait for more maps already, though!  The Extinction mode isn't for me.  I never liked zombies and this is pretty much that with aliens.

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"nemesis","summary":"back from the dead...","reviewText":"Once apon a time, a company named Capcom went out on a ledge, and created a game that brought survival horror to the masses. However, after the second Resident Evil title, the series started to head down hill, not because the games started to get bad, but because all the games were next to the same, and nearly every survival horror game released after Resident Evil, FELT like Resident Evil, which helped the games get old rather quickly. However I am proud to say that the series that kick-started the genre is the same one that will bring it back from the dead. Take every Survival Horror cliche in the book and simply forget it. Slow pacing, long, drawn out puzzles, repetitive gameplay, predictible boss batles, bad controls, horrible voice acting, fixed camera angles... all of it. Gone. Resident Evil 4 does away with the slow pacing, puzzles that make no sense and tank controls that have defined the genre for so long. The game is fast... very fast, and it snow-balls as the game gets faster and more frentic. Enimies no longer stumble twards you with their arms out-streached, but run after you with frightening speed, brandish and use/ throw weapons, and communicate to take you down with cooridination. You will quickly learn that out in the open is not a good place to be, as the game's new enemies will jump at you from seemingly no where and quickly surround you. You will take refuge inside of a multitude of buildings, and the enemies will come after you. They will tear down doors, set up laders to climb through windows, and come after you in large numbers. however, you have the tools to even the odds... Ammo is far more plentiful, and weapons are more fantastic and easier than ever to use. With a new \"over the shoulder\" camera and a laser targeting system, you can take out enemies in different ways.Is one holding an axe? shoot him in the hand and he won't be. Are they running at you? shoot them in the knee caps and they won't be moving fast for long. Up close and in your grill? Aim for the head for a quick kill (untill the sun goes down... then a head shot might be a bad idea, and you will find out why). Because of all these options (which building to take refuge in, enemy AI, weapons and tactics for them) no fire fight will ever play out the same (which adds to the replay value in a way you can only immagine if you have played the game... it's that much fun) Because of the frightening speed that the game moves along at, you will always have your heart pounding, and it might be easy to overlook some things in the game. Things like photo-realistic graphics, perfect character models, character diologe that never feels cheesy, and sounds like it was writen with a western audience in mind. Things like some of the best sound witnessed outside of a movie theater, with crashing thunder and lightning, blood chilling chainsaw whines and hisses, and splintering boards and cracking wood as Ganado (the game's main enemy)break through your barrier of refuge. The game's story, while slow to get going, is every bit as fantastic and movie-like. While I won't spoil any of the great story, I will tell you that you won't be dissapointed, wether you are a long time fan of the series, or a first-timer. In conclusion, the game is a load of fun, and to be honest, you probably wouldn't even know it to be a Resident Evil title, were it not for the label on the front of the box, and some returning characters. Everything that has held the Survival Horror genre back for so long, Re4 finially puts them to rest. With an invintory that is more forgiving, controlls that will suit everyone, and enough heart pounding action and thrills to keep even the most hard-core adrenaline  junky satisfied, RE4 might very well be one of the best titles to be released this year. Don't let the demons of the series' past scare you away, as you would be making a mistake. This is, without a doubt, one of the greatest survival horror titles to have ever been released, and one you need to try, because it is unlike anything else you have ever played.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2005"}

It is a 3rd person shooter that is realistic in everyway.  The game carries you off from the Thai Jungles to oil tankers.  You can kill all enemies with a well placed shot and that means you can also suffer the same fate with a well placed shot.  The gameplay is very fluid and action oriented.  Although, this isn't your typical strafing shooting game, it takes some cold hard skill.  If you fail to use \"Cold Hard Skill\" then you'll end up with you and your 3 seal buddies dead.  The sound in this game is very real sounding with the sound of bullets flying past, the yells and screams of terrorists, the soft footsteps of you seal, and the commands and info that floods through your included USB headset.  All the sound affects are great with the exception of the music. When you fire upon somone the music will start up to increase the drama, but sometimes, it's way off key.  The graphics are excellent from the enviroments down to the characters' faces.  This game can also be played online, and that is the best part about this game.  So if you just buy it for the single player expirience, then your not getting your money's worth.

But that just about does it.  Its nothing we haven't seen with Call Of Duty before, run gun and shoot em up.  There are a few new twists, like the explosive crossbow and zip lines, but nothing to get excited about.  Too much filler time between missions as well.Zombies is in a way, an improvement from WaW zombies.  Bigger move involved maps, smoother graphics.  Zombies however, is much harder and the weapon selection and upgrades aren't nearly as good as zombies from WaW.  Too much wacked out crap going on like having to run and link the teleporter then run back to teleport and THEN pack-a-punch.  Zombie crawlers that explode, the \"Five\" map is just too hard and spastic, to the point where it is nearly unplayable.  Ascension is decent and if you're a hardcore fan of zombies, I'd suggest spending the $15 to get it, it will provide many hours of enjoyment.  New perks, easter eggs, a lot of great stuff going on, but on the same hand, even Ascension is getting to the point of being ridiculously aimless and crazy.Combat training sucks.  Horrible.  The bots are absolutely stupid on the lowest 2 settings so you have to bump them up to hardened to get anything out of it (and then its still kind of stupid)  can't even play on veteran, the bots all run with snipers and auto head shots, just unplayble.  Unfun, doesn't simulate real game play, won't make you better, just make you angry.Now for the online (since thats mainly what COD is about).  If you want good online, DON'T buy this sorry piece of crap.  Buy Homefront, buy Medal of Honor, go back to Modern Warfare, hell go buy Monopoly and play that.  Laggy, sorry host migration, can't keep parties together, sometimes you find lobbies quick, sometimes it takes up to 10 minutes.  All the cheaters, hackers, glitchers, and exploiters have made the transition on to this game.  Aimbots, rapid fire controllers, wall hacks, everything.  I played 10 matches today and couldn't find 1 without a cheater.  The weapons suck, you are forced to run around with the AK74u with rapid fire or else you will get owned.  The Famas has yet to be patched, 1 or 2 shots and it kills you and it has an incredible fire rate.  Pretty much, run with a 203 or rapid fire because you won't stand a chance in a head to head fight.  The weapon's damages are too screwed up to make it fair.  Hit detection....wait, theres hit detection?  Forget ADS, it doesn't matter the bullet will go where it wants to.  I hoped the First Strike map pack would give something new but they don't just more horribly designed maps that are frustrating.  No fix on the spawning issues yet and everyone still runs hardline, gets 2 kills and you have RC XDs live and in effect blowing up everyone.  MW2 went down the drain, but at least it had a solid server, smooth game play, and some fun stuff going on in it.  Everything about Black Ops sucks, perks, weapons, maps, spawning, EVERYTHING.  I suggest go to Vegas with about $15,000 and hit the tables, because thats all this game is, a gamble.  No skill, just randomly picking and choosing who is going to die next.  You may go 20 and 1 then go 2 and 30.  One day the Commando is awesome, the next day you have to run extended mags and MAYBE 45 bullets will kill someone.  It sucks, WaW was the last great COD IMO and I will never waste money on another piece of crap Treyarch makes.  They should be ashamed of this game and hold their heads as low as possible. If you are looking for online, AVOID at all costs!  And the problems are on Xbox as well, not as bad, but still there so don't start PS3 bashing.  Its just one of the worst video games in history.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2010"}

Eminem trailer played during the MLB playoffs, NFL Sundays, and Primetime?!  WOW this is a big game release,and a big deal to Activision.#2  THE BAD:  The graphics are noticeably below average, I was dissapointed immediately.  Some report that the game looks better on the 360 than it does on the PS3.  Sure they do look darker and clearer on the 360, but trust me it's not enough to make that much of a difference in the overall appearance of the game.  As well, I played close to 50 games and there wasn't one game that didn't glitch, have a framerate issue at least twice a game, both of these concerns speak volumes.  This game wasn't polished.  I think the majority of us felt the Treyarch team was playing hacky sack for about a year because they felt the game was done and brilliant long ago.  I wasn't crazy about the gun games and wager matches other than the one in the chamber game I love that idea, because your playing these games with these horrible graphics that feature the guns and your hands and wrists all look undetailed.  The RC car is too easy to get and it unerves everyone and takes away from the focus of the game as you can hear it all over the map; and all it will likely kill is one player.#3  THE GOOD:  The player and gun/gear customization is a brilliant move.  The menus are excellent.  The maps are all so different and creative.  One in the chamber game sounds fun I couldn't find it, likely an unlock.  You can set and move your claymore, very cool. Co-op zombie mode a fun diversion.  Combat mode with bots another great idea.  Hidden games.  The game is chock full of content.#4  However, to me the game lacks heart.  It's just missing the drama and intensity of a war themed FPS, it feels more like an arcade game.  As players run by with the horrible graphics... ping! I shot the rabbit, here ducky... ping! with the cartoon-like undetailed graphics.#5  Fun Arcadey FPS lacking the intensity of its three predecesors, but not lacking on the fun meter, as well as chock full of talent.  Normally I'd give a game like this a 7/10, but with all the content smashed into this game and the cool custmization I'll give it a solid 8, more of a fun game than a great game.#6  I sold my copy for $50 this morning and will be going back to MW2 this evening.  The tough part is all your boys are going to be playing Black Ops, but there are plenty of people still playing MW2.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2010"}

Win win.  I am a huge Mario Kart geek/ freak/ otaku, whatever you want to call me.  I bought the DSi XL 25th anniversary release with Mario Kart DS because I love these titles so much.  And for the record, I also enjoy the driving simulation titles like Gran Turismo.So Nintendo went with the same formula they've been using: create new tracks for the new circuit, then have a large number of popular tracks from previous Mario Kart releases.  In this title, like previous releases, you can change your character as well as their kart, so you're not handicapped for enjoying one character and forced to use their kart as in N64 and previous versions.  I do use Mario most often because he talks the most trash in game (well, more like saying 'bye-bye' when passing someone and such).The 50cc races are perfect for beginners, and really everyone should race these first to get a feel for the game.  Once you can rock the 50cc circuits (and unlock more tracks) you can move on to the harder 100 and 150cc races.The 3d is well suited for this title.  More so than other 3ds titles I've played.  But even toggling the 3d off doesn't really handicap the game.With the dozens of tracks and lots of kart customization options, this is a game that will probably occupy dozens of hours of players' time.

The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

It's time to get physical with the ladies as they set, spike, and kill their way to the championship title on the tropical beach resort, Zack Island. The more points you receive on the court, the more you can customize your characters with over 100 swimsuits and accessories. At night, Zack Island becomes a haven for nightlife activities including an island casino, a movie theatre, and a radio station with all your favorite sand and surf tunes.","reviewerName":"DeRosset Myers \"DeRo\"","summary":"More addictive than heroin . . . and safer","reviewText":"The game takes place on Zack Island, a remote volcano bought by a character from Dead or Alive 2 & 3 (and maybe 1). On Zack Island, you can play volleyball (duh!), shop for swimsuits, accessories, and other junk; and you can play at the casino at night. Oh yeah, and you can also hop on floating devices at the pool but you can't swim in the pool. You can swim in the ocean (sometimes) but not in the pool . . . and you have no control over how you swim in the ocean.You earn money for shopping be either playing volleyball, jumping at the pool, or gambling. It's also a good idea to send gifts so you can get swimsuits from other characters that may not be available to your own. Some characters may not respond well, which can sometimes be very frustraiting. Tina is especially stubborn if you're not playing as Lisa.Personally, I think the casino was a bad idea. Tecmo should have put an arcade in instead where you can play classic Tecmo games like Ninja Gaiden and . . . uh . . . whatever else Tecmo did back in the 8- and 16-bit days. If you prefer casino games like poker, roulette, blackjack, and slots, though, you'll be happier with this part of the game than myself.The controls are tight. The characters respond well to even the slightest presses in either analog or digital mode. This is in reference to the trigger buttons as there is no analog sensetivity for the control stick or cross-pad.Overall, I have to say this is the best volleyball game I ever played. Each character has her own personality, the controls are outstanding once you get used to them (GameFaqs.com has guides incase you don't get an instructions manual), and you can add your own music tracks to the game via the X-Box hard drive -- a nice touch if you don't like reggae.Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball is a great game even if you don't like the Dead or Alive fighting division of the series.For anyone who is confused by the M rating and the nudity label, let me explain: If you watch the opening video (the one that starts right after the X-Box display screen when you turn the machine on, before you go to Zack Island), you may notice a questionable piece featuring Christie. Even though it's hard to see Christie...through the shadows, she is obviously naked. That, my friends, is nudity. Whether Helena in her robe is also questionable depends on who you ask.Also, apparently you can make the girls topless if you complete a vacation within 13 minutes. Even skipping all the volleyball, this is easier said than done. It's very taxing on the nerves and can make you feel bitter. I don't recommend trying this. I'm not even sure it works. Just don't try it.Another piece that may have earned the game an M-rating is also in the opening video. It has a playful part with Lei Fang and Hitomi that could be considered homosexual. The very idea that sexual preference could effect a video game's is inappropriate, but apparently existent.So how does this title compare to Beach Spikers, Outlaw Volleyball, and Summer Heat? I thought Summer Heat was worthless and I hated Outlaw Volleyball, so I won't waste your time with those - not that you couldn't just stop reading this. Where-as SEGA's Beach Spikers is more pick-up-and-play, DOAXBVb has a higher learning curve. There are no player-indicators when you play volleyball, so it's not as easy to catch as in Beach Spikers. Also, the camera in DOAXBVb is somewhat fixed to the side of the net, where-as the view in BS flies around to whatever the game thinks best suits the player (and usually does a damn good job). In the end though, I think DOAXVB gets the better score because of all the extra features. Would this game even be comparible to Beach Spikers without the over-100 swimsuits and accessories? Absolutely not, but that's probably why it has them. Also, DOAXVB does not have an excruciatingly annoying announcer and you can turn the character voices off without sacrificing the sound effects.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2003"}

I ended up played the game seven hours straight, an unprecedent time spend on one game by me.I liked many aspects of this game, from the badguys, to the weapons, to the atmoshphere. This is the first game I played which actually creeped me out at times. That opening sequence played a good mind trip, with immersing you into an everyday enviornment which spirals horribly out of control. But I can describe the weapons and beasties some other time. I think what I have shown you speaks for whether or not this game is a good investment.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2001"}

I know people are rather concentrated on the DS line of systems now, but don't forget this: The Game Boy is what started everything (Or is it the Game & Watch...?). If you own a Nintendo Gamecube, you need to get this thing.The Game Boy Player works a lot like the Super Game Boy for the Super Nintendo. It is compatible with the Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, but it also has compatibility with all of your Game Boy Advance games. That is pretty cool already.So you pop in the game, and you just play with your Gamecube controller. Portability is really awesome, but sometimes, there's nothing like playing a game with a controller in your hand.If you play a Game Boy game that has a Super Game Boy symbol on it, let me tell you right now, that the Super Game Boy features won't show on the Game Boy Player. Instead, you play the game as it was on the original green-and-white screened system (with GBC colors).You know what I think would be a bit funny. Playing a GBA version of a game, that's on the Gamecube, on the Game Boy Player. It just seems a bit funny in a way. Playing Pac-Man World 2 or WarioWare Inc on the Game Boy Player. How amusing...in fact, you can just make the same thing happen with the Super Game Boy. Play a Game Boy game that was also released on the Super Nintendo with the Super Game Boy.The Super Game Boy menu is not present in the Game Boy Player, but there are some options to choose from.If you are playing a Game Boy game with a gyro sensor, you can't use the controllers to play them (Although pressing the buttons are required).

Encounter valuable allies and dangerous enemies on Wayne&#x2019;s search for the truth.","reviewerName":"Michael J. Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"Ice Pirates on Hoth","reviewText":"I put Lost Planet: Extreme Condition on my wish list because it looked like Gears of War crossed with Robotech, featuring giant mecha and tiny soldiers battling huge monsters in a frozen environment. That's more or less what I got.Our hero, Wayne Holden (modeled after Byung-hun Lee and voiced in English by Josh Keaton), loses his father to a giant Akrid known as Green Eye. When the archvillain of the game is chiefly known by the color his eyes, it's an indicator that perhaps the translation isn't perfect. Or to put it another way, we don't call Godzilla \"Flaming Mouth.\"Anyway, Wayne wakes up on the same frozen planet, rescued by the tasty purple-haired Luka (Christina Puccelli) and her aggravating little brother Rick (Justin Shenkarow). Rick's one of those characters who always wears goggles, as if they're surgically affixed to his face. He's a staple of anime, the energetic techie that tags along with the hot chick to make her more effective, since said hot chick doesn't seem to do a whole lot besides make poor fashion choices.Yuri (Andrew Kishino), who looks like a villain, complete with narrow gaze and white hair, leads Luka and Rick. With Wayne joining their merry band, they're ready to go out into the frozen world and steal stuff.They're Ice Pirates...sorry, I mean Snow Pirates. Well, not really - they're actually the Rebels to NEVEC's Empire, battling on Hoth...Wait, this isn't the Empire Strikes Back?Which review is this? Lost Planet? Oh yeah, right.Sorry, sorry, my attention wandered from the convoluted plot. It involves Wayne losing his memory, a bit of time travel, a weird glowy thing attached to his arm that powers the mecha (sorry, VIRTUAL SUITS...can't the anime community agree on a standardized term for these bloody things?), some rivalry between Luka and some other mannish-sound woman, and another bad guy (we know he's bad because he wears glasses) who wants to take...over...THE WORLD! MUAAHAHAHAHA!This is a mech game masquerading as a third-person shooter. Wayne plods along, even when there's no snow. He stumbles when he jumps. Fortunately, he has a grappling hook that fires from his wrist and never manages to dislocate his arm. I ended up shooting the grappling hook at a lot of stationary objects and dragging Wayne along like a slower, dumber version of Spider-Man.The other challenge is that Wayne requires heat to live. Fortunately, the Akrid provide it, which really motivates Wayne to kill them however he can. There are also huge vats of energy lying around that are just waiting to be shot up. What doesn't make nearly as much sense is why Wayne has to power up his heat energy when he's indoors. Or in a volcano. Seriously.The Akrid are beautiful to behold. They are all weird, squiggly bug-types, each unique and varied and most of all HUGE. Lost Planet revels in the size of the landscape, throwing giant worms and massive moths at you as you struggle with poor mini-Wayne to get to a mech. Once you're in a mech, the game becomes much more fun, because you can move faster than a snail's pace and blow things up much more effectively.The human opponents, also in mechs and on foot, are annoying and suffer from the I MUST SHOUT SOMETHING BEFORE I DIE syndrome. Every time. When you kill a lot of these guys, the slogans and rallying cries get old. The Akrid bosses, who don't speak, make up for it.In fact, the game is all about the bosses. Each is innovative, challenging, and terrible to behold. However, Lost Planet is a game of attrition; on the longer levels it carries over the energy you collected in the beginning. Since heat energy and damage are tied together, failing to get enough energy or taking too much damage in an earlier part of the game can make a boss battle impossible. I had to restart two levels from scratch until I got it right.But Lost Planet is addicting. I played it on hard and all of the boss battles were very close. Two of the boss fights ended with Wayne going through two mecha, a handful of grenades and a missile launcher. Now THAT'S a fun game!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00IPTUJ8G","description":"","reviewerName":"Maek","summary":"Not perfect by any means, but a fantastic job by Iron Galaxy","reviewText":"I waited before posting my review since I wanted to test the cross-save functionality and 2-player co-op features of the game.There have been many reviews on this game and just about every single game critic review that I have seen have lambasted the Vita version for not living up to the PS3 version.  Is it fair?  No...but it's an issue that's hard to avoid.  With some of the gameplay issues, one may wonder if it's worth the purchase or not if one already owns it...and I'll get into that later.This review assumes that the reader is familiar with the first Borderlands.  Borderlands 2 is a continuation of the first game, with new Vault Hunters arriving to Pandora at the behest of Hyperion Corporation's recent leader, Handsome Jack.  Handsome Jack betrays the players straight off the bat (he has no interest in having others \"help\"...he just wants to entice Vault Hunters to kill them off) and leaves them for dead.  The would-be Vault Hunters are discovered by the lovable ready-to-quip robot, Claptrap, and the adventure thus begins and eventually involves Vault Hunters from the original game.  It's addictively good fun to say the least and the shoot-and-loot that made the first game so fun to play returns in spades here.Value-------First and foremost, this issue of Borderlands 2 includes 6 DLC's, so at $39.99 it's a fantastic purchase at launch.  Without factoring in the PS3's season pass, you're looking at about $50 of DLC alone.Gameplay--------------I was worried when critics shredded the game because of the lack of L2/R2/L3/R3 functionality.  Instead, the rear touch pad is utilized.  I use trigger grips, so I didn't find myself \"accidentally\" touching the pad as some critics have claimed.  Tap the left side of the rear touch pad and you engage in sprinting (no need to hold it down...you'll run and keep running unless you stop or get interrupted).  Tap the right side and you'll use your melee attack.  Touch the lower right-side of the touchscreen and you'll activate your special ability.  Touch the lower left-side of the touchscreen and you'll throw a grenade.Don't like where the controls are mapped?  Well, guess what...you can remap them!  Including that in the programming of the game was a big plus for me.There are a few unfortunate cons, however:1.  Two-player co-op.  The inclusion of a 4-player co-op session proved to be too much for the hardware, so that sacrifice was made.  Considering that only my daughter and I play, that wasn't a huge one for us.2.  Lower enemy counts.  The hardware, again, is pushed to its limits so you'll find densely populated areas (like the Varkids in Caustic Caverns) to be reduced by about 20 - 30% compared to its console/PC brother.3.  No ad-hoc mode.  Really?  Why would you NOT include an ad-hoc mode in addition to finding other players online, especially given that ad-hoc generally runs much smoother than a Wi-Fi session?  This is an unfortunate omission, especially given that my daughter and I play it...we're forced to go online.Yes, I know that I'm comparing the hardware again, but if being forced to choose between alternatives, then one should know.  However, there are reasons to get it which I'll describe later in \"Who Should Get This.\"Graphics------------This is where the unfortunate comparisons are made again.Graphics take a noticeable hit...far off plateaus may pop in \"closer\" than the console/PC versions.  If the firefight gets heavy, framerates will drop noticeably below the 30 fps target.  Enemies will explode in red, rapidly disappearing chunks instead of ragdolling to the ground.Is it game-breaking?  No...it's just occasionally...\"jarring.\"  But I didn't find myself in a framerate drop so massive that I found myself dead in the next heartbeat...once you get used to it, it plays just fine, especially with a 2nd player.That said, I've heard many people stating that the Vita's hardware can't be expected to do much, etc., etc.  Given how good certain titles look (especially Uncharted Golden Abyss O-M-G), I find that explanation to be a frustratingly bad one.  Borderlands 2 isn't a graphical marvel by any means and I know that the Vita could have handled more.  That, and given that the Vita's resolution is lower than the PS3, it makes me wonder how much of the hardware is truly at fault especially given how impressive other titles look.  Part of it may have to do with how well the original title was coded to begin with and relying on the brute force of console/PC power to compensate for sloppier coding...we'll never know.  But, like I said, Uncharted titles on both the PS3/Vita platforms demonstrate that the hardware is capable of so much more.In summary, graphically it looks quite decent but there are some minor framerate/texture/pop-in caveats that go along with that.  Other than that, it looks like a miniature version of the big brother versions.Who Should Get This-----------------------------The million-dollar question.  If you already on it on the PS3 and/or the PC, and you prefer to play with 2-3 others, pass on this.  If you only play with one other or by yourself and you have it on the PS3, then you may want to get it if you play on the road because of the cross-save feature.In my case, however, I play exclusively with my daughter... which comes to my next point.  The really NICE thing about Borderlands 2 on the Vita is that your saves will transfer from the PS3 and vice versa.  Simply upload your saved character and download on the other platform and you're good to go.  My daughter and I both own Vitas with our own accounts and this worked PERFECTLY for us.  We usually play on the PS3 at home, but recently we played on our Vitas during vacation with our characters on the road.  Some items, unfortunately, do NOT transfer because only 2 of the 4 MAIN DLC expansions (not including the headhunters) are not available on the Vita...yet (and that is a hopeful \"yet\").  But never feat!  Your items are still there...but DLC-specific items, skins, etc., from DLCs not available yet on the Vita won't show up in the Vita.As a result, I love my Vita copy simply because we can take our adventure on the road.  I'm hoping eventually that the other DLC's become available (especially Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon's Keep...the funniest and best DLC ever).Summary-------------Borderlands 2 on the Vita is not a perfect experience nor is it as complete as the console/PC versions, but the shoe may fit for you if you play it by yourself or just one other.  Some lacking features are unfortunate, but the DLC's that are available at launch (and the $39.99 price tag to boot) offset these immeasurably and still make it fun to play.  I haven't encountered any groundbreaking issues with our Level 50 characters and we are looking forwards to many additional hours of fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2014"}

Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Robin to Motion Controller's Batman","reviewText":"Holy PS3 accessories :)The Navigation Controller is Motion Controller's (aka 'the Move') natural complement. It is not a 'must buy' at this time but it helps to have one for certain games where it's meant to be operated with 'the other' hand. If you don't have one, you can get away with a DualShock or a Sixaxis.To make an informed decision on whether a purchase is warranted at this time (or ever) it's important to be aware of the following:- At the time I am writing this, not too many 'Move' games need the Nav. Probably because, one week after Move's official launch there aren't too many Move games out there but that will change - I just ordered Heavy Rain which does use the Nav and I've had Little Big Planet 2 on order for quite a while.- There is nothing that that Nav can do that your DualShock or Sixaxis can't. In fact, the Nav Controller is nothing but the left side of the DualShock 3 plus the X and O buttons (PS button too) and minus rumble and motion sensitivity. You can, therefore, use your DualShock instead of the Nav on games that may require it.These being said, the Nav is a well-designed, quality built accessory that does what it's supposed to do very well. It may not look like much but holding and using it feels 'natural' and all the familiar controls are easy to reach even though it may take a little practice to get used to the unexpected but necessary O and X. And, of course, the Nav does NOT come with a wrist strap because it does not need one. The Nav Controller will not be used to hack and slash or punch or parry. As its name implies, its main use is for 'navigation', meaning mostly the analog joystick, but the L2/L3 triggers and the D-pad are also there when needed - in Aragorn's Quest you use the L2 to raise the shield.Rating the Nav controller for what it is and what it does, I find no faults with it whatsoever. I appreciate its exceptional design, quality and its apparent durability. Some of the early Move games that take good advantage of the Nav Controller include Heavy Rain, MAG, Aragorn's Quest at the time of this review, Little Big Planet 2 coming up in a couple of months, many in between, I hope. To the extent that the Move proves itself a success with game developers, the Navigation Controller will find its uses and its users. I believe it to be so because holding the DualShock in one hand while swinging the Motion Controller with the other is not a good way to play a game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2010"}

New features include Superstar voice overs, online play, new clean/dirty tactics meters, and a few other things.  Now on to the review.THE GOOD:-The new Royal Rumble meter makes Royal Rumble matches more exciting and more difficult to win.  In previous Smackdown games the Royal Rumble match was far too easy to win.  The new meter makes you have to push buttons to deplete a superstar's meter and knock them out of the ring.-The new Dirty/Clean meters award players for using Dirty or Clean tactics during a match respectively.-One of the few multiplayer titles on the PS2.  If you have 3 or more friends to play this game with then it has a huge fun factor.-The create a superstar is more customizable than ever.  Though it takes a long time to create a good superstar.-The AI has improved in many areas and the Legend diffuculty level makes this game a challenge for expert players.  The AI will even suprise you by stealing your own finisher in this game.-Challenge mode allows you to complete special objectives in matches to earn cash.  A good option over the weak season mode.-You have to choose from among 5 weight classes for your created superstars.  Each class is dominant in different stats.  No more Super Lvl 100 Created Superstars.THE BAD:-THQ had good intentions with the voice over feature but 90% of the time the superstars sound like they're on Nyquil or something.-The lineup of superstars is probably the weakest of any smackdown game thus far.  I guess it coincides with the lack of decent superstars in the WWE itself these days.  I agree with the other reviewer, they should've worked harder to get the rights to some better superstars.-Also just like all other smackdown games, unless you have other people playing with you, this game gets boring pretty quickly.-The storyline is complete garbage.  You have almost zero control over what happens in the season.  You can no longer choose what superstars are in the season.  After you play it once, you've played it a million times.  The exact same thing will happen over and over again.  If you want to build up your created superstars then you're forced to play through this hell several times.-Targeting on this game is the worst since the first Smackdown.  In HCTP your player would automatically target the nearest opponent.  This one makes you target the nearest player even if it's your own ally or the referee.  This is very annoying at times.-Though the AI has improved in some areas, they've become annoying in others.  It takes them forever to eliminate other superstars in a Royal Rumble match.  I was the number 30 superstar in the Season and had to wait well over 30 minutes for the AI to eliminate each other.THE UGLY:-The online feature is what really had me excited about playing this game.  Imagine my disappointment to discover that you could only play a regular SINGLE MATCH or a boring Bra and Panties match online.  With the major advancements going on today in game you would think THQ could bring something more to the table.  So the online feature is basically obsolete.  It's sad really.  This game could've potentially had infinite replay value if it were truly ONLINE.This game is good for a group of friends playing multiplayer.  One of the few titles like this you'll find on the PS2.  Unless you're a hardcore wrestling fan and and will buy this game regardless, then I recommend that you rent it a couple of times because it really doesn't last much longer than a few weeks.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2005"}

You start out in a brown-grey combat zone, hiding behind bunkers and shooting away at the incoming attackers. The game does a good job of really immersing you in this world. The sounds of war are all around you, the moke and blasts obscure your vision. You duck down as you reload, and your hands shake as you shoot. Bullets actually hurt you, compared to games where you seem to have a Terminator-like ability to absorb barrages without harm.Your environment has a good eye to detail - and is about as detailed as the PS2 can handle. Bushes have leaves, barbed wire has spikes. The people you meet really do seem like realistic individuals. The smoke clouds and fog are quite impressive. Yes, it's not photo-realistic, but you quickly get drawn into the world that surrounds you.The AI is reasonably good. Sure, the characters make some stupid decisions sometimes, but people do that in real life too. If the computer actually played every enemy as a top-notch super intelligent, super fast being, humans would rarely have a chance to win :) If your side was full of super-strategic people, why would they need you? Even with their faults, your squadmates each have their own strengths and weaknesses and it's up to you to deploy them properly.There are a ton of details in the game. When you climb a ladder, you can actually look around from where you are and it feels like you are at that spot.  When you reload, you actually look down at what you are doing.For those looking for a quick-fix arcade blaster, this game might not be a great fit. It is grey and dingy, not bright and colorful. Aiming takes skill, not button mashing.  You have to be strategic and look for appropriate cover to take out your enemy, you typically can't just run-and-blast and expect to survive. Also, the language is pretty foul.  These are hard core soldiers who aren't very PC.But if you're willing to put in the time and build up your skills, and if you're looking for a serious combat simulation that rewards patience and planning, you really should give Killzone a try. I know many people who are completely addicted!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000CQIDTC","reviewerName":"Jeff Johnson \"Jeff Johnson\"","summary":"A great episode that has everything great about Half-Life 2 without the driving","reviewText":"This is the PC episode for the fantastic first person shooter Half-Life 2. You do not need Half-Life 2 to play this episode. It has a lot more puzzles and action from the great original game. The expansion starts directly after Half-Life 2's ending, so you might want to beat the full game before you play the expansion.You start with a modified gravity gun and exclusively use it for the first hour of the game. The first hour feels like a good bit of puzzles with a side of shooting. Then once you get past the first hour the game opens up to more shooting and less puzzles. Its very nice. The shooting stays great, weapons are fun to shoot and have a great feel to them. All or almost all of the weapons return from the original game.It feels like a clever extension to the already great Half-Life 2. Which if you were looking for something drastically new, this isn't for you. While there are no major upgrades to enemies or weapons, the change in gameplay comes from Alyx Vance who will be with you through the expansion. While she's not with you 100% of the time, you do go off on your own while she waits. As a partner, she is extremely competent and in fact if you want to make things easy you can let her do the shooting when she's around. She rarely dies and never seems to run out of ammo.There are elements of horror when you're relying on flares and your flashlight fighting against zombies and headcrabs in a ruined building, using guns and explosive barrels. The expansion has you relying a lot more on your flashlight. Not 100% of the time, but maybe 10% of the time you will need to use your flashlight while being chased by zombies.All or almost all of the enemies return. There are Combine soldiers, gunships, headcrabs, zombies, antlions and so on. There is even a new armored zombie that will occasionally pull off a grenade and shuffle toward you. There are a diverse array of tactics used by the enemies. Combine soldiers will throw shoot, fan out, throw grenades, strafe, hide and other tactics. They will even fight with zombies or your friendly AI characters. You will find new ways to tackle old enemies, like burying antlion holes with cars and shooting them onto their backs with the gravity gun. You can reprogram gravity mines to go after enemies.The story isn't extended at all. There are a dozen or so achievements and my first playthrough lasted a mere 3+ hours. Which makes it well worth $10, but not the original prize of $30.In conclusion this is everything great about the original Half-Life 2 without the driving or open spaces. This is a great episode, but doesn't add much.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00008KTNW","reviewerName":"John Whaley","summary":"A Flawless Update of a True Classic","reviewText":"One of the highlights of the 8-bit era was the Ninja Gaiden trilogy.  Introducing the then-new concept of cinematic scenes between levels, Ninja Gaiden added a compelling story to a great action game.  Many people were worried that any attempt at &quot;modernizing&quot; this franchise would be mediocre at best.Not only did Tecmo beat expectations, they raised the bar for action gaming in general.Ninja Gaiden follows the exploits of Ryu Hayabusa, son of his ninja clan's leader, and wielder of the legendary Dragon Sword.  He is on a quest to retrieve The Dark Dragon Blade, counterpart of the Dragon Sword.  The Dark Dragon Blade was stolen from Ryu's village by a demonic warrior known as a Greater Fiend.  The Fiend also burned Ryu's village to the ground.While previous games, such as the Tenchu series, emphasized stealth, Ninja Gaiden is flat-out, ferocious swordplay from start to finish.  Ryu can also find and use a variety of other weapons, including a bow, flails, shurikens, and even a giant warhammer.  Amazingly, the game manages to move at a smooth framerate, even when Ryu is engaging multiple enemies in a frantic melee.The big difference between this game and it's predecessors is the learning curve.  This version of Ninja Gaiden QUICKLY gets very difficult.  Be prepared to learn most, if not all, of those moves listed in the subscreens.  The good news is that the challenge mostly comes from unpredictable enemies.  One of the downfalls of many games is that it is far too easy to spot a pattern in the enemies' movement.Overall, this game is one of the best action titles to come out in a long time.  However, due to the steep learning curve, it may not be something for beginners.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2004"}

You play the Nameless One, a confused but apparently immortal (in the sense of if you die, you don't die for good) wanderer of the planes, whose very flesh tells the tale of his endless struggles.  You are turned loose into a world that bears only a passing and vague resemblance to any other D&D; or RPG realm you may have encountered, and that is filled with endless mysteries and characters.  I've never played another game where you can spend an hour talking to the other NPCs in your party (let alone in the rest of the world), earning experience and knowledge for what you uncover about their lives, and never feel like you're bored.  There are plenty of fights but no sense of tedious hack-and-slash, and it's difficult to emphasize just how convoluted and intricate both the plot and the game systems really are.  As an example, at one point my Nameless character was festooned with power-granting tattoos, dual classed as a thief-mage, and clubbing his enemies with a severed limb from one of his own previous incarnations.  I mean, come on!This is not really an RPG you can 'power game' your way through, more to its credit.  One of the most important statistics is Wisdom, tactics are more important than brute force, and the puzzles and side quests are to be savored, not accomplished as rapidly as possible.Lastly, in response to some of the other reviews, I have to note a few things.  First, there are plenty of ranged weapons, particularly crossbows for a character you can obtain about halfway through in an impressive \"side\" quest.  Moreover, there are life indicators under the portrait for each NPC so it's easy to see when people are hurt.  And finally, having played Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate II, Icewind Dale etc, the spell names, types, and effects in Planescape are totally awesome and in keeping with the surreal and twisted landscape.  This is not a game to be missed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00000JRSB","reviewerName":"fallowstarz","summary":"Ahead of its own time in graphics; ahead of our current time in fun, immersive storytelling","reviewText":"Although this game is frequently criticized for featuring \"angsty characters\" and a large number of anime and video game cliches, critics of this game's plot should consider that fan perception of the originality of this game has been lessened considerably by the future inclusion of similar character and plot dynamics in the final fantasy series, particularly in FFVIII and FFX. This video game features truly incredible storytelling, and this game should be called cinematic not just because of the inclusion of FMV, but because of the large number of visual metaphors expressed in the game's visual direction. Consider the parallel between the stars in the game's opening and the sparks Aerith watches shooting out of the open electrical panel, or the fact that Midgar's poor literally live underneath its rich. The low-polygon-count 3-D presentation of this game gives it a visual style which emphasizes the geometric nature of objects, and the producers of the game have changed a technical limitation into a stylistic enhancement. The game's usage of light and dark, squalor and cleanliness, gloom and beauty, give it a literary theme of naturalism, by representing the products of human technology as ugly. The sweeping \"theme of Final Fantasy VII\", which compliments the wide-open world map prior to the summoning of Meteor, is first hinted at in \"Holding my Thoughts in My Heart,\" which plays at the precipice of the dystopian technopolis of Midgar. The game's various themes communicate the producers' vision of which environments represent hell, and which represent heaven. Even the ironic real-life double-meaning of \"finding the promised land\" is parallelled in the game by Shinra's misinterpretation of the religion of Aerith's race. The game spends a lot of time exploring the identities of the characters of Cloud, Aerith, Tifa and Sephiroth through dreams, memories, and hallucinations, and rather than including definitive, conclusive scenes in which the whole truth of the characters are revealed, the game challenges you, much like a David Lynch film, to discover the reality of various events by logically reconciling the various perspectives from which they are viewed. This is \"angsty storytelling\" at its most beautiful, as it challenges the players to make an effort to understand the characters, much in the same ways that the game designers would probably like to see more interpersonal understanding within humanity.This game improved upon the limit breaks of FF6, which could only be used by deliberately keeping the characters at dangerously low HP levels, by adding the limit bar, and the barrier and mbarrier bars also made combat more interesting, leading many players to wonder why they were subsequently removed from the series. Some minor design flaws in this game include the three-character limit in battle, which reduces the player's ability to diversify the roles of the heroes, and leads the player, on a logical level, to wonder why the other heroes are unable to participate. Also, the overavailability of gil makes purchasing weapons and items too easy, and minimalizes the usefulness of alternate methods for party growth, such as stealing weapons and items.If the battles as a whole seem too easy in this game, it is because the game was designed with the intention of challenging the player to experience it, rather than challenging the player to get through it. The game is filled with a variety of fun methods for winning battles, from high-powered summons to enemy skills, and some otherwise difficult boss battles become unloseable after equipping a specific accessory. Part of the coolness of this game is the fact that it was the first major RPG to allow the players to develop extremely poweful heroes, by combining abilities such as auto-resurrection, auto-haste, multiple counter attacks, mp absorbtion, and much more. In other words, the lack of challenge is largely deliberate, and designed to give the players freedom to choose which resources to throw at a particular battle, rather than forcing the players to throw everything they have at most battles in order to have a chance for victory. The inessential-but-fun nature of the sidegames, such as snowboarding and chocobo-breeding, mirrors the inessential-but-fun nature of the majority of the special abilities in this game which may be used during battle.FF VII must also be commended for the distinctively unique visual design of every dungeon and section of the map. Walking on the snowy north continent of the overworld, leaving footprints in the snow, feels completely different than walking in the shadow of Midgar, and getting lost in previously-unexplored environments, such as the chaotically-mapped Great Glacier, is more of a pleasure than an annoyance. Experimenting with different characters and weapons is fun in this game, and this is complimented by visual touches which were unique to this game at the time of its release, such as showing a different weapon in the battle character model's hand, depending on what is equipped.I played FFI, FFIV, and FFVI before this game, and on my first playthrough of FFVII, I mourned the absence of some elements included in FFVI, such as multi-party battles, and FFVI's non-linear second act, but in time, I came to realize that in terms of characterization and presentation, FFVII is the quintessential Final Fantasy game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2007"}

That was the case with The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time and Super Mario 3D Land, which brilliantly brought the drive of 3D games to the Nintendo portable family. But with all of that hype, there still have been some games that Nintendo gamers have eagerly awaited in sports. For a long while, many fans of the Mario Tennis games have wanted to see the next step in action. While there was a Mario Tennis game for the Nintendo Gamecube which did extremely well, there wasn't one of the Wii, and instead gamers got treated to a Mario Power Tennis, the same Gamecube game, but using Wii controls. Now, Mario Tennis has finally came to the Nintendo 3DS, and the big question is that is it worth the effort and money? Well, mostly a few aces, but not a complete game, set, and match.Mario Tennis Open for the Nintendo 3DS, brings in a lot of the ace action of what made Mario Tennis so popular on the home consoles for Nintendo in the first place, by letting you serve you way to the top of the tournament cup. The game is a bit different this time, by featuring online gameplay, which can be fierce and competitive as it is in the game, as now you can actually compete against others in local and multiplayer gameplay, with the streetpass action from the 3DS. The game features of course the traditional round of Nintendo and Mario favorites including the lovable Yoshi, Mario, the clever and tricky serves of Boo and power shot action of Bowser. The challenge takes you from traditional courts like the Mario Stadium, the strong bounce of Mushroom Valley, where you'll be playing on a tennis court, with the high-bounce of a mushroom, all the way to the frozen tundra of the Penguin Iceberg, where it can be fast, but easy to slow down on with the slippery ice court. The gameplay handles well as you play in singles and doubles tournaments with top notch results.There also are a few minigames that are also some good, some traditional from Mario Tennis games before, and others, not worth checking out. One of them is Super Mario Tennis, where you'll be serving and scoring as if you're playing the classic levels of Super Mario Brothers, and Galaxy Rally, in which you'll be playing against the Luma from Super Mario Galaxy trying to match him, and collect coins. There is also a bit of a challenge this time enduring with the controls too. That use of the gyro sensor in the 3DS, makes the control a bit more frustrating at times and hard to master. Yet, the game has also made it a bit simpler by sticking with traditional controls by the directional circle pad, and a touch screen control scheme where you can simply touch the screen to make the shot you want to use. That control scheme is a bit easier to play, and definitely more challenging, especially in online and tournament matches. But overall, a nice mixture within the gameplay to keep you playing in sport and aces to the top of the leaderboard.Overall, when it does come down to it, Mario Tennis Open is definitely worth playing for the Nintendo 3DS. While it does have some kinks in it from the controls and lack of minigames, it really is overall the game and the fun. It is a great game for die hard fans of Mario Sports games, and definitely a game that Nintendo 3DS fans have awaited for. I liked a lot in the game, and the fun is worth serving up a strong storm. While some might fight it to be a deuce, it definitely is worth at least a game, set and smashing match.Graphics: B+Sound: BControl: C+ for motion control; B for traditional controlFun & Enjoyment: B- for solo player; B for multiplayerOverall: B","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0038TT8QM","description":"","reviewerName":"Kevin Meade","summary":"Not a long time Civ Fan so to me it is an improvement","reviewText":"I was never a long time fan of the Civ series.  This game is different from the other Civ games.  That means if you are a long time Civ fan you may not like many things about it.  For me, it is good game for its genre.My Pros:I like the auto-features (auto-build/auto-explore).  I may at some point change to managing one or more of my worker units manually if I ever figure out how to do it better.  But there seems to be some bugs that need fixing here.  I notice the workers will go outside my city limits and I want to say they will even change what they have built to build somthing else.I like the narration.  I just wish there was more of it.  It got redundant real fast to hear the same quotes over and over.  There should be 10 or more quotes for each advance/event/whatever.  That way we could actually finish a game without overbearing repetition.I like that there is a lot less micro-management in this one.  This seems to be the biggest change that affects people.  Many long time Civ fans were into the micro-management.  Loosing it means a very different game and so it better be a really good \"different\" game or long time fans will be upset and so say real fast.A Demo.  There is a demo for this game.  They are to be commended for offering it.  So many games these days don't offer a demo.  They expect you to buy without having experienced it first (well at least there is youtube for videos).  I considered this game primarily because these was a demo to try and I figured in this day and age with so many bad things being done by vendors to gamers, I should support vendors when they do something right.  A Demo is very right.My Cons:STEAM.  I guess it is the way of the future but it upsets me that I cannot play the game without connecting to Steam.  Yes, Steam does offer many neat features, among them being keeping the game automagically up-to-date, and allowing for error reporting, and offering me a community of I want it.  So I suppose it plays a valuable role, but I do not like the apparent loss of control and the fact that steam games start doing stuff at install time which standalone games never did to me.  But in then end I know STEAM and all things like it (ACTIVISION/BLIZZARD Registration/Area Lockdown) is about controlling my ownership of a game and THIS grates against me really badly.  Enough that if things keep going the way they are I can see my gaming days comming to an end.  Might not be so bad to get out into the sun and fresh air anyway so maybe it is not a bad thing after all.Lack of good in game help.  At first the in-game help looked good, but there is a search feature that does not seem to work well.  It never finds anything I want to know about.Lack of in-game animations.  I wanted lots of movies and something that would exercise my directx11 video card but don't see any of it.  Maybe I am doing something wrong here.  Would not be the first time.Loose unit control.  It seems very easy to incorrectly click on a unit thus causing it to move when instead I wanted to give it a different order.  This could be corrected by an \"undo\" button that lets us undo steps before pressiong new-turn.  Maybe it is there and I just could not find it with the search eh?Sloppy uninstall.  This thing leaves stuff after it is gone (STEAM AGAIN?).  I hate that.My Final Thoughts:Overall I give it a 3 because it takes the game in a direction I like although I admit many others will not.Remember, the genre to which this game belongs is a slow paced game.  It will take hours to conclude a game.  This is the exact opposite in terms of speed as compared to a StarCraft game.  There is a demo.  Download it before you buy to see if it is what you want.Hail Flavius!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2010"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J4VQ","reviewerName":"1Dub79","summary":"PS3 The Remix","reviewText":"I previously had aPlayStation 3 40GB. However, it was on its last leg. Therefore, I decided to take advantage of GameStop's PS3 trade-in offer for this newer version. There are a few new features when comparing both systems.Size comparison:The slim is a lot smaller (7.05lbs.) than the fat PS3, which is 11lbs. Overall, the slim is 33% lighter than the fat PS3.Console design comparison:I actually like the new design of the slim. The body is not shiny or as fancy as the fat PS3. The texture would be similar to the finish of a counter top. The finish seems scratch resistant, as well. At least, it is not a dust magnetic and scratch haven as the fat PS3. The slim still has some shiny parts on the console, where the buttons are located. This part has a mirror-like finish, which is slightly different than the fat PS3's finish. Your reflection can be seen. That is the best way to describe it. In addition, both sides of the console has the same shiny finish ala the PS3 fat.Speaking of the buttons, some people do not like them because they are physical buttons, unlike the touch-sensitive buttons of the PS3 fat. I believe the slim's buttons are better because I do not have to worry about fingerprints, while pressing the buttons. In addition, the buttons no longer have to be held down to turn the system on or off. Just press the button, and the console turns on. The same happens when powering the console off. The power and eject buttons illuminate, as well. Therefore, players do not have to try finding the buttons, if they decide to turn it off in the dark. Of course, the controller can be used, as well.One of the most important new features is the quietness of the slim's fan. It is a lot more quiet than the fat PS3's fan. In fact, I have to get up close to the machine to hear it. That is a great thing. I can now play and not have to worry about that loud fan, which used to annoy me, while I used to play my fat PS3. The slim is more energy efficient and uses less power than the fat PS3. This could reduce the strain on this system, which could lead to issues from long term use, such as the YLOD. The HDD is easily accessible, now. It is directly underneath the power and eject buttons. Now, players can upgrade the HDD, without voiding the warranty. Of course, if players had a 40GB PS3, they can probably live with the 120GB HDD, which comes with the slim. That is a 80GB upgrade.Console set-up:Setting up the system could not be more easier. In fact, if you already have a router, just flash through the options, which ask about your internet set up. Of course, I have a wired router. Therefore, it might be a little different for wireless router owners. During set-up, players will be prompted to create a new PSN ID or use the previous one. If players are worried about transferring data, such as games saves, music or pictures from one PS3 to another, no problem. If you still have your old PS3, plug the ethernet cable to each console. For those, who have data saved to a flash drive, just plug it into the slim, and copy the data. It is that easy.In case of a possible YLOD or other issue, I would recommend having a flash drive, and saving your data. Who wants to lose game saves, pictures, and music? If you have downloading demos, add-ons, and full games, do not worry! For players with an existing PSN ID, just re-download the demos, add-ons or full games. Of course, you will not be re-charged for the re-downloading of your add-ons or full game purchases because they were already purchased via PSN account.The verdict:Outside of what was mentioned, there are no other new features. However, if gamers are thinking about switching to PS3, the slim is a good way to start. For those looking to just switch from a fat PS3, I would not recommend it, unless you feel like it is necessary. Either way, this system is worth owning.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000W5Y49G","description":"The Wii Zapper is a gun peripheral that allows the user to insert a Wii Remote and Nunchuk, both sold separately, into either end and play a compatible game. The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. The Zapper comes withLink's Crossbow Training, which helps to familiarize the player with the Zapper in a shooting gallery style game.Link's Crossbow Trainingcontains three game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger.Features:Target Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.Defender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.Ranger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments.The Wii Remote and Nunchuk are sold separately","reviewerName":"Enjolras","summary":"Nice to shoot a few bad guys after a hard day at work","reviewText":"The Wii Zapper and the Link's Crossbow Training are simple but fun. Don't be fooled by the title - it's not just a training game. The game has quite a few stages and levels. This makes it fun for novice to hardcore gamers. I personally like the stages where you get to shoot enemies. The combination of the gun and game is not bad for $20.

{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube. For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"D. Allen","summary":"First game of the new generation","reviewText":"The most advanced console I owned at the time of this game's release would have been the NES. I was about 18 at the time and in my senior year of highschool, too. So with my part-time cashier job, I saved up for a Nintendo Gamecube out of the fact that I owned one of Nintendo's greatest console and it was way past due to get a new system and also the fact that I would have a long summer break before college. When I picked up the Gamecube, I also picked up Resident Evil. Never really knowing what the game was about or even having played the original, I just hoped it was good.I must say it was one of the best purchases I ever made. At the first moment I loaded it up, I was just blown away by the graphics. Even after nearly 10 years after the game's release, the graphics still looks as good as it did the day I first loaded it.The game is extremely difficult and I chose to play Jill. You can also play as Chris, but when I think of Resident Evil, I think of Jill as the main person. I think I only beat the game as Chris once after I played Jill. The character you choose is rather important to some degree. For example, Jill has a lock pick as an item while with Chris you have to find spare keys. So it adds a bit more and also the story plays out just slightly different with Jill or Chris. My opinion, Jill is the best story since you get Berry and all. With Chris, the only good thing is that you get to play Rebecca, another member of the team that Jill and Chris are in.The story is simple: you go investigate a crash an earlier team's helicopter who are trying to find out what is causing some bizarre murders in the city of Raccoon City. Everything goes wrong, and now you're stuck in a mansion. At the time I never really thought of it, but now I look at it the game is a big, \"for no reason\" type deal. Like when you go investigate the other team's helicopter crash, it's really for no reason and when you get into the mansion, it appears for no reason you have to solve complex puzzles to find your way out when one would think that naturally you would attempt to find ways out by way of window or a door.The one thing I liked about the game is the fact that there's so many ways to play it. You're in a mansion and there is no set way to complete the game. You can go room to room and find clues and other things that you need to advance. One of the greatest thing is the inventory system. You can investigate clues by rotating them and looking at them. The one great moment was when I picked up a book and after many hours of walking around and looking at the book trying to figure out what it meant, I found that there was a key on the back! What an awesome find and the game really does a great job in making you feel like you earned what ever you got. The game has zombies in it, which is another reason why you must advance the mansion and as the story advances you find out that an evil corporation is behind and even more startling realizations as you advance. The entire game is scary and really draws you into the world of Resident Evil.The game is simply awesome. I never had so many hours of enjoyment from a game than the original RE and I still have the game copy that I play regularly on the Wii. I must have beaten the game for dozens of times. And RE really opened the door for me to being a gamer. After RE very few games actually give me the feeling that RE gave me and it was most certainly a record for the all time greatest game for me.I would highly recommend this game for anyone with access to either a Gamecube or through the backward compatible Wii. It's a must have and definitively a lot of fun and challenging.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0000488VP","description":"If you think it's hard to flag down a cab in a big city, try driving one in Sega's zany straight-from-the-arcade port ofCrazy Taxi. If you're one of the teeming fans who eagerly playedCrazy  Taxiin the arcade at a buck a pop, then this game is a must-buy, if only from a purely economic  standpoint. Even those who don't know the difference betweenCrazy Taxiand the long-running  TV seriesTaxiwill immediately recognize the appeal of this game. In fact, this game is so  impressive and addictive that it should easily convince a whole new wave of buyers to purchase a Sega  Dreamcast.What's so hot aboutCrazy Taxi? For starters, the graphics sport the most impressive re-creation of  a living city ever seen in a video game. The level of detail is astounding and never ceases to surprise the  player as block after unique block speeds by. The city is a distilled version of San Francisco with some  landmarks and neighborhoods left intact. Making it seem all the more real are apparent product placements  of real-world retail locations such as KFC, Tower Records, and Pizza Hut. And just about everything you  see on the screen is interactive: boxes, phone booths, and mailboxes topple when bumped or smashed,  pedestrians leap and tumble out of your path, and the myriad of traffic attempts to avoid your erratic  high-speed antics. While some driving games brag about a lack of boundaries, this one delivers--players  drive on the ocean floor, off the second floor of a parking garage, through parks, and down stairs. A helpful  hovering arrow points drivers in the correct direction, but you can truly drive wherever you want at any  time, making for tons of replay value.While the game is a direct port from the arcade game of the same name, there's plenty more depth in the  home version. In addition to the city that appears in the coin-op version, the Dreamcast version also  includes an entirely new city.Crazy Taxiincludes a trunk-load of mini-games that help to teach  drivers how to perform the special speed boosts and maneuvers in the game.Though this game would be plenty exciting without any sounds at all, it has an adrenaline-pumping  soundtrack supplied by punk crossover bands the Offspring and Bad Religion, as well as some good, if  sometimes monotonous, dialogue between the driver and the passengers.--Jeff YoungPros:Wonderful, realistic graphicsEasy to get into, and full of many long hours of addictive playEven more to offer than the fantastic arcade game upon which this is basedCons:On very few occasions players will encounter some graphic slowdown","reviewerName":"tdl","summary":"Crazy like you've never known it","reviewText":"Crazy Taxi gives you a simple goal: pick up the people, drive them to their destination, and then make money and earn extra time. What isn't included in that description is that the people are often grumpy and fat, and that to get to their destinations in time you'll have to break a few traffic laws. This makes the game an absolute must have. It is very hilarious to hear the customer's insults blare through the speakers, as well as to \"accidently\" drive off a building, into the river, or through the subway while you are supposed to be taking a lady to KFC. Yet, as funny as NOT playing the game right can be, playing it correctly is also very addictive. Trying to keep the time up is a very difficult task, and when it ends you get your rank based on how much money you made. I've only gotten up to rank #27. Seriously, if you don't like Taxi driving madness, there is something wrong with you. I do admit that it can get repetitive, after all it is a direct arcade port, but it is great fun when bored, upset, or when you are just wanting to play Dreamcast.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2013"}

I absolutely love open world games and Rockstar has produced some of the best, most notably the GTA Series. This game is set in the old west and offers some outstanding detail and scenery ....... there are plenty of side quests (like Most Rock Star Games) that you won't ever get bored. There is Night Watch Duty, Hunting activities, and you can even haul in some of the most wanted bad guys !! Some of the other side games are fun like Liars Dice and Black Jack but I didn't care too much for five-finger fillet which can be difficult when the speed picks up. I did manage to get 100% game complettion in the story mode and even leveled all the way up in the multi-player (which is among the best). Some reviewers claim its GTA on horses but I find that to be lacking. This game is a whole different story and it feels &#34;refreshing&#34; as compared to a city lanscape. The story will definitely draw you in and I won't mention any spoilers but John Marston is a bad guy that you will love. After completion of this game I also bought the add-on Undead Nightmare. That involves Zombies and is just as fun but I'll save that for another review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2012"}

There are PLENTY of different galaxies, so don't ever worry about getting bored. There are also the comets and the additional stars and even a few missions where you have to find and rescue your little bro, Luigi. The creativity beats that put into many of the games I've played. A lot of the galaxies have different themes and all of them have different structures. The graphics are also good, you can always see the Thwomps' and Whomps' shadows. The controls are great, and if your having any trouble with those, somebody in the game will help you whether it be a friendly robot that looks familiarly like one made by Pixar or a penguin or a luma or Rosalina or even a bee if you're surrounded by honey.

{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"Z. A. Recht","summary":"Thoroughly deserving; hands-down must have.","reviewText":"Let me say up front that this is, without a doubt, the most cinematic game I've ever played. They weren't lying when they said this game boasted \"credible digital actors.\" You won't find a comparable performance out there anywhere. This game has the best voice-acting and direction of any I've yet seen.If you've seen the previews and some screenshots but still aren't sure what this game will be like, imagine crossing Gears of War with Knights of the Old Republic. Fighting is twitch over-the-shoulder like GoW, but your character's attributes and gear are all menu-based, RPG-style. The items system is highly reminiscient of KOTOR (which is understandable, since Bioware is responsible for both titles).One thing I'll burst right now, too: this game loves to make a large fact of its many choices and routes. This is not entirely an accurate picture they've painted. You'll still go to the same worlds and complete the same missions as everyone else to win--you just might do it in a different order. And you CAN get a few different outcomes, but they're variations on a theme. There are dozens of conversation choices, but they're also an illusion--most conversations all lead to the same point, and your choice of words only occasionally affects your paragon or renegade points. Most unimportant conversations will have the same answer regardless of how you choose to phrase the question.There are a couple of dozen systems you can visit that have no real bearing on the main plot: they're there for fun and exploration. Many of these planets can be surveyed for minerals or items, and some can be landed upon. This results in a cool animation of your rover being dropped from the Normandy onto the planet, and sets you loose in a sandbox to muck about for as long as you wish.There are advantages to exploring. You can find mineral deposits to survey, or you might come across a pirate base or mine. Sometimes you'll find a colony that's been attacked by the Geth, or a rogue VI. Each planet has its own secrets.The rover you explore the planets in is fun, too, and deserves a mention. If you enjoy any kind of off-roading game, you'll like the rover. It's darn near unstoppable and you can have fun sending it flying off of mountainsides or down steep canyon walls. Mastering the jets on it is a whole other adventure.Mission-specific locations result in something more linear, but no less enjoyable. You'll have to fight your way through many facilities and colonies trying to track down Saren, a rogue Spectre who wants to help an ancient race of machines called Reapers attack the galaxy's civilizations. These missions are where you'll have to make those tough decisions the previews alluded to. Sometimes you might have to kill an innocent or two. One other--significant--occasion forces you to choose between two party members. The unlucky one perishes. Boy, if only they'd given me a choice between Yuffie and Aeris.As with many RPG's, there's a romance subplot, but Mass Effect has two firsts: A) an achievement that requires the completion of this subplot and B) let's call it a scene wherein two partymembers get to know one another a lot better. And it's tastefully done, at that.This game also had something that's been missing from a lot of other ones I've played in my lifetime: a satisfying ending. Sure, they left room for Mass Effect 2 in there, but the plot closes up nicely. And there's one heck of a scene you're treated to, also. If you liked that space battle scene at the end of Return of the Jedi, you ain't seen nothin' yet.The graphics are amazing, especially the distance shots. The Presidium looks convincing. Planets' weather systems are great. My favorite was one planet that was passing through the debris trail of a comet, so I was treated to views of a meteor shower as I explored the surface.Shadows get a mention. Mass Effect has the most well-done shadows I've seen yet on a 360 title. They're not only proportionate but they shift based on the light source, and they do it accurately. Haven't found another title yet that's managed to get it right. Really adds to the subconscious sense of realism.One graphics tic: occasionally enemies will fire through hillsides or objects and hit you. This is frustrating when it happens, but it's not all that often.The music fits very well. It reminds me of the tracks that play on Carl Sagan's Cosmos documentary, and are evocative of the future. Quicker-paced action music accentuates combat and there's an inspiring heroic theme that picks up here and there as things happen onscreen.All in all, nearly flawless. Imagine KOTOR, then switch combat to twitch, triple its content, and finally remove a lot of the restrictions on where and when you could travel, and you have Mass Effect. This game is great. It's well worth your money. You'll get lots of playtime out of it, and you'll enjoy every moment.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2008"}

Sadly, it came out in the twilight of the NES (in America at least) and had some interesting... things... Namely the translation was sub par and the color scheme was just crazy bright.  I originally felt it far inferior to Dragon Warrior 3.I played this a few years ago on my DSi XL and dropped it to play a newer game (Advance Wars I think it was) and forgot about it until shuffling through my games last month.  After playing Pokemon Diamond, this is a welcome breath of fresh air!Basically you have a pretty standard Dragon Quest style of interface.  Turn based combat.  Up to 4 characters vs a group of monsters.  Many new creatures make an appearance in this title, actually many new sprites are introduced, some interesting (like the bedbugs) others pretty head scratching (like the wigglys).  You will encounter many familiar faces, including the obnoxious babble, slippery slimes, and others.  I do miss the mad ravens though!Despite being turn based, combat flows nicely.  You can set your party to auto fight, but I rather enjoy having control over everyone.  Owe it to my sadistic, maniacal, world conquering side.  I never really found battles boring or too straightforward.  The nice thing is that these titles all have a little higher difficulty than the Final Fantasy titles.  One enemy's critical hit can make a serious impact on your journeying future.  But overall the game is not cheap, just tough.  Money is harder to come by, so as a result stronger weapons and armor must be earned and money must be spent wisely.Speaking of money and such.  You will spend a fair amount of time grinding.  But since the battles are actually fun, it's not a big trial.  It's much more fun than the super slow and tedious Pokemon style battles (oh no! switch out my Pokemon!  one hit per turn!).  But if you hate grinding, then perhaps this isn't an ideal series to dive into...Music is similar to the original, just updated to a newer, more symphonic style (still midi though - being DS and all).  But the biggest improvements are in the graphics.  The game features a slightly 3-d top down perspective.  In towns and towers the camera can rotate 360 degrees.  Not in dungeons or caves though.  It makes traversing towns easier but still keeps the challenge in dungeon exploring.  Though I would have darkened the top screen in caves.  The top screen basically shows more of the map as it extends above you, so if you are traveling up (north?) then you can see further ahead of you.Another little tip:  you don't get your hand held in this title. Often you will be stuck, scratching your head as to what the next step is.  Granted, if you talk to enough NPCs, then you can figure it out.  Or just check a gamefaq if you're wanting a quick lead.  I only found a few instances where I had to 'figure out' something.  One was when you are the merchant and you have to hatch the guy from prison in chapter 3.  Let's just say, having a chimera wing in current inventory is helpful...There are a few games that make the DS stand out, especially in the RPG category.  This is a remake, true, but it's a remake of a game that was very rare in the states.  Even for those of us who were lucky enough to play it, it has enough of a new look and feel to not think it is a straight remake.  It is superior to the remake of Final Fantasy 3 on the DS in nearly every way.I recommend picking this up, even though the DS is going away and the 3ds is taking over (it's backwards compatible - win for 3ds - not for PS Vita!).  Also, the other Dragon Quest titles on the DS are equally amazing.  For the record, I recommend this first, then get 5, 6, and 9.  I'm holding my breath for a Dragon Quest 1-3 remake (they made it in Japan) and a Dragon Quest 7 re-release.  Fingers crossed!Bottom line:Graphics: A - they push the limits of the DS hardware without dithering or slowdownSound: B - a good remade score, but the original was decent not great, so you're not remaking perfection hereControl: B - you can walk diagonally, which is nice, but when the camera is tilted, things get wonkyStory: B - it's Dragon Quest... bad guy tries to kill all, hero to save world; at least some of the side plots are interestingOverall: A - it's a solid, old school RPG which improves on the original in most areas.  A game any RPG fan should own.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2010"}

Still really good on hours considering it is fairly cheap at this point but not the amount promised. There is one major hitch in the game. Travel is lacking. It takes forever to get from place to place and everywhere you go you get to walk for basically the whole game.

Then comes MGS4, which addressed all of the things that bugged me about the previous Metal Gear games.  The controls in this game are superb.  The game play is so much improved to the point where it's damn near perfect.  Finally, the cut scenes, which Metal Gear is famous for, are done so much better this time around.There are only two games that have come out this year that I feel are worth the full $60 price tag associated with games now.  GTA4, and MGS4.  I honestly have to give the edge to MGS4 as being the better game though.  I think GTA4 felt like a huge graphical and theatrical upgrade to that series, where MGS4 feels like it has the graphical and theatrical upgrade, but then it also moves the bar higher as far as game play, and in pretty significant ways.If you're a fan of this series, there's no doubt that you'll love this game.  If you're not a fan or are new to the series, and are open to a new type of experience, you'll most certainly love this game.

While I greatly enjoyed my time with the game there are a few flaws that kept me from giving this a game a perfect score.  It was hard for me to judge the game.  As a handheld game it is really good, but judging it as a part of the uncharted series it doesn't stand up as well.First of all, this game looks really good.  And I don't just mean it looks good for a handheld game.  This game has moments where you forget that you are playing a handheld game.  It can look that good.  The only thing i didn't like about the visuals was how Drake looked.  I don't know what it was but his face just didn't look right to me.  Everything else looks great though.  The environments are beautiful and the characters are animated very well.  It definitely looks like an uncharted game.The story is the weakest in the series in my opinion.  Other than the relationship between Sully and Drake, I really didn't care about the other characters.  They're just not that interesting.  I just felt that the game focused a little bit too much on the treasure hunting aspect of the story instead of making you care about the characters in the game.  The character interactions that do exist, however, are acted very well by the voice actors.  Especially Drake and Sully.I'll now move on to the gameplay.  This is where most of the flaws come from.  Don't get me wrong, this game in many ways plays exactly like the console uncharted games.  Drake moves just like he does on the console.  He can run, jump, take cover, shoot, etc.  I guess the first thing I noticed that was a little off was the aiming of the weapons.  Aiming is mapped to the second joystick and it can be very imprecise at times and a bit hard to get used to.  For a while I was thinking it was me not really used to the joystick but after playing a demo of unit 13 and being able to precisely aim with ease I realized that it was with the game.  Im not saying that its broken at all.  It just didn't feel as smooth as it should have been to me.Uncharted GA does incorporate touch mechanics into the game to show it off a bit.  Unfortunately, they mostly all just feel like a gimmick and unnecessary.  There are times where the game will prompt you to swipe your finger across the screen in a certain direction to make drake do some sort of action.  These moments aren't very engaging and aren't all that fun.  There are also alternative touch mechanics to some actions in the game but are pretty useless like climbing and jumping.  I usually just used buttons because it was a lot more efficient.  However, I found that using the touch screen to solve puzzles to be a bit more enjoyable than just using button presses.  The touch pad on the back was useful while using the camera or sniper rifle to zoom in or out as well.There are a few minor bugs in the game that I encountered but nothing to detract from my enjoyment of the game.  Just stuff that stood out because the other uncharted games are polished to perfection.I did just kind of focus a lot on the imperfections of the game but I only did so because I mostly judged the game as another entry in the uncharted series.  I still completely recommend this game to uncharted fans.  The complaints I stated never really interrupted my enjoyment of the game.  The game is really fun and is definitely one of the must buy titles for the vita.  Just don't expect too much character development nor any surprises.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2012"}

Not only do you get the game and the expansion, but you get detailed strategy books for both games.The graphics are still pretty solid after all these years and the music and sound affects are awesome (Hey. This is Blizzard. What did I expect?). The story is very intriguing and quite surprising at the end. Very well put together. And each unit for each race is different as are the buildings. With most RTS games, each faction has different units, but they are usually only different in design and name. They do the same thing the other factions units do. But in Starcraft, you really need to know what units do to succeed. For the Zerg, they have Hydralisks that when seperate are pretty weak, but when you group them up and have them attack one target at a time, they are very strong and a group of 10 or 12 can wipe out an army or buildings very quickly. Very unique units and buildings.As with every Blizzard game, the story is excellent with you controlling all 3 races over 30 missions. The eaxpansion pack also lets you play all 3 races over another24 missions for a total of 54 missions! Not too bad for any game and the expansion is clearly one of the best there ever has been. The cutscenes add to the story and a pretty good graphically and great musically. A total joy to play. The only downside to the game is playing against another live person. I played this game against a friend of mine at least 12 times and we had 11 ties and I won once. The crystals and Vespene gas run out before a winner could be decided. Other than that, this is an awesome game, even today and with this package deal this is an excellent buy. Happy gaming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2002"}

Malone","summary":"Test of time: Failed","reviewText":"This is really getting to be absurd. If I could travel back in time a few years and tell myself \"Guess what? In 2011, you finally give in and play the GTA series... and you end up really loving it,\" my younger self would probably laugh and call me a liar. If I then went on to say \"And then in 2012, you love GTA so much that you even play some of the really blatant rip-offs, such as the wannabe urban gangsta thuggery pastiche that is Saints Row,\" my younger self would kick me in the nuts and demand that I take back this outrageously heinous insult.Yet it's true. After falling madly in love with GTA last summer (and replaying GTA IV several times in the ensuing months) suddenly games like Saints Row The Third are no longer so easy to ignore. It looks pretty fun, and I want to try it. However, anybody who knows me knows that I'm usually too anal retentive to play the third game in a series first, without having played the previous two beforehand. Therefore, last week I went ahead and scored myself a copy of the original Saints Row.Perhaps it would have been different if I had played this game in 2006, and also if I had played GTA San Andreas in 2004. Maybe then I would have been able to overlook SR1's cleaner (read: sterile, plastic looking) graphics and whatnot. Playing it five years after the fact, all I see is a shoddy, unpolished, incredibly derivative game. It's as if they hired a 13 year old GTA San Andreas fanboy to design a game and his 8th grade classmates were the development team. It often times literally looks like a beta, awaiting texture map implementation. Cars and NPCs fade in and out of existence right in front of you. The best I can say is that some of the activities were genuinely fun, or at least funny. e.g. Riding shotgun for the suburban soccer-mom drug dealer and listening to her comments. [kills pursing policeman w/ head shot] \"Oh my! Is it really OK to do that? Well, I'm sure he had life insurance.\" [plows over a pedestrian] \"Whoopsie-doodle!\" One of the worst aspects of the game is that in order to play through the \"story\" missions, you are forced to unlock them by earning respect points in the various side mission activities. Towards the end of the game, these have been boiled down to the most boring/least enjoyable. Kinda steps on the fun's toes.In fairness, I'm probably barking up the wrong tree here. I see the GTA fanbase being basically divided into two groups: A) those who generally ignore most of the missions and instead unlock weapons via cheat codes and go around causing random mayhem, and B) those who prefer to methodically progress through the game mission by mission until they finish it. Seems to me Saints Row was designed to appeal to group A, whereas I happen to be a staunch member of group B. I eventually learned that the most efficient way to acquire the best weapons and ammo is to intentionally bait the cops until you have full five star wanted level, and then farm them for their dropped weapons. It's shockingly easy to survive this for an indefinite length of time, and wander over to a \"Forgive & Forget\" booth when you've had enough. In a GTA game, surviving this would generally require cheat codes.EDIT: I completed this game last night and in the end, I must admit I had fun with it and I don't regret buying/playing it. I just bumped my up rating by one star. Minutes later was playing Saints Row 2. After about three hours of it, I can safely say it's basically more of the same, but higher quality. Much more polished, on par with current gen games from its day. I spent approx. 10 minutes in the character creation system's Default Facial Expression menu, just going down the list over and over, laughing so hard I almost peed my pants.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2012"}

All I'm going to write about is the game itself.Anyway, after playing all the way through the game, I have to say that I like it even more than the original. The script is much better, and the music sounds much better on the GBA.One thing that I particularly liked about this game was all of the new unlockables! After beating the game, you unlock a new dungeon to explore, as well as a really cool music player! If you go down to extra and select \"Music Player\" in the main menu, you can listen to all of the tunes and melodies that you heard throughout the game! My personal favorites include, Hey Cid!, Rydia, Theme of love, Chocobo-chocobo, and Dancing Calcobrena.The unlockable dungeon, Lunar ruins, is very cool! To fully unlock every room in the dungeon, you have to beat Zeromus once as each character. After that, you get to do some really cool extra tasks as each character! I wont spoil them for you, but just having them in the game highly increases the overall replay value of this game.Now for the pros & cons of this remake...Pros:It's the same old game that you used to love, but with some cool upgrades and additions to game play.New Quick Save feature allows you to save inside of dugeons and towns.Some of the text from the old game has been fixed so now all of the magic spells aren't abreviated. Example: Meteo has been fixed to read Meteor.Has new unlockable Music Player and side quest dungeon!The music sounds much sharper on the GBA, you can really hear the seperate instruments playing in unison.This version has the old, unedited script, which is far more convincing durring game play.Cons:Unlike Final Fantasy Chronicles, this game does not include Chrono Trigger.They changed the sound effects for some of the moves, and changed the names of some of the moves. For example, Meteor doesnt make that screechy noise anymore, (which I thought sounded cool) and Nuke has been changed to Flare.In battle, there seems to be a lag in reaction time when pressing down the buttons... (You press the button, but it takes a second to register the command.)50/50:None of the graphics have been upgraded, but if you're like me, that doesnt really matter.If you're like me, and have already played Final Fantasy II for the snes or Final Fantasy Chronicles for the PSone, buy this game! It's well worth the price!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2006"}

{"product_name":"B0049DYNNO","description":"","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Mario Mania","reviewText":"This year marks the 25th anniversay since we first played Super Mario Brothers for the original NES. Since then, NIntendo hasn't just changed the way we play video games with great games and games systems like the Wii and Nintendo 64, but has shown over the years that great games honestly can make the most of great systems. Mario has been no acception, with successful games that've really expanded the game horizons like Super Mario Galaxy, and Super Mario 64, gamers have not only found the most ways that we can play great games, but the excitng challenges of our favorite plumber and his friends, in the strongest escapades and adventures to save Peach from the clutches of Bowser and save not just the mushroom kingdon, but galaxies beyond belief. Now, with Mario's 25th anniversary, Nintendo is going for the silver, with so much in store to celbrate everything Mario, and turning back the clock for Wii owners on a new chance on some old friends from the Mushroom Kingdom.Super Mario All-Stars: Limited Edition is a re-release of the classic Super NES compilation from 1993 that simply reminds people of teh simple and fun quests we've loved everything about Mario. The game includes all of the original games, Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Brothers 2, the definitive and game-changing Super Mario Brothers 3, and the original Super Mario Brothers: The Lost Levels (Super Mario 2 overseas.) The gameplay is just as strong today from these classics, as was back in the original NES days. The gameplay is also just as strong too, as you guide Mario and his friends (Princess Toadstool and Toad in Super Mario 2,) through outrageous levels of maddening mayhem, as he tackles classic foes like Bullet Bills, Koopa Troopas, and the stomping goombas. The graphics have been restored nicely, and the control is just as strong as it was before. While the gameplay is strong, I honestly though wish that there could've been more in the game alone, as we could've seen other Mario classics here like Super Mario World, and Super Mario 64 in the game, but Nintendo has chosen to stay true to not just the original Super Mario All-Stars compilation, but the gameplay too. There also is a nice soundtrack as well, which features a collective array of great songs from te Mario games over the past quarter-century. It is great for die hard Mario fans, and those who've never heard those Mario classics over the years.All in all, Super Mario All-Stars: Limited Edition is a nice compilation that still stands the test of time. While you have had the opportunity to download these games individually through the Wii's virtual console (including the Japanese version of Super Mario Brothers: The Lost Levels) it still works as a nice treat and a great buy for die hard Mario fans, and for those who've not played any of these great Mario games over the years. It is a great buy for the Nintendo Wii, that definitely can still fit down that pipe and lead you to the warp zone of fun.Graphics: BSound: BControl: B 1/2+Fun & Enjoyment: B+ for solo & multiplayer gameplayOverall: B 1/2+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2010"}
{"product_name":"B007VFHGZ4","description":"","reviewerName":"Dredded Deuce \"Dredded Panthyr\"","summary":"Relentless!!!","reviewText":"Tomb Raider is back and it is relentless!!I can't remember the last time I actually played a Tomb Raider game.  Actually yes I can. It was Tomb Raider Legends which was pretty good but not great.  Which is sad considering this was one series that has always had the potential to go far because of two things: A female lead which has always set precedence in gaming and a great take on the Indiana Jones adventuring genre.A lot of fans were decidedly mixed when news came about that Square Enix was going to do a reboot of the game series and also present us with more or less an origin game about the events that made Lara Croft from a frightened survivor to a tough as nails no nonsense adventurer.PlotInsofar, it's a great setup with her and fellow archaeologists and adventurers setting out to go to an island in the Dragon's Triangle only to be shipwrecked there by mysterious storms that plague the region.  As the story progresses you get to see firsthand how relentless this game gets as far as the story telling is concerned.  Lara barely gets a moment to rest before being pushed headlong into the next part of her adventure and the game pulls no punches.  There are modern day pirates who have no qualms with hitting and killing anyone in their way and this includes Lara and even the people who are with her seem to have their own agenda and almost every step of the way there is something that makes you shake your head and say, \"Wow, Lara just can't get a break.\"  This game is of course going to draw comparisons to Uncharted which has been the big game of this genre in this console generation but the only limitation was that you needed a PS3 just to enjoy it where Tomb Raider is across all systems giving everyone access.  I think it may be fair to also state that while Nathan Drake has had to put up with some ordeals in his games but so far just within the first 2 hours of TR Lara just may have him beaten!Graphics and AudioI am running this on my PC (6 core AMD chip, 8 gb of memory and a Nvidia 460 GTX card) and it looks astounding on my HDTV. The only thing I haven't been able to do is use the TessFX for the hair.  Once I turn that option on the game comes to a crawl. Other than that, the visuals on PC are astounding.  The draw distance to mountains and other faraway places are credible and even one particular mission where Lara has to climb a tower gave me vertigo. It's well designed and we can see why this game took so long to come out.  The sound is also excellent from the raging storms to voices and natural ambient sounds all around. What's even cool is as Lara explores places, she gives commentary as to what you the player are looking at and what it might be.  In conjunction with the graphics, you have everything this game can immerse you in except the heat and the smell.GameplayThis is where the game really shines because as the game progresses, so does Lara. You get skill points for doing certain things and those points add up to all kinds of upgrades and this is where TR takes its cues from Far Cry 3.  Lara starts off with minimal weapons but by the time she advances the Mountain Village, you can really feel how far she has advanced and it's still very early on in the game. You also get to track down journal entries and treasures scattered on each level and for even more replayability, some levels you will want to revisit as not every place is reachable unless you have some kind of advanced gadget like rope arrows or a pickaxe to scale mountains which gives this game a slight one up on Uncharted. Control-wise, it's an easy setup to figure out and I had no problems with the basic controls.  My only slight complaint is that with the QTEs certain actions may not quite register with a quick push of the button.  Certain things I did required me to mash the button and hold it until it registered which caused me to repeat a few QTEs before I figured out what I needed to do. Another small complaint I have is when using the pickaxe for certain levels and having to use a button to jump between cliff faces and instead of automatically latching on like you can in Uncharted, there is a separate button press.  Small complaint sure and just something new to remember as I play through the game.  Also accessing and using the weapons is pretty standard and easy and I do love using the bow and arrows. Maybe even more than the guns!  Of course there are puzzles galore and also ways (lifted from the Batman arkham games) to get a clue to where you need to be goingIn conclusion, if you have been waiting for a good Tomb raider to come along, you really can't miss with this one.  The past games got more and more about Lara's boobs (ha!) and less about the game.  It's nice to see this reboot ground the game and give players another look about the events that made her what she is.  It just makes one wonder that with this and Uncharted, why hasn't there been a good Indiana Jones game made for this console generation yet?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2013"}

It's pure, blissful fun that hearkens back to the old school games while introducing thoughtful and interesting new elements. (I feel like a Nintendo PR person writing this, but just thinking about this game puts a smile on my face).The game is divided up into worlds, each with a certain number of levels. You pass through a linear overworld and complete each level, earning up to three stars in each world. Completionists can also strive for one other accomplishment - I'll let you figure that one out when you play.It's the little touches that make the game shine. The way you kill Bowser will bring back memories for many gamers (I'll leave it up to you to find out if you don't already know).The 3D effect is well done and often makes for awe-inspiring scenery. When you fly downward or upward (\"out of\" or \"into\" the screen) you'll see why the 3D effect is both useful and entertaining. It can also be used to solve puzzles. While it can be nauseating, it's also a thrill for the times when you do have it on.For those who got started with a 3DS with Pokemon X and Y, this is a great second game.

But it has forged a quirky new identity as a high quality purveyor of ports, emulators, JRPGs, and media. Yes, a large percentage of the Vita's library is on other consoles, but it hardly disqualifies the Vita, since content is content, and, hey, you probably didn't get to play these games before, and it's a cost-effective way to play PSone and PSP titles. Some of the ports are rather excellent remasters, like the system defining Persona 4 Golden. Between that and Persona 3 Portable on PSN, you will hardly put the thing down. What's more, it acts as an effective companion to the PS3 or PS4, not so much in remote play, but in the shared PS Plus benefits, like the Instant Game Collection, and the games that allow cross-buy and cross-save. If you have the recent PS3 version of Minecraft, for example, the incoming Vita version is yours free, and you can move saves between the two.Now, if you want to play Vita games, but don't need a handheld to compete with your phone/3DS, I recommend buying the incoming Playstation TV Bundle for $140, but remember that not all Vita games will be compatible.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2014"}

{"product_name":"B000X25GW2","description":"You are Travis Touchdown, a normal guy (with an otaku geek streak) who wins a Beam Katana through an online auction and uses the weapon to start a new career as a professional killer. One day, an assassin named Helter Skelter appears before Travis and the two face off in a battle. Travis emerges victorious and finds himself in the presence of Silvia Christel, a mysterious French woman who claims to be an agent with the UAA. Silvia gives Travis official rank of 11 in the organization. Now, it's up to you to become #1. No More Heroes takes place in the city of Santa Destroy, and you are free to explore the town to your liking, taking on missions large and small to collect money and purchase new weapons as you work up towards the 10 main killing contracts. Gameplay is all about using your Beam Katana (via Wii remote) to defeat enemies.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Slick and Stylish","reviewText":"Pros:+A tolerable storyline+Fantastic Gameplay+Beautiful Cel-Shaded graphics+Good soundtrack+Good voice oversCons:-Incredibly short game-Side jobs inbetween the main missions aren't exciting-The game is on the easy side-Despite good Cel-shaded Graphics, more detail could've been put into Santa DestroyNo More Heroes is a stylish game.  A game that isn't aimed at the kids by any means but the adult gamer instead.  It manages to do so.  The humor is crude and the game is incredibly violent.  Parents, that's your warning.In No More Heroes you play the role of Travis Touchdown.  As Travis Touchdown you are the newest member of the United Assassins Association.  After the battle with the rank ten assassin, Travis decides that he has to be number one.  Your goal is pretty simple.  Defeat all the assassins and become the number one assassin in Santa Destroy.No More Heroes lives up to its M Rating perfectly well.  Much of the core gameplay is centered around slashing through the levels to the boss at the end.  Your main weapon is a Beam Katana.  Despite how some third party games have faired in the past, No More Heroes makes excellent use of the Wii's controls.  The A button simply swings your Beam Katana while B is used to make kicks.  Whenever you reduce an enemies life gauge down, the game enters deathblow mode.  In Deathblow Mode, an arrow appears on the screen and you must wave the Wii Remote in that direction to execute a killing blow.  Despite which way the arrow points you can really swing the Wii Remote anywhere.  There's more to the motion sensor controls.  You can grab enemies and perform wrestling moves by shaking the Wii Remote and Nunchuck, and you can get into weapon clashes where you must wave the Wii Remote in order to win.  These moments are involving.  The game has a fine balance between the motion sensor controls and the normal everyday gameplay.After your first mission and you're officially admitted into the UAA, you'll have to start paying to partake in the games main missions.  This is where No More Heroes slows down considerably.  The rank missions are expensive.  There are ways to make money around Santa Destroy by doing part time jobs for people, but they're hardly fun.  They're mundane jobs like collecting coconuts or mowing lawns.  You can do assassination jobs for the UAA which will allow you to be involved in more action, but these missions go by quickly.  Finally, there are missions you can go to where the objective is to kill all the bad guys without getting hit once.  These missions, however, are over in a flash.Even worse is exploring Santa Destroy itself.  You can cruise around on your stylish bike but there's really nothing to do in Santa Destroy.  You can go train around or buy some clothes to change into or you can buy parts for your Beam Katana.  Unfortunately, Santa Destroy is a pretty boring place.  You can't interact with the denizens and the city is actually relatively empty.  You can also hang around your apartment and watch videos to learn new wrestling moves or play with your cat and the like.However, when you get to play the main missions, the game is a lot of fun, and the missions are long and satisfying, especially the boss battles at the end.  The bosses are some of the most fun to be had in the game.  They aren't really that hard, however.  In fact, the entire game isn't that hard.  It's also pretty short.  Any devoted gamer should be able to finish the game within a couple of days.In terms of graphics, No More Heroes opts for style over substance.  The cel-shaded graphics look good.  A few nostalgic 8-bit moments come out as well, which is obviously part of the style.  Despite how good the graphics are, much more could've been done with it.  Particularly with the outdoor environments.  At least the game sounds good.  With some catchy tunes and good voice overs.  There are moments when the dialog can be grating but it's tolerable nonetheless.No More Heroes is one of the best titles you can buy on the Wii.  While the moments in between missions are slow, the main game itself is fantastic with some good production values.  A little more could've been done to improve the game overall, but the end result is fantastic.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2008"}

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone. To help you maximize the potential of this setup, two-player online and offline co-op modes ensure that you have options when picking a partner.Steel yourself Against the Harsh Reality of KijujuAn advanced version of Capcom's proprietary MT Framework game engine brings groundbreaking graphics and effects to Kijuju, the highly-developed environment where this game's action takes place. New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"A. Barry \"THE reviewer\"","summary":"A worthy succesor to Resident Evil 4?","reviewText":"I may have played Resident Evil 4 far after its initial release, but even so, it was hard not to notice the overwhelming amount of praise the game was garnering. RE4 set a new standard for the survivor-horror genre and resurrected the Resident Evil franchise. Does RE5 try to be just as ground-breaking as RE4? No, RE5 instead tries to simulate and perfect the RE4 experience by incorporating a number of changes.The biggest change is that this game is on the next generation (or should I say current generation) of consoles. The graphics are some of the best the 360 and PS3 currently have to offer. Of course, the wonderful graphics are almost a given considering a company with high production values such as Capcom developing a game on the next generation consoles. The real changes are the ones made to the gameplay.The first major gameplay change is the co-op focus. Our hero Chris Redfield is paired up with sidekick Sheva at all times in the game. Having another armed person always by your side definitely take away the thrill factor that was present in RE4, but it makes this Resident Evil fun in another sort of way. When playing alone (such as I did) your partner Sheva is controlled by the AI. The AI is hard to describe. Most of the time it operates perfectly. Sheva seemed to have perfect aim with the rifle I gave her and definitely saved me from death more than once. However, there are certain points in the game when the AI poorly handles the situation at hand. Worst of all, these are points were you cannot just take matters into your own hand. Chris and Sheva are sometimes required to split up and if Sheva can't handle her own, there's little you can do to alleviate the problem. Fortunately, this problem only comes into play if you are playing alone. If you plan to play with another person, these situations won't show up.The other game play change is the changes made to the inventory system. Compared to RE4's attache case system, RE5's is both a step forward and a step backward. The good news is that you no longer have to pause the game in the heat of the action to switch weapons or pick up ammo. You can assign your various guns and what have you to the four directions on the d-pad. Rather than pausing and scrolling through the menu to select your gun, just push up on the d-pad and out comes your weapon. There are other slots in your inventory for ammo and curatives that can be chosen by holding triangle (or Y on the 360 I'd assume) This too does not break up the in-game action. The problem with this system is that you only get an un-upgradeable 9 slots of inventory. Sure you had to manage space in RE4's attache case, but at least that system was fair. Here, one item can go in each slot, be it a gun, an herb, or an egg. Yes, an egg takes up just as much space as a gun. It's quite frustrating when your full inventory makes it unable for you to pick up a red herb, because the only destiny a red herb has is to be combined with a green herb, but before you can do that they both have to have their own slot in the inventory. You have to manage Sheva's inventory if you're playing alone, dictating what guns and ammo she'll be getting or not getting. You can request any item she may have for yourself, so the whole item management between the two of you isn't a total conundrum.I can't say for you if the plot is better than that in RE4, but I can say that it is much more related to past Resident Evils than RE4's was. Whether this is a good or bad thing is up to the player.In conclusion, there's no reason somebody who was pleased with RE4 wouldn't be pleased (if not more) by RE5. It has everything that made RE4 great along with new features and that next-gen flair to keep things fresh.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"Matthew Lawson \"sleepyteacher\"","summary":"I like 360 more the PS3. Why have the tides turned?","reviewText":"I bought this console so that I could play exclusive games, namely Dead Rising 3 (the only launch game I was excited about for either systems) and Titan Fall (the game I have been most excited about in the history of EVER). I was a huge fan of the Xbox 360, but I've got to be honest, this system truly disappoints.Hardware: The system itself is bigger than I thought it would be. Maybe even bigger than the 360 was, but don't hold me to that. The guide suggests laying it horizontally, not the biggest fan of that, but as long as it doesn't overheat or red ring on me, I will respect the lady's choice. Also, the power chord still has that cumbersome power box that connects the two chords.Graphics/Gameplay: For my money, graphics and everything look good/comparable to the ps4. I really like that the game I am playing (Dead Rising 3), has a HUGE map and does not require any load time after install. That was a big headache in previous systems. However, reverting to last checkpoint takes more time than I would have anticipated (ditto with starting games). That being said, I've never seen more zombies on a screen in my life, the only noticeable \"next gen\" benefit.Dashboard: The dash looks cluttered, very cluttered, and the idea is that you can \"pin\" the things you like and slap or snap some other things (you think I'm kidding? I'm not, I just don't remember what it's called), but the process for all of this is VERY clunky. I still prefer this dash over the PS4 by quite a bit (makes the PS4 look depressing and simplistic).Controller: The controller is okay. I prefer the 360's or the PS4's. The modifications that they made to this controller are so slight that it's clear they did it simply to prevent Xbox 360 controller reuse, because nothing has changed or improved other than if a zombie attacks me, I have to shake my controller to get it off (like the most basic Wii function). At least the PS4 included a new swipe pad, which I have used playing Killzone and it's pretty handy and could be a feature that games find a lot of use for (it's basically a second D pad).Kinect: The kinect is conspiracy-theory levels aware (recognizes my face), and the camera quality is pretty good. Unfortunately, the xbox encourages you to use it to do commands that buttons also do. Instead of hitting \"B\" I can say, \"Drop Item\". I'm not in the habit of yelling at my TV and I hope I never am. I can understand yelling \"Get over here\" to a Comp Teammate, because that might happen in real life, but I would never say \"Drop Item\" every time I put down a book.Audio Commands: These are very hit and miss for me. They work at times, but when I want them to work, they seldom do (especially on the first attempt) or they get it wrong.Features: Looks like Skype and stuff like that are pretty well integrated. Too bad I have no intentions on upgrading to gold which is required if you want to use any of it. Also, too bad the \"Avatar\" program is not running yet. What? I like cartoon versions of myself. What's wrong with that?Cable: This is definitely the best feature! I can hook my cable box directly into the system (one less universal remote to worry about). Syncing the xbox to turn on and off all of my devices was laborious, but in the end, my system does turn on/off my cable box, TV and receiver when I say, \"Xbox On\". Also, when I watch TV, it is nice being able to say what channel I want to watch. Yes, saying \"Watch Comedy Central\" will take me to Comedy Central. I was hoping that I could do a split screen and watch TV while gaming, but you can only check apps, messages, etc.Penny Pinching: Microsoft seems miserly compared to Sony. Aside from the $100 price difference for the kinect, which I may or may not use, the controller still requires batteries (how very 80s of them) or you can pay to get a chargeable adapter. Just to piss them off, I won't pay and be miserable for the rest of my life. What a kick in the nuts. This was genuinely disappointing. Not nearly as many free games to choose from in the app/game store (only two and one requires a lot of additional purchases to have any fun). My PS4 came with a month of gold and each game comes with 7 days; the xbox came with 14 days and the game I have came with 3. Also, all of the apps like Hulu and Netflix require gold (not so on PS4 or PS3), but this is consistent with the 360.System Preference: Overall, if a game is coming out on both systems and all things are equal, I will buy it on the PS4 over the xbox, sadly. However, the integration with my TV and Cable is a priceless feature that I won't soon want to replace. All I need is for microsoft to stop being stingy with their gold features. And if your new remotes don't add anything to the equation, then let me use my 360 controllers!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00009TW6R","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play. However you choose to hero your way throughHalo: Combat Evolved, the action should break in your new Xbox in explosive style.","reviewerName":"M.

But Halo looked so much like Metroid Prime (which I like and hate because it's a good game, but I don't care much for the first-person shooter change in format) that I decided to give this a try on my PC since I never had time to use the TV for Metroid.What I liked where the graphics, very good, sharp, clean for the time it was made, very smooth playing most of the time. The sound was merely okay, mostly thumping heart-beat noise to try to make us feel we where in a horror film, doesn't work. I wanted a more spatial, 3-D sound, like Metroid.What I didn't like, absolutely hated was the control for the vehicles! The move the mouse to move the vehicle thing sucks, the control was awkward and I just wanted to get past those parts. What really annoyed me is the 6-minute ending where you have to race to the end in a combat vehicle through an obstacle course. It took me six tries, and what a pathetic finale!This game is too short! You don't get to keep anything thing, and when I had the weapons I wanted, the area would end in the next area I'd have default weapons. Either way on and off for three days and the campaign was complete. I don't play online,I wanted more to do. A new, DVD edition with added content and more expansive areas would do this game justice. The save feature is great, because you never get more than a few minutes behind in game play when you die, so all that you have to repeat is a small area, and it's automatic so you don't need to bother about it. I get tired playing games when I reach a tough area and spend twenty minutes and then die, do it again, die, do it again, turn off game! Halo spares you that.Over-all a fun, but limited game with no map, no sub-screen, and all your routes laid out so you never get lost, it's a little too easy even on Heroic setting.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2007"}

Save the Princess \"Peach\" by defeating the evil Bowser, while collecting 70 stars in only 15 levels (all 15 levels are contained in 1 huge castle). It might not be the best Mario game, but it offers a new 3D world and a whole new realism. It also has new features such as an energy feature, where rather than collecting power-ups like the fire flower, you now collect a gold coin and you get a block of energy back! Now Mario has far more of an offense rather than just stomping enemies, he can now throw punches, kicks and slide into enemies, making full use of the 3D plane. The enemies come to life in 3D, such as huge chain chomps, menacing goombas and annoying koopas The graphics could have been better, because they make enemies out of simple colors rather than textures like more recent games have. The music and sound effects are nice, because Mario now has a voice to be heard. There are however only minimal power-ups, such as Mario's Winged hat, which allows him to fly, and Mario's steel cap, making him invincible.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2002"}

Together, these two titles laid the foundation for the series and spawned many hit sequels that have now sold over 42 million units worldwide.","reviewerName":"Jewels \"bookgrrl\"","summary":"Origins, Perhaps Only Good Once","reviewText":"I purchased FF: Origins for Playstation 1 because I have been a big Final Fantasy fan for years.  I thought it would only be right for me to see the origins of this greatly known and loved series.  However, I found myself to be slightly disappointed.  Two games are in the FF: Origins game disk.  They include, Final Fantasy I and Final Fantasy II.Final Fantasy I: Dungeons, random battles, finding items, and running aimlessly in circles trying to find your way around.  That's about all I could say about Final Fantasy I.  At the beginning you get to select a customized list of characters.  You can have any combination you desire.  This is a great feature I enjoyed.  My party included: Warrior, (originally called a Fighter), Black Mage, White Mage, and a Thief.  If I wanted, I could've put a Monk in my party or even a Red Mage.  Also, since you can pick four party members you could have 4 warriors or 2 black mages and 2 white mages...basically any combination you desire.  The graphics from the original Final Fantasy to this Playstation version is quite improved.  It is still in 2D, but the colors, sound, and graphics are much improved.The reason I did not enjoy this game as much was because I was not compelled by any story or innovative battle system.  You learn skills by buying them at a store.  I hated getting lost in dungeons and there wasn't enough places where you could `officially' save your games.  Memo file was introduced to this version of the game, but if I wanted to actually quit and shut off the Playstation, Memo File would be deleted.  It seemed like a tedious game for me, but I wasn't brought up with the old school Final Fantasy, so I'm probably just a little spoiled with innovative battle systems and an in-depth story line.Overall: A pretty short game, (about 30 hours) and a good remake of the roots of Final Fantasy.  This is not my personal favorite by far, but I can't say it sucks.Final Fantasy II: I seemed to like this one better.  There was more of a story line, and this time characters in your party had a story and development.  Skills were learned by not only purchasing them at a store, but then reusing them over and over.  The only way they could level up or be useful in the game is by a repetitive act of use.  This was how the rest of the game was done as well.  To level up your HP, you have to get hit a lot and be in the critical at the end of battle.  To level up your MP, use a lot of magic.  This goes on and on.  That's basically what you spend most of the time doing in the game is reusing skills and attacking your own character to raise your HP.  Still, I liked this one better than the first.For Both Games: As the game progresses there are Bonus Material to look at monster information, pictures, artwork, conceptual art, ect.  There is a great feature that shows the percentage of monster defeated and items aquired.Overall: A good game, but not my favorite of Final Fantasy series.  If you've played the old version, I'd recommend trying out the improved version.  And if you're interested in FF roots, here's the game for you.  But for casual gamers, this may be too much of a bore as the battle system is not innovative.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2004"}

This and Assassin's Creed II are amazing games!  I have very much enjoyed the awesome gameplay and open worldness of these 2 games.  There is so much to explore, especially as more area opens up as you go along...and there is plenty of little side quests and items to find throughout the environment to keep you plenty busy as you play along.  Plus, like II, after you have beaten the story, you can continue to play to try and find everything you missed and play all the side quests you didn't get around to.  I like the addition of recruiting fighters to build them up as assassins to join the guild.  There is an even greater variety of weapons you can use throughout this game, and a new assortment of fun little gadgets and other stuff to make hunting enemies and exploring more enjoyable.  There are so many great weapons to chose from for melee fighting, but I think my favorite was this one particular mace that you can by later on...I call it Ezio's bashing stick.  There was some pretty brutal counter kills that could be done with that weapon...loved it!  Haha!  I enjoyed the storyline...continuing on with the story of Ezio, and at times I was very immersed in it.  Just ask my wife, haha.My only little gripe about this game was that, like II, it had a tendancy to glitch out just a little bit every now & then.  As an example, sometimes when I would be running along a rooftop chasing someone and trying to catch them, Ezio would occasionally jump a completely different way than I was running or he would not grab ahold of a ledge when prompted.  There are other examples of this, but that is just an example.  However, these little glitches weren't consistent, and I could in no way bring myself to mark this game down any for that because overall it's just simply an amazing game!  I highly recommend this series to any gamer out there who loves a good open world action adventure game like I do...it's simply awesome.  I look forward to getting into Revelations, which is one of the next games in my collection that I have to play!  So awesome!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2012"}

Without a doubt, this is the best game in the series to date and a must own title for any person who enjoys fun video games.As for the game itself, Dead Rising 3 offers a large city to explore with a lot of things to collect, zombies to kill, weapons to destroy, vehicles to drive, etc. It's all done in a seamless fashion with no loading even when going into interior environments. The gameplay feels similar but everything's been improved and feels better than ever. It doesn't constrain you in ways that previous games did, allowing you to play the way you want to play. While it's still challenging in places, Dead Rising 3's controls never frustrate like they could in previous games.Onto the graphics, I feel that Dead Rising is pretty pleasing to the eyes. While it's not the most realistic looking game, it's improvements are numerous. This is the best looking game in the franchise, but it's all the more impressive since it's much larger than the previous games. It includes better texture detail, some very nice lighting, expressive facial animations, etc. It's definitely a nice looking sandbox launch game.As for the story, it's standard zombie stuff, however some of the characters are really interesting and the voice acting is generally superb.If you're looking for a next (now current) gen exclusive with lots of playability, look no further than Dead Rising 3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2013"}

I switched to Sony for one reason, and one reason only.  Vice City.  After playing it at a friend's house, I had to get it.  I couldn't get enough of insane bike stunts and spectacular car crashes with 80's music playing in the background.  After a long-standing combination of determined effort and shameless cheating, I completed 100% of the game.So there was no more need for the Playstation 2 now that Vice City was over and done with, right?  You'd think that, but sure enough, I found another game I had to get, even while restricting myself to a somewhat miserly budget.  Dance Dance Revolution Max this time.  I never imagined a video game could be used for ANY form of exercise until this game showed me better.  Some of those goofy little arrows move pretty darn frustratingly fast.I never quite mastered DDR Max, and to be honest, I haven't even come close.  But I found a new game to play in the meantime - Smackdown: Here Comes The Pain - a rare Brock Lesnar wrestling video game.

Titanfall makes you feel important.  Titanfall is designed and balanced with precision and expertise.  But most of all Titanfall is fun.  Way too much fun.Developed by Respawn Entertainment (former developers of CoD 4: Modern Warfare) comes Titanfall, a futuristic fast-paced rock-em sock-em robot parkour simulator.  It's easy to recommend this game, especially to anyone who loves multiplayer games.  But for me, I couldn't be more satisfied with the purchase.  I plugged in hundreds of hours into Halo 3 and CoD MW 2.  I remember late nights, chilling in the forge with my buddies and early mornings getting an attack helicopter after countless rounds.  Since then, I've had no interest in multiplayer.  Sure, the past Halo games had great multiplayer but nothing to encourage those same hundreds of hours I've clocked before.  Battlefield 4 was a bust due to its extended online connectivity issues.  For me, multiplayer love was all riding on this game being great right out of the gate.  If the guys that changed the face of multiplayer once, they could do it again.And indeed they have.Story and Presentation - 7/7 = 7I'll get this right of my chest: Titanfall 2 needs to have some sort of exploration of its fiction in the sequel.  The fiction of Titanfall is rich with diverse ideas, awesome sci-fi creations and creatures coupled with awesome designs for nearly everything.  Titanfall's single player component comes in the form of a multiplayer campaign, which works in certain ways (introducing you to specific characters, giving fictitious backdrops to the maps) but not in other ways (exploring the incredible world, feeling important, or diving deep into the characters).  The menus are fairly bare-bones as well.  Featuring static images for all characters, titans, and backgrounds, it would've been great to see 3D models or epic backgrounds at least.  This is where Titanfall stumbles the most.Graphics and Art Direction - 10/10 = 10Titanfall looks gorgeous, and that's a fact.  Running at a (most of the time) blistering 60 frames per second, Titanfall looks and feels great.  Lighting effects are sharp and crisp, explosions look devastating, and the game is incredibly well animated.  Titans feel lumbering yet agile, while pilots respond with great animations when wall running, jumping, shooting among other things.  Textures also look sharp and clear, with not a muddy one in site.  Of course, there are some anti-aliasing issues and screen tearing issues at launch, but those can be easily patched post-launch.  The art direction for Titanfall is the best I have ever seen for a multiplayer-only game.  Stunning backdrops of epic dog fights in space, huge futuristic ship yards, and space dragons swirling in the sky are amongst the few awesome and breathtaking scenes you'll witness while you're kicking dudes in the face.  The design for each class of titan looks inspired and fresh, while the pilots all have different looks depending on class chosen.  The art direction team at Respawn has some massive chops; Titanfall is simply a stunning game to look at.Sound = 10Turn up the bass and let this game melt your face off.  Titanfall sounds absolutely fantastic.  From the steely crunch of Titan on Titan fisticuffs, to the light pattering of pilots as they wall run across a gap to the exciting chatter of bots (that actually correspond with the action going on around them) Titanfall's sound design is absolute perfection.  It's big, it's loud, and it'll blow you away.  The voice work and chatter of you friendly compatriots throughout battle is both fairly well written and delivered well.  The balance between important dialogue and intense gameplay never seems to lean one way or the other too heavily, creating a nice balanced effect every match.  Surprisingly, the soundtrack here really stuck out to me.  Composed by Stephen Barton (MGS 3), the soundtrack accentuates on the drama each match.  Jump into your titan and the music will blare deep a chorus of trumpets and dark brass.  Depending on your side, the music is also different and changes according to the position your team has in the match.  Most will not even notice it, which is the sign of a great soundtrack.  But for me, soundtracks can really accentuate dramatic moments of a game or movie, and the composer and mixing team at Respawn has done a great job at doing so.Gameplay = 10At the end of the day, Titanfall will boil down to it's gameplay.  Is it fun?  You bet your sweet cheeks.  Is it easy for non-shooter veterans to get into?  Depending if you can easily abandon and learn a whole new set of tactics and combine them with the incredible mobility of the pilot and the intense Titan combat, that's up to you.  For me, getting this game in my hands and playing a few hours solidified how good this game feels.  Simply put, everything works in tandem like it should.  Wallrunning feels smooth, gunplay is tight, titans control as they should, melees aren't magnetic, and killing another player/grunt features a satisfying ripping noise.  Everything here is top notch, impressively well balanced, and fun as all get-out.  One of the biggest complaints is that the bots aren't smart or lethal.  On the contrary, I feel they've been amped a little bit since the beta.  But these little guys are simply there to keep the match going forward, and it makes every match feel much more exciting and kinetic.  The various game modes (while low on the count - 5 available at launch) they all have the quirks and tricks, making each mode entertaining.  (Respawn claims additional modes will be available post launch for free).  Titanfall also features 15 (15!!!) maps right out of the gate.  All are unique, balanced in their own ways, and top notch in terms of design.  Each map can be played with all game types, and feature all sorts of hidden passages and unique mobility opportunities.  I'll leave the experiences of playing titanfall to you, but there will be many an epic moment while playing Titanfall.  Burn Cards are temporary stat boosts and weapon enhancements that you earn through various challenges each match, and there are no micro transactions to get these.  That \"one more round\" mentality is gonna come creeping back.Lasting Appeal = 9Titanfall features a hefty amount of content right out of the gate.  A fun, if frivolous, multiplayer campaign.  15 maps, 5 game modes and a whole lot of challenges.  10 prestige generations to work through, and a great and balanced arsenal just waiting to be unlocked.  Titanfall has a metric crap-ton of things to see and do, but it plays it safe and doesn't stray too far from the pack.  It would've been fantastic to see unlockable art, story clips, fiction exploration journals...something to enhance and expand upon the fiction of this incredible game.  If you're all about unlocks, gun enhancements and fun new toys for your titan, then Titanfall will please those endorphins in your brain.The Verdict: 9.2 (an average) rounds to 9.0Titanfall is fun, frenetic and polished like no other shooter of this caliber has been for years.  This game is a joy to play, even when you're having a bad round.  Titanfall makes you feel important every match, with exciting moments and explosive battles at every turn.  Titanfall feels like the first fresh step forward for shooters in quite sometime.  Respawn has taken the baggage of multiplayer shooters and given it a facelift, and it's name is Titanfall.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2014"}

This start really set the tone for the rest of the game for me. This game does reminds me of COD in various parts, but stands tall on its own. The campaign is indeed relatively short (say 8 hours) but there is no filler whatsoever, and the action is very entertaining.

You play from a new perspective, that of a Big Daddy, which offers a lot of fresh gameplay mechanics and storyline elements.The shooting play is, I believe, improved over the first Bioshock. Although Bioshock's shooting play was great, Bioshock 2 gives you the Big Daddy drill and rivet gun, among other new toys, which add a fresh twist and a welcome departure from the traditional blunt weapon, pistol, etc. that are common in all shooters.The story is great, too. It is very emotional, and really focuses on the Litter Sisters, providing a lot of interesting insights into the history of the Little Sisters and the ways in which they perceive their world. It also explores a powerful relationship between your character and a particular...sister.Bioshock 2 is an outstanding game, but it doesn't quite stand on its own without the original Bioshock experience backing it up. I believe it is absolutely essential to play the original first. Bioshock 2 can never match that first breathtaking view of Rapture, or that marvelous, stunning plot.

Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Excellent","reviewText":"I have very high praise for this game. \"Heavy Rain\" totally drew me in, the level of realism was so great that I really cared what happened to the people I was watching on screen in a way that quite surprised me.I can't say much about the plot other than the obvious (4 people become embroiled in the search for a serial killer), because everyone who plans to play this needs to know as little as possible about the plot to get the most out of it. You need to know about the style of play though. Apart from making the character move about, which is done with the directional stick, every other action on the screen is co-ordinated by following on-screen button prompts. Some of this simple, for example, if you stand facing a cupboard, you might see an arrow pointing to the left flash up - and pushing the analogue stick to the left makes the character open the cupboard and see what's inside. And some of the action is more complex. Anything like fighting, escaping or carrying out difficult tasks means that you have to watch the screen closely and press the right button quickly as it appears, or hold three down at once, or mash one as fast as you can...get the idea? Sounds like it would get boring fast but I have to say it didn't - although I got sore hands after a few of the very diffcult combinations when I ran out of fingers!The success story of \"Heavy Rain\" though, is the sense of real drama. The story and the characters are fantastic. All four leads are amazingly lifelike, and they speak, move and emote with real depth, and this makes you become hugely involved with the plot...well, I certainly was, When my characters encountered hurdles or were subject to attack, I was with them all the way. Sometimes I even surprised myself by shouting at the screen when I was able to dish out much needed retribution to some of the very unsavoury characters who were after me. And unsavoury is putting it mildly. I agree with some of the other reveiwers about the classification of this game. I think an 18 certificate would have been easily justified. I knew the game was about a serial killer but I didn't expect things to be quite so violent. The killer taunts one character by forcing him to undertake sadistic \"trials\", and a couple of these made me flinch with genuine revulsion as I did them. This is undoubtedly due to the hyper realism of the game - you really feel like you are totally immersed in the action, and that these could be real people. And nobody has a nice time in this story: \"Heavy Rain\" is one very dark game.I only have a few niggles - some events in the game are massive red herrings that are never explained. The plot is very clever (it has to work from four different perspectives), but some of the finer points passed me by and at times I got lost. The overall weakest part of the game is character movement - the swivel-and-walk-in-different-directions control scheme is hellish...sometimes I was twirling my character all over the place before getting them aligned correctly to open a door or press a switch.The flow of the game is great though, the saving is spot on - theres no easy way to backtrack if you think you've made a bad choice - unless you reboot in the middle of the action before the autosave kicks in - although I later found out you can choose a chapter and replay and save it, but I couldn't tell if this meant playing forward again from that point or simply saving that standalone chapter with a different set of actions in it (?)In general, this game is a class production all the way, high quality and mature in all respects. The \"quick-press\" way of controlling the action will not be to everyone's taste - especially if you know exactly what you want to do but the button combinations are too difficult or too quick to press correctly. I think everyone should play this game, but again, be warned that it can be quite hard hitting due to the impact of some very realistic scenes of violence.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2010"}

{"product_name":"B001TD6SK8","reviewerName":"Matthew Erwin","summary":"Good but not great","reviewText":"Here is a game that could have been so much better than it is.  Even so, it makes an entertaining, if lesser chapter into the Kingdom Hearts Series.First the good.  The game controls great.  Clever use of shortcuts makes magic casting a breeze and the action for better or worse in primarily controlled by mashing on the A button, occasionally using B and Y to jump and block/roll respectively.  The fighting is good for what it is, but mostly it is a bit simplistic.Sadly the whole game is a bit simplistic.  It is clear the developers wanted to focus on graphics and story.  What they wound up with is a game that looks almost as good as its PS2 counterparts.  The story on the other hand is a bit muddled and what starts out as a cute bromance turns into a constant irritation.  My god, I don't care about them eating icecream for the 85th day in a row.Also missing from the game is any bit of exploration.  The worlds are depressingly simple and small, generally consisting of a few large rooms or spaces with few more caves/rooms opening up later in your missions.  That brings me to the other big problem with the game which is the mission structure.  Simply put, it is not nearly as fun as just a regular Kingdom Hearts game.  85% of the missions boil down to either kill a bunch of Heartless or kill one specific Heartless.  It begins to drag with a flustering amount of sameness.  Every once in a while you will come across an exploration mission which generally involves running around until a question mark pops up over Roxas's hear and you press A.  There are also a few missions that you have to follow a character, which are about as dumb as they sound.The characters from Disney and other Square series are pushed to the backburner here as well, it is mostly about Organization XIII and run parallel to the events of Chain of Memories.The final problem with the game, as alluded to by other reviewers is the panel system, which seems to be an odd combination of a card game, the materia system from Final Fantasy VII and Diablo's loot system.  You can place different panels into your inventory to do basically anything including learn moves and magic.  The most irritating panel could be the level up panel.  This is certainly the first game where you have to equip a level up.  You get to make irritating decisions such as \"Do I level up or take 'cure' into the battle\"  Do I want more casts of fire or to have the ability to block.  It seems some things, such as new tactics and level ups should be automatic.  I guess it adds in a new strategy to the game, but mostly I find it irritating.That all being said, if you can look past the irritants, there is a lot of fun to be had here, especially for those who are already fans (for those that haven't played KH before, good luck following the story).  This one is for the fans only.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2009"}

They should have come up with something better than the normal 'shoot the boss a billion times while running around' gameplay.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2014"}
{"product_name":"B002I0JAJ2","description":"","reviewerName":"Chef Sean","summary":"Ode to a Sad Old Man","reviewText":"Ah Duke, how far have you fallen! The former king has been relegated to a ghost of his former glory in this mediocre shooter. Sure, his macho one-liners are still here, so is his misogynistic attitude but the whole thing comes off a little flat. Duke seems like some sad guy who peaked in high school and is now pushing 40 and is completely oblivious to how uncool he is. I don't offend easily, I'm far from squeamish when it comes to bawdy language and lo-brow humor but most of the time I spent playing this game consisted of me rolling my eyes at how sad and stupid it all was. The long development didn't do it any favors either. All the outdated cultural references just add to the feeling that Duke is a sad old relic from a bygone era. There's something about Halo jokes that just don't do it for me anymore.The game itself is OK I guess. The shooter aspects are competent at least, there's a fair amount of weapons, plentiful ammo and the mechanics tend to work. It relies on some outdated conventions though. You know, come to a dead end and notice a turret, man the turret, kill a gigantic horde of enemies that swarm straight at you, after the bloodbath the way through magically becomes available, etc. etc. Nothing new here. There's also some strange lulls in the action. Often I'd find myself standing around wondering what I'm supposed to do next and the game does nothing to tell you.The shooter parts are broken up by silly platforming and puzzle solving sections that tend to annoy. I've always thought that first person platforming isn't a very good idea and this game has done nothing to change my mind. Punctuating that is the fact that when Duke jumps he lets out a grunt, and they only recorded one grunt! You get to hear it over and over and over and over again while trying to figure out how to climb up a statue or something. More often than not, after hearing Duke's singular grunt about 30 times in a row I'd have to shut the game down and take a break from it.The graphics (like the level design, play style, jokes and OVERALL CONCEPT) are outdated. They're not bad, I wouldn't call the game ugly, just old. Kind of Doom 3/Quake IV style, certainly not what we've come to expect from a shooter released in 2011.The game comes with mandatory Steam activation, that's an automatic -1 star for me.Fans of old Duke might get some nostalgia from this but if you're looking for a fun, new modern shooter, this ain't it. It's not terrible but it's not great either.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. Get ready to jump out of your couch cushions!--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessGreat cooperative modePlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multi-player options","reviewerName":"R. Wiedlin","summary":"A disappointment...","reviewText":"I'm a long time doom fan, and this revival of the series was a real disappointment. The graphics are stunning, the guns are sweet, and the monsters are horrifying, but it all lost the unique \"doom\" feel.The designers changed the gameplay type from gung-ho marine wiping demon scum from the world to \"please dont hurt me\" try to survive. This game focuses too much on the fear element that loses the novelty of a Doom game. It's set up so that theres less dodging and skill involved in playing the game, and more emphasis on knowing whats around the corner.Don't get me wrong, there are things about this game I do like. I like the graphics, I like the storyline, but I feel that they should have tried to stick to their roots more. I'd have appreciated it a lot more if they returned some of the original monsters, or made an option to unlock original Doom 1 levels.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"Baseball \"Johnny\"","summary":"Super Smash Bros.

{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","summary":"Not just the best looking game of this generation of consoles, but one of the best PS3 has to offer","reviewText":"The Good: Fantastic visuals, gripping story, Joel and Ellie are memorable characters, lots of fun guns to use, crafting on the fly, Clickers are down right scaryThe Bad: Poor sense of direction, combat is down right hard at times, combat sequences are all the same, feels repetitive towards the end, some glitches and AI issuesPost-apocalyptic games always try to focus on a mass group of people or the devastation itself. The Last of Us focuses on two people, Joel and Ellie as they travel across the US to find a cure for the biological outbreak that&#8217;s destroyed the planet. The journey is a decent length and you really get to love Joel and Ellie and they become amazing characters that you don&#8217;t want to separate from.The Last of Us is full of emotion and amazing production values. It&#8217;s the best looking game to grace the PS3 and is a great entry for the final lap of the console&#8217;s life cycle. The combat is a mix of action and stealth. You can sneak around enemies and grab them from behind and either shiv them or strangle them. Shivs aren&#8217;t easy to come by, you must craft them and they can break. Strangling takes about 10 seconds to do and is a slow way to kill someone, make sure no one else is around or you will spotted. You don&#8217;t just fight humans in this game, Clickers are some of the scariest monsters since Dead Space&#8217;s Necromorphs. The sounds that were used are incredibly scary and original. These creepy creatures can hear you even if you crouch. You must slowly crouch around them and you can only kill them with shivs. Hunters and Runners are also hard to fight but Runners can&#8217;t be snuck up on, you must fight them. Bloaters are like Tanks from Left 4 Dead; huge enemies that are hard to take down. These enemies are interesting to fight, but they are the only ones in the game so it can get repetitive after a while.Repetition sets in in other things like each encounter feeling the exact same way. It&#8217;s just room after room of zombies or humans to fight. I wanted more cinematic events which were kind of sparse. Crafting and collecting parts helps make the game a bit more interesting. You can craft melee weapons, molotovs, shivs, medkits, and smoke bombs. You can craft in the middle of combat which is nice, but weapon upgrade stations are rare. There are only about a dozen in the whole game and you need to save up a lot of your parts to upgrade weapons. You can add gun slots and even increase clip capacity on one shot weapons which is nice. There&#8217;s actually a good variety of weapons and they all feel useful in different situations. I found myself using all of them one way or another often.The game is very linear but feels like an adventure. You go through various areas in the US from Boston to Utah and the game just oozes stylized atmosphere. You really feel like you&#8217;re being pulled into this destroyed world and it just feels so compelling. Despite combat though there isn&#8217;t much to the game, there&#8217;s no puzzles or anything else that&#8217;s very challenging. Just pushing Ellie across pallets in water, moving ladders etc. The combat is down right frustrating since Clickers can kill you in one hit and the stealth is a bit iffy. Some times it felt the AI was flawed and got me killed. I also ran into a few glitches.The story itself is the best part about the game. Bringing Ellie across the country and the hardships these two go through is just something else. I don&#8217;t want to spoil anything, but you get to play as both characters and Ellie is just a strong character. A little girl who curses, kills people, and wipes out an entire gang on her own? It&#8217;s nothing like I have ever seen and shows Naughty Dog has guts to do this.The game itself looks amazing. The textures are at such a high-resolution, the animations and models look great, and the lighting is fantastic. It really shows just how much more powerful the PS3 is over the Xbox 360. 360 exclusives like Gears of War 3 and Halo 4 have some pretty ugly textures and the lighting doesn&#8217;t look too hot. The Last of Us looks like a PC game and is blew my mind which is rare for current generation consoles these days. There are a few eyes sores but you really have to hunt for them, if only every developer put this much effort into their games.Overall, The Last of Us is one of the best games of this generation and the best PS3 game this year. Joel and Ellie are highly memorable characters and their journey is frightening and enlightening. The combat can feel repetitive towards the end and can be down right difficult and frustrating, not to mention constantly being lost due to a lack of direction. Despite these flaws this is one fantastic journey that every PS3 gamer should endure.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2014"}

I also have dedicated blu-ray players, and they never update firmware... and netapps on the blu-ray players? forget them!2. Games are are graphically superior because of faster rendering engine, and blu-ray allow storage of a lot more data.3. Net apps - Netflix can be constantly updated. I have HDTVs with net apps like Netflix from 2 years ago, and the Netflix and other apps will always remain ancient because they will never get updated.4. 3D - simple OS upgrade to enable 3D. Great return on investment. This is a testament to PS3 being future proof.  When it was first released (2006?), 3D didn't come out yet. But in 2009, a simple system update enabled 3D!

{"product_name":"B002GPPPS4","description":"","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"Not your old school Castlevania","reviewText":"As an old-school gamer who grew up playing the Castlevania games on the NES and SNES, I have had a love-hate relationship with the games released after the 16-bit era. For every masterpiece like Symphony of the Night, there is a turkey like Castlevania 64. The games have not transitioned well into the 3D realm, so I met the release of Lords of Shadow with some indifference. That is until I saw some gameplay footage and read some reviews, all of which convinced me to give the series another chance. So far, I have not been disappointed.To appreciate this game, it's best not to think of it as a Castlevania title. Outside of the character being named Belmont, there is little here that references the glory days of the series or resembles any of the earlier games. Many consider this a weakness, and to be honest, I would have love a classic Castlevania experience. But taken on it's own merits, this is a fantastic game that provides a mix of exciting gameplay and challenging puzzles and boss battles. Some of the negative reviews have point out that this game is derivative of better games, such as God of War and Shadow of the Colossus. This is definitely true, but you might as well copy the best and this game does it to great effect. The combat is tight, the puzzles are challenging, and the boss battles will definitely make you break sweat. Gameplay is a mix of platforming, hack n' slash combat and puzzle-solving. It would be easy to dismiss this as a button-masher, but you'll find yourself dying a lot if you don't employ some ducking and dodging strategy, especially duting the boss fights. Outside of your cross, which doubles as a whip when platforming, you have weapons and combos that you can upgrade that will aid you throughout the game. And this is a long game, with several levels consisting of several stages each, you can easily put in 20 hours and still have plenty to do.In the audio/visual department, this game is simply fantastic. The environments are lush and detailed, the animation is fantastic and it all runs smoothly and lag-free. Some have claimed that there is slowdown and screen tearing during the more frantic battles, but I have yet to see this. The music is the usual mix of gothic and orchestral, which suits the mood of the game beautifully. None of the music stands out as memorable, but it works well to set the mood of the each level. The voice acting is also top notch, including the work of Robert Carlyle (Begbie from Trainspotting as a Belmont?) and Patrick Stewart acting as the narrator.The game does have a few drawbacks that might turn some off, but this totally depends on what you are looking for in the game. For starters, the stages are totally linear and they offer little to no option to explore. This is a downside for people who enjoyed the backtracking and exploration of the 2D games on the DS. The camera is also fixed, as it was in Dante's Inferno, and this brings about a few problems when fighting in tights areas. But it's not as big a problem here as it is in other games, so it's tolerable. The biggest weakness for me are some of the puzzles, which border on frustrating. I love a challenge, but I don't want to spend an hour struggling with one puzzle.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with Castleva: Lords of Shadow and I think that people can enjoy it if they put aside their expectations for a \"return to form\" for the series. In truth, this is an entirely new game that provides plenty of great gameplay moments to justify the purchase. With a 20 hour story mode and plenty of challenging battles and puzzles, this game will keep you busy for a while.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2010"}

More realistic than GTA or Saints Row 3. I played the demo over and over again, then I decided to buy it because it is very cheap. I bought this game for two reasons after playing the demo: The storyline which is protecting your \" Family \" and the realistic things that happen around the world. Let me give you some examples of realistic \" things \":-  There is a speed limit, which means if you drive too fast, cops can pull you over and give you a ticket. You can always bribe them or run.-  If you have a weapon in your hands, they can arrest you.- Others can get arrested and they may try to run or just go with the flow.- Key to stealth is everything, if your wanted from stealing in a store, you can try to hide. If the cops don't see you, your wanted level goes down.- Killing everyone in a store then leaving. Come back and you will see that the store has cops around it investigating like real detectives. And Much more realistic things.This game is worth gettin for less than 20 dollars. I sold mine because I needed the money and I regret doing so. I probably will go buy it again and if there's a third to the sequel, I\"ll be first in line!Pros:- Campaign ( Drama, action, and love)- Characters- Variety of weapons- Loads of realistic activity happening- Realistic action from yourself-  Combat and gun handling makes you feel epic- High Replay Value- Amazing Graphics ( Trust Me )- Loads of Nudity ( Boobies and more ) Not too much of a good thing.Cons:- A few hard missions- No Multiplayer ( Wouls of Been Amazing)- The ending of the storyline ( No Spoilers )So yeah, this game really deserves to be played over again! Man, do I love the combats and driving in this game.  Thank You for reading and Enjoy this game !!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2012"}

Posey","summary":"When story is greater than gameplay","reviewText":"Story has often been a minor addition to video games.  Recently it has been coming into it's own with some previous and next gen games really pushing the limits of digital storytelling.  When you play Mafia 2, you'll realize you have have one example of excellent story telling in a game to tell your friends about.The game begins with an introduction of the character you will be controlling, Vito.  Vito's story begins in Italy as he is part of the US Army forces tasked with invading Sicily.  In this level you will get a feel for the gameplay and be introduced to the extremely intricate character that is Vito.  Over the next 10-15 hours, you will take part in a story that rivals some of the best mob movies ever made.  Vito's story is so compelling that you will find yourself looking forward to the next cutscene.  Your friends in the game will really tear at your heartstrings at different moments and you will really feel for the characters.So, the story is fantastic and hits a homerun, but for most, this isn't enough.  Luckily, the gameplay isn't too bad.  Shooting is and movement in the game is basically what you would find in any other game out there.  If you have played other third person shooters then you will feel right at home with Mafia 2.The sound is a homerun as well.  The sound of the city and characters is extremely well done.  Along with the sound, the graphics are top notch in some places.  Occasionally you won't be wowed by the graphics but then you will see the city skyline and your jaw will drop.  It's a mixed bag but one that is perfectly capable in a game of it's caliber.The only drawback to the game is the open world.  The open world is great, it just feels empty.  There's nothing to do but go in some random shops and drive around.  You will spend your time in between missions driving to the next story mission and nothing much else.All in all, Mafia 2 is a great game you should check out if you like a great story in your video games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00BGHUS58","description":"","reviewerName":"TRFB","summary":"Techno-Vigilante","reviewText":"I had high hopes for this game.  The start of this game is really attention grabbing.  The intro is so nicely put together, just like a movie.  There are a lot of fine points:GRAPHICS - Incredible.  The environment, the AI (Artificial Intelligence) makes the game feel real.  Like you are in a real environment.  People walking, doing their own thing.  Amazing.SOUND - Sounds around you just seem to flow on their own.  And through surround sound speakers you really feel immersed in the world.GAMEPLAY - Controls are pretty straight forward.  Intuitive, at least for me.  You have a mode where you can slow down time as you shoot so that you can accurately target your intended victim.UPGRADES - There are so many upgrades to your device that you can use to hack into the environments.  You have a PDA that allows you to hack into cameras, servers, other people's bank accounts.  When you break into parked cars, you start out by smashing the window and stealing it.  Alerting people and they end up calling the police.  But, with an upgrade hack, you disable the alarm and unlock the doors.  Sweet.  No one would know.SPECIAL GAMES - You have an option to play these \"Day trips\" which are like cyber drugs that put you in an induced state and you play these little side missions.  So, they are essentially games within a game.  I like them.  In fact, I spend a lot of time in those environments trying to upgrade my skills to better increase my abilities.It's a cool game in terms of the story, the game play and everything.  But there is a really dark side to this game.  And I must warn parents to pay attention to the \"M\" Rating!!!It's filled with a lot of filthy language and sexual conversation.  It made me uncomfortable.  I hacked into a random person's phone and their text message conversation came up.  And it was really sexually explicit.  I had to exit out of that text conversation.  Throughout the game, people use foul language.  The usual \"F\" word is heard.  Especially by the law enforcement.  But, then there is a level where there is explicit nudity.  A friend of mine made the comment that he wish there was a way to skip that scene but it is integrated in the level cut scene.I would've given it a higher rating if the designers wouldn't put this level of sexually explicit content and make it an integral part of the game experience.  I know, that the \"M\" rating is supposed to deter younger kids from playing it and parents from buying it for their kids, but, even for adults that enjoy gaming, it was unnecessary and doesn't add anything to the story.NOTE:  I'm giving this an \"Okay\" rating ONLY because the graphics, sound, gameplay are incredible.  But, I don't recommend this game if you are uncomfortable with the level of sexually explicit material and foul language found in today's video games and movies.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2014"}

The Stadiums and City skylines look photo realistic at a distance. The crowds look very good and the ballpark sounds great. The commentary is mostly unchanged, if not even slightly scaled back.I never really thought it was all that bad but most will not like it if they didn't like previous years. All of the modes you are used to from previous titles have returned. As far as the actual core gameplay goes it just seems to be missing the fluidity that MLB13 had. The ball physics are improved but I feel as though the fielders move really jerky and just do not seem like they are always aware of the situation. I also do no like the new heads up display for popups the icon moves in a weird mannor and it is just weird tracking the ball which will lead to frustration in the field. Baserunning has always been iffy on the show and I feel this game has the worse I can remember. The response is slow and sometimes glitchy I have had players freeze up inbetween bases more than once on flyouts where I could have tagged up and advanced for a sac fly. Batting also seems like the window is less than consistent than before.Updated 7/5/14 I am in July on my Franchise and have played roughly 80 something games I have noticed that alot of the glitches I noticed early in the game may have been due to some bugs with AI Rubberbanding, such as forced errors happening making it seem like the fielders are not focusing on the ball. Sometime it seems that the AI gets stuck a certain way for a prolonged ammount of time and that you will feel like you are batting with a wiffleball bat and your fielders are just plain drunk. I have also noticed other things such as facing the same starter on back to back days and his energy will read empty after about 2 innings but he wont run out of energy. Usually I just turn the system off and restart and these anomalies seem to sort themselves out. Overall I still enjoy the game but really hope some stability updates are made.*Overall it is a good game*Looks Fantastic for the most part*Same great simulation and multiple ways to play-Online play is really bad-Gameplay isn't quite as refined as previous years-Have ran into a few bugs-Some of the gameplay upgrades were a step back IMO","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2014"}

I'm a big fan of shooters like Halo and the Tom Clancy games and this idea sounded and is still great.  I must say that I was expecting a Rainbow Six type game set in the Star Wars universe.  This game does not even come close to Halo or Rainbow in play or in story. The sound was alright and the graphics were acceptable, but neither knocked me out of my seat.  To be honest, the graphics seemed more like a 90's arcade game.  I'm not a big fan of running around with a bunch of other people just running and gunning, but if you are I don't think that you'll be disspointed.  One major gripe that I have is the weapons, especially the sniper rifles....if we had stinkers like those today, we wouldn't have snipers at all.  Since when does it take 2 headshots to kill someone and since when does a sniper rifle or other blaster shoot all over the place half of the time?  I am probably judging this game a little too harshly, but after Ghost Recons and Halo how can you accept less?  To sum it up, die hard Star Wars fans get this game and you'll probably be satisfied; fans of online shooting get this game at a discount;  someone looking to try a shooter for the first time, look elsewhere; if you like Star Wars and shooters, get this at a discount.  The best advice I can give is game makers look at the best games for ideas and game buyers get this one when it comes down to under 20 bucks.  Save your big money for Halo 2, Ghost Recon 2, Splinter Cell 2/3, Men of Valor and Brothers in Arms.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2004"}

Still has flaws however.Graphics: Just beautiful, nothing compares to this game when you see these graphics both characters, architecture and landscape. The game also has realistic lighting, where I really felt the heat scorch the buildings and light up the characters while i was moving around. This is how video games should be visually, as this game felt very alive.Gameplay: Repetitive.Simply put once you play this game, you will be doing the same thing over and over.Hope yer ready. pick pocketing, interrogation, saving citizens,assasination,synchronizing are part of the game and are done over and over throughout the levels.Plot: Very bizzare plot as you are a man who supposedly was a bartender and is now working for a secret enterprise contained in a lab where you are drilled day by day to sit down on a machine called \"animus;\" to uncover the truth behind the crusades and the faith amongst the religious  cities. This game is to be continued.Cons: There isnt too much interactivity amongst the towns people and yourself as the player. Walking through crowds I expect more talking, smoke in the air from foods, more wildlife. These are things that ubisoft failed to do as you feel somewhat alone as no one says anything directly toward you unless there your leader or the person you assinated. When you smash a shop the vender doesnt punish you, when you climb a guarded building, the guards dont punish you...whats going on?? There needs to be more variety in gameplay, to many a times you find yourself doing the same thing over and over, and it does get boring :(. There are two stories going on, one in reality and one in the \"animus\" world, which is hard to follow both at a time.conclusion: Overall the visuals are what shocked me as they are just stunning, i would rent the game just to wander around looking at all the landscape which really brings out the HD in the xbox 360. This is mainly why it got the 4 stars was the spectacular graphics followed by the fun times climbing buildings.

{"product_name":"B0050SY4DG","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Bean","summary":"All aboard the Zombie Express","reviewText":"If a game had to be judged on amount of content alone 'Resident Evil 6' would be the star of 2012. You're given three campaigns to play through, Seven Characters to control, skills to upgrade, trophies to unlock and all in one big monster-killing thrill-ride of a video game. Unfortunately the quality of RE6 suffers from some obvious weaknesses, most notabley an identity crisis that's been present in this series since 'Resident Evil 4' making it hard to recommend to certain players.'Resident Evil 6' is split into three (and eventually four) intertwining campaigns which have you dealing with outbreaks and bio-terrorist attacks in North America, China and Eastern Europe. The U.S. president is killed, entire cities are infested with zombies, genetically enhanced mercenaries run amok and series regulars Leon Kennedy, Chris Redfield and Ada Wong (as well as RE2 survivor Sherry Birkin) have to team up with newcomers Helena Harper, Piers Nivens and Jake Muller to put a stop to it and prevent another outbreak. As per Resident Evil-norm the writing isn't the game's strongest element but there are some great character moments and the globe-spanning narrative gives RE6 a more epic feel than it's predecessors.While the three campaign's give 'Resident Evil 6' quite the playing time (about 25 hours) they're not all equal in quality and the repetitious (and action-oriented) nature of the game make some parts feel like filler. Leon and Helen's probably have the most diverse as you'll be creeping through an abandoned college campus, shooting zombies in a rain-drenched cemetary, solving puzzles in underground catacombs and swimming away from water monsters. There's even a haunting bit where you're just riding along in a military truck through an infected city, forcing you to impassivly watch as zombies attack innocent civilians. At times this FEELS like a real 'Resident Evil' game and the amazing amount of detail put into the graphics and sound ensure that the experience stays an immersive one.Sadly the horror-inspired nuance is few and far between and 'Resident Evil 6' eventually gives away to the action-packed spectacle of shootouts and vehicle chases (especially Chris and Jake's stories). That's not to say that these levels are bad exactly and shooting monsters (and bosses) has never been more fun thanks to the varied enemy types and mobile third-person shooting mechanics. But while RE6 has aped it's controls from accomplished action franchises like 'Uncharted' and 'Gears of War' it's never as smooth as those games were and getting your character to do something specific like dive into cover or combo a melee attack can be a handful. Oh, and there are QTE's....LOTS of QTE's!One thing that 'Resident Evil 6' succeeds at almost perfectly is co-op gameplay. While the A.I. is certainly smart during solo playthroughs, playing with a friend is even more fun as both partners get split up on the fly and you have to race to meet up while simultaneously providing cover for each other. There's so much to do that no matter which character you end up controlling you never feel short-changed during missions. Finding another player online is easy as well since the game lets you specify how you like to play (\"just for fun\", \"just for the action\" etc) and helps you match-up accordingly.The 'Resident Evil' series may have all but lost it's identity (calling these games \"horror\" is practically a joke at this point) but I can't deny I had a lot of fun with 'Resident Evil 6' and it gives you quite a lot of content for your $60. I still enjoy seeing more of Leon, Chris and Ada and if you're a fan of these characters or a monster-killing fan who can deal with some repetitious combat and ho-hum game design then I see no reason not to give 'Resident Evil 6' a shot.(this XBOX 360 version of Resident Evil 6 comes with a second disc that allows you to install different languages. The entirety of the game is on the first disc though, so there is no disc-swapping)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2012"}

I don't like just running around shooting -- I need a little plot and objective. I could never get the multiplayer to work. I checked online and found this to be a fairly common issue.

It was fun to play and quite the stress reliever and had become a party game at my house.  It was a blast to see who could create the most carnage and it was easy to pick up and play.  When I first bought Burnout Paradise, I was immediately upset that Crash Mode was gone.  I was going to sell it and call it a failure, but I kept playing around with it and found out that it is really a fun game.  The open world play is fun and exploring is a great time waster.  I've found myself driving around looking for signs to smash and ramps that I've never noticed before.  Online play is a blast because you can complete challenges with other players and it really adds to the gameplay.  There are still races and takedown challenges and they have added a stunt challenge, but for all these great things, it still doesn't excuse them getting rid of Crash Mode.  The Showdown Mode they replaced it with, while entertaining, just doesn't hold up and is quite silly.  Bouncing the car around and around trying to hit other vehicles just isn't as fun as Crash Mode.  It actually took strategy to complete crashes on the old games, but showtime just requires you to look for buses to get multipliers and bounce around and around on the street like some big metal fish out of water.  Overall, I would still say this game is worth buying and you will get hours of entertainment out of it, but I hope they bring back Crash Mode for future releases to take this from a good game to an awesome game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-29-2008"}

The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"Classic Final Fantasy gameplay gets a 128-bit makeover.","reviewText":"Considering the momentum built up by previous installments, the first 128-bit installment of the benchmark RPG series had to be something special. FFX is my favorite installment since part VI, making it my second favorite RPG. I alway prefer gamepay over long cinematics, but this game never gets dull. Here is my impression of the game, broken down for you:Pros:1. Classic gameplay. Although the technology has changed, many of the classic gameplay elements have changed. The battle system is familiar enough, with the use of magic and special abilities giving each character a unique advantage. The free-roaming in a totally 3-D environment continues the fine tradition of FF gameplay.2. Graphics and Sound. Obviously not an inch of technology was waster here. The 3-D environment, the cinematic quality cut scenes, and the real time facial expressions provide a whole new depth to the world you are exporing. The music is memorable, and suits each scene well. After the somewhat poor audio we got from FFIX, this is a welcome relief. The first time I played FFX, my jaw was on the floor. Actually, it is still there.3.  Cinematics. FFX is part game, part movie. While this may be a con for people who demand action at every turn, I think the movie scenes are essential. There is a lot of character development, and I am always interested to see them interact wih each other. The addition of voice acting (a first for the series) also gives life to the characters, whom we have known until now only as 2-D sprites who make us read a lot when they talk. The voice acting is easier to follow than text-based dialogue.4. Challenge. While I found FFIX to be pretty easy, this installment is more challenging than you might expect. I have gotten killed twice already, which is more than I was killed in all FF game combined. But I love a good challenge. As with other installments, you are looking at a decent 30 hours (maybe more) of gameplay. Your time will be well spent.5. Story. What every RPG needs is a compelling story, and this one give it in spades. While it offers little innovation in the plot, it keeps you hooked, and you are always wondering what will happen next.The Cons:These are all depending on your taste in RPGs.1. RPG cliches. The theme of &quot;world in peril, only the select few can save it&quot; is all too familiar. Though very compelling, the story could have had some more original twists. You are bound to have the deja vu feeling through out FFX. It is not a horrible thing, but those seeking a whole new story might be disappointed.2. Less overal gameplay. People who love action games will love the battles, but might object to the long cinematics. But these are essential to the plot, so if you cannot sit through them, you don't deserve to be playing FFX.FFX is a fine return to form for the series, and will definitely please both casual and hardcore gamers. One of the main reasons I bought my PS2 is for this game, and if this was the only game available, it would have been worth every penny.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2002"}

Also, like the Tony Hawk games,The Simsis a very addictive game.Players micromanage the lives of a family of virtual people and influence the outcome of their lives, be it success or something akin to a nervous breakdown. The bestselling PC version of the game has, in recent years, been upgraded with elements like parties, pets, and vacations, but this iteration is closer to the basic formula.You start the game living with Mom in a one-story suburban house. You are immediately presented with certain life tasks, such as fixing the TV and making lunch, which are aligned with the skills you'll need for the game's main challenge--keeping your sims in balance on eight conflicting categories. For example, eating will have an impact on your sim's hunger rating, but it will also impact his bladder rating. You'll have to make sure that he keeps himself and the house clean, that he sleeps to restore his energy, and that he also has time to keep himself entertained. The free will option lets your sims coast a bit, and you can also save time by stacking tasks together. Time passes at the rate of about one minute per second in the game, but you can fast-forward sim time when you need to, such as when they're sleeping.The controls are justifiably complex, but adjusting to them is not difficult. You see your sims from an overhead perspective that you can both rotate and zoom. You direct their actions by moving a line cursor to where you want them to go or to what object or person with which you want them to interact.The game is surprisingly funny. Neglect your sims and they'll shout and wave their arms to get your attention. Allow one's energy to get too low and he or she will likely collapse and sleep right where they were standing. When that happens, Mom is likely to serve them dinner on the floor.Gamers may find that it takes a while to get the hang ofThe Sims' style and control scheme.

The game has frozen on me a few timesafter calling a timeout on the field.- Lack of lineup flexibility.  I tried to put in an outside linebacker into the middle linebacker position and could not do so.  You can't even edit a player's position, look, etc. in the Franchise mode (if at all) outside of college players.  Don't players routinely change positions later in their careers, especially defensive backs (Rod Woodson going from corner to safety, for example)?- The running game is a bit too easy.  On 5 minute games on Pro difficulty, I routinely break off multiple 70+ yard runs a game.- The soundtrack kind of sucks.  Where Madden has established artists on their soundtrack, ESPN has artists that I've never heard of.  Then again, I'm not exactly up to date on the musical scene.Overall, I actually like playing this game more than Madden.  The graphics are better (players actually look like themselves), and the overall game is just more fun to play.  Some of the glitches get to me, but they've been few and far between thus far.

{"product_name":"B000FQBPCQ","reviewerName":"Sir Edmund Hillary \"Tenzing Norgay\"","summary":"Take a Trip Back 10 Years","reviewText":"I will start off by saying that despite be mostly negative about this game, it is still fun to play. However, from an adventure game perspective, Twilight Princess falls way short of other epic adventure games released on last-gen game consoles, let alone next-gen. I believe this game has been highly overrated by players and critics alike because they are trying to justify the long wait in their minds. They have also given it special dispensation because it is a Zelda game. I, on the other hand, hold the designers to a higher standard because it is a Zelda game, and therefore, have to admit that I am mostly disappointed with this title.Graphics - Early Game Cube quality at best. Even draw-in on some objects is worse than older GTA games on the PS2. It is painfully obvious that this title was designed for the Game Cube and was way behind schedule, and therefore, an allowance or requirement for a Wii-port. I think for those claiming that the graphics are great are comparing them to the 10 year-old technology of Ocarina of Time, which really isn't an objective assessment. Since the Wii is supposed to have twice the horsepower of the first XBOX, I should at least see XBOX 1 quality graphics.  Most games on the XBOX 1 graphically blow this game away. Certainly even the higher end PS2 games are superior in graphics quality.Game Play - What is up with still utilizing Z-camera reset? Holy smokes I feel like I am playing Mario 64. You do get used to the controls after awhile, especially if you just played OoT  or M64 on the VC, but why? The controls still feel a little sloppy and not even incrementally tighter than OoT. Why do I still have to go into a \"first-person\" mode to look around when 3rd person action titles have allowed full camera control for years now?Story - Though hokey at times, the story has a more welcome darker edge. Still, nothing new here. You start out as young Link in the forest and you still have to visit the Gorons. For goodness sake they couldn't have come up with something new? The transformation to a wolf, though looking cool, is pretty gimmicky with little substance in its deployment of fetch and puzzle missions.Sound - OMG, they still utilized MIDI technology. I have to wonder whether this was purposely done for nostalgia sakes. I am ok with a lack of voice-acting as employing Japanese voice actors usually results in horrible outcomes; but they could have used orchestrated music. This is a Zelda title after all, which usually means plenty of innovation. In fact, I started up OoT on the VC the other day and have to say that the MIDI music in that 10 year-old title is better.Overall, it seems that the designers used the actual OoT game engine from 10 years ago, refined it a bit, and made it passable on a Game Cube. It is certainly not passable by next-gen standards in any shape or form. You can't say that the Wii isn't capable of next-gen technology either. Start up Mario Galaxy and you will see what I am talking about. I still recommend playing this game, as it is fun and engaging, especially if you don't mind 10 year old game technology.

The gameplay, story, and especially, epic ending of the game left Hitman fans wanting more. Unfortunately, no Hitman game was in sight. Then, in 2009, Square Enix announced they were in development of the FIRST Hitman for the current-gen consoles. After six years, since Blood Money, Absolution is finally upon us. After watching many videos, I was surprised to see the game is a 180 from its last-gen editions of Hitman . Not only have it obviously changed, graphics-wise, it changed gameplay-wise, as well. The question is, are these changes for the better?CONTRACTS: This is a new addition to the game, which allows players to choose their own targets to take out. Plus, the player can also choose what weapon to use and how he may go about taking out the target. For example, a player can choose to take out a target, but NOT be seen by anyone, when doing so. This achievement will earn the player money for purchase of new disguises, weapons and upgrades. During the campaign, it is best to find as many weapons, items, and disguises as possible, so they will not have to be purchased in this mode.GAMEPLAY: The game is powered by the Glacier 2 engine, which is highlighted by the physics of CPU AI movements. The movements of 47 are very swift and responsive. In fact, many of 47's movements can be compared to how Sam Fisher's movements are in the Splinter Cell games, which means players can now access cover and look around at a 360 angle. I would also compare the sneaking around to the Metal Gear games, as well. In this game, there are just SO many ways to go about taking out a primary target. On one level, I was given the option to take out a target in 12 different ways. That way could be by taking him out, wearing various disguises, taken him out quietly, poisoning his food, blowing his car up or taking him out with guns blazing. Not to mention, players can get reward for doing so, which enhances the replay value of this game, like no other Hitman title.What separates Absolution from the previous Hitman games is an increase in interaction. Players do not have to rely solely on weapons to take out enemies, anymore. Unlike the previous Hitman titles, 47 can now use hand-to-hand combat, as well as face-to-face combat tactics. These are cool because he can punch someone. However, the enemy may counter the attack. When this happens, a quick-time event will come up alaHeavy Rain, which prompts 47 to make another attack and eventually land a lethal blow to his enemy. If not done promptly, 47 might be taken out by an enemy with his OWN counter attack. Also, 47 can use surrounding objects to down foes, as well.While playing through a level, many items can be picked up and used to distract or eliminate enemies. For example, 47 may see a book. Well, the book can be thrown to distract an enemy, so 47 can sneak by him. Also, 47 can that very book as a weapon, as well. Deadly weapons can be used in the same fashion. Nothing is cooler than seeing 47 throw a knife or an ax at an enemy's head. Speaking of weapons, there are many guns that are available in each level of the game, either by finding it or disarming and enemy. When collected, the weapons will be saved and can be used in contract missions. This also applies to acquired disguises, as well. The only downside to Absolution is 47 can no longer choose acquired weapons, prior to starting a level during the campaign.If 47 has to take on multiple enemies, no problem! Prior to firing a weapon, there is a new feature called Point Shooting, which allows 47 to mark multiple enemies and take them out with precision alaTom Clancy's Splinter Cell Conviction. When this is done, the game will go into slo-mo and 47 will automatically take out those marked enemies. 47 can also climb and hang onto structures. What's more exciting are 47 can now take enemies over the edge or shoot, while standing on them.The use of disguises has been a trademark of Hitman games. However, in Absolution, they must be used with more caution. For example, if a guard disguise is picked up, it will likely work. However, it is best not to get too close to other guards wearing the same uniform. With that being said, there is a new Blend-in mode. This can be activated, while passing guards. When this is activated, the screen will dim and the game will go into slo-mo. While this is happening, 47 will not look surrounding enemies' eye-to-eye, when passing them. Timing is critical, when activating the Blend-in mode. In addition, he can also \"hide\". This happens when 47 is wearing a disguise and appear to be performing an action that the person in that disguise would do. For example, 47 can dress as a cop and pretend to eat donuts. On the other hand, he can be disguised as an electrician and pretend like he is working on an electrical panel. There is meter that shows the reliability of the disguise. If the meter goes down, the disguise will slowly lose effectiveness and may eventually be compromised.If the instinct meter gets TOO low, and a civilian in the enemy's area sees 47, he could get suspicious and start to follow him. He may say, \"who are you?\" or \"you're not fooling me!\" Meanwhile, this would be the time to flee or lead this person to a place, where 47 can quietly take this person out because if not, two scenarios happen. First, that person is going to alert enemy guards. While this is going on, a picture of 47's disguise will be shown on the screen. This indicates the disguise has been totally compromised. Meanwhile, a SUSPICIOUS message will appear on the screen and the searching enemies will be shown in yellow on the mini-map. If 47 is out of sight long enough, a CLEAR message will appear on the screen. All of this is also reminiscent of the Metal Gear games.The second scenario will happen if 47 is seen by an enemy. They might try to subdue 47 or just shoot on sight. If the enemy tries to subdue 47, he can now do what's called a fake surrender. 47 will put his hands up in submission. When the enemy gets too close, 47 can disarm and use him as a human shield, which is also a new feature. When or if this happens, a full alert will commence, which means you have to start shooting. Meanwhile, enemies on the mini-map will be shown in red. Depending on the circumstance, this alert level may not change for quite some time. The best thing to do if 47's disguise is about to be compromised is to try to get away, get another disguise or quietly take a suspicious person out, prior to these scenarios even taking place.The instinct mode also allows 47 to see which paths enemies will take. The nearby enemy can be seen through walls and it will show a trail, which indicates an enemy route. This is a feature that has similarity toBatman: Arkham City for Playstation 3. Not to mention, 47 can scan surrounding areas for places and items of interest. Of course, if players believe this feature is too supernatural or make the game too easy, it can be turned off. In addition to disguises, an increase in concealment has been added to the game. In the past, 47 could only hide one body inside of a container or closet. Now, he can hide two bodies. 47 can also hide in a closet or container, rather empty or with a max of one enemy in the container. While hiding, 47 can peek around. 47 can also crawl through vents for concealment or to find an alternate route to another area.GRAPHICS/VISUALS: Don't be fooled by the 420p/720p output of this game. The graphics are VERY good. They are not quite as vivid as some Sony-based games, such as Uncharted. However, the sharpness, framework, physics and attention to detail are second-to-none.SOUND: The game has Dolby Digital Surround Sound. Every sound in the game is very realistic. The coolest feature is hearing enemies or civilians carrying on a conversation, which gives the game a very immersive feel. It is very interesting in hearing some of the things that they have to say. Also, when navigating through a crowd, the sound makes the player feel like they are watching a movie.VERDICT: This game has the graphics, story, and the gameplay that easily makes Absolution the best of the series. Diehard Hitman fans owe it to themselves to purchase this game. The game welcomes new players to Hitman, but if these players still happen to have a last-gen console, they should pick up those editions of the series, as well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2012"}

Also, I have not encountered any 'buggy' areas either, which is great considering the amount of action going on the screen at any given time...Like a great summer movie, this is a nice & simple diversion. Plus it will help polish your FPS skills(if needed...). I think some of the professional reviews were a little hard on this game, but to each their own. Highly re-playable too.Have fun and def. turn it up!!! Your neighbors will love you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2011"}

I thought this game was fun from start to finish. I couldnt wait to start playing again when I had to quit for a while. There are plenty of different types of weapons to be found amd seem to be well balanced. All of the different types of monsters you will encounter will not simply sit back and wait to be slain. they will be comming at you hard and some like the warewolves even pick up things and throw them at you which you have to evade or take damage if you dont. the Graphics are not the best Ive ever seen but are not bad by far as some people are saying in their reviews. I have played all the big titles Halo 1 ,2 ,& 3 ,all call of duty games , Gears of war 1 & 2 etc. and have enjoyed them all and this game is no exception. dont listen to all of these negative reviews and try this game for yourself I really think you will be suprised at how much of a really great game this is.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2010"}
