Dead Rising 2 has improved on the first games system, removed the photography element but lost much of the story and plot along the way. There is a story here with the heart pulling need for the character to keep his daughter supplied with the medicine to keep her from turning into a zombie, but I just didn't find myself caring much. The plot of the game was also sort of out there even for a game where there is a game show about killing zombies. I wanted to love this game as much as the first but I think the time had just passed for me. The elements are all there, lots of cool outfits and weapons, tons of zombies, a more forgiving save system and story counter, but I just had a hard time getting into it. I applaud the downloadable content to expand the story that is available for this game. It helps to add some much needed story and to keep the game alive and somewhat fresh while waiting for the next installment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2011"}

Worst yet, one based almost entirely in underground caves infested with alien bugs. Despite this con, I had an absolute blast playing this game. Not many games out there can compare to Red Faction's penchant for destruction.Best of all, like it's predecessor, this game is packed with cheats that are unlocked after playing through the game once. You can purchase unlimited ammo for all guns, unlock weapons usually exclusive to in-game vehicles, and even change the visual style of the game. And may I just take a minute to explain just how ridiculously destructive and fun some of these weapons are? Several (including a pony that farts rainbows... not even kidding) allow you to disintegrate buildings, one lets you see and shoot through walls, one creates mini black holes and another (The Napalm Laser) has you literally drawing a line of utter destruction across the battlefield.Unfortunately due to the inclosed areas, the destruction is not as satisfying as it was in the previous, more open game (Red Faction Guerrilla). Still given it's price, I would very strongly recommend picking this up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2012"}

Randall","summary":"One of the best is back:  Smaller and better than ever!!","reviewText":"\"Super Mario 64\" for the original Nintendo 64 is considered by many to be one of the best video games ever made.  It took the enormous popularity of the side-scrolling Super Mario games and evolved it into a mind-bending, three-dimensional adventure that thoroughly pleased existing fans while enthralling a whole new generation of gamers.The gameplay, design, and challenge of \"Super Mario 64\" is still as cutting-edge today as it was when it was first released in 1996.  So, it should come as no surprise that Nintendo would take one of its most popular games ever and port it as the debut game for its new handheld device, the Nintendo DS.  The result is \"Super Mario 64 DS\" which, in almost everyway, is superior to its spectacular predecessor.  Once you get past the simple amazement of being able to play this remarkable game on a handheld device, you start to take notice of all the ways they were actually able to improve on the original.As with the original \"Super Mario 64\", the objective (other than defeating Bowser and rescuing the Princess, which it is in every game.  Boy that Princess sure knows how to find trouble!) is to gather as many Stars as possible from the 15 different worlds hidden throughout the castle, whether they be in a painting or some other strange location.  In the original, there were 7 Stars to be found in each world, along with 15 Stars hidden at random places throughout the castle, for a total number of 120 Stars.  While obtaining 70 was all that was required to face the final battle with Bowser, most dedicated gamers went for the gold and all 120 Stars.The difference with \"Super Mario 64 DS\" is that they have raised the ante.  Now, there are 8 stars in each world and 30 HIDDEN Stars throughout the castle, making the total 150 Stars.  The extra 30 Stars create a compelling additional level of challenge for the gamers.  Especially where the 15 new hidden Stars are concerned, it feels like a whole new dimension of adventure has been added to this game.  It should also be noted that Nintendo reviewed the gameplay of the original and realized that there were several Star objectives that were simply tedious and aggravating to obtain.  So, Nintendo either scaled back some of the difficulty or replaced them entirely with brand new objectives.  The difference is striking.  One doesn't feel any less challenged in these objectives, but one also doesn't get bogged down with frustrating objectives that are more annoying than anything else.There are some other changes to this game, as well.  In additional to the vastly improved graphics, there is a major change to the gameplay.  The main method of moving around in the original game was with the analog stick located in the center of the control pad.  Obviously it would not be feasible to design that into the DS.  So, much more substantial control has been ceded back to the directional control pad on the left and the results leave very little noticeable difference.  For those who still love the idea of the center control, the DS' thumb device for the touch screen can let you get that analog stick control.  Nintendo also improved the control of the camera angles from which you can view your progress.  Whereas in the original, you could find yourself spending as much time fighting the camera controls as trying to achieve the objective, the camera is much smoother this time.One final change that the designers made to set \"Super Mario 64 DS\" apart from the original, and make it more compelling, was now you get to play as FOUR different characters instead of just Mario.  Luigi, Yoshi, and even Wario have made the trip this time, and each one helps out in a different way.  Some of the switch caps that Mario used in the original to be able to become invisible or be `Metal Mario' are now the special skill of the other characters (Luigi: invisibility.  Wario: Metal).  So, now there has be some strategy involved into how one tackles each objective.  It truly enhances the overall game.\"Super Mario 64 DS\" has thrown down the gauntlet for Nintendo in the next generation of handheld gaming wars.  If the other DS games continue to match level perfection witnessed by this game, Nintendo will continue to dominate the portable world.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2005"}

It is stunningly accurate. I've heard some complaints about table tennis. Table tennis is hands down my favorite sport in this game. As a semi-professional table tennis player, trust me -- it works accurately.Archery is also a blast. As is, strangely enough, Bocce -- a game I never had much fun with in real life. Another winner is the gladiator duel section of the game. This is the closest motion control has gotten to the 1:1 \"lightsaber\" or \"Lord of the Rings\" moment so many have wanted since the Wii was first announced as the \"Revolution.\"The game isn't perfect. Using two controllers almost seems to be a marketing gimmick to get you to buy a second controller, even if you don't need one. Archery and gladiator work MUCH better with only one Move controller. Archery is twice as hard with two controllers. The other problem is the Playstation Eye itself. Unless you're in a VERY well-lit room with a LOT of front-lighting, your image will be grainy and full of colored splotches. This affects the game, because you are able to take photos \"holding\" a virtual bow, paddle, sword, etc. and, all the photos I've taken, have shown a barely visible grainy version of me holding the item. This makes them unusable (you're allowed to upload them to Facebook).Still, complaints and quibbles aside, this is really a good game. And I haven't even mentioned disc golf yet (it's fun, accurate and easily the best of the bunch when playing two player). Sports Champions is essentially what we were promised with Wii Sports. It just took it 5 years to finally arrive.*I've noticed a LOT of complaints about table tennis in reviews for this game. Here's a tip that should solve any problem with the controls in table tennis: Make sure the Move controller has the Move button facing UP at all times. That's the way it's programmed to mimic an actual paddle. If you hold it any other way, it's similar to holding a ping pong paddle sideways and trying to hit the ball with the edge of the paddle. Once in the \"up\" position, you can add spin and anything else you would do in regular table tennis. Hope this helps!*","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2010"}

It's great to see the DOA characters again alongside my favorites like Kasumi and Jann-Lee and i have not unlocked everything yet but from what i can see this title may have every DOA character included in this version.I started with the chronlogical mode that serves as both a tutorial and looks to wrap up the previous DOA stories and i'm guessing will go into the new one dimensions but i have only played to doa 3 atm, it was really nostalgic seing all those old bosses, costumes and seeing those old storylines i havent seen for 5-10 years and i have not even touched arcade or any other mode yet, and with so much content to unlock like characters, costumes and figurines i can see myself playing this game for a LONG time to come.This is so far one of the best 3ds titles available and gave me a reason to turn on my 3ds again and to keep it on for the coming weeks if not months.

Placing a familiar Nintendo personality behind the wheel of a  sputtering kart powered by a 50, 100, or 150-cc engine, the game lets players race  computerized opponents or up to four other players on a variety of well-designed tracks.  Because karts lack the power and speed of race cars, drivers must focus on collecting  power-ups and nonlethal weapons rather than negotiating hairpin turns on two wheels.

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"B.

{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"Princeps P \"The Princeps\"","summary":"Honest review, first time Diablo player","reviewText":"Honest review of Diablo 3.  I have not played any previous Diablo games, so this is new to me.  I own World of Warcraft and Starcraft 2. I enjoy Blizzard games and like the community.Diablo 3 is described as an action RPG; I would consider it a water down version of that. I consider an RPG along the lines of WoW and Skyrim.  There are some RPG elements like equipment customization, but not in character builds.  Your stats increase a set amount depending on the character you choose and you unlock specific skills at different levels.  The customization is that you choose what unlocked skills to use at any particular time. I have always enjoyed choosing what skill I wanted when I leveled up, I am not use to having it chosen for me. I understand why Blizzard did this, they wanted to make it easier to play and encourage new players.  However, what attracted me to buying Diablo in the first place was the customization that I read about for Diablo 2.  For me, customization and character builds comes before story in RPGs.  Even though this is disappointing the game is still enjoyable.  The random loot gives a good amount of customization, but leveling does not have the same satisfaction I am accustomed to.  The story is quite enjoyable and the cut scenes are fun to watch, they are timed to not  interfere with the gameplay.  I find the voice acting superb.The game play mechanics are easy to learn and use. The challenge comes in the timing and loads. Basically, you can assign abilities you have unlocked to both mouse buttons and numerical keys 1-4. I have heard complaints about this namely that players want access to all abilities and not limited to just six.  However, I find this adds to the challenge because you have to choose the right load out for the situation. It is easy to change and the cool down time is very short.Replay value of the game is there for at least a couple of play throughs with different characters, but may become boring after that.  Yes, loot drops are random and yes, some aspects of the dungeons are random as well, but if you are not into loot hunting and auction house whoring-the game could lose its appeal. Even with multiplayer players who are not trying to find the next great piece of equipment may get bored after a few play throughs.  At this point, I am not bored and playing with my second character. I am interested to see if there is money making opportunity with the \"real money\" auction house when it is up and running.  I think the lack of player controlled leveling customization may hurt long-term replay value though.I chose to give the game three stars for two reasons.  First, I marked off a star because of the watered down customization, this is a huge issue for me, but may not apply to everyone. I just feel long-term replay value may be hurt by this and past Diablo games have been known for replay value.I marked off a second star for the fact that you must have an internet connection to play single player.  This really does not affect me because I am always connected, but I believe players should have a choice. Battlenet is a double edge sword in my opinion. I like that I can login to any computer and easily download a game I already payed for and play anywhere. Currently I have WoW, Starcraft 2 and Diablo on numerous computers. I like the fact all I have to do is enter my account info and I am off. However, on the other side there is no resale value. I hardly sell games, but I believe it is a player's choice. You buy a car, house, gun, stereo, etc, you can choose to sell. I think games should be the same. Even though it does not really apply to me I stand by the community and thus, marked off a star.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2012"}

Players can get married and have children; female player characters will become pregnant, which will then be reflected by their physical appearance.Early in the game, players are presented with a stray dog for a best friend, who will need to be fed and loved, and will accompany the player throughout his or her life.

W. Mullins","summary":"Lots of glitches, but really good when its working","reviewText":"Fable 2 has an impossible amount of hype to live up to, which is impossible. The first game had failed to live up its hype and this one can't either. But it is a very good game in its own right, when its working correctly. It is a very refined version of the first game and the gameplay is almost the exact same, but slightly more polished.The problem I have with it is the huge number of bugs and errors mine seems to have. Alright I have a character with a huge amount of time invested in him that will no longer play. When the game locked up during a map transition/save and never recovered. This apparently corrupted the save and there seems to be no way to get it to load again. This is something I could actually forgive, had the designers allowed for multiple save files for the same game. Instead all of your saves are limited to one per hero.There have been a number of times I have moved into a new area and instead of loading the proper map I end up back at the beginning of a quest. I've been stuck in walls and trees, and my 360 has frozen more times while playing this game than in the entire time I have owned it.But there are good points too, actually Fable 2 would be five stars across the board if it had shipped complete. Granted I am sure there will be a patch to fix the majority of errors people are having. But if you spend 60 dollars on a game, you should get a complete, playable game. Your dog is awesome, and while it doesn't add an insane amount of depth it is possible to grow attached to your four legged friend.The economy system is almost as much fun as the game. While the tedious jobs are rather annoying, the ability to buy homes and businesses is really cool. The added depth of being able to decorate and change prices on items and rent is also very neat.The combat is simple, but effective. You are able to string together various combos using will, melee and ranged weapons easily. The new magic system and its lack of mana bar is also a welcome change if playing a magic using character.All up I rather enjoyed Fable 2, up to the point where my game became unplayable and wasted days of work.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2008"}

Assassin's Creed was leaps and bounds ahead of the original, and the good news is that Brotherhood is a continuation of that winning formula. Coming out a year after the previous game might make this seem like a glorified expansion at first glance, but Brotherhood is anything but that.The story shifts back and forth between Ezio, returning home to find that war has broken out and his arch nemesis does some nasty things that warrants Ezio's motive for revenge and overthrowing him, and to Desmond in 2012 as he and the rogue scientists attempt to unravel the past in order to escape the murderous templars in the present. The plot is not overly engrossing, however it's the characters that bring everything to life and Brotherhood really excels in this area. Ezio is a compelling character a always, and the game is filled with a rich cast of colorful characters that are both new to the series and returning from the previous game. The difference in this game is that you are not supposed to run through the story on your own; you are expected to recruit assassin's to assist you througout the game and they are yours to summon whenever needed. Sadly, the AI is not spot-on and sometimes they are not as useful as you would hope, but they do come in handy when you are getting slaughtered in battle. A character in and of itself, the city of Rome is vibrant and bustling with interesting and sometimes amusing people. Beggars line the streets, prostitutes beckon you to hire them and groups of vigilantes gather in the public squares, all adding to a sense of realism that made the previous game so endearing. The bulk of the game is spent in Rome, which may feel like a step back from Assassin's Creed II, where you would travel between cities, but Rome is so vast and populous that you'll easily overlook this. The story missions are well paced and full of intense action, and the platforming segments in the shrines are fantastic as well.The gameplay is largely unchanged from Assassin's Creed II and the free-running mechanic works as well here as it did before, so anyone familiar with the game can dive right in. Rome is a huge city with plenty of rooftops, so it's sometimes fun to just run around and take in all the sights. In addition to the story missions, there are various things you can do around town to earn money. Like Assassin's Creed II, there is an economy system here in which you purchase shops and they add to your treasury balance, which is essential for upgrading your weapons and armour. A new addition that's a nice touch are the areas of the city that are under the tyrannical rule of Borgia and his armies, and you can liberate these areas by destroying their towers and killing the captains. This adds some of the most intense and exhilarating moments in the game, since these tasks ramp up in difficulty fast. Graphically, this game is a sight to behold and it is easily on par with Assassin's Creed II. The character animation, cutscene quality and design of the city are all well done and, despite some noticeable pop-in, it provides a wonderful sense of immersion.Like all video games, Brotherhood is not perfect and it does have it's share of flaws. The free-running mechanic is tight and responsive for the most part, but it is not always accurate. There have been several occasions where I meant to jump in one direction and I ended up going the other way, sometimes falling to my death or losing valuable seconds in some of the time-based objectives. This even happens when you are clearly facing a place where you can jump. Additionally, there is some glitchiness with your AI controlled assassins and even some of the friends you need to interact with. For example, they would get stuck in walls, stand there doing nothing or simply teleport to another area. It's not a huge problem, but it does pose some annoyances when you really need things to run smoothly. Thrown in to add a level of challenge, you can now achieve full synchronization by completing missions a certain way. For example, if you complete a mission in under a certain number of minutes, avoid losing health, or killing someone in a particular manner, you will achieve full synchronization and this will add up to achievement points/trophies. Unfortunately, some of the sequences are lengthy and it's disheartening to know that you've failed this so early into the missions. This does add some frustration, but it's hardly a deal-breaker and some might actually view this as a strength.The last thing I'll touch upon is the multiplayer, which is something very interesting and unique. You are thrown into a large area with other players, given a person to assassinate, and likewise someone is after you. The objective is to kill your target before you get killed, and the style in which you do it will determine how well you do. For example, if you run up and knife someone in the back, you've achieved your objective and move on. But if you do it with style and stealth, you earn more points. This is a refreshing change from all of these online shooters that mainly focus on kill streaks, so being a hardcore online player doesn't ensure that you'll do well here. It's definitely something different. On the other hand, the pace will definitely feel slower to those who prefer the breakneck pace of online shooters, so this is an acquired taste. If you don't like multiplayer, you don't lose out because the single player campaign is 20+ hours long and there is plenty to keep you busy.The speed at which this game was released certainly attracted some sceptics, however I am happy to say that Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is every bit as fun, challenging and beautifully done as the previous game. Those expecting an entirely new game with a new plot and cast of characters might be disappointed, but anyone who loved Assassin's Creed II is really missing the boat if they don't pick this up as well. Highly recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2010"}

The checkpoint/kill/respawn system is lacking, as others have discussed, and can become pretty frustrating. Eventually, I just changed the difficulty setting from NORMAL to EASY to get around that and have a better gaming experience. This is the first game I've ever had to go through on easy...But I probably would've just thrown it in the sell pile otherwise.Also annoying is the in-game loading scheme.  When you're about to enter a new section of BB, a 10 sec freeze frame load occurs...Then when you have to go back to the area you came from, another 10 sec load occurs.  These extra loads occur more often than they should because of poor gameplay design.  For example, Riddick has to go see \"Centurion\" to get him to set up a fight in \"the ring\".  So instead of Centurion actually setting up the fight like he says he will, Riddick has to go wandering around BB, section by section, looking for his opponent because Centurion only gives him the opponent's name.  Once Riddick locates him, the opponent then says, \"So you want to fight me, huh?\"  Then Riddick has to walk back to Tower 17 where Centurion is/was and talk to him again in order to actually get into the ring and fight the opponent.  All the time there are load screens after load screens when entering and exiting each area, and Riddick just ends up back where he started, talking to Centurion...This is either FILLER or it's just horrendous game design.  This has to be repeated about 3 or 4 more times, until there's nobody else for Riddick to fight.  I was GLAD when there was nobody else for Riddick to fight!!The eyeshine gimmick is neat at first, then it will nearly blind you at times when Riddick comes out of darkness into a lit area. I was also ticked-off near the end of Escape when your mission is to \"get past the guards to reach the transport ship at the Spaceport\". I found the easiest way was to not confront the Riot Guards, but sprint past them and easily handle the \"basic\" guards at the ship. After all, there is a \"stealth\" aspect to the game isn't there?  So I spend 30 minutes walking around the ship, trying to jump up on the ship, crawling under the ship, trying to grab the platform where the hatch is located and NOTHING worked. I could've spent days doing this because you have to actually KILL the Riot Guards to trigger the hatch to open so Riddick can enter the ship. I don't see why this was necessary and since it obviously was, why wasn't it explained more clearly in the mission statement? However, the scene that follows was probably the BEST in the entire game and the ending was really satisfying...So it leaves you with a good feeling.Assault on Dark Athena was the better Riddick game, in my opinion.  But it REALLY IS \"Dark\" Athena! Most of the time you spend on the ship, the screen is almost completely BLACK it's so dark in this game and this is further complicated by certain areas requiring precision moves and timely maneuvers when the controls themselves aren't so exact. This makes the platforming exercises particularly frustrating when you know what needs to be done, but getting the controls to actually do it without Riddick plunging to his death or alerting guards can require multiple attempts. Eyeshine helps somewhat...But you have to keep flipping back and forth turning eyeshine on and off and it becomes annoying. Fortunately Riddick does get off the ship and explore a planetary environment that consists of some of the BEST parts of the game. Here's where he acquires the S.C.A.R. gun and it's almost too much fun to blow stuff up with it!At the end of this game (I believe it was DA, not EFBB), there is an extended platforming/puzzle-solving exercise that seemed like it would just go on and on forever. It was overkill as far as I'm concerned and time could've been better spent shooting/fighting/blowing stuff up instead of jump...walk...climb...jump...walk...jump...climb, etc. Just boring stuff here...So overall there's a great deal of gameplay on the Riddick disk considering you actually get to play through 2 complete games. While gameplay itself wasn't extraordinary (or even memorable), there were some enjoyable parts and nothing was so bad that I was throwing the controller around the room. That may not be a \"glowing\" endorsement, but that's why I said I'd give the package deal 4-stars because you do get sufficient gametime with BOTH games. Since Riddick's recently plunged in price, it's certainly an even better deal now and it's worth a playthrough...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2009"}

You'll need all the control you can get, too, as you roar through the twists and turns ofF-Zero's 15 deviously difficult courses. There are four hover cars to choose from, each with its own strong points and weak points. Most beginners find the durability and handling of the Fire Stingray easiest to use (despite poor acceleration), but veteran players will often choose the more-balanced Blue Falcon.Strategy plays a big part in this speedfest. In this one-player racing game you will need to find shortcuts, elude hazards and snag power-ups if you want to beat your savvy competition. Keep an eye out for sand, land mines, magnets and other trouble spots, but always be ready to get a boost from a speed or jump plate. You'll earn one Super Turbo per lap, and part of the strategy is knowing when to use it.When originally released in 1991,F-Zero's graphics were light years ahead of most of the competition. It still impresses mightily, thanks to innovative use of Mode 7 scrolling that immerses you in the adrenalin-pumping action.Sonically,F-Zerois one of the best SNES titles.

I'm in the middle of \"Changing Tides\", the apparent fifth level.  I've taken the disc out of the tray and put it back in the box and it will remain there forever, in penance, to think about what it has done in darkened silence.  Danger Close and EA should be ashamed of this pile of garbage.I played the Medal of Honor reboot/release, the single player campaign, and it was good.  I enjoyed it.  The pacing, the action, the story, all of it was good.  It wasn't perfect, but it was a good purchase and time well spent.  I thought Warfighter would be the same.  Good gravy, was I wrong.  So wrong.Beyond the fact that the levels are very corridor-like and cramped, they are too dark.  I don't have room on my drive to install the \"HD graphics\", so I'm using whatever the default stuff is -- but the color pallet is washed out and the shading is too aggressive.  I had to turn my brightness up to see what was happening a lot of the time.  The game is an endless series of high pressure zero notice pop-up shooting gallery pieces punctuated by trying to navigate an obvious corridor or a confusing environment.  \"What in the world is happening??\" has been my most common thought.I've done one of the driving levels...  that is some total nonsense right there.  Man, I don't know how anyone thought that level was well done.  After an excessively long and frustrating chase scene I had one single chance to pilot that careening piece of garbage vehicle with terrible controls into a single spot, or else I had to restart from the last checkpoint NO PREACHER NO YOU LOST HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This game feels like Call of Duty: World at War got smashed into a trash can with Medal of Honor: Airborne, and then that trash was formed into a new game which was sold to me through Amazon.  Endless guys, invisible spawn lines, a terrible \"cover/peek\" system, and lots of HURRY UP RUSH HURRY UP RUSH GO GO GO complete with your idiot squad mates haranguing you about taking too long.Please, please, please:  Rent this game.

{"product_name":"B004EW948E","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Personality Over Perfection","reviewText":"The \"Yakuza\" series is one of the most underrated franchises globally. It's story, character dynamics and renovations of typical brawler conventions are all amazing reminders of just how intricate and fun video games can be. With the franchise taking a shooter-style vacation this year with \"Yakuza: Dead Souls\", it's development team focused their efforts on a new IP with their signature flair for character and narrative, all on top of the increasingly-tired third-person shooter market. That new IP is \"Binary Domain\", and it's here to prove that Japanese developers not only can hold their own against Americans when it comes to action games, but surpass the gamut of them.\"Binary Domain\"'s plot unfolds similar something by authors like Philip K. Dick or Harlan Ellison. In the early 21'st century, i.e. present day, humanity's downfall began. Global warming peaked and the economy collapsed, resulting in a one-two punch of cataclysmic events. The earth flooded, destroying three-quarters of the world's major cities. Only the corporations and governments with abundant resources could survive such an event, and conveniently, the most well-off ones were in the United States. This led to America becoming an international superpower by default. In order to rebuild the world which was now pretty much it's oyster, the government and technology corporations began to construct robots that could get the job done faster and more efficiently than the weary masses could.However, this came with a price. Soon, the concept of intelligent robots who truly believed that they were human was brought to the table. This was an immediate threat, and thus the President of the United States put into motion the New Geneva Convention, which forbade any type of fully-aware robotic entity. But in 2080 a humanoid robot breaks into the building of the top robotics manufacturer in the world and attempts to kill the president of the company. That robot, known as a \"Hollow Child\", was built by a rival Japanese corporation, and was in violation of the new Convention. To put an end to this threat, the US Government sends two Special Forces operatives into Japan, which is being ravaged by these thinking machines. Their mission is to topple the corporation and take out any enemy robots along the way.These two soldiers are the two most enjoyable protagonists I've played with in a game since I met agent Francis York Morgan in the 2010 cult masterpiece \"Deadly Premonition.\"  Their nonstop banter is very reminiscent of that shared between the protagonists of the \"Army of Two\" series, except in this game, the dialogue feels more natural and not overly wrought. It's like the best buddy cop movie imaginable, only set in the future and with armies of humanoid death machines out to kill said buddies. Killing wave after wave of enemies never feels tedious with these two guys around for chemistry and laughs.Then again, the excellent dialogue isn't all that makes shooting these baddies special. Yakuza Studios implemented a damage system similar to the one found in the \"Dead Space\" series. Killing robots isn't only a matter of pointing and shooting, but rather a strategic and methodical takedown of each squad. Shooting the legs off of a robot stuns then, but they'll quickly crawl around and start shooting at you again, making a nuisance of themselves in a firefight. Blasting the head off of one fries their optics and brain, causing them to shoot at anybody, including fellow bots. Tearing through the chest is straightforward, but takes more time. How you handle each opponent is an integral part to \"Binary Domain\", making it more enjoyable than your average \"Gears of War\" clone.What also makes each battle more enjoyable is the character relationship system, which not only affects dialogue, but character behavior on the battlefield as well. Depending on how you choose to react in battle, how you respond to questions, and your gameplay style in general, the AI partners will change accordingly. With other characters added to your party later on, you have to be conscious of how you treat your fellow fighters. One response may please a certain partner, but irk another. This will change their willingness to follow orders and help you out in the middle of a fight, so it's not just a throwaway gimmick to keep people interested. It's an important facet of the game, and one that more developers should definitely use in the future.Visuals in this game are top-notch. While they never reach the level of something like, say, \"Modern Warfare 3\", they're certainly nothing to scoff at, something to be expected from a developer who accurately rendered contemporary Japan in the \"Yakuza\" series. The character models are impeccably rendered, and the scenery is fantastic after the first hour of gameplay kicks in. The futuristic Japan put on display is a true feast for the eyes, and a blast to barrel through and blast enemies in. Comparisons the aforementioned billion-selling shooter and other major action franchises are unfair, really, because \"Binary Domain\" has more originality bleeding out of it's designs than anything to come out of Infinity Ward, DICE or Epic Games.What some might notice, though, is that the shooting mechanics are rather basic. They're a more raw-bones version of the \"Gears of War\" school of TPS games, and while that's certainly nothing bad, it may come across as not \"innovative\" enough. However, keep in mind that everything works the way it ought to, and the shooting mechanics are perfectly adequate. Same goes for the upgrade system which is basic, yet adds more noticeable firepower with each weapon level than most other systems I've worked with. It's a nice little component to an already nice game. Basic mechanics being fairly typical is nothing to complain about in this day and age, however. What most gamers look for in a game is originality in concept, design and execution as opposed to distinct moving and/or shooting mechanics. By this standard, \"Binary Domain\" is a roaring success.However, it should be noted that by typical standards, this game is not perfect. In comparison to blockbuster games, it's graphics could use more detail. When held up against major shooter franchises, the mechanics could perhaps be a bit more fluid. And when put up against writing by studios like Rockstar, the banter might come across as cheesy or contrived. But in spite of these potential minor gripes, this game is hardly possible to dislike.It makes me disillusioned with the current game criticism system that a game like \"Binary Domain\" is awarded a 6 or 7, while a game like \"Battlefield 3\" is awarded a near-perfect score. BF3 has a campaign that is utterly dull, a contrived war story punctuated by explosions and firefights with mechanics that are aped from many other FPS games. The redeeming feature of the game is it's multiplayer, which in truth should be a knock off on a score, not *the* reason to buy a game. In contrast, \"Binary Domain\" has tight controls that aren't anything revolutionary, but makes up for it with sheer creativity in AI interaction, narrative progression and feasible visions of what a robot post-apocalypse might look like.Instead of sticking itself inside of a box and doing one thing that everybody on the market is doing, Yakuza Studio threw dozens of unique ideas behind \"Binary Domain.\" There is absolutely nothing else like it on the market; it's a wonderful experience, with breathtaking action sequences and moments of true humanity among the cast. With way above-average graphics and sound backing it, this excellent concept work hits every sweet spot that a game should. One of my favorite critics, Jim Sterling once said that a game should be judged on \"how often it made you happy, how much you laughed or became excited, and how you long you spend thinking about it after it was finished.\" I could think of no better standard to judge \"Binary Domain\" by.Score: 9.0","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-29-2012"}

A lot of questions were swirling around my head as I started playing.  Would I have fun?  Would it be too hard?  I am pleased to say that the Return of the King is a fantastic movie liscened game and a great game by itself.The Return of the King uses a new graphics engine, which is apparent from the moment you start fighting orcs.  Everything is more detailed and better then the Two Towers game, and some of the levels are absoloutly astonishing in terms of how big everything is (A prime example is the battle of the Pelennor fields level).  Speaking of the Two Towers, it's a good idea to be familiar with how that game is because the Return of the king game assumes you have memorized all the combat because it dumps you right into the action with little explenation as how to fight.The Return of the King has three paths for you to take.  After finishing the opening level, you can take the path of the wizard to Minas Tirith, The path of the King to the Paths of the Dead, and the path of the hobbits to Mordor.  You can tackle any level in any order, and all of them lead up to a explosive finalie at the Crack of Doom.  Along that route, you'll be fighting thousands of bad guys.  At times there are so many bad guys on screen I was amazed that there was no slowdown on my PS2.  The Black Gate level (Which is AWESOME) is a prime example of this, but I'll let you see that for yourself.The Return of the king has three times as many playable charachters as the first game for a total of nine charachters (including three secret charachters).  Each charachter has thier own fighting style (Except for the hobbits) to play with.  Gandalf the White is a very balanced charachter as is Aragorn, while Legolas is fast but weak, and Gimli is slow but very strong.  One of the best features about the game is that once you finish the Crack of Doom level, you can go back and play any level with any charachter, which leads to some very funny what if scenarios, such as what if Aragorn took on Shelob the Spider, or if Sam defended the Walls of Minas Tirith etc.Sadly, Return of the King has some areas where I was a little dissapointed in.  All the ads for the game say you fight Shelob, the King of the Dead, Saurons Lutinent, the witch King and more.  There is a little bit of false advertising in that statement.  The Witch King is in the game, but all you ever do is shoot arrows at his fell beast until it dies, then you watch a cutscene of Eowyn and Merry fighting the Witch King.  I was INCREDIBLY dissapointed that you cannot fight him hand to hand, as that would have been awesome.  Also I had read that Sauron was going to be a boss in several magazines, but that is not true.  I was also mystified why the final boss is immune to your attacks.  Secondly, at times there are no clues as to what you are supposed to do next.  On the Walls of Minas Tirith level, you use a catapault to destroy a siege tower, but for the next two, there are no catapaults, and it took me eight replays before I realized that I could destroy the towers with my ranged attack.  Likewise, on the Crack of Doom, it took me forever to figure out how to defeat the final boss (You have to knock him/her/it over the ledge, then use a finishing move).  Another little complaint is that on the Shelob's lair level, it starts out great because you can hear Frodo calling for help and fighting something big far away while you try to reach him, but the game ruins the suspense halfway through the level when it shows Shelob in all her glory (I think she isint big enought).  Also, why are orcs camping out in Shelobs tunnels?  It wouldent make any sense in the movie if Frodo was running from Shelob, only to encounter orcs having a campfire in the middle of this evil spider infested cave.  Another thing is that while you can replay any level with any charachter, the game does not modify the cutscenes with the other charachters.  In the cutscenes, the new charachter you play as is standing still, and dosent do a thing.  An example of this is in the Shelob battle, when Sam stabs Shelob in the eye.  If you are not playing as Sam, then Shelobs eye will suddenly pop on its own.  It would be great if it showed all the charachters doing the actions, but it dosent, and that is disapointing.Aside from those complaints, this game is awesome and a lot of fun to play.  I havent played the game on Two player mode, so I can't review that.  But if you are a fan of the movie, you will probably love this.  Highly recommended.The Good:Fantastic graphicseasy controlsgreat to play the movieGreat Replay featuresThe bad:You cannot fight the Witch kingShelob is not big enoughOrcs having campfires in Shelobs lair?!?Cutscenes not modified for additional charachtersBottom line:  A fantastic game, with a few disapointments.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2003"}

{"product_name":"B000BGPGU2","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Sandoc \"sussarakhen\"","summary":"One of the best rpgs, if not one of the best games of the last decade","reviewText":"The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (now that's a mouthful of a game title) was suppose to be set for release at the Xbox360's launch day of November 18, 2005. It was to be one of the 360's launch day crown jewels. Instead the game was delayed by Bethesda Software as they deemed it needed abit more polishing and work. There were quite abit of disappointed gamers who'd been waiting for almost 4 years for this nextgen sequel to the best-selling and quite popular The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and its expansion packs. Now, after 4 months of delays, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion has been released to the gaming public and the many delays was well worth the wait. Oblivion has turned out to be an excellent, fun and engaging roleplaying game that improves on what made Morrowind such as success and fixing the previous game's inherent flaws.First off, Oblivion could be enjoyed by both Elder Scroll veteran gamers and new players to the series. Like the three previous games in the series, Oblivion takes place in the medieval fantasy world of Tamriel. Similar to the Japanese rpg franchise Suikoden, The Elder Scrolls game could be played without having played the previous titles in the series as each game works both as a continuation of the growing mythology of Tamriel, but at the same time a storyline which works as a stand-alone. Oblivion's storyline, or main quest as some would call it, involves the search for the long-lost heir of the recently assassinated Emperor of the Kingdom of Cyrodiil. The search for this heir would spell either the success of your character's journey to becoming hero of Cyrodiil for helping close the Oblivion Gates popping up all over Cyrodiil, or failing in that be destroyed with the rest of the kingdom. The main quest will take a dedicated gamer somewhere between 25-40 hours to complete and that alone is worthy of this game's purchase. But like Morrowind before it, Oblivion is not just about the main quest. Oblivion is a sandbox-type of game where the player is given free rein on what they should do. The main quest would be there for the player to work on, but they could also delay working on it to explore the huge realm of Cyrodiil and perform the 200 or so sidequests ranging from guildquests, city quests, and freeform quests. I went 100 hours from the day I bought the game before I even began to work on the main quest. But then the beauty of the game comes form the fact that each player could play the game however they want.Just like the Grand Theft Auto games, Oblivion's gameplay is non-linear, but unlike Grand Theft Auto the gameplay and its many sidequest helps introduce the player to the rich and expansive world of Cyrodiil and Tamriel as a whole. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion took the open-ended gameplay of Morrowind, ran with it and made it simpler and less daunting by allowing for a simple journal log which kept track of all active, current and completed quests taken in by the player. Unlike Morriwind where a player played 15-20 hours before they even figured out what their main quest was supposed to be, Oblivion starts off the player with the main quest. This change in gameplay puts Oblivion heads and shoulders above its predecessor and makes the game much more accessible to the more casual gamer who in the past would've been intimidated by a large, complex game like Morrowind. And unlike other rpgs franchises like Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Wild Arms just to name a few, Oblivion doesn't end when a player finishes the main quest. Unless a player has done and finished every sidequest there is in the game, Oblivion continues well after one has found the heir to the throne, closed the Oblivion gates and saved Cyrodiil. Bethesda has already announced that they will continue to extend the game's lifespan by releasing new official questlines through Xbox Live download content. I like to characterize Oblivion as a Massive Multiplayer Online RPG (MMORPG), but without the Multiplayer Online part. In fact, Oblivion's more of an rpg than other MMORPG's like Final Fantasy XI, World of Warcraft and Guild Wars.Second, Oblivion sports one of the most comprehensive character creation of any roleplaying game in the history of console gaming. The character creation doesn't begin at the start of the game but during the tutorial section which also acts as the first act of the all-encompassing main quest storyline. A player goes through this first part of the game learning the game mechanics and controls during a very hands-on journey through the Imperial City's sewer and catacombs. How a player goes about playing this stage helps the game come up with recommended classes for the player to choose from. But a player could bypass these recommendations and create a custom class of their own. Doing so they would be prompted to pick one of the 10 different races (4 human types, 3 elf types, and 3 creature types), then following it up with one of a dozen different birth signs (gives bonuses to attributes like Strenght, Intelligence, etc...), and finishing it off by choosing seven major skills that when levelled up ten times gives the player one full character level. If that wasn't enough the player then could then come up with a custom class name that only a player's imagination could limit in variety.For all micromanaging players out there, Oblivion's character generator also allows for the player to alter, adjust and manipulate their character's facial and head details. From how the eyebrows look to the size and shape of the lips, chins, cheekbones and nose. Oblivion's character generator allows a player to almost create a character who could look like the player themselves or some other person they know. All it takes is time and dedication from working the sliders to get the right look. If a player wanted their character to look like Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn they could do so with time and effort. If they want their character to look like them then they could try and make it happen. The possiblities are endless and again only limited by one's imagination.Third, Oblivion surely helps usher in the nextgen gaming promised by the gaming industry in 2005. The graphics in Oblivion bar none have to be one of the best looking. Bethesda's programmers and developers really take full advantage of the Xbox360's processing power as it gives the player a rich, lush and believable fantasy world. All of this done in full high-definition. Even when played on a standard TV, Oblivion is great to look at but it's with a HDTV that its beauty could truly be seen in full view and appreciated. From the sunlight and moonlight reflecting off the water surfaces of rivers, lakes and even just puddles of water after a thunderstorm to the swaying blades of grass that move with the wind and moves accurately when disturbed by characters moving through it. Each weapon and pieces of armor show great, fine detail that's also reflected on your player's character. It's not just the gleam and shine of the metal as the light hits them at an angle, but also the etching and rune work done on the gear could be seen from every angle and close-up. If there's to be found a hiccup in Oblivion's graphical beauty its that there's a slight problem of graphic pop-ups and fade-ins of distant images. It's really not enough to take away from the game's beauty, but it's there nonetheless. The PC version also has this problem but moreso if one didn't run the game on a bleeding-edge, hi-powered gaming pc rig.Lastly, there's the audio part of the visual excellence of Oblivion. This game could truly only be played with justice and appreciation on a surround sound system sporting Dolby Digital 5.1. The game has been developed with true DD 5.1 surround sound and it shows at some of the more stealthy and shadowy gameplay aspects of Oblivion. One could here the ambient sounds of nature when exploring out in the field to the background chit-chat of passing npcs on the streets or in dwellings. The surround sound also helps a player when spelunking in caves and dungeons as enemies could be heard sneaking up on your flanks and rear through satellite speakers. The soundtrack to Oblivion was once again composed by premiere game music composer Jeremy Soule who also did Morrowind's excellent soundtrack. There's a hint of Howard Shore's Lord of the Rings to this soundtrack which just helps accentuate the game's epic and fantasy nature.In the end, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion's four year trip from the minds of Bethesda's creative programmers ans developers has been a trip well worth all the delays. Oblivion has turned out to be a massive open-ended roleplaying game that's both fun and enjoyable to fans and non-fans of the genre and the series. Oblivion's a sandbox-type game which Grand Theft Auto wishes it could be and one that's now set the standard very high for other games in its genre to match and surpass. Oblivion has also officially announced the arrival of nextgen gaming with its HD graphics, true surround sound and excellent gameplay which could last a player 25 hours to 200+ or more. It all depends on the player. Oblivion has become the jewel crown in The Elder Scrolls saga and has become of the best rpgs ever, if not one of the best games of the last decade or more.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2006"}

I like the frequent display of situational statistics.+ My Player mode is a lot of fun and the first-person fielding is far better than MLB The Show.The Bad:- Online play is horrible.  The lag time was so bad that I needed to start my swing just as the ball was leaving the pitcher's hand.  Here's an idea, 2K Sports: don't offer online play.  Honestly, I got four hits in an online game, only because I just gave up on swinging and started bunting every time.  It was the worst online gaming experience I have ever had. The only benefits of an Internet connection with this game are MLB Today and Living Rosters.- When playing My Player, many achievements, such as trucking the catcher and hitting three home runs in a game, are reserved for other modes (although it doesn't clearly explain that). Also, I played two seasons on My Player and the only achievement left for me to earn is making the Hall of Fame; no way I'm going to play a bunch of seasons to pursue 80 points.I've read reviews in which people report game freezes, but I've played two seasons in My Player and about 15 games in Franchise and have had no freezes.This game is definitely worth buying if you're into Franchise or My Player, but if you're looking for something to play online, this is not it.  I'm happy with my purchase, but until I read rave reviews about a future MLB 2K game I won't buy another.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2010"}

If you need tutorials or frequent save spots, just walk away. This game is not for you. It even tells you that YOU WILL DIE. And you will.Story: Dark Souls doesn't really have a story, that is left up to you. The basics are that when the world was formed, dragons ruled. Humans eventually were born, found 'The Flame' and rose up against the dragons. They were successful, but at a price. The flames that supported them soon began to die and humans began becoming creatures that are simply called 'Hollow', mindless husks of their former self. You, like all undead (those who are not Human nor Hollow), are imprisoned as to try and stop the spread of the Darksign and set out on a pilgrimage to relight the flame.Graphics: The graphics in Dark Souls are dark, depressing and dank. Which is good for this game as it gives you the feeling of dread and despair, which fits perfectly with this world. Textures look well done and special effects are rare, but done well. Foliage is done very well also, and you'll spend a fair amount of time in it.Controls: Controls are rather basic, you get a few slots for spells, while other buttons will have you attack, roll, defend, etc. If you've played any sort of action adventure RPG game, you'll feel comfortable with the controls.Voice/Music/Sound: There isn't much with voicing here, a few NPCs will talk when talked to, but they aren't frequent. Music and Sound however, are commonplace and are pleasing. Music can range from a low background sound to dramatic when facing bosses, but most of the time you'll be able to play without suffering from overbearing music. Sounds, such as walking, running, water, etc are also done to the same quality.Other: There is a small amount of online play in Dark Souls as well. This comes in two forms, the co-op and versus. Co-op is playable after obtaining a certain item and allows other players to summon you into their world (or them into yours if you are human), this allows for more than one person to fight bosses. HOWEVER, if you've already beaten an areas boss, you cannot summon in that area.Versus varies, normally, anyone who is a human can be invaded by another player, the two fight until one dies. Joining certain alliances will give you the ability to fight others who attempt to harm that alliances key members or protect an alliances territory. This is only possible though if you are in human form.Overall: Dark Souls is a very tough, yet very rewarding game for those who have the skill to conquer it. Memorable characters and gameplay have earned it many awards and a sequel in the making.Pros:- Tough and rewarding- Unique gameplay- Worth the frustrationCons:- Tough (but rewarding)- Weak online- Sometimes feels TOO distant, deserted","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"D","summary":"The PS4 is a very great console so far but is it worth the hype?","reviewText":"The PS4 was released late in 2013 and has become one of the quickest selling consoles at launch and within its first few months of all time.  Obviously this means the console had a lot of hype around it, but is the hype worth it?I think its a very great console for being its first year. First years in a new consoles life are usually a little rough and company's typically have a stronger focus on selling the system and getting it out there rather than actually focusing on the games. However within the first few months since its release we have seen plenty of games so far. My only problem is that there have been to many ps3 ports. I really recommend getting infamous second sun as that is the best title on the system that I played since launch and is only available on ps4 and pretty much shows what the system can do. I will probably have a review on that very soon so feel free to check it out. The other games I have on the system are thief, tomb raider definitive addition, killzone shadows fall, trails fusion, and pinball arcade. although the games are limited in number there all really well done even though right now most of these are playable on ps3. Give them some time and there will be plenty more ps4 exclusives though so if your waiting on them your probably better off waiting tell next year before purchasing the system.Now the important question, is this going from a Nintendo to a super Nintendo or is this just barely an upgrade to the previous consoles? Graphically speaking its way to early to tell just yet however I don't think its quite a big of leap as the other console generations have been. The main reason for this console generation is to have a affordable way to keep up with pc gaming. Which graphically is probably just as good as this console if not a little better if  you have a couple grand to spend. You see if the had not released this console company's would have to downgrade all there games for ps3 and 360 and cut out a lot of things unless the kept it pc exclusive. (very few games do these days).Of coarse there is some new features as well that separates it from the ps3 and the other systems like the controller. I think it is a mass improvement over all the previous PlayStation controllers which have pretty much stayed the same since the added the joysticks. Gone is the select button for the first time since the atari joysticks and is replaced with a share button. The share button lets you record gameplay and upload it to Facebook, YouTube and all that good stuff. Which is kinda a big deal considering  it used to be a pain to record off game consoles without owning multiple hundred dollar equipment. The ps4 is also more integrated into Facebook which you can thankfully turn off so you don't spam people with a 1000 different \"I played infamous today\" posts but it is there for people that want it though. Also whats new with the controller is the *EXTREMELY* bright led light. Its default color is blue however when playing some games its color changes with the situation (blue when enemy's not alerted, red when the are, etc).There are some downsides to upgrading to the ps4 however. If you plan to play online for free you will be disappointed as it forces playstation plus on you which is the main reason I put 4 stars instead of 5. However Playstation plus does get you some free games every now and again so that almost kinda makes up for it. That and if you plan to play mp3s and import cds you will be disappointed  as well as the only way at the time of this review to listen to music is to subscribe to music unlimited. This however is supposed to be changed eventually and hopefully as music unlimited is missing a lot of good songs and it costs $10 a month. With that being said however from the free trail I've used its a real nice service that allows you to play songs while playing games with the ability to adjust the volume on the music without turning down the tv so you can still hear the people talking in a game. Also even though apparently you will be able to stream older playstation games through the playstation now the console is not backwards compatible with any previous playstation systems 1-3, psp, vita.Anyway while the system is missing a lot of great features its still a great console to game on. Which is essentially what its here to do its more streamlined and has a more focused point on gaming  which is what video game consoles where originally made for. Comparing this to the other systems I have not played a Xbox one nor do I plan to any time soon but I also own a Wii u. I would recommend getting both systems as the both have there on strengths and weaknesses if you are able to do so.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2014"}

Rhodes","summary":"One of Finer Fantasies","reviewText":"After a long wait, Final Fantasy XII is finally here, after such a long wait.  Everything about it shines.  From it's deep storyline, to its fantastic and complex gameplay.  All worries aside, Final Fantasy XII is a keeper.The Archadian Empire has taken over the Kingdom of Dalmasca.  The King has been assissnated and the princess is presumed dead.  The people of Dalmasca are displeased with the Empire, especially a young boy named Vaan who believes it is up to him to take Dalmasca back.  Luckily, he's not alone.  There's an entire resistence group out there that are willing to help him out.  The storyline of Final Fantasy XII is different from all the Final Fantasy games.  For one, it relies far more heavily on its political drama and philosophical intrigue.  What you get from Final Fantasy XII isn't a huge epic story in scope, but rather a drama that unfolds.  It's a different way to tell the story for Final Fantasy, but here it actually works.  It's still got some good twists and it is somewhat deep, but don't expect something along the lines of previous installments such as Final Fantasy X or VII.  It doesn't have the most memorable ensemble cast either, but you do, for the most part, like the characters.What many fans are most concerned about when it comes to this new installment is the battle system itself.  It strays away from the series roots. It is no longer the ATB style battles we've been used to since Final Fantasy IV.  Instead it's Active Dimension battle.  All enemies in any given area of a dungeon are present at all times and will charge you upon seeing you.You can free roam through any area, and so can your enemies.  As your characters approach an enemy they pull out their weapons and you can begin to issue attacks.  You can only play as one character at a time, but you can still issue orders to other characters if you want.  Since all enemies are present on the map at one time, running away can be a hassle.  Enemies will give chase, and some enemies will even join in the battle.The combat has a couple of downsides.  For one, getting money is downright painful and repetitive.  Your enemies don't drop money, and when they do it's not a lot.  Instead you'll be forced to sell the items they drop.  This wouldn't be a problem if stuff wasn't so expensive, and if the items dropped by enemies didn't sell for so little.  Also, dungeon maps are huge.  It's easy to get lost and overshoot your objective sometimes, even with the ingame map provided.This wouldn't be Final Fantasy without some complexity to the battle system, though.  First, there is the game's complex AI system called \"Gambits.\"  Gambits allow you t customize what your characters do in battle.  You can set your characters up to attack, or you can get more complex and have them heal anyone whose HP falls below a certain percentile.  Once you get used to the Gambit system, however, it's really easy to take advantage of.  To the point where Final Fantasy XII becomes a cakewalk.  Even worse, if you set them up too well, you'll find that the only thing you ever have to do is move around the left analog stick.  It is entirely possible to track through Final Fantasy XII never having to open up the menu.Then there's the license point system.  As you battle through the game you'll earn license points which can be spent on the license board.  This helps to determine what spells, abilities and even weapon and armor characters can use.  Yes, that's right, weapons and armor.  You cannot use a certain weapon unless you have a \"license\" to do so.  There's nothing too complex about this and it suffers from its own little issue, the fact that in the end every character is the same.Let's be honest on one more thing... for some Final Fantasy XII just might not be a lot of fun to play.  The aspect of no random battles is nice, but take advantage of the gambit system, and Final Fantasy XII becomes a game that, for the most part, feels one-dimensional.  The complexity is nice, but gambits can make the player feel like he's doing little to participate.  What it amounts to is basically you moving around the left analog stick while your characters automatically carry out their own actions in battle.  There are times when Final Fantasy XII can feel monotonous as a result.  That's not to say you won't have fun, it's only to say that battling won't keep you as engaged for long.  Especially when every character can so easily learn everything.  The dungeons being so big doesn't help this.  They've made big so that you will battle.  And while the battle system isn't really bad in anyway, it can definitely be annoying to find that Square-Enix made a dungeon huge for the sake of padding out the length.Graphic-wise, Final Fantasy XII is fantastic.  The towns are detailed, and so are your characters.  The fact that each town has so many unique looking characters on screen at once is an impressive feat.  The game also sounds lovely.  Even better is the games artistic design.  Towns are breathtaking.  The game also sounds good.  The voice acting isn't the best in the world, but it does manage to be good in many areas.Perhaps Final Fantasy XII suffers most in the story department.  It's a good story, but the game doesn't spend a lot of time focusing on it.  It gets off to a great start, but at some point the game just becomes so devoid of it that it's easy to lose interest in what may have been one of the series more interesting stories.  Around the mid point of the game, the story takes a backseat, with developments coming further between.  It's refusal to focus too much on its characters doesn't help this.  It picks up again in the end and makes for a good story overall, but there's so much to Final Fantasy XII that just doesn't focus on it.  What makes the story good is how well written and how cinematic each of the cutscenes becomes.  When you get one of these in depth moments into the story it's really engaging and really good.  The problem is just that for so long this doesn't happen much.  The world of Ivalice is definitely beating with a pulse, though.  Running through towns and seeing the vast populations really brings things to life.  It's just a shame Final Fantasy XII couldn't have a more lively story.The Good+Fantastic Graphics+Good storyline+The new battle system is complex+Tons of side quests and secrets to keep you busy for hours+Beautiful soundtrack+Well done voicesThe Bad-Dungeons are huge and save points are few and far between-The battle system is too easy to take advantage of-The license board will eventually make every character the same-While the story is good overall, there certainly isn't too much focus on it","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2006"}

But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world.

That makes the world feels kinda lonely. Leveling up is based on your style of playing. So, some skills would be developed fast while others may not go up at all. This could be bad if you'd like to try different things but couldn't change your play-style that much. And the character levels up so very slow that it could make you feel unrewarding and unaddictive. Some quests are annoying and boring.But when it's fun, it's fun. And when your skills develop to the significant point, they're fun to use.You have to really be patient with its sluggishly-slow pace and a weird leveling-up system. This game bored me to tears as much as kept me playing. Fallout 3 is much more well-paced and addictive. So 4 stars for over-all and 3.5 for the fun.In conclusion, it's slow and has significant boring portions. Still, It's a good RPG to add to your library of games, especially for its price now.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2009"}

A LOT.  This game met my expectations, but it didn't feel like an overachievement or anything.  It just met the standards really.Pros1.  The story is about the same as last game except your introduced to a new enemy with the same objective in all retrospect lol.  There is plenty of character depth in this game plus a good share of boss fights.2.  I felt this story was much darker then the last game, and more mature for sure.  I only hope they keep with this trend in this series because I like that.Cons1.  Sephiroth is much weaker in this game, and that royally pissed me because he was so hard to beat in this first one.  Maybe I am just a better gamer haha.2.  I felt like there was no sidequests, and barely any hidden bosses like last game and I hate when developers do that the first time and switch up the formula.3.  I was hoping to have more characters in my party at all times, but I guess thats not possible to do.Overall this was good game.  I was just hoping for some new stuff plus keeping the old stuff as well.

{"product_name":"B0017HW5LM","description":"Get your hands dirty in the early stages of the epic battle between UNSC and Covenant. Developed by Ensemble Studios,Halo Warsfor Xbox 360&nbsp;brings all the drama of a real-time strategy game to the popular Halo Universe. Set in the year 2531, before the initial Halo first-person shooter game, this game lets you control the human armies of UNSC in a whole new way..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; }Play as UNSC or Covenant and exploit your faction's unique strengths.View larger.Invade enemy strongholds full of advanced technology.View larger.Find ways to make the detailed environments work for you.View larger.Bring in air support to turn the tide of battle.View larger.Experience the Epic Battle from a New PerspectiveDefense, offense, and the ability to hold down a command center in the face of hostile attacks: there's a lot to think about when laying out tactics for an all-out alien war. Featuring detailed environments and complicated new battle mechanisms, this game demands a different kind of perspective than the first-person shooters from the original Halo series. You'll need to uncover the hidden strengths and weaknesses of each unit and play them to your tactical advantage, and that's just the beginning.UNSC: Be Part of a Legendary ConflictThe story opens with UNSC forces retaking the planet Harvest from the Covenant. At your disposal -- should you choose to take command of UNSC forces -- will be everything from a corps of highly-trained Marines to the Warthogs, Scorpions, and Hornets you'll need for air and land attacks. You'll take stock of the map and decide between holding your ground or advancing on enemy strongholds, all while trying to navigate the local terrain and outsmart Covenant forces. And when you need something extra to tip the tide in your favor, UNSC leaders can provide you with the ability to mobilize highly specialized units or call the Spirit of Fire vessel for support from above.Covenant: A Capable, Playable Enemy FactionThat's right, Covenant is playable in this corner of the Halo universe. This alliance of alien species has manipulated advanced technology, firepower, and tactical prowess into a powerful force that is engaged in a Genocidal war against human race, having branded humans as heretics. With the ability to play as these tough, alien fighters, you'll have advanced shield technology, the modular Citadel at the heart of Covenant's colonizing power, and, of course, the iconic Scarab attack vehicle at your disposal, adding a whole new dimension to your strategic warfare. The Scarab is a terrifying military vehicle crafted from heavy mining equipment. And with a mining laser that delivers massive damage across battlefields large and small, turrets for taking on air attacks, and the ability to clamber over any terrain, what's not to love about commanding Scarabs instead of fighting against them?Developed Exclusively for Xbox 360Most console RTS games are adapted from existing PC games, which can make their controls bulky or awkward, butHalo Warshas been developed for Xbox 360 from the ground up. This means the controls are sensitive, intuitive, and easy-to-operate in the midst of battle. And the UI is just as intuitive, so whether you're managing a unit of marines or a deadly machine, you can focus on creating a battle strategy instead of worrying about how to overcome a clumsy controller.No matter which faction you choose to play as, you can test your skills against those of other players in online skirmishes that allow up to six players with the New Xbox Experience through Xbox LIVE.","reviewerName":"Bowman373","summary":"Excellent Console RTS!","reviewText":"This is such a good game! For those who don't know, Halo Wars is an RTS (Real-Time Strategy) game where you control multiple units from a third-person perspective. You can create bases, build units, move them, and fight with them! The controls are very easy to learn with the tutorials. I highly recommend playing both tutorials (Regular & Advanced) before you play campaign or skirmish. THIS IS A NO SPOILER REVIEW!!!Campaign:This is a very fun and enjoyable campaign! I haven't done the entire thing yet, but I am almost done. The story is great, and it is easy to know what your objective is. Aside from the requirements for the mission in general, there are fairly easy side objectives that can be completed in the mission. There are 15 missions in the campaign, each taking approximately 15-20 minutes each. I had trouble with 2 of the missions, but I looked up online a good strategy. There is a co-op mode for the campaign, which makes hard missions a lot easier (especially if that friend is very good at the game). So overall, the campaign is very fun.Skirmish:Skirmish is a mode where you can play different game modes with different leaders from the UNSC and the Covenant. You can do 1-1, 2-2, and 3-3 games. You can either play by yourself or with your friends against AI enemies. There are 3 UNSC leaders and 3 Covenant leaders, each having different abilities and unique units. With the UNSC, your leader is NOT a general unit. With the Covenant, you can fight with and control your leader. There are tons of maps to choose from! There are 2 DLC packs, but I don't think they're worth buying. They just add a few extra maps. So overall, the skirmish mode is very fun.Multiplayer:Multiplayer is also very fun. You can do the same modes as Skirmish, but just on Xbox LIVE.I generally like the 1-1 matches better because if you're doing 2-2 or 3-3, if one player drops out on your team, it greatly decreases your chance for success. There is a rank-up system in Multiplayer as well. The only problem is that only about 5,000 people play multiplayer, so it's really hard to find a match unless you have lots of friends. So I haven't played multiplayer as much.Overall:Halo Wars is a great RTS that is fun to play and easy to learn how to play. All of the modes are very fun, but I prefer Skirmish over any other. The price is very good on Amazon, and it is very fun to play with a friend. I would highly recommend this to any Halo fan or any RTS fan in general.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2011"}

Assassins Creed 2  offers much much more in terms of depth but the boring repetitive aspects still remain.One big highlight to this game was the graphics were excellent.  While some of the initial levels were not very memorable, the later levels are very unique and exciting.  Venice in particular was flat out awesome.  Since 90% of the game takes place in outside environments this aspect really important.The story was fun and interesting.  In fact it was the story that kept me interested in this game because I always wanted to know what came next.The addition of a home base was also a lot of fun.  I really enjoyed the concept here but felt too limited in what I could really do with it or directions I could take.  All I could really do is fill things in the way it was intended.Missions for the most part were straight forward in that it was clear what you needed to do and where you needed to go.  The mini map was really well done to help keep you on track to make sure you did not miss anything.  I never was left sitting around trying to figure out where I needed to go but rather just how I wanted to get there.  Though it was clear what needed to be done it was partly because you had done similar things 100x over.The combat system while giving some options and a variety of weapons, there really was not much too it.  All the enemies are blocking once their guard is up and you either have to side step an attack or do a counter move.  Even facing 5-6 bad guys you can just go into counter mode and get through it with ease.Now the assassin combat however was much improved.  You can now jump out of hiding and take people out, you can hold onto a ledge and pounce down on somebody or if the bad guy is on the ledge you can surprise them and yank them off.  This was a huge improvement over the first game and made for a lot more fun.The weapons they give you the option to have are nice but I always grabbed the weapon with the best stats.  That would mean most of the time I would never get much action with some of the other weapon types such as maces since you could only carry one at a time.Money is a total joke in the game as others have said.  I ended up buying every single thing I could and never could come close to spending all my money.  The villa home base just keeps dishing out crazy cash and there is simply just not enough things to buy.  At this point I stopped going for money in treasure chests all together as they were a total waste of time.Overall it is a much improved version of the first game but still super repetitive and personally I got really bored after a short amount of time.  I think a game like Batman Arkham is a much better standard for a mix between sneaking around and fighting in both indoor and outdoor environments.  Assassins Creed 2 is good but not great and really not that memorable other than the killer graphics and interesting storyline.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2010"}

It is awesome while you're killing your first victim. Then after you assassinate him, and move onto your second target the game becomes more and more monotonous. Every assassination is the same. Yes there is a slightly different story to them, but the game play is the same. You get on your horse and ride to the town. Then you go to the assassin's bureau, after that you have to scale tall buildings in order to see your investigation missions. And finally after you do them you get to kill the target. The horse riding is extremely boring, as you go through the same patch of land every time, with a slight variation at the end. Also why don't they just give you the investigation missions, why do they make you find them by climbing to 8 high buildings in the city. Also there are mini missions like saving the civilians from the guards. There are only two sets of dialogue, one for the man, and one for the woman. Why couldn't they record another line of dialogue. These missions aren't vital and unless you like to throw your PS3 controller at your TV, I suggest you let the guards have there way with them.The combat system itself is your average hack and slash. Basically you defend and counterattack when they try and hit you. It gets really annoying, because as the game progresses you get caught more and more by the guards. It's downright boring to stab people. Another problem is that sometimes he doesn't stab them, he simply punches them and knocks them down letting them get back up and join the fight. Every assassination you achieve you unlock a new move to add to your list. The game makes you practice the move every time you unlock one. None of these moves are difficult, why must I have a tutorial on them.The story in this game is average. It doesn't really grab you like it could have. There are some great voice actors like Nolan North and Kristen Bell in the game. Unfortunately their performances were in vain, because the story can be explained in one sentence. A rebel assassin is sent out to kill 9 targets, and with each one he begins to question his faith in the creed. There is another part of the story, but I'll leave that for you to find out.While the game looks impressive most of the time, there are some issues. There is constant digital data floating around. This is done on purpose to some how connect to the machine that Desmond uses. It is just distracting in my opinion. The sequel has garnished high reviews and if you are deciding to buy this one or the new one. Don't even hesitate, buy the new one, because the original is a very forgettable, monotonous, and average title.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2010"}

Guberlal","summary":"A rare Capcom bust.","reviewText":"The Gothic thriller taken to new hype. And in that last sentence there is one word that does not belong: Gothic. DMC 2 is essentially Shinobi Redux. There is no story, no mystery, and little more than pressing the buttons to acheive moves.Pros:I strain to find any. But, Disc 2...Lucia's quest is a little better than Dante's. Still has all the cons, though she reminds me of BloodRayne.Cons:1. Lack of a storyline, of any kind.2. The camera angles are so bad that most of the time you are lost or don't know what you are fighting.3. Dante's modeling is from a far distance and the combat is rhetorical at best.4. It mimics Shinobi in most aspects. There's the empty city, deranged tanks and even copies of those hated dogs from Stage 3-A.5. The swordplay was taken directly from Onimusha & Onimusha 2, it's that obvious. But, in this game...the sword will get you killed. It's all guns, no glory.6. Dante is slow. He runs through the city in a crawl-like way and it takes forever to get from one place to another.7. The beginning takes a lot from Tomb Raider and is quite pointless. You don't know where you are in this game and there's nothing to find.8. It takes forever to power-up and there's not enough enemies in a single mission to get you the orbs to power-up.9. The attack method is not similar to the original and The Matrix stunts won't get you the high demon rank.10. Graphics. Twice the graphics, huh? The graphics can't hold a candle to Onimusha 2 in gameplay. The cutscenes aren't anywhere near Onimusha (1 or 2)and there is a scene where Dante slides down a pipe - similar to Final Fantasy X, though far less impressive. The main gameplay is reminiscent of BloodRayne...though...not in its league.Ok, I gave you 10 reasons for the my point. Capcom has been in a frenzy to produce so much this past year and ahead with Resident Evil Zero, RE 1 remake, and RE 4. The company has given us high quality games such as the Onimusha series, the original Devil May Cry and others. This leads me to believe that this DMC was overhyped and underdeveloped.This wasn't intended as a bash review and I didn't want to write it in that way, honestly. I looked forward to this game for so long. My suggestion is that you rent this one first, see if you like it, and during that week rental...surely you can pick up the game if you are into it. I'm sorry fellow gamers, but the hype doesn't fit the game. This is not Devil May Cry...it's a confusing mess. It is not Gothic, not dark, and holds no bearing to the namesake.I'll probably get a lot of unhelpful votes from the hardcore, but I'm in the top 5000 reviewers (feel free to check my rank) and I won't steer you wrong.Robert Eldridge (...)","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2003"}

I played Max payne one and two, and both games have some striking similarities.

One thing Max did not have, was Shadow, the faithful k9.I just finished this game a few days ago, and I'll be honest..for me, this was one of the most challenging games I have played for a while.

I learned a lot about not just throttling every race and hoping for the best.

I like that there's a variety of race types and challenges along the way.  Being able to skip around is really nice too because I found if I went to a different location and raced a different type or race I could come back to whatever I was having trouble with instead of having to just push through and be frustrated.The graphics are great.  No real hangups at all with the quality of the game or the controls.  Maybe it's not totally realistic, but there's a lot of variety.

{"product_name":"B002BSA3EM","reviewerName":"Shannon B Davis \"Nepenthe\"","summary":"fun mini-games but game dishes out a \"tough love\" message that some may not want to hear","reviewText":"After having owned the Wii Fit Plus for two months now, I would like to update my review.  The Wii Fit continues to deliver fun to my household.  After two months, everyone in my family still jumps onto it almost every day to do a body test, and play a few games.  We've also used it as a party game, using the multiplayer to entertain a multi-aged group from a preschooler through adults.  I recently read that while the Wii Fit isn't a true workout, its goal isn't that - the goal is to get people off the couch and moving.  To that end, it's great and it's appropriate for all ages.The strength of this title is in its fun mini-games, if you see them as physical games rather than a \"workout\".  If that's what you're looking for, you're going to love it.  It's a great way to get the whole family involved in an active activity, one that you can do inside on a rainy day.  After all, anything you do standing up burns more calories than sitting down, which is why I have always used my Wii standing up since I bought it.  You can use the balance board for other Wii-based fitness titles, so whether you enjoy this game or not, you do get the balance board.  Most of my review, however, will be about the game.  In brief, the balance board is an amazing piece of technology and I have no criticism of it.The balance games are lots of fun.  I consider myself to have excellent balance - and indeed - I score very high on a single leg balance, but these games are really challenging.  It's an interesting idea to play the equivalent of a marble balance game, only you are the marble - or in some cases - the board.  Balance Bubble and Obstacle Course are two of my favorite mini-games.  Balance Bubble detects shifts in your balance as you guide a delicate bubble down a watercourse without getting popped.  Obstacle Course has you running and jumping, almost like a live Super Mario Bros.  I am also a yoga enthusiast, and I did feel that the yoga segments led me to have better form through the awareness of my balance.  The hula hoop game was far more fun than real hula hoop, where I spend most of my time picking up the hoop again.  Another great minigame is Island Cycling, where you cycle through an item picking up flags, trying to find the shortest route.  Most of the games engage your mind as well as your body, which is perhaps the reason why we keep coming back to play. Some of the strength workouts were very challenging, such as the pushup and side plank. Overall, the minigames that make up the workouts are a lot of fun.I definitely can see how this game is appropriate for older adults, as I've heard it recommended for them. There is a focus on safety, and the activities start out very easy.  The game will suggest that you get help or lean up against a wall.  The workouts are not very long, and  they might just be at the right level for a new exerciser who wants to improve their fitness.  For someone that works out all the time, these workouts are not that challenging.  I did not sweat, for example, as I do with EA Active from time to time.  I also found my heart stopped pumping as fast when an activity would end and I'd have to pick the next one.  I use other Wii games and exercise videos for my real workout, but that doesn't stop me from spending 5-15 minutes every day with my Wii Fit.  I may not be burning a lot of calories, but I've become very competitive with my family members on certain minigames.And that's certainly a motivating factor on the Wii Fit.  You can see your scores stacked up against other people in your family. The game truly involves the whole family.  It will ask me why my spouse hasn't been around lately.  Plus, you can use the Wii Fit Plus for BabyStats (weighing your baby) and PetStats.  We don't have a pet, but I do have an infant.  The Wii Fit Plus has really cute \"messages\" for your baby, like \"Don't eat things that are on the floor.\"  I come back every day to compete against myself, in the Body Test, but I also come back to make sure I maintain my top score in Balance Bubble!The game is certainly cute in that trademark Nintendo way.  You are represented by your Mii, and the workouts take out in cute locations. The graphics are not equal to anything you'd see on other game systems or even other games - but they don't have to be.  You get the point, and besides, it's quite cheery. For example, the running activity actually takes you on a jog outside on an attractive island.  The Kung Fu fighting game takes place in a mountaintop temple.However, with all these pluses in the Wii Fit Plus, there are some downsides - or at least some people may see them as downsides.  The game starts out with a big wake-up call about your weight, but not all users necessarily need to hear it. When I started the game, I was only three months postpartum and was in the process of losing the baby weight at the slow recommended pace, through breastfeeding, diet and exercise.  I feel pretty fit and work out a lot.  So, having the game tell me \"dah dah dah dah - You're Overweight!\" was a message I was quite familiar with but not looking to have it rubbed in.  You may choose to skip the daily body test,  but the game will nag you and then you can be told you're overweight every day.  It adjusts the avatar from skinny to fat to demonstrate how you supposedly look (and nevermind your T&A; - all the Miis are apple-shaped).  Next, I was presented with a balance game that I had never seen before.  I didn't quite understand it, so next I hear that my Wii Age is \"51\", two decades older than I actually am.  Then the game suggested that I lower my BMI to 22, when I have always been happy at around 23 and am aiming to get back there.  24 and lower is considered healthy, and that's not even considering that BMI is irrelevant to athletes.  So, I'm not a big fan of the negative reinforcement.  My best friend was visiting but before we could create her an account to play with us, she had to go through the body test.  It actually bummed her out, because like me, she's fit but she also spends much of life dieting and exercising to stay that way. Like many women, she has a complex about her body!  I did find out later that you can play the multiplayer Wii with Guest users and not subject your friends to the Body Test.  If someone were recovering from an eating disorder, this game's focus on weight alone as a meter of fitness could be a dangerous thing.  The plucky little Wii board character that gives you tips and tricks comes across, to me, as condescending.  For example, I may have done a five mile run the day before, and not got on my Wii.  So, I'll hear a message about how I should work out every day and not skip days.  The Wii Fit is a bit self-centered, not realizing that you may have other workout routines that do not involve it!  Also, it nudges you about your family members.  My best friend came to visit and played on the Wii with me, as I previously mentioned.  She lives three hours away, so she hasn't logged in since then - now the Wii asks me every day how G is doing and why she isn't playing!Ironically, it's not much of a workout so the Wii Fit itself won't be contributing much to my bottom line so to speak.  As I said, EA Active and some other exercise videos and fitness activities will do more for that.  So that's why I feel it oversteps its bounds in that area.  I wish it was just minigames.EA Sports Activecould stand to pick up some of these features!  I do love Wii Fitness Coach, which can build up to be a really hard workout (i.e. breathing hard, sore the next day from the strength training).  I've also heard that Jillian Michael's  Fitness  Ultimatum is a good game, although I haven't tried it.  So of all the wii-based fitness titles, the Wii Fit Plus is probably the least of a workout.  However, it's the most like a game, and therefore may keep people's attention better, especially kids.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXQ12","description":"","reviewerName":"Alexander Lucard","summary":"Another Mediocre Move Game","reviewText":"I haven't really been impressed by the games that use Playstation Move yet. I enjoyedSony Get Fit With Mel B, Singstar Dance and Captain Morgane and the Golden Turtle, but everything else that uses Move has been lackluster at best. Because I enjoyed Singstar Dance, I thought I would find Everybody Dance just as entertaining. After all, I like singing and dancing. Unfortunately, Everybody Dance hasn't a mix of karoke and dance. It is pretty much just dance. Even worse, like most Ubisoft dance games, the scoring and actual attention to one's dances moves are bit of an illusion. The game just arbitatrily scores you. However, if you're playing a dance game for a score...you're doing it wrong. At the same time, Ubisoft's dance titles are far more of a shell game than a video game and it's about as much a game as dancing in a club or to Sweating to the Oldies with Richard Simmons. As the game doesn't actually track how you do and merely randomly says the equivalent of \"Good Lob!\" when you're not moving and then scolds you when you actuall are...well, there's something wrong there.Then there's the actual tracks included with the game. I can't say I cared for too many of them. Unlike Singstar's massive library, Everybody Dance doesn't have too much to it. When the only songs I liked were by Billy Idol and Elton John...there's something wrong there as well.All in all, as a video game, Everybody Dance is a sub-par affair that is less a video game than it is the illusion of one. As well, the track listing isn't to my cup of tea, but mileage may vary. If you like the track listing and don't care that the game just kind of dispenses points randomly rather than based on how well you are able to ape the moves displayed on your screen, you'll probably have more fun with this than I did.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2012"}

It is a game of intense action, atmosphere and involves some strategy and choices.As with any game there are positives and negatives...let me explainThe Pros:1.)A great selection of weapons and ammo (with the better ones becoming available as you proceed in the game). Some are better than others and some are quite heavy (you have a limit to how much you can carry).2.)Different armor is also available at different points in the game.3.)Realistic \"fog of war\" occurrences; weapons jam (with increasing frequency as they become worn); your player tires and gets hungry affecting his ability to perform.4.)Great atmosphere; spooky ambient lighting in dark halls and tunnels, in the outdoors you have rain, lightening and night time; and then there are always the unexpected attacks (anywhere) by an assortment of men, animals and mutants.5.)Enemy AI that is realistic: their guns need reloading and occasionally jam; they hide behind objects when shot at; they sneak up from the unseen side; animals attack in packs and from behind while one or two distract you from the front. All in all an enemy that appears to \"think\" about what it's doing instead of just standing there and blasting away at you.6.)Although the game requires you to the complete main missions to proceed in the game, you can roam around the country side unrestricted. As a bonus,  however, there are several side missions that you can do (these are optional and not required to finish the game but may give you substantial rewards in money or items)7.)Easy save and load feature.8.)3 different endings, depending on the choices you make near the end of the game.9.)Some re-playability; you may want to try different endings, side missions and other weapons and armor.10.)Many hours of intense, hectic game play.Cons:1.)You'll need fairly good hardware and lots of RAM to run this game as it was meant to be played.2.)No vehicles to ride for battle or transportation purposes. (and annoyingly, towards the end, you must walk back almost to the starting point to get an important piece of info) or you can't get into the last 2 endings.3.)Maybe, just maybe a little too hard even on novice (especially towards the latter part of the game).4.)You'll need at least 9GB of disc space to load this game.5.)I found there were occasional crashes or freeze ups after long periods of play.Suggestions; (SPOILER)1.)Early on, go to \"Dark Valley\"; this will give you a chance toa.)obtain a sniper scope (useful a little later) andb.)while here, do a side mission that requires you to \"rescue a fighter's friend\" (here you'll find, in the same building as the \"friend\" (but in another room), a piece of great armor and many useful and powerful \"artifacts\".2.)Take every bandage you find; medkits will heal wounds but do not stop bleeding (and if you don't stop bleeding, well...you bleed to death).Conclusion:This was a game that I really enjoyed (even though the novice level could be a real challenge at times); it featured my favorite type of game, that being, a FPS with some RPG upgrades. If you liked such games as Deus Ex,  System Shock or Dark Messiah, I'm sure you'll pleased with this game. 5 Stars.R. Nicholson","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2007"}

Maybe just as an upgraded PS2 graphic engine.Now to the game itself, people complain whine & complain about the linearity in this game the story is too boring, maybe you just cant follow it right. Square came out with worse FF games then FFXIII. Try FFXI.. its online... possibly only. Yeah, huge fail there Square FF was an RPG not MMORPG. Didn't even get to play that game. It costs money to buy the game then it costs money just to PLAY IT! Try, FFXII.. story was just too short.. as apposed to the 10-12 hour long FFX story, FFXII was only 5 hrs long. (My hours til end of the game. FFX: 70 hrs FFXII: 40)FFXIII: 72 hours. (i didn't time the story scenes this time)For the people who thought this game was a complete snore, try the story for FFX. It took me 3 times to watch the story before i finally got it down (a friend had to point out a few things about the story). I was actually impressed by FFXIII's story, something i haven't seen since FFVII. It wasn't a love story like FFVIII or FFX (although FFX was a bit more religious/culture based) FFXIII is centered around fear, despair & umm.. betrayal? Well i think it hints that i thought it had more of the elements from what FFIV, VI, & VII had. Which makes those games my favorite ones. I did take a vacation when i played this one so i understood the story alot better then when i was playing for 3 hours per day or every other day (depending on my schedule). Although now that im at the end i feel like i need another playthrough just to get that feel again & to rewatch it incased i missed something (well most likely non important). I finally understood the I'Cie & all the other meanings.. well did for awhile but now i need to play it again haha. Which to me adds to the replay value. I loved this story & to me it was memorable. It only took Square 13 years & several games to get the story to that classic FF feel. At least thats what i noticed, although i think most people who were fans of older FF games probablly spent too much time crying over the linearity.(a little minor spoiler here)Ok onto the gameplay, those who think this game is not an RPG is not following the storyline. There are no towns, no people to talk to because your on the run. Hmmm, if i was a fugitive where would i hide. Maybe a town? No.. coudln't do that because if i did i would be caught. If you bothered to play through half of the game, both characters you are switching back & forth DO GET CAUGHT IN A TOWN! The first town they go to as well. It was so damn predicable too. I was thinking wow, they're fugitives on the run they'd be stupid to go to any towns. Sure enough they did & they got caught. The gameplay looks so gloomy, you feel trapped like your in a linear path (which litterly you are in).. well i looked on the positive side of this.. you only got one straight path that is so narrow i even felt claustrophobic. Again.. that's Square's genious for you. The characters in the game felt claustrophobic too, or felt trapped rather. The whole world wants them dead, Lighting & the others feel like there is just no escape, no where to run. Well.. infact Square must have done an amazing job then. I got my $90 worth. If you don't like watching movies or don't really get into them then this game might not be for you. Square has always done awesome FF games & kid you not.. even they did excellent with the other games as well. I just really hated the junctioning system in FFVIII. Really badly. I wanted to take Squalls gun & shoot the junctioning system.Again, when playing through the first part of the game i felt like i was in a school full of nerds. The junctioning system seems like a math thing where you just have to draw the right amount of magic when & where while the strategy guide tells you nothing on magic hoarding. Well.. um maybe it does? But still found it awkward & more annoying then the materia setup. At least i understood how materia worked. I even found a limit on how much you can carry. Hint: Yuffie only steals a set amount.. if you hoard lots of good materia she will only steal part of it, i found this out 2nd time i played through i didn't have any materia 2nd time through. The first time i bought every kind of materia for every character in my party. 2nd playthrough i didn't do it as much.. realized that Yuffie can only carry so much or steal so much.Anyways, i was on the floor laughing at the guy who thought the music for FFXIII sounded too much like elevator music. Even funnier, there is a part in chapter 11 (depending if you explore like crazy) where the music is elevator music!! I felt out of place.. like lost.. lol maybe i got to a section of the game where supossably the characters felt lost? Ha either that Square just added that track in just to amuse people. Anyways this game is amazing! It's different.. but amazing! Some may find this game boring or too linear but umm yea thats your call. For those who don't think this game is an RPG, go back to lerning school. Or look it up in the dictionary. If you still don't think this is an RPG then i don't know man, if towns & people & non linearity is a must in RPGs you won't like this game much. For me, RPG's are stories that your playing through to get the feel of the character. If you understand the story somewhat then you might get a feel for what the character might be feeling. That's a true RPG game in my book!Its just a matter of opinion (you'll see a bit of a rant in the comment section below)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0002CHJAA","reviewerName":"citan-uzuki \"citan-uzuki\"","summary":"Amazing, Truly Amazing!","reviewText":"The Xenosaga series is truly the most amazing and enthralling RPG that I have ever played.  The size and scope of the story being told here is nothing short of epic.  The game play is very good, with a fine balance between solving puzzles, fighting, and cinematics.You can complete this game in less amount of time than the previous game.  However, the battles in this second installment in the series are much harder and much more strategic than in Episode I.  Even minor enemies possess high amounts of HP, and they can also inflict various status effects that must be properly dealt with if you want your battle party to survive.  The pace of the battles are faster though.  Because some of the battles must be completed within a certain time limit, there is an additional surge of adrenaline rush in trying to plan and execute your moves.  The concept of boosting your characters is carried over from the previous game.  However, in this one, there are some tricks involved in using boost.  Four of your characters have the ability to either \"air\" (send an opponent flying in the air) or \"down\" (knock the enemy down).  While the enemy is in such a state, more damage can be inflicted by the next battle character.  But, you would need to boost properly and at the right time in order to put this chain of events together.  Anyway, do not let that discourage you.  The battle system has been simplified.  Also, the character development system has also been greatly simplified.  You do not have the multitude of weapons and armor options here that you had in Episode I.  The types of attacks at your disposal have been narrowed down.  In other words, the learning curve will be less steep.  It seems like the game developers might have wanted to attract a broader range of RPG players to the game.  This may be for the good; however, there are some of us who really enjoy the ability to customize our characters to our specifications.The Mechs play a vital role in this episode.  You must use your mechs (or Gears, for those who have played Xenogears) for certain battles.  The design of the mechs themselves are quite interesting.  It seems that the artists might have taken quite a bit of liberty with their artwork.  Throughout the game, you will have three at your disposal.A new playable character has been added to the main party.  You might recall seeing Jin Uzuki during the ending credits to episode I.  Here, he joins the party for reasons of his own.The cinemas and scenes in the game have really gravitated more towards \"serious\" and \"powerful\".  Yes, there were plenty of powerful and emotional scenes in episode I.  However, here you have a couple of scenes that were just downright heartbreaking.  Definitely, this is a game for a more mature and intelligent crowd.  Our friend Allen is not quite as funny in this one.  You do have plenty of lighthearted moments, however, that soon gives way to the very serious themes that dominate the plot.The sidequests are optional, however, the best features of the game can only be experienced by engaging in them.  The much talked-about Cooperative Attacks (where two characters work together to put a very devastating chain of attacks) can only be earned through the sidequests.  I suspect that you can easily lose 50+ hours in this game, if you engage in a few of those optional sidequests.  I also suspect that there are excellent side stories and adventures to go along with these adventures.  I chose to pursue a couple of them and found them to be worthwhile and entertaining.  Some of these adventures can only be played after you have beaten the game once and saved.  You can then reload your save data and pursue a variety of side stories and quests.A lot of the questions from episode I are answered here for you.  However, most of these answers come towards the end.  All I can say is be prepared for one grand story to unfold.I highly recommend this to anyone interested in RPGs.  Particularly, for those who have an interest in watching a great story unfold.  You will appreciate the story more if you play Episode I first, however, there is a DVD out there with some of the more important and pivotal scenes from episode I.  If you are short on time, perhaps you can locate one of these DVDs and spend a few hours watching them, prior to playing episode II.  Is Xenosaga II: Beyond Good and Evil as good a game as Xenosaga I: Will to Power?  That is a hard question to answer.  That would really have to depend on what you look for in an RPG.  However, let me state that both games are great.  My only wish is that someday, this story will be released in the form of a novel.  The story is just too good.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2005"}
{"product_name":"B004FYJFNA","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Exciting","reviewText":"I have to say right now that playing Mass Effect 3 was hugely enjoyable and addictive and I think everyone should try it.The game is a shining example of everything done right. Basically a continuation of Part 2, you see your character (Commander Shepherd) carry on fighting the Reapers who are now close to destroying the galaxy as we know it. All the familiar elements remain, it's basically a 3rd person, over-the-shoulder action game with lots of combat, exploration and tactical thinking. Interspersed with this is a lot of gear to purchase and customize, plus loads of NPCs to talk to, and even begin romance with.The plot is pretty epic and the dramatic atmosphere just about keeps up with that. Rather than review this game in detail, I would instead just say that if you liked Mass Effect 2, then what are you waiting for? Play it...NOW! And keep your save - you can import the same character. And if you haven't played it first - that's the one you need to buy, followed by this one - there is no point in playing this without playing the other!For me, once I loaded the game up and started it I was totally hooked. I devoured it like a hungry man in front of a slap-up meal. There's just so much to enjoy, awesome detailed graphics, multiple levels to play, hundreds of characters to interact with, many weapons and skills to try out, and of course those all important moral decisions to make, that change the flow of the game.The acting in this game is the best I have come across. Playing with a female Shepard was (for me) hugely affected by the great vocal performance by Jennifer Hale who I can't thank enough for what she added to the experience. But it's all good.I really have very few complaints. There are a few judders and slowdowns on the PS3 but I forgive them. There's been a lot of discussion about the ending, which I can understand - it's not what I expected either, and while the journey to get there is what made the game for me, it would have been nicer to see some acknowledgement for my work in the form of an extended ending as I worked hard to get every drop of support out of every mission and every conversation, but none of that really mattered in the finale. It was also missing the great (and very stressful) decision making prior to the final battle of ME2, where the people you chose to do certain tasks made a difference to the outcome...here it's just a mad dash with whoever were your favourite team members.Anyway none of that changes my recommendation: this is a high pinnacle of achievement in gaming, and I have rarely played anything better. Whatever genres you enjoy, I urge you to give this a try.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SWVIQ","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Cravens \"Loves a good story\"","summary":"Good? Great? Still Dead Space?","reviewText":"Let me just say that after playing the first two games, watching Extraction, playing the iPhone game, and reading both DS novels, it really is difficult to describe just how excited I have been to get my hands on Dead Space 3 and see the conclusion of Isaac's terrifying tale.Dead Space has gone from a sleeper hit that got excellent reviews (I'll never forget the first time I experienced that horrifying noise-intro as the bloody EA logo appeared) to a full-blown AAA title/series that many are calling the \"Resident Evil\" of this generation. So how does Dead Space 3 actually do?I think it's important to address the notion of change within a game series. Typically, when moving through a series or trilogy, developers tend to hit one of two extremes. The next games in line either stay largely the same, often leaving gamers feeling underwhelmed and bored (think BioShock 2 or COD), or the initial formula changes completely, making many gamers feel angry and even betrayed by the developers (think Resident Evil 5-6). The key is that games shouldn't simply change or remain the same; they should evolve -- keeping core elements of the original game while adding on new ones that enhance the experience of the series as it moves forward.Does Dead Space 3 evolve effectively? I think so, even if it's not perfect. Let's see why. DISCLAIMER: I am reviewing this as a lone wolf. No co-op for me on my initial playthrough.TAU VOLANTIS:As everyone knows, this is the single biggest change in Dead Space 3 -- going from a cramped Ishimura or a doomed Sprawl to a seemingly open ice planet. It's a huge change from dark to (literally) white, right? Well, don't be deceived. You don't spend all your time, or even most of it, walking around in the snow with the sun out. While chapter 1 will likely catch you off guard as it did me in giving more of an epic-sci-fi-movie feel versus a Dead Space game, you'll spend a huge majority of your time exploring claustrophobic ships and dark, abandoned areas littered with blood, all the while panicking at how few medpacks you have. Yep, still plenty of that Dead Space feel we all know and love.If you played the demo, you may have been concerned about the blatant action sequences and human enemies. I will admit the action sequences are around noticeably more than in DS2, but this didn't bother me. Also, the human enemies are rare; seriously, you will encounter them only at specific parts of the game. If you've been following the struggle between EarthGov and Unitology outside of the games, it does make sense that Unitology soldiers would finally make an appearance. However, it's nice that they aren't a regular part of the game. That would honestly take a lot away.ATMOSPHERE:This leads us to undoubtedly the main question fans are curious about before buying: \"Is it as scary as the previous games!?\" Yes it is. There were PLENTY of dark hallways and dimly lit rooms where I had to stop and take a deep breathe before moving on through. I still got an overwhelming sense of dread that made me have to take breaks between playtimes like with the two previous games. However, please understand something. After playing two games (likely several playthroughs each) and controlling a Necromorph-veteran of a main character, you are likely going to be at least a little desensitized to many of the scare tactics that are still employed here which originated in DS1. Not only that, but with more action sequences and a certain percentage of the game taking place on the snowy terrains of Tau Volantis, there will be certain levels that maybe do not scare you quite as much as the others. Don't get me wrong, though -- this game still freaks me out. If you want the real survival experience, by the way, be a man and start your first playthrough on Impossible.With that being said, let me personally tip my hat off to the Visceral team on the audio. The new sounds they've been able to come up with are truly chilling, and I got so immersed in the atmosphere my wife was able to get a few scares out of me when I was playing alone in the dark. Seriously, though, whether it's the deafening blizzards or the near-silent creaking throughout the Greely, Visceral absolutely nailed it with the audio. If you're playing on a high-quality system/pair of headphones, you'll be extremely happy... though maybe not so happy while you play, if you catch my drift.Something new to the audio is an actual soundtrack of melodies. You'll hear it in the menus, and you'll also hear it at certain parts of the game. Some people may accuse this of dumbing down the claustrophobic feel of the atmosphere, but in my opinion it gives the game more of a rich and even epic feel when coupled with many of the in-game sequences. Some of the soundscapes played during your space explorations are hauntingly beautiful; they give the player that downtime that's similarly needed in horror movies/books (though it's hard to ever truly feel safe or at peace in this game).An element that greatly adds to the atmosphere are the stunning visuals. Whether it's an icey vista on Tau Volantis or the glowing lights in a dark, cramped corridor, Dead Space has always had a visual allure to it. Some sort of charm in its own twisted sci-fi way, similar to when you watch a movie like Alien. I'm just so glad this visual allure is still apparent in this game as it was in the previous two.GAMEPLAY:The gameplay of course still feels like Dead Space, as the combat is basically the same. However, I believe the combat is the game's main flaw (more on that soon). Several things have changed, like the weapon crafting, checkpoint saves, and the bench systems. There is no more store (or save stations), but again from a narrative standpoint it's logical in that your time is spent exploring 200+ year old ships and stations that weren't directly overseen by EarthGov. Being stranded on Tau Volantis gives credence to the scavenging aspect that plays into weapon crafting, and it encourages the player to explore every nook and cranny. One immense change is moving from gun-specific ammo to universal ammo. It can be frustrating at first, since you can carry \"clips\" in your inventory, but the clip translates to a certain amount of ammo that's different for each weapon. Be sure to take a few minutes early to figure out which weapons get the most/least amount of ammo in a clip. This will help determine which weapons you like for your playstyle, as well as which weapons are the most efficient.As far as the necromorphs go, I've noticed they are much faster here than in the two previous installments. This is likely to counterbalance the double-weapon firepower, but just keep that in mind. Stasis will especially be your friend! If you are playing on Impossible on your first run, expect to die. I know some reviewers are disappointed with how the necromorphs look, but the devs said they wanted to make necromorphs that look like they've been trapped in space or ice for an extremely long amount of time. Again, to me this is one of those changes that makes sense. And I personally believe that when the newly-designed Puker gets up in your face you won't feel too peachy at all.Like I mentioned, the combat aspect was the biggest drawback for me at times. First off, depending on your weapon choice you'll find CQC can be awkward as your shots many times miss up close. Secondly, in the latter half of the game I sometimes got the feeling that you would be simultaneously rushed by 7-9 of the same types of necromorphs. Not only was this lack of variety bland, but given the Necromorph speed boost here I generally just ended up spraying to survive versus the dismemberment I'm used to.STORY:The decision to be heavily narrative-driven is the backbone of all the changes in Dead Space 3, and it's the best way to go in a new direction without the need to change core gameplay. I mean, Visceral can only use the tool of sheer mystery for so long before it becomes bland; I'm glad they decided to focus largely on Isaac's personal story. While many reviews reveal a polarizing effect of the story, I actually like it just fine. As I mentioned before, the Prologue and Chapter 1 will likely throw you off as you'll literally hit the ground running with Isaac. A lot has happened with him and Ellie since DS2, but as happens in the DS universe, the action kicks in pretty quickly and there isn't much time for explanations. You will notice there are some leaps in the plot throughout the game. However, if you think about it, outside of Isaac, Ellie, and some surface facts regarding Unitology and EarthGov, there is still quite a bit we don't understand about the Dead Space universe. With that in mind, the plot leaps aren't too hard to stomach. Also, being married and working full-time means I don't have too much time for explanations anyways! Seriously, though, I did enjoy the story's conclusion. The final chapter was incredibly intense!One part of the story I felt was largely left out -- what happened to Isaac's dementia, Visceral? You played around with the idea of using Isaac's dementia to evoke psychological horror for the player, but most of that is missing in Dead Space 3. Isaac has (presumably) gone untreated with all the scarring he's got -- there are so many disturbing hallucinations the poor guy probably has that could have been implemented. If I could change one thing about DS3, I think that would be it; utilize Isaac's mental instability more. It would have added a deeper layer of character development as it did before.REPLAYABILITY:There are 19 chapters here, whereas the previous game had 15. If you beat both previous DS games in 10-15 hours on your first playthrough, you're probably looking at about 15-20 here if you like to explore and do side missions. I beat my first playthrough in 21+ hours. In addition to the various difficulties, there are four additional game modes to keep things fresh: Classic, Pure Survival, Hardcore, and NG+. Vintage fans will like classic mode as there's no crafting -- you need full weapon blueprints to get new weapons (just like old times!). Pure survival means the opposite and forces you to craft everything from scavenged parts. Hardcore will give you one life, just like real life, to beat the game with. Die once and you're back to square zero. Couple all these with jump-in-jump-out co-op to keep you and your friends busy, it's more than obvious you'll get a good bang for your buck with Dead Space 3.So that's it. There's my review. Dead Space 3 still feels like good ol' Dead Space, even if the different lighting levels in various areas tone things down at times, and the combat has its times of frustration. Still, if you're playing on Impossible for your first round, I wouldn't worry about not getting creeped out. Just turn up the volume, turn down the brightness, and play in the dark.Would I recommend DS3 to a first-time gamer to the series? You can definitely pick it up and enjoy it, but you're probably going to get lost with some of the narrative jumps. Besides, the Ishimura is a classic! Go back and start on DS 1 & 2.I just want to say thank you, Visceral. You've managed to evolve the game in a way that expands the lore in a near-epic way without dissolving the Dead Space roots. Dead Space has been a truly incredible experience since 2008, and I'm excited to see where things go from here.*****UPDATE 6/13*****After heavy contemplation and spending more time with both DS2 and DS3, I have decided to lower my overall rating by one star. I still stand by everything mentioned above, but with the combat flaws I noticed, some parts of the game did feel like a slight step back in terms of gameplay. Regardless, I still think this is a great and ambitious conclusion that every DS fan needs to play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2013"}

Before you rate this review just read it because I got quite a few reasons while i don't like it. I really don't like the game because there is a certain amount of time you have to do for things, and I can never seem to find the person I need to find, and the game is just too hard to play. For the age I was at the time I got this ( 9 ) this game I found slow, and unfun. Then again, I don't really like too many adventure games. Here is my stack, I'm sure all of you guys will disagree, because as it seems, most people like this game.Graphics: 5/5. For an N64 game, these were very well done, I believe they needed the advanced graphics thing you had to put into the system.Sound: 5/5. The sound is great. The sounds in towns, the voices, the cutscenes, everything about the sound is great.Control: 4/5. There are some times when controls can get confused, and you can get a little angry at the game because you pressed the wrong button, but they are overall easy to get used to.Fun: 2/5. Even though I rated everything else high, I really dislike this game. It is just not my type of game, and like I said before, it's slow, boring, and too hard. ( It was when i was 9, at least. I haven't played it too recently. )Even though this game is rated E for everyone, be warned: this game is not very easy, OR fun. But I'm sure there are those people out there that enjoy these games.

The store I shop at has a good return policy, even on used games, so I really had nothing to lose except my time.  Therefore, I decided to take a chance and I am glad that I did.The game is solid overall and makes me feel like I am experiencing Aliens all over again.  The controls are good.  The graphics are good as well, although I think they could have used a little polish and have been even better, but it doesn't detract from the game.  I like the story.  I only wish they had made one of the Marines from the movie like Hicks, Hudson, Vasquez or even Gorman playable characters.  I have also noticed that the game seems to freeze for about 5-10 seconds after you get killed before it starts to load again.  However, since I have yet to have it freeze on me during actual gameplay, I am not docking ratings points.  I recommend this game if you are an Aliens enthusiast like I am.

One, it's now 2007 so it's been a while since this was released.  Two, I only tried single-player story mode before stopping (more later).  Three, I LOVED TS: Future Perfect.I definitely seem to be in a different corner from other reviewers.  Generally people love this game.  After 3 levels of single-player mode, I realized it was pi**ing me off more than providing fun.Looks aren't a problem.  Unless your a graphics fetishist there's nothing to complain about how it looks, even today.  Not too blocky, nice environments, smooth framerate.The problem for me arises in the actual gameplay.  First, I hate aiming with my thumb, and prefer a fixed site that moves with you until you choose a zoom sight for, say, a rifle.  This sight is hard to zero in with and almost impossible to use on a moving target.  Choose not to use aiming mode and who knows where your shots will land?  If you're happy thumbing it, then it won't be a problem for you.But over and over I found the missions (played on medium difficulty) to be obnoxious.  The save system sucks big time, and you too often find yourself playing an entire level over and over again if you mess up.  There are checkpoints here and there, but you lose them if you have to quit.  I don't always want, or have the time, to play through an entire level.  Granted, they aren't horribly long, but I'm the type of player who likes to take his time and look around.  If you're the blow-through-as-fast-as-I-can type, it might not be a problem for you.  I just put it away in frustration after getting tired of failing several times for no apparent reason on the 3rd mission (the \"rescue the girls from zombies\" one).That's about the gist of it for me.  With other reviews being so glowing it may be that I just don't \"fit\" the game.  Or, maybe, having played Future Perfect first ruined it for me.  Still, that doesn't remove the frustration factor from this one.  Sad, that, since, as I said at the beginning, I absolutely love love LOVE Future Perfect.  That game really has it all!  If you haven't played either this or Future Perfect, I strongly recommend FP but you might want to rent this one (if you can find it) or buy it very cheap.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00432O4VM","description":"","reviewerName":"H. Wang \"nycmode\"","summary":"Demented, Irreverent, Immature ... And Yet, I'm Having So Much Fun","reviewText":"This game feels like the true love child of Suda 51 (Killer 7) and Shinji Mikami (Resident Evil).  It's gory, chock full of penis references (even your sidekick - a floating disembodied transforming skull - is dubbed \"Johnson\"), and features dialogue filled with more cheese than the state of Wisconsin.  Some control aspects also feel archaic, and at times I do agree with some reviewers who say the the game plays like an old PS2 shooter.So why can't I stop playing this game?Shadows of the Damned doesn't take itself seriously.  The game feels like the video game version of Robert Rodriguez at his B-movie best.  Imagine if RR wanted to make a movie about a bad ass demon killer who hops into a vortex to the underworld to save his hot girlfriend and blows everything out of the way.  Throw in some (awfully) funny one-liners, amusing cutscenes, and tons of underworld blood and gore and you have SoD.As you would expect from a highly produced game with B-movie aspirations - the game looks great and boasts some pretty (entertaining) kill animations.  I agree with a previous reviewer who says headshots are rewarded.  I would be shocked if you didn't take great pleasure in blowing off the head of a demon like a shattered watermelon.  There is definitely something inherently satisfying about seeing a well-aimed shot come to fruition.One of the best parts of the game has to be the top-notch atmosphere.  This is due in part to two things.  1. SoD's soundtrack is excellent.  It is a wonderful mix of moody, creepy and sometimes playful tunes (thanks to the man behind the soundtrack of Silent Hill).  2. The voice acting is excellent.  The interplay between Hotspur and Johnson is hilarious at times (even the F-bombs are delivered with perfect B-movie gusto) and all in all the acting is on par with stuff you see in the theaters.  Honorable mention also goes to the insane settings, which are a mix of the disturbing with the explicit.  But when juxtaposed with all the irreverent humor, crazy one-liners and abundance of penis jokes, it all makes adds up to a perfect brew of horror and comedy in one amusing package.The game plays fairly well, though I docked one star for the somewhat loose aiming mechanics (think Resident Evil), which feel a bit dated.  You can adjust the looseness of the aim/camera - but I still wish the mechanism was a bit tighter - especially given how important it is to make your shots count in this game.  There are puzzles sprinkled around the underworld, but they are fairly easy to overcome.  The game will challenge you on the higher difficulty settings, but all in all it's relatively manageable for most players.  The boss battles are quite fun, and I found myself looking forward to each major encounter in this (somewhat) short game.  I also really liked the weapons and the simple upgrade system.All in all - I have to say this game greatly exceeded my expectations.  Even though seeing stuff like naked corpses, rivers of blood and a disembodied skull sidekick isn't the kind of thing that screams comedy for the average person ... the on-the-mark dialogue and ridiculously insane banter makes it a unique game that doesn't take itself too seriously (like Dante's Inferno, another 'go to hell save your woman' epic tale sans the humor that's more GoW than RE directed by Rodriguez or Tarantino).If you are a fan of horror games but also have a devilish sense of humor (and love RR or QT films), you have to get this game at once.  Demon hunting has never been this fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2011"}

Using the power of the playstation 4, gamers can now share their journey to the Super Bowl championships.There are some physical improvements in this new version of Madden 25 on the PS4, but don't expect much else when it comes to actual gameplay mechanics, as what you experienced on previous versions of Madden on the Playstation 3 is pretty much what you are going to get on the Playstation 4. Where gamers will see the most improvements is in the overall visuals, the look of the players, and the weather system, all enhanced to give a far more detailed experience on the football field.Madden 25 is geared towards players already familiar with the genre, as there is very little instructions of what to do once the game gets going. I felt this was a bit of a let down, as it could alienate a lot of gamers unfamiliar with how to play the sports.For those who are familiar with the game, Madden NFL 25 gives you a lot of customization options allowing you to control the game exactly how you want. With Connected franchise for example you get the chance to call the play, choose teams, change their names, and take them to Ultimate Victory.I did experience a few controller issues, especially when it came to player respond time when attempting a pass. This could be very frustrating as miss timed passes can result in loss of yards or worse. The new player artificial intelligence was also a bit of a challenge as team mates, make questionable decisions and leave you exposed with little time to change or correct directions.

Yes, the campaign is great. But I purchased this specifically for the online portion. You wouldn't think that if you buy a relatively recent game that the online portion would no longer work. What is the point of upgrading your car and getting good at it if you cannot take your car out for a challenge among your peers? You can only play the campaign so many times before you want to know where you stand amongst your fellow racers. This game clearly states the ability to race with up to 16 people. If you can't do that, then they have no business selling the product to unsuspecting customers like myself. Given that the XL edition only came out about two and half years, and still on the shelves of many stores, Sony and/or PolyPHONY should not be shutting down its servers for this game. To purchase this game brand new and only to find that a major part of it is no longer functional is a total letdown. In an age where publishers such as Activision keep their servers running for games such as Call of Duty: Black Ops that came out four years ago and at the same time still serving the other Call of Duty games from Black Ops to Ghost this should not be. Sony with its deep pocket should be able to continue serving the Gran Turismo 5 community. They chose to go the in the wrong direction and follow businesses such as EA whose business practice has been to nickel and dime customers and give them less for their money. Producing a game such as Gran Turismo 5 XL Edition and then pulling the plug on the customers is simply, to put it short, bad business practice. As such, I will no longer be purchasing any more Gran Turismo iterations ever again. I am sure that they will do the same to the Gran Turismo 6 customers. Same goes for Resistance which also fell to this bad business practice.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2014"}

But Far Cry 2 is nothing like that game.  My biggest gripe is the glitchy save system.  The game seems to only sporadically save my games and when I die I find out that my last save is gone.  Also, the AI is buggy as well.  Most of the time the enemies have an uncanny ability to spot and shoot me.  But there have been times when an enemy will run right by me and stop and stand with his back to me.  The final straw is that the game is tedious at best.  I'm given an overall goal to kill some weapons dealer, but I have no idea how to do this.  In the meantime, I'm given lame missions to intercept convoys and kill people.  Of course, each mission I get forces me to drive across the map and get attacked constantly.  Reminds me of the equallt tedious Assassin's Creed.

You get to visit the Sedgewick hotel (and re-capture slimer in the same ballroom as the first movie), and many other nostalgic tie-ins to the movies.The campaign gameplay is particularly fun. Wrangling ghosts with the proton pack and throwing out traps to catch them was right on. The only problem I had with my game was in the library where the game stuttered. But the voice acting, music (pretty much straight from the movie soundtracks sounds like), and sounds are right on. The sounds in particular. The sound of the proton pack being engaged or hearing it tear through furniture, etc.The online gameplay is a nice addition to the game. You can pick from the 4 ghostbusters and the rookie and earn money to advance your rank. I found it also particularly interesting that certain ghosts are on the \"Most Wanted\" list and you encounter them almost randomly when playing. The missions are challenging and include: Thief (protect 4 artifacts from thieving ghosts), Protection (power up a PKE disrupter and protect it while it starts up from attack), Containment (catch all ghosts w/in timelimit), Slime Dunk (compete to slam slimers into traps), Survival (survive wave after wave of ghosts/demons).

Is it love?  Is it revenge?  Is it a desire to protect all that you hold dear?  Is it the desire to acquire more things, money, and respect from others?  All of those can be very powerful motivators, and you can find all of them in Fable II.Fable II is everything you loved about Fable I only more of it.  (If it ain't broke don't fix it, right?)  You can still buy shops and houses, only now you can set the price of rent and goods.  (and get good or evil points in the process)  You can also buy and upgrade each individual piece of furniture for your houses.  You can still get married, but now you can turn any house into a marriage house.  The towns look familiar, but are much bigger.  You could spend a lifetime just doing all of the side missions.  The choices are endless.You get out of it what you put into it.  If you really work to keep your wife happy, she will keep you VERY happy. ;)  (and give you children if you so choose)Not only can you buy every piece of property in the game, but you can also rename every townsperson who isn't a main character.  Your creativity can run rampant here.  I already have a well endowed, cleavage showing woman named [...] McGee and a bisexual cultivator of crops called [...] the Farmer.Online and offline co-op is a nice addition from the last iteration as well.  You can drop in and drop out almost as seamlessly as in the Lego games.  Like the Lego games you share the same screen (offline, haven't played online yet).  One of the biggest frustrations with sharing the same screen is when the 2 players go 2 different directions.  This can be easily remedied by player 2 pressing the back button to warp up next to player 1.Graphics: 9.5  Artwork in motion, characters are a little cartoon-ish thoughGameplay: 12!  You could spend hours acquiring land, spouses, and children, hunting treasure and playing with your dog!Story: 9  Clich&eacute;d yet intriguingMusic: 10  The background orchestra music fits perfectly with the settingVoice Acting:  9.5  Very well done, yet most voices are the same as the last Fable, who knows maybe you sound exactly like your ancestors from 500 yrs agoThe bottom line: if you're willing to invest the time and effort into Fable II, it is VERY rewarding.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2008"}

It was the beginning of a new era- the Cold War.October 16, 1962. The President of the United States received word   that the Soviet Union had deployed nuclear missiles in Cuba. The world    trembled in fear as the prospect of nuclear war loomed ever closer.   After days of tense negotiations, the Soviets finally agreed on the 28th   to withdraw their missiles from Cuban soil. With the resolution of this   incident, later to be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, it    seemed that humanity had survived yet another threat to its existence.However, there was a secret condition in the deal that put an end to   the crisis. Nokolai Stepanovich Sokolov, a Soviet scientist who had   defected    to the West, was to be sent back to the Soviet Union. The U.S.   government agreed to this stipulation, and returned Sokolov back to his   native    land. Little did they know that Sokolov was to be the designer of a   nightmarish weapon. Now, with Sokolov back in their hands, the Soviets    are ready to resume its development. If this weapon is completed, it   will mark the beginning of a new age of fear.August 1964. Realizing at last the urgency of the situation, the CIA   forms a plan to recapture Sokolov. They dispatch the covert FOX unit    to Sokolov's research facility, located to the south of the great   Soviet fortress of Groznyj Grad. Led by former SAS member Major Zero,   FOX is a    next-generation special-forces unit that operates both as a   specialized combat group and as a covert intelligence outfit.

{"product_name":"B001CRM3RI","description":"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Warsis the highly anticipated first game in theGTAfranchise designed for play on the Nintendo DS. But although it comes in a small package, this is a full-fledged game that stands on its own. With an all-new, deep story that approaches the familiar sights and sounds of the infamous Liberty City from a different perspective, an innovative control system and multiplayer options,Chinatown Warscaptures the tone and flavors of the long-runningGTAseries in unique ways that both longtime players and those coming to it for the first time will find hard to put down..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Grand Theft Auto:Chinatown WarsPlayers:Offline: 1; Online: 2Gameplay Modes:Single player; competitive &amp; coop multiplayer via Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.Kick some tail as Huang Lee.View larger.Use the DS stylus like never before.View larger.Reconquer Liberty via PDA.View larger.The Story: Left for Dead in the Worst Place in AmericaFollowing his father&rsquo;s murder, Huang Lee is given what seems a simple mission: to deliver an ancient sword to his Uncle Kenny to ensure his family retains control of the Triad gangs of Liberty City. Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement. While driving players also have access to five in-game radio stations and use of their weapons. Your PDA provides efficient management tools for your growing crime empire, including quick weapons switching, a running total of available cash, in-game e-mail and Internet access and nearly instant game saves any time. The control scheme inChinatown Warsutilizes an easy to use and comfortable to play combination of steering via the D-pad, choice of action through the face buttons and/or stylus taps and manual and automatic weapon locks and unlocks via shoulder buttons.Key Game Features:The Largest DS Game Ever- Contemporary Liberty City is a massive world complete with pedestrians, weather and traffic patterns, five different radio stations and four different sprawling boroughs to explore.Endless Gameplay- Mature storyline with over 70+ story missions; plus dozens of side quests, collectibles, contextual mini-games and the all new mission replay feature.Street Economics- Addictive drug dealing side game with 6 different drug types, 80+ drug dealers and a supply / demand driven narcotics economy.Play with Friends- Nintendo Wi-Fi mode for head-to-head and co-op multiplayer mayhem.Bragging Rights- Chat, trade guns and commodities with your friends, and compete for glory via online tournaments and leaderboards on the Rockstar Games Social Club.PDA Interface- Use the touch screen as a PDA device to set GPS waypoints, change radio stations, communicate via e-mail with in-game characters and order weapons on the Internet.Online Bragging Rights and MultiplayerCare has been taken to ensure that players can share theirChinatown Warsexperiences with friends and fellow players in different ways. First, players will have access to theChinatown Warsas well as the greaterGrand Theft Autocommunities through the Rockstar Games Social Club. Here they can chat, trade commodities, purchase special in-game items with in-game currency, check the leaderboards and compete in online tournaments. The DS' Wi-Fi capabilities also gives players the opportunity to take their game online as they battle for supremacy in their own little corner of Liberty City in both head-to-head and co-op multiplayer battles.","reviewerName":"Shantel","summary":"GTA for DS!","reviewText":"There is not very much I can say about this game that other reviewers have not already said. This game is obviously well thought out. It is amazingly full of detail. The developers managed to squeeze all of Liberty City into such a tiny cartridge, and they did it with flair. The city is bustling with life.Unlike console versions of GTA where raids and stake-outs are large scale, with 20 characters shooting at you all at once, the developers of this game kept in mind that this a hand held and they scaled down these battles as well. This is a plus since trying to take out 20 or so gangsters on the DS might have felt a bit overwhelming.This game takes good advantage of the DS touch screen. It's use is seamless and it is used in interesting ways like scratch cards, digging in dumpsters, hot-wiring cars, selling drugs, and more. The use of the touch screen takes the customary GTA tasks and makes them interactive. This is another plus because it makes you feel that much more involved in the game.The only tiffs I have with China Town Wars are that the radio stations don't have any of the funny dialogue or any recognizable songs - this is understandable, and doesn't take anything away from the game at all - and that the graphics of the story scenes are kind of ugly, luckily the dialogue is just as off beat and funny as the console versions. These things weren't big enough cons for me to take any stars away from my rating.Overall, I am very happy to have bought this game. It is a great addition to the collection of any GTA fan, and the best adult DS game that I have seen so far. Every time I turn it on I find out something new. This game is definitely worth owning, even for those who are not the biggest GTA fans. This game will not disappoint.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"Yuri Cunha \"Juggalo\"","summary":"REinvented","reviewText":"Back in 2002, I bought a GCN to play the Resident Evil remake. I loved it, it was the next best thing to the best Resident Evil ever - the first one for PSOne. It was scary, it was beautiful, it rocked! And, by the way, I bought my first videogame, a PSOne, just to play Resident Evil. Then came Resident Evil Zero. Some people I know stopped playing the series just because of that game. It wasn't a bad game at all, but it could've been so much better, it disappointed fans. Suddently, it seemed like that slow, zombie formula wasn't working for most fans, and CAPCOM didn't want the series to die, so they released Resident Evil 4.First of all, it shouldn't be called Resident Evil, because it has very little to do with the games we've been playing for years. If you think that's a good thing, if you were tired of the zombies and the same old formula, buy this game right now. If you're like me, and you loved that old formula... As good as this game can be, you will most likely miss the old games. RE4 is near perfection visually, I have no complains about that. Controls are enjoyable most of the time (the new aiming system is harder, but more rewarding), enemies are intelligent, the soundtrack is nothing speaial but voice acting was very well done. The game is technically top-notch. Is it fun? Well, yes. Some difficult parts here and there (few but intelligent puzzles), but it's overall fun. If you're worried about the lengh and you don't want to spend 50 bucks for a few hours, don't worry. You won't beat this game under 20 hours, unless you hurry a lot. No matter if you hated or loved the old RE games, you have a very good chance of enjoying this one. Nice extras after you beat the game shall keep you entertained. Don't wait for the PS2 version in 2005, buy it right now. It's not the best Resident Evil ever, but it's a different experience you won't forget.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait. You can't buy a much better game.--John CockingPros:A story to beat all storiesCharacters worth caring aboutHey--it's from SquareSoftStunning animationsCons:Too many random battlesCombat is, as always, turn-based and offers minimal excitementWeak souls might give up after two or three discs of play","reviewerName":"Joshua Sweeney","summary":"Great Game","reviewText":"I liked this game.

I wouldn't call this a \"no risk\" purchase, because there are definetly gamers out there who would prefer a more \"guided\" game, with less twists, turns, and puzzles (like Max Payne). The puzzles definetly get annoying after a while, and you may find yourself saying...\"I really don't need this break in the action to wonder around in circles.\" What is a puzzle? Well trying to find a secret code to unlock a door may take you 15 minutes of running around the level. Aside from that..When there is action, its GREAT. The graphics are top notch, (running on a Geforce 3 Ti on 1024x768 resolution, everything maxed out). The sounds are right out of all the Star Wars movies, the music, the laser blasts, and the lightsaber. You'll feel like you walked into the middle of Empire Strikes Back just from the audio/visual standpoint. The levels are done in GREAT detail.The enemy AI is a bit suspect, the Storm Troopers aren't the most aware enemies you've ever encountered in computer games, but when the do come after you it's a battle. The easiest setting is even challenging, and the hardest setting is near impossible without cheat codes, which there are available. (I don't reccomend playing with these as it will DEFINETLY shorten the game, and make it ALOT easier). I notice alot of people complaining about AI in this game as well as others, but I don't see a problem in JDK2.The BOTTOM LINE....If your a Star Wars fan, looking for great graphics and a different FPS, go for Jedi Knight II. It's unlike any game out there, and that's what makes it worth buying. It's unique.**I would reccomend this even more to players with higher end computers. I'm running a P4 at 2.8ghz, with 512 MBs RD Ram and a Geforce 4 Ti 4600...I also ran it on a 1.6 and a Geforce 3. Both run it on pretty high settings.Good luck and take care.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2002"}

This adds on to the basic Wii Fit set. So make sure you have Wii Fit - or that you buy a bundle of some sort - to be able to enjoy Wii Fit Plus. Make sure you have a balance board, as well as both a Wii controller and nunchuck. You'll need all of these to enjoy all the games.The Wii Fit Plus, first, adds in pets! You can enter a cute little avatar for your cat or dog. It won't let pets train, but it does track their weight. How you do this is you (the human) have it measure you - then you hold the pet in your arms and it measures you plus the pet. This is a great way to keep track of your pet's weight over time and to know if something is changing!For humans, there are lots of great new features. First, you can play a variety of multiplayer games. This lets you challenge each other to all sorts of fun.In my home I tend to be the only Wii Fit player, so I was more interested in the new games. I love the Kung Fu one, where you do various moves in time with the rhythm. I'm also a big fan of the segue game, steering your rolling two-wheeled scooter around the course with body movements. There's a juggling game, a snowball fight game, and a nice running game.An area I use quite a lot is the \"routines\" area. This lets you design a series of activities and have them just run non stop in a row. So let's say in the yoga area I enjoy tree pose, then palm, then sun salutation, then tree pose and then sun salutation again. You define that series of activities and then start it off. The game seamlessly steps you through those poses, one after another, and when you're done you get credit for all the time! It's perfect!I can't say enough good things about Wii Fit Plus. I love the yoga, how you can make the perfect routine for YOU, to meet your interests and the time you can spend. I love many of the new games. I find it really helpful to track my pet's health easily in the system.Is there a down side? I would love more customization. I would love yoga on a beach, for example, or in a forest. It can't be that hard for them to toss in new backgrounds. I would love new background music - or let us add in our own.I also think you should be able to choose your timer. Right now they have a \"piggie\" which I find a little inappropriate. Again it'd be easy for them to let you customize that, and really help out a lot.Maybe those things will come into play in Wii Fit 2!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000JLIXIG","reviewerName":"Sky","summary":"Only One Can Resist","reviewText":"No one can resist the urge to keep playing Resistance: Fall of Man once the game is started. Chapter after chapter of exhilarating battles against a plethora of creatures that you use a plethora of weapons to defeat (and they'll use them against you too).To really put the plot of the game in context (if you care about the plot), it's well worth the visit to the official Resistance: Fall of Man web site; there's a ton of story there that I'd bet 90% of the people who start the game are unaware of. For me, the story helped me \"get into character\" for the game. If you just want to start wasting some nasty beasts, \"Get to it, soldier!\" Rest assured, the story won't help you beat the enemies or evade the barrage of defenses that will be fired at you by them.As a relatively new gamer, I'm glad that I played Call of Duty 3Call of Duty 3before I cracked open Resistance: Fall of Man. It was good FPS training (set in approximately the same time period) for this much more difficult PS3 title.Resistance has an M (mature gamers only) rating which miffs me a bit, but then I'm a bit more liberal when it comes to what I think might warp the little minds of kids these days.  I've seen this classified as a Horror title, but I think that Sci-fi Action is much more fitting. Resistance deserved a T (teen) rating. My kids and I get hung up all too often on sunny days playing Resistance's Co-op Mode when we should be outside playing ball. And hopefully that alone speaks volumes as to how addictively fun this game is.Co-op Mode is split screen of course because the game is FPS; it would be nice if some games could give the option of switching to a single screen, third person view for Co-op in order to negate the need for split screen, but that would distinctly change to look, range, feel and some of the weaponry...so I assume that's why it's never offered on Co-op mode.Multi-player is very cool. Multi-player is not like Co-op where you play the Campaign Mode with a partner. In Multi-player you battle against your friends offline (4 player max/split screen) or online (40 player max/full screen). You get some areas of battle to play in that you encountered in Campaign Mode and some new map scematics.But Resistance's real challenge is in single player Campaign Mode.Your weapons are plentiful. You start with a pretty standard machine gun (M5A2) that includes a grenade launcher that will become your best \"little friend\" in the game. It's very useful on the enemies that you encounter most throughout the game. You also get several mean weapons that you pick up from your fallen comrades and defeated beasts including the enemy's main machine gun (The Bullseye...very handy), grenades, a shotgun, a sniper rifle, a radiation blaster (The Auger), a mine thrower, a rapid fire subsonic bolt dispenser (The Hailstorm) and a rocket launcher.Grenades are key to survival...use them, but you'll want to keep in mind that you can run out real real fast...so use them pretty much exclusively to take down groups of enemies.(And five other weapons aside from the ones that I mentioned above are unlocked only after beating/completing the game once on medium difficulty or higher.)If you missed the countless gamer magazines' synopsises of the creature types and the power of the individual weapons, there are some great gamer help web sites that are worth taking a look at to help you strategize (just click on my profile above and email me if you'd like me to point you in the right direction).And speaking of getting pointed in the right direction, part of the fun of this game is figuring out on your own how to get from chapter to chapter. There are no maps, which at times was frustrating. Let me tell you that if the phrase \"the best route is not always the most obvious\" ever applied to trying to get from here to there it applies in this game on more than one occasion.You'll also need to at times navigate a jeep and a tank.So what exactly are you fighting? Where exactly did they come from? If you're up to the challenge to find out....You're Sgt. Nathan Hale, and you're the only one with a Resistance to the Fall of Man. Prepare for some serious battle.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00007KUU8","reviewerName":"Trevor Cotton","summary":"Classic MGS","reviewText":"I think the best way to approach a massively hyped up game like MGS2, is to ignore the hype. I know people who bought this game and were really dissapointed, basically because they had been lead to believe it was going to be the best thing ever. I however was completely amazed by this game, it was a big surprise and it is definetely one of my favourite games of all time.I owned MGS1 for the PS1, and to be honest thought it was a little over-rated, it was a great game, but people claiming it to be the best game ever, made me anticipate too much from it. I went into MGS2 not expecting too much, but I was completely blown away by the game. Great additions were the aiming in first person, which meant much greater accuracy when shooting, and generally the gameplay is superb. Collecting the Dog Tags was also a great addition, and adds longevity to the game (I have completed it about 10 times), the boss battles are also amazing, though there are fewer than the other games in the series. In particular the battles with the harrier, Vamp and the final bosses are great. So far so good, in fact there is very little wrong with the game, I only have two minor problems. Firstly you don't get to play as Snake enough, only a slight problem but Raiden is a bit of an (...), and most people agree Snake should have been the main playable character. The biggest problem though is the plot.Up until about an hour from the end of the game the plot maves along nicely, with a couple of nice twists along the way, then it all goes to pieces. There is a ridiculously long cut scene (about an hour), near the end where you lose all idea of what is going on. I wont explain it here, mainly because I cant, I have completed the game loads of times and still can barely comprehend it now. The good thing is, when you have completed the game once you can skip the cut scenes, and you will want to at the end. While I did eventually grasp the plot at the end, it was just stupid, and were I reviewing this game out of 10, it would only get 9, just because of the plot.Luckily for Hideo Kojima, the daft plot doesn't ruin this as a gaming experience, it is a fantastic game and highly recommended to any gaming fan.  This review is not of the Substance version, but for some reason I can't find the original PS2 version on Amazon anywhere.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2006"}

Nathan Hale.View larger.This sequel introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers.View larger.Resistance 2 takes up right where Resistance: Fall of Man left off. Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest. This unprecedented 60-player option could revolutionize online multiplayer game play and is sure to provide countless hours of action-packed fun.Resistance 2, set in the United States, is loaded with new weapons, enemies, and an unprecedented online gaming experience.","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Spectacular, a must-own for every PS3 owner","reviewText":"When Resistance: Fall of Man was released at the launch of the PS3, it quickly became the best game you could get for Sony's maligned system, and showed what the console could be capable of.  Fast forward two years later, and Sony and Insomniac return with Resistance 2; a sequel that blows the original game out of the water in nearly every aspect, and is an absolute must-own for every PS3 owner.  Picking up where Fall of Man left off, Resistance 2 puts you in the shoes of soldier Nathan Hale as humanity's against the Chimera continues not to bode too well.  The first thing you'll notice about Resistance 2, besides the gorgeous graphics and visuals, is that everything is just plain bigger.  From the environments, to the weapons, to the battles; everything about Resistance 2 just screams epic.  The single-player campaign boasts some impressive AI and tough boss battles, but the real meat and potatoes of Resistance 2 is the game's eight-player co-op mode, which is just a blast to play through.  Combined with the fact that the online multiplayer modes are lag-free this time around, and Resistance 2 is a superior shooter sequel in every sense.  All in all, along with Little Big Planet, Resistance 2 shows that the PS3 does have excellent, exclusive titles that are the definition of \"killer app\", and it goes without saying that if you own a PS3, you need to own Resistance 2 as well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2008"}

I mean, we FINALLY had a game worthy of the modern day and age, where as so many game makers fail to bring something modern and epic, to the table. Mass Effect 1 was nearly perfect. Mass Effect 2 is not so much. I can't say it's really \"worse\" but it is, however, different. Very different.If you haven't heard by now, the story of ME2 is Commander Shepard dying after an attack on the Normandy following the Battle of the Citadel. Terrorist organization Cerebus spends billions of dollars reviving Shepard and building a new Normandy, and you, as Commander Shepard, go on a quest to find the most powerful guns-for-hire on a mission to find out what's happening to human settlements across the galaxy to make them vanish in thin air. The Alliance and the Council has forgotten your deeds to save the galaxy and all your old friends have moved on, in your absence. Cerebus, despite them being more or less \"the bad guys,\" are all you've got left and considering they brought you back to life, they're all you know now.Essentially, the whole gaming experience is like GOING FROM RICH TO POOR. Instead of just cruising through, you now have to earn your way in EVERYTHING in this game. Kind of an easy way to put it is that the game is much harder. Only, it's not necessarily \"harder\" as much as it's a lot more work, and you're given a lot less.Those who felt as though they mastered Mass Effect 1, played through on Insanity level and never once died... well, those days are over. All your expertise, skills, knowledge, and yes, even cash, is gone. Mass Effect 2 takes place in the lawless and poverty stricken Terminus systems. Whereas Mass Effect 1 had a \"Citadel\" and \"Presidium\" feel to it (you're given everything and know what you have to do), the sequel definitely has a \"Terminus systems\" feel to it. The game is darker, more violent, more \"evil\" if you will, and you won't be getting any help from the Alliance or the Council. While you're not \"on your own,\" you definitely are against the world in this. Working for the pseudo-terrorist organization, Cerebus, who players of One came across in the Traverse, you soon find your own pleasures and leisures gone, and you must make do with very little. This is reflected in the actual game, in the literal sense, and in the gameplay.Remember how I said, those who beat One on Insanity level and had earned the right to be cocky would no longer be able to be so? Well, this is true because the entire gameplay is overhauled and redone. Mostly inspired by \"Call of Duty\" but in a Third-Person shooter way, you'll have to be extremely careful in gunfights, as survival is number one. No more \"Scarface\" style, video-game-esque walking out into open space and Assault Rifle'ing everyone and anything that stands in your way. Taking cover is absolutely essential in this game. You try to Machine Gun an entire gang of enemies in the open and you WILL be massacred! There is no more health to use in ME2, and it is now all auto-regenerated, like in Call of Duty. When I first heard this, I was really upset and thought you'd waste hours in gunfights, waiting for your health to boost back up before shooting again. However, they somehow pull it off perfectly, here in ME2. Mainly it's because your health and shields boosts back up really quickly, no matter how hurt you are. Like, in two or three seconds. There's no long waits to recover, like I thought. Your shields are also pretty good at absorbing damage. One full-on rocket or grenade blast is what it'll take to fully shatter them in one blow. In ME1, this would normally insta-kill you. Even though the new system suprisingly doesn't make you miss Medi-Gel (it still exists in the game, but is only used to activate the Unity team recovery power), you still need to take cover as multiple hits from enemies shatter through your shields, and then health, pretty quickly. Cover is essential for survival. And unlike the \"wall-stick\" of One, this time, you can hold A to cover behind walls and boxes. The game is designed so that everything can be used to cover behind and that you'll almost always have a 'safe' place to hide. Also, you're given far FAR less powers and abilities. While the Soldier class can still use every gun in the game, the hybrid classes suffer a lot. There's about less than half the powers you used to be available to have. Partly, this is due to the new gameplay style, but a lot of it is just designed to give you a far tougher experience. And as you might know by now, the unlimited ammo guns are all gone. Now, you have to use ammo and conserve it, wisely. And specialized ammo is now a privilege, not a given. You have to upgrade your squad abilities to use such ammo as Incendiary and Disruptor (Proton, in ME1) ammo.So, with less powers, ammunition-required firearms, cover being mandatory to survive, special ammo being something you have to earn, and harder enemies to boot, you have a lot harder experience on your hands and are no longer given \"unlimited range\" to do whatever you want. It's kind of a positive and negative. You have a new gaming experience, but one where you're dealing with the bare minimum instead of having a wide range of powers and guns at your disposal. One good bonus is now, instead of a myriad of the same gun made by different manufacturers, all of your guns are now varied and unique. This means playing as an Adept, who is only limited to using pistols, isn't so bad anymore as you now get different pistols, such as a standard pistol, hand cannon, automatic pistol, and so on. This makes the gun restrictions of classes a lot MORE useful. Oh, and everyone gets the same Armor. (I'd guess it's an Onyx medium, comparing to ME1) But you get to customize your armor, however you want, choosing colors, patterns, and designs for it.The \"poor man's experience\" doesn't just stop with gunfights. Although you can import your Mass Effect 1 character and storyline actions into the game, you can't import any of their weapons, ammo, credits, or squad powers. Even if you've done three playthroughs with one character to get them to that almighty Level 60, you'll be starting from scratch again in the sequel. Squad powers are different now, and you only have four or five squad abilities now, instead of 15+. Leveling up powers will be done 1, 2, 3, or 4 points at a time, instead of one-by-one. And as I said, some things will be for what you used to have at any given time in One, like ammo. Yes, you have to level up just to use certain types of ammo. (And no, they aren't more powerful or that much different than they were in One.) When exploring the uncharted Terminus systems, you'll have to mine for resources. Where as in ME1, you got a planets' elements with the press of a button, this time, you'll need to spend money on probes and actually need to scan an ENTIRE PLANET to find elements. I'm guessing The Alliance had a division for that. You, do not. The Iridium, Platinum, and Palladium you find will be needed to upgrade weapons. No longer do you just find or buy upgrades. They have to be made, and require these elements. And you have to find them, yourself. It's like going from having an unlimited credit card, to finding pennies on the street. The \"good news\" I guess, is that doing it this way means gaining a lot more material from a planet than before. It is also an odd mix of interesting and EXTREMELY boring, at the same time. You know you need to mine that planet until it's utterly depleted, so you keep going, but anyone watching you do this will be bored to sleep. There also are no more Mako missions, where you drop down to planets and explore, either. Many people will be disappointed by this, by many other people who felt it tedious and boring, will be thrilled.Your new characters all have different personalities, and allows the player to definitely pick and choose their favorites. While I may hate Jack's juvenile attitude, to many other people, she may be a favorite. While Mordin may be a hyperactive William Shatner to some, to others, he may be downright annoying. This helps to definitely give you a unique gaming experience. But in my personal opinion, ten characters may be too much, even if it is only four more than before. In this game, you'll have to do \"loyality\" missions, similiar to the Dr. Saleon mission you did for Garrus in ME1, or the Family Armor one you did for Wrex. These missions do two things. One, they help determine how much, if at all, your character trusts you. And two, they help build them up for the big and final \"suicide\" mission you go on at the end of the game. These missions help determine just how useful they are in battle when there's more focus on them over your other ally. You may find out someone isn't all that good. Or vise versa, and that they're better than you thought them to be.The imports from Mass Effect 1 don't have nearly as much of an impact as one would think. Although the facial import is pretty darn impressive (they look exactly the same in One, aside from a few new scars), everything else is described in the beginning when you export them. The only major imports aside from your Shepard are who died on Virmire, if the Council survived, and who was appointed onto the council following the Battle of the Citadel. And while you can change combat classes, no matter what you were before, I disliked how they didn't let you *edit* your imported character's physical appearance in ME2. My female Shepard always had too high cheekbones that I didn't notice until I started playing One and I was hoping to fix that when I imported her into ME2. When I ended Mass Effect 1, I had a male Paragon Soldier who saved the Council, spared people's lives no matter what, and appointed Anderson as the fourth member of the Council. And a female Renegade Adept who left the Council to die, didn't choose anyone to replace the dead Council, and was only nice to her fellow teammates and no one else. Upon importing both Marvin and Kristen into ME2, the only noticable differences I seen right away was the love interest who helped my Shepard save the original Normandy crew when it was being attacked, and when I traveled to the Citadel to see who's in charge. (By the way, you can't really travel to the Presidium on the Citadel, anymore. Instead, you go to a tacky, working class part of the Citadel called the Zakera Ward and it's really lame.) Maybe as I play along, I'll find more differences, but the sad reality of it seems to be that all those minor (and major) choices from ME1 don't really matter, anymore. I don't even think it matters if anyone survived the first game or not. You could've hypothetically had everyone but Garrus and Tali die in One, and it wouldn't matter at all in Two.Being a Paragon or Renegade has much less of an effect in the game. While the dialogue options are still there, based on your morality, the actual changes done to the entire game are minimal. They effect how, or if, your scars will heal. But beside that, the choices are just for fun, only. One new feature lets you \"change the cutscene\" by performing a quick-action, on-queue Paragon or Renegade action while a character is talking to create a new path for the conversation. (Doing these will mean missing the usually good dialogue, though.) Ultimately, the choices don't really matter, anymore. One problem I had with the Renegade path in ME1 is that even while performing Renegade actions, your character still felt \"too good.\" There wasn't enough killing people in cold-blood or being borderline evil, just for the sake of it. And in the choices, you felt more like you had to be a Paragon, not because the Renegade options were bad, but because being a Renegade just meant being a pr*ck, more than anything else. Renegade aren't \"evil\" actions; they're just assh*le actions, instead. And there's even less of a feel of being tough and ruthless here, rather than just being a do*che. So even my supposedly-Renegade female Shepard still ended up being about 40% Paragon just because of how big of a jerk Renegade Shepard is.Overall, Mass Effect 2 is a brand new adventure, with some elements of the past behind it. In some regards, it's actually better played if you've never played the first game, before. You certainly have a lot to get used to in the sequel and experts and veterans on One will have to start all over again in learning how to play, even if exporting their seasoned character from the first game. While it is interesting and worth it's sixty dollar price, in terms of depth, scope, and replay value, in many ways, it's not as \"good\" as the first game. It's a much tougher experience from the original and takes doing a lot of side work in order to succeed. With that said, I don't know how many new players of the series may like the game. Those expecting non-stop action may become bored, fast. Those unused to third-person shooters like this may find the game much too difficult. And a select few who casually played the original may hate the new changes and sacrifices the sequel puts you through. Ultimately, the vast majority of players to this game will be those who played and enjoyed Mass Effect, the original. I guess it's good so many players enjoyed ME1, then. While it definitely feels like they've worked and expanded on a lot in ME2, it just isn't as much... fun. No, it's not nearly as fun, this time around. The game is just more depressing and involves a lot more side work, which sometimes comes off as a tedious chore. Mass Effect 2 also has quite a few noticeable glitches in it, too. Sloppy looking work. In One, the only real glitch was the High Explosive Ammo force that often sent enemies behind walls or into floors. In 2, there are sometimes object glitches, as well as menu glitches, like not letting you go back to something with B.To sum it all up, Mass Effect 2 is fine enough for fans of the original, despite all its changes, but may not be worth it for those foreign to the series. While ME1 was almost universally liked and praised for its innovation, exploration, and fun, Mass Effect 2 is just a lot more depressing, requires a lot more work, and is a lot more difficult. That's fine if you're looking forward to continuing your Shepard into the lawless Terminus systems. But for everyone else, it's a bit of a \"chore video game\".*** Some post-game negatives I thought I should add onto here ***Your partner AI is really dumb. While more helpful than the first game, they almost ALWAYS run right out into danger, with no cover or anything. Unless you don't care about them, you'll often find yourself using Unity to revive them because they foolishly keep rushing out into open fire and you have to direct them to safe spots to keep them from consistently getting killed. They also love to hop over cover objects a lot, for some reason.The Machine Pistol (the first one you get) is just the worst weapon ever. Now, re-playing the game as my female Renegade Adept, I have to say using that machine pistol is just dreadful. I loathe it to a T. I'd rather waste Heavy Weapon ammo on weaklings than to be forced to use that stupid pistol. It's too bad the regular Heavy Pistol has low ammo clips, because I just dread using that Godawful machine pistol so, so much. It's weak, it's slow, and it's VERY inaccurate! Even the Battle Rifle and Hand Cannon are better weapons and they're terrible, too! The second, upgraded machine pistol is slightly better, but still...The first Mass Effect did not have the dialogue problem the second has. Repeating, looping dialogue! When you're on the Citadel's Zakera Ward, you hear the same three lines of conversation with civilians over and over and OVER! The first game had it play once and then, that was it! Unless, you talked to them to get them to repeat what they said. Also, the slanderous reporter lady still hangs around there AFTER talking to (or punching) her. Uh... that shouldn't be the case. They really dropped the ball with NPC interaction in this game. The looping dialogues and characters standing around all useless, doesn't look good.And perhaps the biggest flaw... WHY do you need two discs for a game that's literally half as much as the first game? When Shepard can only get to Level 30 and there are only, at the most, nine or ten side missions to find and discover while scanning planets, why do we even need two discs? It feels so cheap. Half the game with twice as many discs. How does that happen?Again, I feel it's important I note these flaws in the game. Hopefully, looking back on this when Mass Effect 3 comes out, I hope we will be able to see Mass Effect 2 as an entertaining game, but ultimately and undenibaly the weakest link out of the three. It's still a fun game, but I'm not sure it's worth sixty dollars, especially since it's literally half the game Mass Effect 1 was. I say, wait until the price drops under thirty dollars before buying this game. It's still fun and worth playing at least twice. It's just not \"sixty dollars\" fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2010"}

{"product_name":"B008AU4YEA","description":"","reviewerName":"Ryan Sil. (Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...","summary":"Best platformer EVER (sans touch screen, that is...)!","reviewText":"In my review of Rayman Origins, I stated that it was one of the best platformers I've ever played, right alongside one of my other favorite games of all time: Super Mario World. Well, for my birthday five days ago, this was the game I received as a present. It was all I needed! And I was still able to say that after playing it. THIS is THE best platformer I've ever gotten my hands on, PERIOD - Super Mario World has finally been kicked off the throne for my personal favorite game of all time. No game has ever made me smile throughout the long period of time I played a game for, until this masterpiece came along!The gameplay is almost identical to that of Rayman Origins - You jump, you punch/kick, you collect Lums, you do whatever it takes to go and rescue the trapped Teensies. However, as simple as it sounds, it is amazingly executed. Rayman and friends already feel very fluid and fun to play with, but the game constantly introduces new things and keeps everything fresh, even considering the fact that you start out with moves that you would have to unlock back in Origins! The level design is equally brilliant and contains all sorts of fun platforming elements and interactivity with the environments such as swinging on vines, using wind gusts to fly, using Murfy to assist you in some areas, and the list goes ON.Speaking of level design, the game throws in a cute bonus package of levels lifted straight from its predecessor! The levels have been untouched (with the exception of the Teensies' placements), but they are still great to hop and bop around.There are also levels in which you need to keep your pace as you zip through them without slowing down! It shouldn't be a major turn-off for those that ache from such things since they only contain 3 Teensies each as opposed to 10 in normal levels (Teensies are more-or-less required to unlock various things including other levels and worlds anyway). And keep in mind there's 700 of them in total!Now how are the graphics here......JUST LOOK AT IT! You don't even NEED to see video footage here to be amazed at how lovingly crafted the game looks and IS! This time, it just takes a single GAZE at a SCREENSHOT to realize how amazingly crafted the game is! I said in my Rayman Origins review that that was the finest 2D graphics could go. The lovelies at Ubisoft Montpelier begged to differ, according to this unbelievably colorful and lively atmosphere the entire game is provided with!The soundtrack is, of course, also phenomenal. Each soundtrack as a whole is extremely diverse and contains songs of pretty much every instrumental genre out there, from rock to orchestrated to even Rayman-y remixes of licensed music!If there's one thing I feel like I need to note, though, is that when I played the Wii U version of Rayman Legends, there was just one issue I had with it: Murfy. Don't put up your torches please! Lemme explain!I completely understand that Legends was gonna be Wii U-exclusive until Ubisoft made a bonehead move to delay it to the same month as Grand Theft Auto V, resulting in how it wouldn't sell well like its predecessor hadn't. However, when playing the Wii U version, I felt that the touch screen control for Murfy, while nice, interrupted the game's flow, something I felt was very jarring considering the quality in literally everything else. In the Xbox 360 version, you just press/hold the B button for Murfy's actions, which is something you can do almost instantly, enabling you to keep the pace. Therefore, I believe that edition of the game is slightly superior.But overall...Just, what else can I say? This game is as close to flawless as it can get, and I didn't even mentioned the other goodies the game has in stock (Including unlockable costumes for characters, various challenges you can participate in, and even a minigame titled Kung Foot)! I have no clue how much higher I can praise this masterpiece, and I already said that it beat out Super Mario World as my all-time favorite game!No matter what console you own, you NEED to buy this game! Please.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000087H7T","description":"Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B00008ODBQ","description":"Following in the tradition of previous Blizzard expansion sets,Warcraft III: The Frozen Throneprovides gamers with a vast new chapter in the epic Warcraft saga. In the single-player campaign, players revisit the war-torn world of Azeroth. Several months have passed since Archimonde and the Burning Legion were defeated at the battle of Mount Hyjal, yet a new threat has arisen throughout the land...One new Hero per race, each possessing powerful spells and magical abilities.A host of new units, each equipped with new abilities and spells, giving players the opportunity to create diverse strategic and tactical forms of combat.Player-built shops, unique for each race, equipped with items carefully designed to improve and aid the units of every race.Neutral Heroes, available for recruitment by all players, that can supplement and strengthen a player's army with all new spells and abilities.Expanded multiplayer optionsover Battle.net including multiple new game types, clan and tournament support.","reviewerName":"Bee","summary":"Want to see something real scary? Then read these reviews.","reviewText":"I feel compelled I suppose to bunk some of the other reviews that have been posted for Frozen Throne. The one's that state \"this game will rock\" I need not say anything about, cause you already know to take them with a grain of salt. But for the one's that are written by actual beta testers (like myself), I need to update you on the facts, and correct some mistakes.First off, it's hard to really rate or give a knowledgeable review of Frozen Throne because those of us that are beta testers are only getting to see the multi-player, on-line aspect of the game. There will also be an extension to the storyline of WC3, of which we can only guess at until the game is out. To give a really in-depth review of the whole game, a person would need the complete expansion.Another thing that I find upsetting is that one of the reviewers has gotten a lot of helpful votes, just for the simple fact that people don't know whether he's correct or not. His review would have been appropriate when he wrote it. He wrote his review in March, and the game has made some drastic changes since then. So, for example, saying that Orc Batriders are overpowered is no longer applicable. To be honest, people rarely use them anymore.Also, there is no Night Elf hero that can change Day into Night. That is an item that the Night Elves can buy from their own specific shop. To explain this, each race has the ability to build their own shop, which is very inexpensive at the moment, from which they can buy items, such as scroll of town portals, heath potions, etc. Each race has certain item specific to them. Like the Night Elf item to change the time of day or the Undead item called a Wand of Necromancy that can summon 2 skeletons from a corpse.  But for some reason Blizzard decided to give Undead that item, but take away the Wand of Negation from the Original WarCraft 3.  I haven't understood that move (taking away the Wand of Negation) since the beta started.There are many other changes as well, but if I was to try and list them all, it would take me quite a while.  Just rest assured that Blizzard has done a bang up job of not only making it feel like an expansion, but also adding the excitement back to when we first got WarCraft 3 and got to try out all the \"new\" stuff.  And if I listed them all, I would take away some of the excitement of when you first pop it in and play it yourself.Okay now that I got that off my chest, my opinion on FT so far is that it is fantastic! Bear in mind that I am only reviewing this game from the multi-player, on-line, battle.net aspect of it; I have no idea what the storyline will be to the game.Veterans to WC3 will find some very interesting changes in Frozen Throne. While still not complete, the game seems to be reaching its home stretch. Blizzard does an excellent job of fixing balance issues, as many WC3 players already know. So that's why it was not a good idea for someone to post in March on how powerful certain units were, because Blizzard has since fixed that issue and it's no longer true. Recently they changed it so that you can get Wyverns at tier 2 now, but whether or not that will stay in the final edition, I can't say.I personally give the game 5 stars because it excels at what I loved about WC3 so much. The on-line aspect. In all my years of gaming I don't remember a game that has pulled me in as much as WC3 has, and now Frozen Throne.There is however a nice learning curve. Even if you are very good at WC3, you will run into some bumps in the road with Frozen Throne. But this is to be expected with new units, new heroes, new buildings and new creeps. Be warned though, a lot of the newer creeps are very, very tough and are not to be fought unless you have quite a few units. I say this mostly in the vain hope that I don't get to hear \"our alley's hero has fallen\" to creeps. So don't say I didn't warn you, he, he.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2003"}

In the single-player campaign, you are given the role of Solid Snake, a mercenary who lives his life trying to do what is right. As in the previous games, Metal Gear Solid 4 is full of storytelling and there is a lot of time spent developing the story through cutscenes and other various methods. Throughout the game, Snake will adventure through 5 different chapters all in completely different areas with many enemies, action/stealth sequences and bosses as well. By the end of the game, it is hard not to have a great liking for Snake and the battle for survival becomes as fierce as ever before. It is safe to say that just about every emotion is drawn out of a player throughout the course of the game, and it is also safe to say that the conclusion of the game and the series itself is one that is incredibly memorable.Controls:Surprisingly, Konami has finally hit the nail on the head with the control scheme for this latest installment. While the core mechanics remain, the rotational action camera and cover system have given the game a whole new level of depth. Previous games had fixed cameras which a player would have to fight with to see in the direction desired. This time around, the controls feel cohesive and responsive, and it really helps setup a solid multi-player experience as well.Graphics:Whether in the deep jungle or in the snow, the graphics of Metal Gear Solid 4 have really turned out to be something special. Seeing the Metal Gear world in such rich detail for the first time is an experience to be unforgotten for many Metal Gear fans. The character models within the game have proven to be some of the highest quality models of any console game to date. On the other hand, the wall and ground textures have been comprimised and are low-resolution. Thankfully, the terrific lighting effects and atmosphere help hide this little smudge on what is otherwise a masterpiece.Sound:Metal Gear has gained notoriety for its deep storytelling and voice casting, and Metal Gear Solid 4 really helps solidify that statement. The voice acting is as good as ever before with returning and new cast including David Hayter as Snake and Quinton Flynn as Raiden. Also, the music has once again been orchestrated marvelously with a soundtrack similar to an action movie. There is also a built in iPod where you can play whichever song you'd like while playing with many unlockable songs throughout the game. Not to mention that the sound effects are well-done and really help the setting of the game and draw out intense emotions during firefights.Replay Value:With a roughly 20 hour single-player campaign with many unlockables, the single-player alone justifies the pricetag. Also included is Metal Gear Online which is a very competitive and popular online experience with teamwork and stealth elements fully utilized. The online portion has 2 expansion packs which include a variety of content but come at a cost. Thankfully, neither of them are required but are definitely recommended if a player wants to get the full experience out of the game. The online has tournaments, tracked stats, gear unlocks and many other implementations that make it one of the most complete online experiences in quite some time. With the online portion of Metal Gear Solid coupled with the deep and emotionally-ridden single-player campaign, Metal Gear Solid 4 is one of the better console purchases to date.Rating:Story:10.0Gameplay: 10.0Graphics: 9.5Controls: 9.5Sound: 10Replay Value: 10Overall: 10.0Own, rent or avoid:Own. The single-player campaign has unlocks and reasons to come back for more. The multi-player is full of competition and customization to give any player a very rich experience.Closing Statement:If you haven't played this game then you are really missing out. Metal Gear Solid 4 is hands down one of the highest quality and overall greatest games ever made.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"Nona","summary":"Another enjoyable entry into the MGS series","reviewText":"Metal Gear Solid 4 was probably the most high profile game released for the Playstation 3 during the initial launch of the console.  Even if you had never played any of the previous Metal Gear Solid games, you almost certainly had heard of them.  In many respects, the MGS series is sui generis; its mix of combat and stealth gameplay was revolutionary when the first MGS was released, and its over the top storylines and legendarily long cutscenes are as well-known if not even more well-known than the gameplay.  Metal Gear Solid 4 follows in the tradition of the previous three games, with refinements in the gameplay to make the game more enjoyable.You can rest assured that the crazy plot twists and long cutscenes are still present in Metal Gear Solid 4.  As a matter of fact, MGS4 does a fine job of trying to unify the stories the previous three games - and to say anything more would risk spoiling the rather well-written plot.  The cutscenes are gorgeously rendered by the Playstation 3, and can actually be skipped.  This game has notably fewer codec scenes than the previous three games, despite the fact that the animation during codec conversations is better than it has ever been.  I should probably note that the story won't make a lot of sense without having played the previous three games, and it is a good idea to play those three before MGS4 if you haven't yet.The gameplay of MGS4 represents a rather substantial departure from the previous three games.  Combat is now mostly done in an over-the-shoulder view, and there is now complete flexibility in the angle at which you can set the camera.  While it may take some time for veteran MGS players to get used to the new controls, once you do get used to them they are probably better than the control schemes of any of the previous games.  There is also considerable customization in the weaponry you can use, and as always has been the case in MGS games, there are usually multiple ways of fighting enemies and progressing through the game.Metal Gear Solid games have never been particularly long, and this game is no exception.  A first time playthrough, in which you watch all the cutscenes, will probably take sometime between 15 and 25 hours, depending on your skill level.  Fortunately, the story is quite interesting, and the gameplay is superb.  It's clear that the designers spent a lot of effort in polishing the combat in the game.  There is a good mix of sneaking, combat on foot, and combat on vehicles, and the boss fights are reasonably challenging and quite interesting.  There's also considerable motivation to play through the game multiple times, since you can experiment with different ways of beating the bosses and will have access to new items in repeat playthroughs.If you have access to the Internet, it is possible to download an \"MGS4 encyclopedia\", which contains entries on key events, characters, locations, and more, for all the Metal Gear games (not just the MGS series, but also the Metal Gear games and the games on handhelds).  The lore in the Metal Gear series is so immense that this application does a good job of refreshing your memory about the previous games and organizing all that information in one place.  While there is protection against MGS4 spoilers (you can't read entries on MGS4 unless there is a cleared file of the game on your PS3 hard drive), there is no such protection against spoilers for any of the other games.Overall, MGS4 is a fantastic game on the PS3, and has deserved the many accolades it has already received.  With the price of the game being not much more than many Blu-Ray movies out there, this is a great deal and if you own a PS3 but don't own this game yet, you should buy it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2009"}

To start things off it is heavier than both. The sticks placement although completely based on preference is just feels weird and unnatural compared to holding an xbox or nintendo controller. The battery is the worst for any controller out there including last gen, expect to be conected to your console constantly. So much for a next gen controller and console that cant even do wireless right. Its just like a electric car. Great gas mileage but you only get  50 miles at a time. The touch screen seems cool but it is just a lame gimmick that could only be useful in fruit ninja. The light on the controller just further drains the battery.

I wanted a game that was easy to jump into. Boy was it a mistake getting this game.The game punishes you for being good. 1st place? Not for long!Everyone from 4th-12th place gets stars, red shells, green shells, blue shells (which hit exclusively those in 1st place), lightening / POW which hit all but he or she whom uses it, and speed boost. Once hit by a blueshell, youll then get bombarded by green shells and red shells and run off the track by other players. Once hit by lightening or POW you lose all your itmes. Period.But do not fret 1st placer, you will get so many banana's that you actually go banana's. Thats not all, you may get an upside down cube... or *gasp* green shell that you can blindly throw backwards.But if you suck at this game, boy are you gonna love it. You get stars to knock everyone out of the way, or even a bullet which is basically an automatic first place. Screw up again and again? No worry, more stars and bullets.I dont mind chance, I love chance (such as poker). But imagine texas hold em if the losing person automatically got pocket aces every hand while the chip leader got 7 2 offsuit. Not so interested in betting anymore, eh?It wouldn't be so bad if you got to save an item after getting hit, eg you get a mushroom while in 6th place and get hit by lightening but you dont drop the mushroom. Or if, FOR THE LOVE OF (insert preferred deity) the first place person could get some kinda shield... every once in awhile.Nintendo's pretty damned arrogant thinking I want to play Luigi's Circuit 32,768 times in order to unlock Baby Daisy.Online mode? Im getting better. But as with most any online game, noobs are gonna get frustrated by those who have played dozens of hours and can get through the courses with their eyes closed.The game feels close to impossible using the motion sensors. While the motion controls are good, the level of drifting accuracy needed to compensate for the cheap POS computer can only be done with a remote.This would be a fun party game with friends, but if you get this and expect to jump right in and kick some mario butt, please reconsider. There will be words coming out of your mouth in tounges you never knew. You will be bombarded by shells both online and off. You will lose your mind, body soul.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

But the first time I picked up the controller and played a demo, I was sold and half.The controller really is the perfect shape and size to fit the average human hand. It takes the general design of the PSX and PS2 controller and streamlines it to do away with any awkwardness inherent in the design. Shigeru Miyamoto himself spent considerable time working on the controller design to perfect it, and it really shows. There is absolutely not controller, first- or third-party made that feels better and can be used longer.The system is incredible. Nintendo has decided not to try to split power between DVD and CD playing, and focus purely on gameplay. And that's a good thing. This is the machine of a blue-blooded gamer, someone who only cares about the love of the game, not number of the widgets. The built in fan keeps the system cool for literally hours. Unlike the XBOX, which was shipped in 2001 without a cooling fan, the Cube can be left on for hours at a time with not skip or melt or shutdown. In addition, unlike the crashing experienced too often on the XBOX, the majority of GC's won't crash during their lifetime. Add to that the most durable shell ever seen on any console, and you have a hell of a well-put-together system.The medium, additionally, is, according to third party publishers, the easiest to use. And it more than does its job, as attested to in its fantastic library. Nintendo has always tried to make titles for all ages, and on the Cube it has succeeded:Eternal Darkness (rated M)Resident Evil (M)Resident Evil 0 (M)Zelda: The Wind Waker (E)Rogue Leader (T)F-Zero GX (T)Resident Evil 4 (M)Animal Crossing (E)Pikmin (E)Metroid Prime (T)Super Mario Sunshine (E)Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes (M)The list goes on, but you get the point. The GC has the largest library of AAA first party titles of any system. . . well, ever. Far from being a \"kiddie machine,\" the Gamecube manages a wide range of variety meets quality.Now, many people would complain about the lack of online support for the GC. I'm not one of them. I have a computer, thank you very much, and that meets my online gaming needs just fine. I don't need to go to the net on my Cube to be happy with my system.And that's what it gets down to. The GC has seen more play time in my house than any other system. It's just the fact that the games on the system are fun. With PS2 and XBOX, I find myself waiting for the next Halo, Metal Gear Solid, or Grand Theft Auto, with little to no must-haves in between. However, with multiple branches of Nintendo working on its different franchises, along with it farming off some to third-party publishers, the games I love are flowing more freely on the Cube than any other system.All in all, this system, especially considering the recent price drop, is well worth the purchase, and with a solid line-up on the 2004 horizon, there has never been a better time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2003"}

Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or fighting the good fight solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support.Multiple Controller SupportMonster Hunter Trifeatures a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes. And finally the Wii Remote allows the ability to save your character&rsquo;s information directly to it, just as is possible with Miis, so you&rsquo;re always ready to play at a friend&rsquo;s house.Key Game FeaturesSpecial Controller Included- Designed with input from the Capcom development team, the Wii Classic Controller Pro is included in this bundle.Hunt Together- In the hunt, you&rsquo;re never alone. Hunt together with up to 4 players online or take on arena quests with 2-player split-screen action. In single player mode, you even have the ability to hunt with AI-controlled characters named ChaCha.Communicate Online- Because communication is key in coordinated huntsMonster Hunter Trisupports Wii Speak and text chat.Monsters with Unique Abilities and Attacks- Monsters have unique and dynamic personalities, abilities and defenses, increasing in complexity as the player progresses. They camouflage themselves to ambush hunters, but will flee or call for help if outmatched.Immense Living, Breathing World with Ecosystem- Monsters interact amongst each other in a living breathing ecosystem, complete with food chain. Monsters have stamina, migrate and even attack one another, the strong feeding on the weak.New Underwater Maps- For the first time ever in anyMonster Huntergame, you will be able explore land and sea and hunt monsters of the deep.Fully Customizable Equipment- With ten weapon categories &ndash; including the all-new Switch Axe &ndash; and new armor and weaponry created from the remains of slain monsters, there are almost limitless opportunities for equipment customization.Choice of Controls- Play with either the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, with the Classic Controller or Classic Controller Pro.Take Your Character with You- The ability to save your character to your Wii Remote lets you engage in multiplayer hunts anytime on a friend's console.","reviewerName":"Adol A.","summary":"Not what I expected compared to other RPGs.","reviewText":"So I bought this game on Gamestop, thought it'd be awesome. To be fair it's an okay game, and a lot of people give this game good reviews, which is fair to me. However, I didn't expect this game to be as complicated as it was (at least to me). There's a lot of stuff you have to know in the game, such as combining certain ingredients to make certain stuff, hunting enemies for bones and such.Keep in mind, THIS IS NOT AN RPG WHERE YOU GO AROUND AND KILL MONSTERS JUST TO LEVEL UP YOUR CHARACTER! You have to buy your basic beginning equipment, and either mine (pickaxes break after like 10-20 ores mined by the way, gets a bit irritating to constantly have to spend tons of zenni on pickaxes, especially when making zenni without doing the quests is hard on its own) or hunt down certain enemies to get materials.The quests are good, I'll give it that. However it's mostly having to go to a certain map and hunt down monsters, which is fine, but in one of the first quests you have to fish for certain fish, and they rarely spawn. You have a time limit of 50 minutes to catch 3 goldenfish. Sounds easy enough, but the fish rarely spawn, and when they come, you have to be deadpoint accurate to catch them. If you're 1/4th of a second off, you'll most likely lose some bait and have to try again. I had to repeat this quest since I ran out of time, and I had 2 fish. Kinda irritated me that I had to waste another 30-45 min to do the same quest again.It's a good game, gets the praise and respect it deserves, but it didn't suit me. I like RPGs that you have to get experience to level and buy/hunt down equipment from monsters, not constantly gather objects (you can only have 10 of an object in your inventory by the way, and it maxes out fast). If you're looking for a new type of RPG, check this one out. However if you're like me, make sure you either rent it first to see if you like it, or watch videos on Youtube.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2011"}

In just about every way, this game gets 5 stars.  Graphics, gameplay, story, multiplayer, special features, etc...Here's what I thought of Star Craft/Star Craft Brood War, part of the BattleChest collection for the PC.1) Gameplay: Perhaps the best I have EVER played.  In this world of the future, humans (Terran) have changed, and become one large army: the Confederacy.  They are able to explore space, have an incredible array of weapons, and have explored much of the universe.  But on these trips to different planets and such, they discover they are not alone in this universe.  2 other dominant races exist out in space, and both of them threaten the Terran world as we know it.  It's time for war, and thats where the game begins.The story has 30 missions in all, and lets you control each race (3: Zerg, Terran, and Protoss) for 8-12 mission per race.  Each race has strengths, weaknesses, etc...  And dozens of things to build.  But first, before u can build anything, u have to mine minerals and gas.  To do this, u must build Probes/SCV's/Drones.  At the beginning of missions, u will get a Nexus(Command Center/Hatchery) (basicly what holds your minerals and gas and makes new gatherers).  With the Nexus(Command Center/Hatchery), u make Probes (SCV's/Drones) to gather minerals and gas.  Once u have enough minerals and gas, u can build more complex structures.  Soldiers, Air Units, Anti-Aircraft guns, etc...  As the game goes on, u r faced with how to use your minerals/gas, etc...  With your soldiers and air units, u carry out missions.  For example, destroying a base, or defending a leader, surviving for 30 minutes, etc....  The thing about Star Craft is, you need to out think your opponant.  If the person has anti-aircraft guns and more soldiers than you, you need to get them into a Drop Ship, and perhaps go to the side of their base, drop them off, and proceed.  There are so many ways of doing things, and so many things to build, the game really is EXTREMELY fun, and you can find new ways to do things every time.  The more you play, the more you will enjoy it.  It truly is a never-ending game.  And once you beat the game, it's time to take your talent online.  Get to that later...2) Graphics: EXCELLENT!  I have never seen such excellent graphics for this type of game.  Everything fits perfectly.  There is blood after a soldier is killed, explosions are very dramatic, u can see the sparks as minerals are mined up by cutting SCV's.  When hurt, Zerg buildings bleed, etc (don't get the idea this is gory, its really not, just little red sparks on the screen when something is injured or killed)...  Everything casts a shadow, things can turn invisible, etc...  It's excellent!  The world's you play in our top notch as well.  Shadows, mountains, trees, animals wandering around, etc....  It truly works well for this type of game.  Graphics are top notch here (especially for when it was made).3) Multiplayer: The main reason this game stands out.  It is absolutely incredible!  You can play against the computer, system link, and of course, go ONLINE.  When you play online, your record is kept, so you can try to earn some respect out there!  There are clans, literally THOUSANDS of StarCraft players waiting to play 24-7.  And it really is neat to see some of the strategies people have made, the beauty and creativity of a well constructed base, etc...  You can play with your friends as \"allies\", Melee, Capture the Flag, etc...  The possibilities are endless!  Some people master either the Protoss, Zerg, or Terran, while others use a different race every time.  Each one has strengths and weaknesses, and things you might be able to do better with them then you could with other races.  It really is great, and for the price, I don't think you can find better online entertainment, as Battle-Net is FREE, and the SC BattleChest is just 20 bucks.4) Lasting Appeal: Proof that this game IS incredible, and one of the top 10 games of all time?  It literally was made 5 years ago, and still has 30,000+ people playing online at any given moment.  It is still a Best-Seller, and is just a classic in the world of RTS (Real Time Strategy), and just Video Games period.  I bought this game 4 months ago, and literally play it for hours every day.Overall, this is a great game.  Online, the INCREDIBLE story (very creative and well put together), the races, the graphics, the price($$$), etc...  If you have a PC and are low on $$$, and are looking for not a good, but a GREAT game that will last you for many years (for all ages 9+), StarCraft is for you!*Note though, if going online, I'd recommend having a Cable or DSL modem.  56K is good, but High Speed internet is just so much better in my opinion!  ...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00004SWL9","description":"Just when it seems 3-D fighting games have permanently made 2-D fighting  games obsolete, something likeMarvel vs. Capcom 2comes along and proves  just how deep and fun 2-D fighters can be. It's better than its predecessor in  every way, and arguably the best 2-D fighting game to grace the Dreamcast.The amount of playable characters is enough to put any fighting fan's salivary  glands in overdrive. Beginning with favorites such as Spider Man, Wolverine,  Ryu, and Chun Li, players can eventually unlock 56 characters. We had our hands  full just mastering a few of these fighters, and getting familiar with all 56  would take months of intense practice. There are almost too many moves, all  depicted with superb animation and augmented by several tag-team combos. When  the match begins, you can pick three characters. Once things heat up, you can  call in your pals to unleash a massive move on your opponent. This adds  immensely to the game's depth, and button mashers will be in for a shock when  they find that their mistimed tag-team moves backfire.Visually, this game is intense. The large characters are slightly jagged around  the edges, but that's more than compensated for by the massive amount of  animation frames, colorful special effects, and stunning 3-D backgrounds that  are loaded with detail.Marvel vs. Capcom 2also delivers a sonic  performance that is nearly arcade-perfect. This is a must-buy for any fighting  fan, especially those who have a couple of buddies to bash. Just be prepared to  put in a lot of time in practice mode if you want to get good.--T.

Guberlal","summary":"Problem filled Gamepad","reviewText":"I want to make this review rather short. First, it's an easy to install Gamepad and looks very promising. You have the easy PS2 feel, dual-analog control pads, and a comfortable fit. You can install the drivers or not. It doesn't really make a difference because Windows will recognize it.The problem with this Gamepad is that it is not very durable. I bought and tested this controller with MVP Baseball 2005 & Need for Speed Underground 2. What happened is, I had to take the controller back 3 times to have it replaced because the analog sticks would give out or get stuck in a certain postion. Now, in MVP Baseball, for example, you need the right stick to dive/slide with. Well, the analog stick stuck to the right in 2 of them I tried, so that ends up leaving you to have automatic fielding because you can't get to the ball when the player is diving for no reason. With Need for Speed, I found that the 1 controller where the left analog stick went out, the cars were just out of control.There are many reviews online as I have found that confirm that Logitech never addressed this controllers issues. Even Tech. Support kept telling me I had just bought a bad controller when I called them on each one.Be aware, once the analog stick goes, whether it is 2 days or 2 months, you can't calibrate it. The GamePad is useless. I would suggest you go with Nyko's AirFlo Gamepad instead. I've had no problems with that one.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0088MVP3S","description":"","reviewerName":"ObiWanShinobi","summary":"Falls Short.","reviewText":"As a long-standing (and very dedicated) fan of the Castlevania series - the reviews that preceded the release of this game did little to deter me from purchasing it. And if you're an avid fan as well, then I would say the same can probably be true for you.However if you're considering whether to buy this new or are just not the type of person to pickup a Castlevania game simply b/c there's a new one - then the following is for you.While the overall story arc is a continuation of the very awesome LOS, and the basic action oriented gameplay is the same...there are a couple of very real issues in this here sequel that keep it from being as good as the last one. And while I am usually hesitant to give any credence to the usually overly-thoughtout professional critiques of any game - this time they're generally right.The gameplay keeps with the basic GOW style that the first LOS established, but takes the &#34;clone&#34; aspect to the place where it's a straight up copy. If you played the latest entry in the GOW then you've played this. You can upgrade the three preset weapons you have via a basic skill tree from XP gained in combat. The new moves you get would be cool - if you could use any of them. I had this complaint with the first one as well, as both the enemy AI and the sheer amount of them this time around makes skilled combat almost impossible. You're going to be mashing the crap out of the primary attack button a lot more than you'd like.The &#34;open world&#34; also really isn't that open, but it's def a step up from the previous linear setup. It's NOT even close to Symphony of the Night. It's just a bunch of backtracking to get a life/magic bar gem or two, but at least there's a level of exploration.I've also heard folks complain about the way the game missed out on the opportunity to use a more &#34;modern day&#34; setting. And while usually those kinds of complaints are &#34;nitpicking&#34; in my opinion, in this case it's true. The backdrops/stage settings for this really do lack that Castlevania flair and are about as generic as possible. The original LOS nailed that. And while graphically there are some cool moments, you can't help but get bored with the types of things you've seen in everything from Resident Evil to GOW. If deserted alley ways with garbage cans, and overly complicated lava bridges are your thing...well then prepare to have your cup run over.And the &#34;stealth&#34; aspects are as bad as everybody says. In addition to making absolutely no sense (i.e. Dracula can take down a whole army of enemies&#8230;some of which are way bigger than he is but still needs to sneak around certain ones?) towards the end they get frustrating as all get out. It's also just another mechanic to get you to &#34;do something,&#34; but serves no purpose.And outside of generic &#34;pretty much everything&#34; I think that's one of my biggest complaints about this game. Most of the time the mechanics are thrown in just to increase playtime. For instance, you'll sometimes have to switch between the current modern setting and &#34;the past&#34; via a series of portals that you stand on. Which would be fine if you didn't have to activate the portal and then walk over to somewhere else on screen, then walk through this weird dream phase and then walk out of it. It's well past the point in time in game development where should be able to just stand on the portal and be done with it. It's just padding.And this ties into the fact that for the first time ever you're playing Dracula in a Castlevania game&#8230;which should be awesome. But outside of the first few minutes - just isn't. Does the Prince of Darkness really have to climb up old beams to get somewhere? Really? I mean that makes for a great Uncharted/Tomb Raider mechanic&#8230;but here it's just silly.Now all that aside - the overall story is great (the execution leaves much to be desired) and it's not a &#34;bad&#34; action game pound for pound. But it's not special, and there's so much about the experience that's just too generic and/or contrived to make this worth it. I am really glad that there are Castlevania fans out there that are loving this game, but for me this is the literally definition of mediocre.And if you're trying to figure out if this game is worth it - honestly I could have given this a miss and been better off. If you're not die-hard Castlevania fan then there's nothing LOS2 has that will make it worth your time/money. Unless you've got an unlimited supply of both.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2014"}

I never played the older versions, so the storylines were new to me, as well.  This was another great addition that has quickly become one of my favorites although it had a shaky start.Story-This game takes place years in the future, and I think that it is a different planet than earth.  The ability to use magic has been lost after a huge war, and most people have started living very peacefully.  However, one man wants to reawaken the power to use magic and invents something called Magitek which is basically a surgical way of putting magic into a person.  The game starts off, however, with a girl named Terra, who has a real ability of magic.  There is a short opening scene, then some fights take place.  It soon becomes evident that she has been brainwashed and is being used.  She escapes from her captors, and is found by a rebel group called the Returners and joins them in their fight against this evil man.  You gradually gain new members as the game moves on, and each of them has a special attack they can do in battle as well as the ability to learn Magitek via crystals.  More on that later.Graphics-While the previous Final Fantasy games for GBA had really small characters, this games has really huge characters.  It was a little hard to get used to, but I did get used to it.  The backgrounds are pretty nice, though.Sound-I don't play these games for the music, so I don't really remember it, but the songs that I do remember were really nice.Gameplay-There is a lot of fighting in this game, if you haven't already guessed.  When you encounter an enemy (it's random as you are walking around outside), you have four characters in your group that will fight.  They all have the attack command, a special move unique to each, magic (eventually), and an ability to use an item.  Once you find crystals in the game, you can use them to teach magical spells to your characters.  Each battle you fight, you gain magic points which go toward teaching spells.  It's really quite simple.  Also, at several points in the game, you have the ability to choose the four characters in your group (at the beginning, it's chosen for you), and I found this very customizable.  There are, of course, new weapons and armor that you can equip on your character, and there are several back stories that you can do if you wish.Fun-This game is a blast, although the story is a little bland at the beginning.  Keep playing the game, and it will keep getting better.Length-This is a pretty long game.  I was about to finish it (I thought) when I realized that there was a whole other half to the game!  I was pleasantly shocked, and I found this made it like 2 games in one!  The length is a good 50 hours at least.  It's really probably more up near 100 hours the first time you play, and at the end of the game, there are several new locations that open up with some new backstories that are REALLY hard.  This game has a lot of game time!Overall, this is a great fighting game, that I recommend to any player 10 years and up.

If you have ever played a role playing game, then set the difficulty to normal. Even on normal the game is not too tough, but at least you'll have some tense moments, especially early on. And it's been awhile since I played a jrpg where I felt I must use items to survive.Ghibli created the story with level 5 developing the game. Which is great since level 5 is amazing at design but the stories in their games have been very shallow.  Basically you follow Oliver, a youth on a quest to 'Another World' to save his mother. In his quest he will also find a way to save 'Ni No Kuni' with the help of his sidekick Drippy.Battle is interesting. You acquire familiars which can battle for you. But they have limited stamina so they must be swapped out with other familiars or with Oliver. Everyone shares one pool of mp and hp, and this makes battle interesting. You can move about on the battle map ala Tales of Graces, but not quite as involved as said title's battle system. Oliver can jump in to use magic or items. Boss battles are tough and get progressively tougher.  Defending is a must sometimes!The world is gorgeous. I was immediately drawn into the art. The characters are all ghibli fare while the over world is more level 5 style. Towns and dungeons are a nice mix.The story though is the strongest aspect. You really are drawn in and Oliver is quite the amazing young hero. I really enjoyed playing because it was like being drawn into a ghibli film. And one of the better ones like Nausica or Mononoke.The game was originally a Japanese DS game, and you can tell by the magic runes (look like stylus drawn spells) but it really does work well as a ps3 game. Also the game has both japanese and english voice tracks. Both are excellent.Update:The game gets tough.  If you're not careful, you can run into baddies that hit 2-3x very quickly and can end you.  There are slow points in the game, but then there are large stretches of gameplay without interruption for story and interaction with others.If you haven't gotten it, buy it!Pros:+ Engaging story+ Brilliant graphics+ Fun+ Wonderful Ghibli characters+ Great soundtrackCons:- Long story arcs can break up game play","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2013"}

Now, Yoshi and the four young superstars must set out on a wild and colorful quest to rescue the kids and investigate the ominous island hovering overhead. Thanks to the power of Nintendo DS, all of the lush vistas and perilous paths of Yoshi's Island span two screens.","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Another superb, must have original title for the DS","reviewText":"Ah yes, here we have another superb, must have original first party title for Nintendo's dual screened handheld.  Anyone familiar with Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island will be immediately drawn to Yoshi's Island DS, which improves on it's Super NES and GBA predecessor in many ways.  Using both of the screens to play, you once again control Yoshi as you have a baby on your back.  This time though, besides Mario, you also get to play babysitter to baby Peach, baby Wario, and even babies Donkey Kong and Bowser.  Depending on which baby is on your back you get different abilities to progress through the game, which is chock full of platforming goodness and surprisingly long levels.  The game's look and feel is pretty much the exact of the original Yoshi's Island, which is a good thing.  There's an incredible amount of bonuses to unlock, but the game is so easy to get into and pick up and play that you'll be making progress in no time.  If there's any complaint to make about Yoshi's Island DS, it's that there is a somewhat steep learning curve as you progress through the game.  Some multiplayer options would have been nice too, but with the game being this good, that is forgiveable.  That aside, this is yet another superb title from Nintendo that is a blast to play and suits the DS perfectly and shows what it can do.  If you dug the original, you'll dig this even more.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"ahoffoss","summary":"Just a few things wrong....","reviewText":"First of all, I'm posting this solely for the Xbox ONE itself,...NOT the included Kinect.  I did not hook up the Kinect.  I hated the original and really didn't see a reason to connect this one.  The console itself is really powerful as a gaming platform.  The graphics seem nearly the same as current gen graphics (they ALWAYS seem to take 2-3 years to really get the full potential going) but the AMOUNT of information going on at one time is the real reason this is a true &#34;next gen&#34;!  While I've only been playing Dead Rising 3 (I still have Need 4 Speed to play) I can tell that this console cycle is going to really bring out a lot of what gamers are wanting!My MAIN concern with the system is the fact that it required an update before I could even begin &#34;playing&#34;.  I say &#34;playing&#34;, because to actually &#34;play&#34; a game, it requires that it be INSTALLED first!  No problem since you can begin playing once it's installed about 20% (might be more/less).  HOWEVER, the games ALSO require an update before you can play them as well!  So here's what happened to me.  I unboxed the system and got it installed.  I finally turned it on at 4:30 PM.  I actually ended up going to sleep BEFORE I was able to play (around 11PM).  The update took FOREVER (I've only got DSL) and once that was done it took a while to realize that I should disconnect my internet before installing the disc.  The games only take probably 30 minutes or so to install (again, maybe more/less) but once they are installed, you then need to reconnect to the internet and update.  The reason being (and I HATED this) the system seems to want to install the update before the actual game itself.  The installation % will remain at 0.  Either way, I soon got everything figured out after going on the various boards and asking around.In all honesty, if I wasn't dying to play Dead Rising 3 (I LOVE the series) then there's no way I'd have gotten one of these yet.  There's really not enough difference to merit the purchase and Microsoft adding the new Kinect (forcing you to buy it) only made it that much more expensive for no reason.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2013"}

It is a racing game that was above and beyond what was available, in terms of graphics and sound, in that genre when it first came out.  The graphics was better than any other racing game available due to the power of the 360.  And the sound, when played through a capable audio system, really brought the engines of these exotic cars to life in your livingroom.As I have said before in my review of the console itself, I do not like First-Person Shooters. I much prefer all of my games in the third-person perspective.  Mainly, I prefer Japanese-style RPGs and Fighting games.  I bought the 360 mainly because I wanted to experience XBox Live and see what the Marketplace had to offer, in terms of content.  Once in a while, I will play a racing game even if the view perspective is not what I prefer in gaming.  I make that exception because I love cars.  And PGR3 is one of the few racing games that I enjoyed.The most enjoyable aspect of the game for me is the chance to \"drive\" the exotic cars.  Sure, it would be a whole lot more fun to drive them in real life, but Citan is not a man of means.  The best he can do is to play simulations such as these on his video game consoles.  And PGR3 is not the worst substitute for that sort of fantasy trip.  However, do keep in mind that the best cars will not be available to you at the start of the game.  You will basically have to earn (unlock) them in order for them to become available for you to use.  But don't despair.  You do have some interesting cars at the start, like a Lotus or a Honda/Acura for example.How does the game play?  You've got different modes that you can play.  I have only played one mode.  I do not own the racing wheel.  I am having to make do with the wireless controller that came with the premium system.  I am sure that takes away some of the realism.  Yes, the car responds to controller.  I have no complaints there.  I just want a more realistic experience.  I hope to be able to purchase a racing wheel at some point.  The only negative there for most people is that the game is included when you buy the Microsoft racing wheel set.  I knew that going in, so I am just borrowing the game from my friend.  He owns the racing wheel set from Microsoft.I recommend this game to you, if you like this genre.  However, by this time, I am sure there are more games in the genre that can match this one in terms of graphics, sound, and all around realism.  I would also recommend for you to buy the MS racing wheel set, which includes the game.  It is expensive to buy.  I can understand people hesitating. But, in my opinion, this type of game just doesn't feel right using the normal controller?  Do you drive your car with a controller?  No.  So why should you drive a simulated car with a controller?  There is no reason to do so if you can afford the racing wheel.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2007"}

Super Smash Bros isn't available on 3DS and Wii U yet, so Sony wins for now.  This game isn't as fun or the controls as tight or immediately user friendly, as SSB, but it's still a good entry.  One can still jump in and kick kiester, even without the tutorial.  Might as well get the tutorial trophy, though, anyways.  Fighting games work really well for portable, because they are much easier for short spurts of on the go game play.  The fighting system is one I'm having fun learning.Sure, if I was looking around the fighting options, as opposed to being handed one, I'd have checked out Mortal Kombat, Blaze Blue or Marvel versus Capcom (although this game is DLC evil), first.  But I'm not feeling any urgency to pick up those titles and it is nice to have this to get my fight on and I'm enjoying it.  There is some dissonance between more realistic character and cartoon characters, but the game play works and seems balanced.  The fighting environments are interactive (crashing through walls and the like).Kat's cool (Gravity Rush shout out); Emmett Graves is meh (The DLC characters).  Might get additional cool characters by paying extra some time in the future, does not excuse the fact that base game options are anemic, in comparison to the competition, now.  As it stands, I'm not really passionate about any of them and I'm only interested in 10/22, two of those for laughs.  In some cases (like Metal Gear), Solid Snake is not an option, Raiden is.  One could build a whole fighting game out of Metal Gear alone and all we get is Raiden?  Dante is the hero of his franchise, but its reboot young Dante(not as cool) and there's no Virgil . . What's the fun of having Nathan Drake, if you can't kill him multiple times with Chloe or Elena? This is the trend with a lot of characters available and it is disappointing.  Maybe I'm just not as invested in PS characters, so I don't have the same excitement or care about playing through.  The thin stories don't give me that additional push to care, either.I'm disappointed I can't use my Little Big Planet DLC to customize sack boy.Once the PS3 version of the title drops enough, I'll go ahead and get that, so I can enjoy cross features.  If you have a PS3, it is definitely the better deal getting that version with the digital copy bundled in for the cross play/buy features (assuming you have a decent memory card).  Probably wouldn't want this game at $39.99 on Vita and it is worth more than $20, if you like fighting games, even though I got it as part of the deal on my ACIII L Vita bundle.I'm sure I'd get more out of this, if I had more friends with PS3 and\\or Vitas, but alas, I do not.  I am tempted to give it three stars as nothing especially stands out about it to me, but I do like it.Also, how did I not notice how barely covered Nariko of Heavenly Sword is before now?

Banjo's lazy bum the whole time was sleeping. It's up to you to get jiggy's and notes and what-not to stop Grunty and get Banjo's sister back.Graphics: 9.5/10. Awesomely different and creative worlds. From a sewer, to a pirate ship on an island, to a desert and into an icy snowland, there are tons of different and unique worlds to play through. The graphics are stellar for the N64, with bright colors and cool characters with good animations. This is one of the best N64 games as far as graphics go next to games like Donkey Kong 64 and Legend Of Zelda: Majora's Mask.Sound: 9/10. There aren't really any voices in this game; just kind of sound effects that are different for each character. Blubber on Treasure Grove Cove sounds like he's burping or throwing up, Kazooie sounds like a gagging bird, Banjo sounds like a big old hick of a bear... and so on. The music in this game, though, is some of the catchiest and the best music i've heard in really any adventure game. The music doesn't really get old, and whoever created it is brilliant. Overall, the sound is really, really good.Control: 8.5/10. Being an adventure game, there are a lot of different controls for a lot of different moves. And since the N64 controller is the way it is ( pretty annoying ) it's easy to get confused even after playing for hours on end, just because you go brain dead. The controls are a bit strange at first to do some of the attacks, but you will get used to them anyways.Fun: 9/10. A great game from beginning to end. Get the jiggys, move on. Get the notes, move on. That simple? No. This game is challenging and is for all ages, even if it does have a kiddy approach. The game lasts maybe 40 hours or so depending on how fast you get through the game. Great characters, great level design, and fantastic music makes this a must buy. This is one of the best games on the N64, and I.M.O., the best adventure game. Pick this game up now; it is better than its sequel and the Game Boy Advanced ones, even if all three are fantastic.

Together, these two titles laid the foundation for the series and spawned many hit sequels that have now sold over 42 million units worldwide.","reviewerName":"Adrian Jenkins \"southerndudeman\"","summary":"A rewrite is in order.","reviewText":"OK, few people seem satisfied with my review of Final Fantasy Origins. Fair enough; I reviewed the game before it came out, and said some things which weren't entirely correct. I'm still not changing my rating (4 stars), but perhaps I can defend it a bit.If Final Fantasy 1 was the only game on the docket, I would give this 3 (or maybe two) stars. In fact, I played my old NES version concurrently, and found that I enjoyed it far more. Let me draw up a comparison.Those things that are GOOD in Origins:1) Enix decided to make a few tweaks in the battle system. In particular, your party no longer will swing at nothing should the enemy die before they have a crack at him. This was very stupid in the first version (I mean, why would you go to the trouble to attack if there was nothing in your path?).2) The graphics have improved quite a bit, and while some may wax nostalgic for the old days, I think that the overhaul makes the whole enterprise easier on the eyes.3) Many of the little secrets have returned, including the hordes of giants you can fight in the Terra cave to grow powerful and rich early on, and the little mini-game on the ship (something about holding one button and pressing another 55 times, hmmmm?).4) Instead of having booby trapped chests, now there are booby trapped floor tiles, which add an element of surprise.Those things that are POOR in Origins:1) The normal difficulty level really isn't that much more difficult than the easy level. In fact, what really changes is the encounter frequency, and the enemy's ambush possibility. Essentially, the normal difficulty guarantees a longer game, but only because you'll have to fight 50% more monsters.2) The enemy ambush level is ridiculous. I mean, during my play-though, I gained a pre-emptive attack a total of fourteen times in the game, while the enemy ambushed me that many times as I was preparing to enter the Temple of Chaos (or Fiends, in the NES version).3) The Ice Cavern is ridiculous. Much of your chance of making it out alive relies on luck, hoping and praying that you don't get ambushed by four Dark Wizards, who will kill off your entire partyt before you can say \"guh?\".4) The music, somehow, has gotten worse in Origins. Somehow, by sprucing up the tunes, the folks at Enix have made the mucic 100 times more annoying.5) The collection menu is useless; I would have hoped to get more for my efforts.As I said, if it were only FF1 on this disc, the game would merit less stars. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the addition of Final Fantasy 2. In fact, after playing this little game, I wonder what fools told Square not to release the game over here in the first place! The storyline is pretty good, and the growth system is quite novel (it resembles the Game Boy offering, Final Fantasy Legend pt. 2 which, as an aside, is probably the most difficult game ever conceived). Truth be told, I am sad that I left this game for last, and its addition really makes this new game worthwhile.Well, there you have it. I feel I've justified my position now, and it is up to you (the buyer) to take or leave what I have offered.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2003"}

Half Life 2 didn't age very well for me.  It was pretty boring (Team Fortress 2 FTW).  But I took to Portal quickly.Portal was a game that got you thinking.  Not just how to solve the rooms.  It got you thinking, \"Why are companies cranking out FPS games when they could make games like this?\"  You sit down and play First Person Shooters and every single one of them is exactly the same.  Shoot this guy.  Shoot that guy.  Shoot the exploding red barrel conveniently located.  PIck up the conveniently dropped sniper rifle or rocket launcher.  I mean there's good ones out there, but really how much more mileage is there to going into a checkpoint - bad guys run at you - shoot them - checkpoint - bad guys run at you -shoot them?Thank GLaDOS for Valve.  Look at Left4Dad.  It is a deceptively simple FPS, even glitchy sometimes.  That game does absolutely nothing new and what it does do, isn't really all that amazing, but with friends - it's a blast.  Portal was a bigger nut to crack.  The concept alone could spawn a dozen $5.99 puzzle platformers on Steam, but they took it the extra mile and made something of it.  Portal 2 is the extra mile of the extra mile.  Yeah there's tractor beams, you shoot holes in walls and jump into the floor.  Sure you have gels that bounce and accelerate you and spring boards to launch on.  But the best thing about Portal is the care Valve took with these innovative mechanics and made something out of it.  Portal feels just as solid a science fiction experience as 2001; A Space Odyssey or even Spaceballs.  I'd go so far to say calling Portal 2 a puzzle game is almost insulting.  The story is really subtle and has you asking friends all kinds of questions on who was who, was \"she\" the same one in the painting and the like.  Voiceless Chell may even have some interesting roots. Very subtle.  Potatoes take on new significance. Wheatly is probably the greatest non human anti-hero of sorts since R2D2.  And Cave Johnson?  He's the guy that is going to burn your house down.The game plays just as good with a dual shock or WASD keyboard style on PC.  The PS3/Steam linking is great. I bought this on release day so I did have to wait until the PSN hacking stuff got sorted out to actually activate it on Steam, but that's history by now.  I have the Steam download on my MacBook Pro and my work PC to burn off time when I get bored at work or when I'm traveling which is a pretty big incentive above the 360 version.  You really are getting a possible 3 game pack for the price of 1.Portal isn't challenging, but it is fun.  It's a game I showed to a couple people who HATE video games and got them hooked on it.  It is hilarious.  It's a perfect example of what games should be doing these days.  It's a great time in co-op experience.  It's a great single player experience and easily the #1 Game of the Year contender.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2011"}

Fast-forward to 2002 and the Xbox is screaming for a decent four-player game that uses the same basic principle that won Gauntlet so much acclaim. I'll start first with the control scheme as comfort while playing the game decides whether or not it's picked up again. The control scheme is close to where you won't realize your holding a controller and you'll feel comfortable enough to go through the game. Sound is decent enough with the ambience delivered by the game is enough to send a shiver or two down your spine at points throughout the game. The concept is close enough with a feeling of a four player resident evil in which you fight the undead through the streets of a no-name town. Playability is good enough with the ease of being able to pick the game up and just go is really good. Finally, the replay value on the game is really good as it is worth being able to pull the game out and play it while you have three friends over. Start the game at about 8 in the evening and the fun just goes on from there. However, with this genre it can be a situation of hit or miss depending on how you feel about games built on the platform of multiplayer.

The game combines elements from Hollywood action thrillers with the latest in video game technology to deliver a highly original gameplay experience.","reviewerName":"Richard Veysey","summary":"Good plot, terrible play","reviewText":"I feel like I played a different game from the rest of these reviewers. I made it into the early missions of the second part before I couldn't take the abysmal design flaws anymore. It's disappointing considering how good the story and atmosphere of the game are.Plenty has been said about the positive, so I'll lay out the game's many flaws in more detail than I've seen in many of the negative reviews here.1 - Lack of precision digital controls: If you're a gamer, you probably know that most games utilizing a joystick (pretty much every game made in the past 12 years) allow you to change movement speed based on how far the stick is pressed. For instance, ever since Mario 64, pushing the stick a little bit forward allowed the player to move slowly, sneaking past unsuspecting enemies or gaining more precise movement over treacherous terrain. Pushing the stick all the way forward allows the player to run. Sometimes there's other increments in the middle (sneak -&#62; walk -&#62; run). Max Payne does not have this feature. If the game detects movement of the joystick, you set off in a wild sprint. Usually this isn't an issue (tact and stealth seem to be words alien to Payne) but in a few areas your character must walk along narrow walkways. A slight tilt on the joystick will send Max tumbling to his death. Considering the era in which the game was made (long after the release of Mario 64) the lack of precision controls is almost inexcusable, especially when precision movement is expected.2 - Abysmal AI: Making life-like enemies has always been a challenge for game companies. There's always some obstacle or unforeseen circumstance that the AI has no script to compensate for. Yet it feels like the AI for Max Payne consists of a few lines that say 'point your gun in the players general direction and shoot'. Enemies will repeatedly try to fire at you from behind walls or run one by one into your line of fire like a duck shoot. Later enemies will throw a grenade then stand there while waiting for it to explode. Of course, the developer compensated for poor quality by putting in a LOT of enemies. The worst issue I found, however (and the one that actually made me turn off the game in disgust) is the AI's ability to detect the player. A certain mission early in the second part has Max unarmed with the exception of a baseball bat. He says that the best course of action is to &#34;Play hide-and-seek&#34; with the enemies. Only problem is, if you use the game's third person view to look around a corner at a group of enemies, they will immediately detect you (even if you're several feet outside of their line of sight) and come running, also apparently calling the rest of the enemies in the area. There is no excuse for this.3 - dull, repetitious game play: I guess I'm not the best judge of this as a fan of JRPGs, but the lack of depth in enemy AI and the emphasis on run-and-gun game play makes every level feel dull and repetitive. Most opponents can be overcome by following the same one or two strategies, and the huge abundance of ammo means that you'll never find yourself needing to conserve your better weapons. I'll admit that the opening of chapter two was refreshingly different, but consisted of a long segment involving precision controls (see issue 1) and the aforementioned part with the baseball bat (issue 2).I've heard that the second game improves on the mechanics of the first, so I'm willing to give it a shot, but I couldn't play anymore of this one.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2014"}

On Sly's eighth birthday, he is given the Thievius Raccoonus, an instruction manual passed down through the Cooper family for generations on how to be a great thief. But ruthless villains bust in and steal the manual, split it amongst themselves, and then vanish. Sly, along with his two friends Bentley and Murray, must embark on a platform adventure to recover the pages of the book and prove to the world that Sly Cooper is the world's greatest thief. Different skills, such as stealth tactics and platform jumping, are required throughout the game. You'll also pilot vehicles, play minigames, and fight bosses as you proceed.","reviewerName":"Pat O'Donnell","summary":"A very rewarding departure from the standard platformer","reviewText":"Most platformers today are more or less the same. Same ideas, same objectives with the same old cliche's. Sly Cooper is about to break that trend. Make no mistake, it does share similarities with various platformers, but it adds enough depth and play mechanics to seperate itself from the pack while still remainng quite fun. The game revolves alot around stealth, ala MGS, but fuses it together with platformer elements. Instead of jumping around mindlessly as in most platformers, Sly makes you think just what is the best route to get to a certain objective, as there will often be diffrent traps and other enemies or the like but there is always different routes to take rather than a set path for every objective. Each path will vary on difficulty and strategy. It might me to jump into a barrel and tip toe around an enemy or radar, or perhaps scurry up a high wire, or maybe swing from rope to rope. There are plenty of various situations where different skills or tactics will be needed, so everything does not become monotonous. Thankfully, the game itself handles wondefully, with very fluid and responsive control. Sly himself has diffrent abilities such as jumping, rolling, running, and and uses his odd-shaped cane as his primary 'weapon'. There are also your typical coin collecting for extra lives and you can also collect a few bottles in each level, to unlock a secret move for Sly to have at his desposure. So the little collecting there is in the game is quite rewarding. Another great aspect is the mini games. You will find mini games such as auto racing, where you drive Sly's beefed up dirt truck and there's other like sniping, submarine shooting and many others. The game's graphics are impressive as it looks much like a modern animated cartoon, and a good one at that. Animation flows seamingly and gives the illusion of a fantasy cartoon world. Enivorments and color schemes are also varied to keep from getting too repetetive. There is also voice acting dialogue through-out the entire game. All in all Sly Cooper is a great platforming game, that mixes platform action with stealth gameplay and yet manages to keep these two concepts quite enjoyable. Add to that endless mini-games and amusing dialogue. It's a game that can be enjoyed by both young children and adults alike.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2002"}

Played through 2-4(I wish I found the copy of RE1 I brought years ago so I could finish it). I heard mixed reviews about Code Veronica. For every positive comment I heard about it I also heard a negative comment. I actually ended up just shelving the game for about 6 years playing other games and not really sure if the RE Code Veronica was worth my time. Finally eons later I decided to pick it up and play it all the way through this time to see for myself.First off I just want to say that I have no idea why people complain about the controls. Now I know a few defense movies from RE3 seemed to be missing, but it controls just like every other Resident Evil game and not to mention just like the Silent Hill games(that I actually finished just before playing RE-CV)as well. Survival horror games just don't work when you have 100% control of the camera. It needs that limited view to toss in the scares and surprises for you. Without it, it just doesn't work as well. The controls are not as all hard as people say and that's coming from someone who is now playing what is an 8 year old game at this point.Resident Evil Code Veronica starts you off as Claire Redfield who is captured trying to break into Umbrella and is now being held captive in a remote island. Your mission to find your way to safety. Alright if you played Resident Evil you pretty much already know how it goes. Solve puzzles fight Zombies...some big guy chases you...yadda... yadda. Same ol' same ol' even the weapons are the same. I had no time jumping right into the game since it featured the same items from all the other resident evil games, and the puzzles are of the same difficulty level. I breezed through everything rather quickly.I was kind of disappointed because the game never really made me feel so much of the \"horror\" feel as I felt the \"sci-fi\" fill. Matter of fact RE2 was the only game where I felt that vibe and a few episodes in RE4, but other than that its pretty much Sci-fi. If you played Silent Hill you know the \"horror\" vibe that I'm talking about. Resident evil games just don't have that magic anymore because by now you know what's going on and the story is always the same. Of all things the story of Resident Evil Code Veronica is what seemed so so to me. This could have been called RE 2.5 and it would have been a perfect tie in with the story line. This feels more like a mystery sci-fi game than a survival horror game. It doesn't bring anything new really and is pretty much the same game only repeated with updated (at the time)textures.The Gameplay isn't so bad as I said earlier the controls are just fine. Their survival horror controls so they are perfect for the games atmosphere. The only thing that got on my nerves was that the \"select\" button not being assigned as the \"Item Menu\" button and I couldn't change it to my preference. It was the only confusing part as with most games that button is reserved for \"item menu's or maps\" and not \"GAME OPTIONS\" so that was weird.The thing I did like about the game is that there seemed to be plenty of health and ammo where ever I went. Actually a lot more than I remember from the past 2 games before it. Every time I needed ammo or health the next room readily had it. The annoying part though is that some weapons like the Glock 9 and blow gun take endless amounts of ammo to bring down average zombies. Which usually leaves you low on ammo. Sometimes trying to aim is hard until you learn how to do it with the 3rd person effects. Silent Hill does this and Resident evil does this. You just have to get used to lining up your shots with the target since there is no guide. I like this feeling as its more free and realistic and have no complaints about it. I'm a survival horror game veteran and I prefer this more than the cross hair style that RE4 had.The Graphics of RE- Code Veronica show the games age. It looks cartoony and detail is somewhat lacking. For the times it was state of the art, but looking at later PS2 titles like Resident Evil 4 you can see that the graphic design has come along way. However, it's still not a reason to avoid this game. The voice acting is well... \"laughable\". Not so much the actors it's just the lines of the characters. It can be pretty cheesy but I just remember that this game isn't as \"adult\" targeted as Silent Hill is. So be prepared to expect goofy lines from the characters.Overall I give this game a 3.5 Outta 5. It's not necessarily anything new or ground breaking. You'll certainly live if you skip it (and play 4 or 5 just like I did) but, it's definitely a game you might want to pick up of your an RE game and would like to accomplish the goal of playing all the major games in the series. It's a good game. Not blow your mind spectacular or a \"YOU HAVE TO PLAY THIS!\" game. It's just Resident Evil continued if you liked 1-3 and want more of the same.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2010"}

{"product_name":"B002I0JAJ2","description":"","reviewerName":"HitRaj 47","summary":"Not Worth the Wait, Even for the Fans","reviewText":"I posted this same review for the BoS edition, which is the one I almost bought, thought I'd repost it here as there are people that just want the game, not the BoS edition.I had the opportunity to play Duke Nukem Forever before it was released, and I played up to the levels after the \"Queen Bitch\" level, where you are outside, high up in the air climbing over the alien growth. The only reason I made it that far was because I am a fan of Duke and really wanted to see this through. So when Gearbox finally finished the game and proved all the skeptics wrong, I was stoked!Unfortunately, after playing, I canceled my preorder for the balls of steel edition. As much as I enjoyed the previous Duke games, even as a fan I can't justify paying $90 for this game. I've also been told by friends and other people that bought the balls of steel edition that the items are underwhelming. A predictable anti climax if you ask me. But I'm not here to review the items, I want to talk about the game. That's the reason you're buying.This game is worth the budget bin price of $10 - $15, at most. Kudos to Gearbox for just finishing it, and the graphics don't look amazing, but they don't look bad either. They managed to keep the cheesy macho American lines and overall character of Duke, but beyond those three things, I can't really say anything else good about the game.Let me start off with the weapons. All your favorites from Duke Nukem 3D are in there, but the problem is, they feel like crap. I know the pistol isn't supposed to be powerful, but it doesn't even feel powerful. None of the weapons are really satisfying to use either, save for maybe the shrink ray and the rail gun. Not only that, but you can only carry two at a time. I can't help but think they only put this in here because of the fact it's going to be on consoles. The whole game is a tribute to the old Duke and how FPS games used to be, as in, you played a character that was practically a one man army.Next, the A.I. is... From the same era as Half-Life 1. Yes that was groundbreaking, but that was also 1999! Enemies run at you or hide behind cover. That's it.The level design isn't that good either. There isn't anything innovative and you know you're doing something wrong when, in a level where you control a car, you can't find where to go next. There are also moments where enemies will just spawn out of ships and you have to deal with wave after wave of enemies until they go away. This is lame and if I wanted to experience such cheap gameplay I would play Modern Warfare or Black Ops. The bosses are also pretty standard, just the regular shoot until it dies.What I do like is that they managed to keep the theme of Duke with cheesy jokes and objectification if women. Though a lot of the people who might find this funny are pubeless thirteen year old boys. Of course, if this was released ten years ago, this might be a different story. By todays standards, and by that I mean Half-Life 2, not Bad Company 2, this game is mediocre at best. A tribute to how shooters used to be.Overall there is some fun to be had, for a few minutes, but after that, I don't feel compelled to finish the game. The multiplayer has your standard modes and there's no co op, which might of made this a little more bearable going through it with a friend.Gearbox are responsible for Opposing Force (the best expansion ever made) and Borderlands, so I expected the game to be ok, but not amazing. I thought this was reasonable considering how long we've had to wait, but the game failed to meet such low expectations. If they had made it from the ground up it might of been a good game, but that would of meant an even longer wait. Like I said, kudos for finishing it. I, like many other Duke fans will finally cross this one off the bucket list.I've played all the most relevant, and some obscure or underrated FPS games on PC, but this is down there with the worst of the lot. If you really must play this game now, rent or borrow from a friend, or wait until it goes on budget. It's not worth full price. I'd give this game a 3/10.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00D96BNGM","description":"","reviewerName":"eau","summary":"Great wireless gaming headphone for the consoles","reviewText":"I'm pleasantly surprised by the presentation of the retail packaging of the Turtle Beach Phantom headphone. The headphone and the transmitter are secured in a molded tray inside a flip-open, keepsake quality box. Under the tray is a box full of cables and an adapter, and a pack of reference literature.The headphone is solidly constructed with good padding on the headband and the earcups. Various buttons are located on the exterior of both earcups, and a removable goose neck type mic boom. Although the key buttons are fairly big, I don't find it particularly easy to fumble for the buttons while wearing the headphone.The Phantom headphone is actually compatible with PS3, PS4, Xbox 360 and some mobile devices, despite of what the amazon product says. Out of the box, it is compatible with all the above mentioned consoles and devices except PS4, which requires a firmware update to enable a new 'PS4 mode'. The Turtle Beach website has the instruction and download to do so, but it requires a Windows based PC. For Mac only users, it says you can request a chat cable. I believe TB is going to release an adapter soon in order to make it work with Xbox One.The included reference and guide is pretty useless. I recommend to download the complete user guide (PDF) from TB website. It contains setup instructions and diagrams for the original Xbox 360, Xbox 360 S and Xbox 360 E variants, as well as PS3 and Bluetooth pairing with your mobile devices. It also explains the presets, modes and surround sound settings.Please be warned that while the headphone includes the cables for different console setup, you will still need an additional accessory (purchased separately) for the original Xbox 360 or the E model. The original model requires a Xbox 360 Audio Adapter and the E model requires the Ear Force HD Audio converter ($40 from TB website).I hooked up the headphone/transmitter to my Xbox 360 using the Audio adapter that I got from monoprice. It's straight forward with the user guide that I downloaded from the TB website. For online chatting, I plugged the included Xbox Bluetooth Adapter into my Xbox controller. Totally wireless. The adapter has a multifunction button for power on/off, mute and BT pairing.The RF transmitter is USB powered using the included power cable which will take up one of your available USB ports on your console, or you can use a regular USB wall adapter/charger (not included). Sound quality is great. I haven't experienced any dropout in the wireless connection so far. There are different modes for movies, games and music, but I primarily use it for gaming.  In game mode, there are like 8 different presets that enhance different areas in the sound. For example, I use Superhuman Hearing preset in COD to boost low volume sounds such as footsteps so that I know enemy is approaching nearby.The headphone can last me almost a week (~2 hours a day) on one single charge. I like that it's rechargeable so I don't have to deal with batteries. It has voice prompts to the indicate the status such as 'Power On', 'Pairing Headset', 'Pairing Bluetooth', etc. I think you can download more voice prompts/presents from TB too.The Phantom headphone is pretty expensive but you do get a lot of features and high quality sound from it. As far as wireless gaming headset goes, this one gets a solid recommendation from me.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2013"}

I've played thru God of War III, Uncharted 1 & 2, Heavenly Sword, and currently playing thru them again. And just picked up Yakuza 4 which is a riot. I'm also starting to build up my fighting game library - it feels awesome to finally use a solid, precise D-pad on current-gen fighters.The hardware is flawless- I've had no problems so far... whether it's gaming or watching bluray discs, there's no freezing, no slowdown, no glitches - nothing but smooth presentation.

Also, some of the earlier multi-plats that were released between '06-'08 on the PS3 were poorly ported and ended looking inferior to the 360 releases (developers' fault, not PS3's).

It is fun- especially if you like shooting Nazi's over & over again. As an adult gamer, I've played probably 100 games with  this same formula. I loved Return to Castle Wolfenstein- and I would see that as more of a challenge than the current version.It's really unclear what the developers wanted this game to be- a shooter, action, stealth, rpg? There are elements of all of these. The shooter part is very good. Although pretty linear, it can be fun & interesting. However, a modern shooter like Killzone Shadowfall allows you to take multiple paths & strategies to get to an objective. Most of this game is linear & the stealth elements are a joke. You could set off a grenade behind the targets without them turning around. The story is OK, but BJ really seems like a meathead- all brawn & not much brain. Then it really goes off the tracks with the hole space trip- won't spoil it- but it's completely lame. At times it was hard to tell if this was a Wolf game or a Serious Sam boondoggle. Part of the story was serious & other parts were completely over the top.Another disappointment was they didn't really show what everyday life would be like if the Nazi's won & were in control in 1960. There are maybe a few glimpses of that, but it would have made the story much more engaging to have more of a context.The game was a decent length- probably around 12 hours. I did love that this is a single-player only game (which is 99% of what I play). Every game out there has to have a multiplayer component- which is fine if you want that, but playing a well-developed single player can also be a great experience. Hopefully there will be a dlc with additional missions to make the game more worth the cost. It would be great to see what the USA would look like under these conditions.A heads-up for parents- There are at least two of the most realistic sex scenes I've seen in mainstream games. Not to mention there is all the killing, torture, blood, etc. I'm not a prude, just think it should be known.*Pros- Graphics are great- it does look Next-Gen.-Gameplay- Shooting, movement, etc. is great. The blowtorch is a nice addition.-You can get in & get out if you just want to play one level (That is after the long intro sequence).-Auto Save feature is pretty good. I rarely had to go back very far in the few times I was killed.**Cons- Having to pick up weapons, armor, etc. takes me back to the Return to Castle days. Not the worst- but I definitely prefer the automatic pickup in most other modern games.-Navigation is mostly hit & miss. If you've played shooter/action games you would be fine, but if you're new to this- I think navigation could get frustrating at times.-The two possible timelines do not seem to be much different at all. Not a really different experience as you get with a game like Infamous.-Cost- I'd try to get it used if you can. This isn't a gamechanger like Watchdogs should be. If you've played shooters before I'd wait for the price to come down or rent it.-Overall- It's a pretty fun old-school type shooter with next-gen graphics. Worth your time if you're into this genre. If not, there are better offerings out there.-I'd give it an overall score of about 7 out of 10.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2014"}

While it doesn't give you total open world control like Saints Row the game still has its charm with the story of the Mafia wars and your characters trial to make himself a powerful man in the mafia world as well.  If you've played the game L.A. Noire you'll feel some deja vu while you play this game but it in no way deters any of the entertainment from playing this game.  The fight and gun shootouts are also very reminiscent of the Noire and Saints Row games too so if you've played both there isn't to much confusion on how to fight or shoot in this game.  I'd advise people though to try out a demo or check a few trailers to see if this game is for them but still for what this game is going for and the entertainment of playing I think most people won't mind getting this for their game library...Update 06-16-2012A friend of mine was wondering about the rumors of the easy gameplay and how short the levels or chapters are, sadly both are somewhat true.  While I haven't played the hard mode yet the normal mode of difficulty is still pretty easy to pass through the chapters especially with the lack of any challenging A.I. enemies in the game.  Most time all you really have to do in the gunfights is stay covered and pick your shoots on time as most of the enemies won't charge your position giving you more then enough time to aim and fire at them without fear of the enemy flanking you.  Also there are no mini-games you only have the main quests and that's pretty much it, you can explore the city,steal or car or pick a fight if you want but unlike GTA or Saints Row there aren't any side quests in here to really do.  So if you want either mini side quest jobs or more truly hard difficult npc opponents in games you'll probably want to pass this over...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2012"}

Wii, like all the previous releases in theSuper Mario Bros.franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiis held sideways, allowing for easy, classic inputs using the D-pad to direct playable characters, the 1 button to jump and 2 button to spit out projectiles like snowballs and fireballs. In addition, players can access powerups with their choice of either the push of a button, or by shaking the Wii remote, again demonstrating the perfect merging of classic gameplay and modern game design which isNew Super Mario Bros. Wii.Key Game FeaturesNew Super Mario Bros. Wiioffers a combination of cooperation and competition. Players can pick each other up to save them from danger or toss them into it.Supports 2-4 players in multiplayer mode.Mario, Luigi and two Toads are all playable characters, while many others from the Mushroom Kingdom make appearances throughout the game. Players can even ride different Yoshi characters and use their tongues to swallow enemies &ndash; or their fellow players.In some areas, players use the motion abilities of the Wii Remote controller. The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"Anti MTV \"Old school MTV 4ever!\"","summary":"Great game but could have been better.","reviewText":"First of all let me start off by saying this was a very fun challenging game to have if your one of those old school NES mario fans who grew up on mario. The game has a small combination mix of the 5 mario games such as: super mario bros, super mario bros 2, super mario bros 3 (mostly), super mario world, and yoshies island. The game takes you back to the days where games were played on 2d platform sidescroll screen with the mix of the 5 mario games I mentioned earlier and they were pretty amazing but I think playing with 4 players together (never tried it) could be quite annoying and not fun.*SPOILER ALERT*Now for the real dissapointment for the consequencial buyers, The game is kinda short in 8 worlds which takes you quickly to the end depending how fast you beat the levels. But when you beat the game it leads you to a secret star world with harder levels which involves collecting all the star coins in every single level to beat star world which is not easy at all. And when you get all the coins in every level what do you get? absolutely nothing at all! Thats right all your hard work for nothing which was pretty dissapointing.Overall: Not bad I liked this game but it could have been better","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2010"}

I have to say first off getting this was such a pain it is so popular that hardly any store had it in stock but I finally lucked out. Inside the box you had the Wii console,one wireless remote and nun chuck set,a power and video cables,a sensor bar,and finally a multi sports game disk.You'll find putting this together is pretty easy it finds the remote easily and the sensor bar for tracking the movement of the remote worked great as well.  The console has a wireless network for it to go online for updates or to shop at the nintendo wii virtual store if you have a computer most people realize you have to give the console an IP address as well as Default Gateway and Subnet Mask especially if you have multi-computers networked to you're modem. I myself first tried to have the console find these addresses automatically but ended up having to do it manually especially for the IP address.  After that was taking care of though it found the updates easily and I was also able to shop online at the wii virtual store.  The console allows you to play you're gamecube games as well and you can play the old nintendo,super nintendo,sega genesis,or nintendo 64 games you downloaded from the virtual store.  The wii plays great and I have already gotten such greatgames such as Super Mario Party 8,Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess,and Harry Potter and the Order Of The Phoenix  the games play great and they read the remote and nun chuck controls excellently.  The video is good but don't expect quality like the Xbox 360 or PS3 the wii has the lowest video graphics of these three systems that by no means lessens the quality of this system but again don't expect breakthrough video on thesegames to much.  So I say if you can get this system as soon as possible and if you can find one in a store since their still selling like crazy...GOOD LUCK","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2008"}
{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Melvin","summary":"Fun, innovative, but dated","reviewText":"The Wii, when it first debuted, was an innovative way to game - by making the gamer interact with the game vs simply manipulating a remote, it brought a whole new aspect to the gaming world - and attracted a whole new generation of gamers to the industry.  Old and young alike were willing to game.  No longer were games designed that took immense skill or countless hours to play - now there were games that could be played in a matter of minutes and took very little skill besides following the motions suggested on the screen.Now, however, the Wii is beginning to show its age.  It still only connects via 480i (or 480p if you buy the special cable), while the competion connects at 1080p (HD).  It has built in wifi, but only 802.11b/g - whereas newer standards exist (a/b/g/n), which allows better streaming, faster downloads, etc.  And finally, with the release of XBOX's and PS3's motion systems, the Wii has lost one of its major initial advantages.  Yes, it still has countless games that require very little skill or time to play - but XBOX and PS3 quickly ate away at that market as well.What Wii still has that no other system can claim are the franchise games.  Mario being the most prominent that comes to mind.  Many gaming companies have tried to capture the appeal of the Mario franchise, but have found it a hard nut to crack.  Too many gamers grew up on the original Nintendo and Mario to care much about any newcomers to the jump, run, repeat genre.  With the addition of the Wii online store, users can buy old, classic games for very little cost, reliving some of their glory days of gaming.  Add the fact that the Wii now has YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, etc (albiet in 480i/p) and you have a nice combination for that TV in the gaming room that isn't connected to the PS3, Roku box or other network capable device.Yes, the Wii has likely seen its heyday and isn't long for this world, but it will be fondly remembered as the gaming system that got people to standup and play!  That's something that will never be contested.  The Wii has attempted to rebrand itself (new colors, slightly new design and minor updates), but nothing will put it in the same league with the PS3/4 or XBOX / One.  Perhaps Wii is content with its lot in life.  Who needs to be number one when you can sit quietly, attract the casual gamer and reap rewards off game sales and other little transactions.Overall, this is a fun gaming system, which I still own and will keep until it dies.  It doesn't get much use these days and isn't the most advanced piece of hardware in my home - but it still gets turned on from time to time, even if only to watch a quick Netflix film in the quiet part of the house.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2013"}

Sony added Ready at Dawn Studios (Daxter) to help, which after playing for a while, seems like the right decision.  Originally released in 2008, this game still looks and plays great today.  Being that I have owned a PS2 and PS3 since launch, and never played a God of War title (shame, shame), and this was chronologically the first adventure, it seemed like the proper place to begin.  Does it live up to it's console predecessors?  Can a portable version of classic series make the grade?The game opens on the shores of Attica, and Kratos is serving the Gods of Olympus, by defending the city from the attacking Persians.  Armed with his trusty Blades of Chaos attached to his arms, Kratos is thrust immediately into action, battling a combination of men, ships, and a huge basilisk.  While the battle is no easy feat, after the Persians are defeated, Kratos' adventure really begins.Kratos happens to see the sun falling from the sky, and does what any self-respecting hero would do: investigates and signs on to retrieve it.  Following the bit of light he can see takes him to the city of Marathon, where it seems Morpheus (God of Dreams) has put the land under some dark spell.  Kratos must now, not only ward off dark beings, but must grab Helios' Sun Chariot to ride to the Underworld to end the madness and return the sun to it's proper place.In the Underworld, the game really shines and the plot becomes more than just a fetch quest.  The subtle differences in the locales and enemies kept me plugging through when the game had gotten a bit repetitive above the surface.GameplayThe combat is action packed, with a variety of enemies, from small Harplings, to various medium sized Satyrs, to much bigger Death Knights.  That's not even including the bosses, who are quite cool, in their own right.  Kratos' Blades of Chaos really feel responsive and can do a couple of different attacks, based on the buttons pressed.  There is also a magical-type attack that Kratos uses, and all of his acquired weapons can be upgraded to more powerful versions.  The deaths of enemies are actually quite gratifying, whether with weapons or fists.What would a God of War be without blood, and there is plenty to speak of here.  The game really earns its M rating (but probably more for a particular mini-game).  Some of the bigger enemies can be finished off with a Quick Time Event (QTE), which involves pressing the correct buttons within a certain time frame, while others can be grabbed and disposed of quickly.  I enjoyed the close-up fatality views (who doesn't love stabbing a cyclops in the eye) and thought they were well done,  but any that involved moving the analog nub in a certain direction, usually took a few tries to master correctly.  That was a big drawback for me.  I dreaded seeing the arrow, instead of a button to press, as I knew that it would most likely take me some time to do correctly, and the loss of precious health.I also at first enjoyed the vagueness of some of the puzzles, as I tried to decipher them, but on a couple of occasions was completely stumped on what to do or where to go next.  Luckily, save points were strategically placed and if I did die exploring or mis-jumping, I didn't have to repeat much.  The prevalent use of \"invisible walls\" around cliff and in areas, usually led me to the right spot (but I still wish I could have thrown enemies off of cliffs).  Though, I sometimes tended to forget that Kratos could destroy pillars or walls to open up new areas.The Underworld was my favorite section of the game, and especially thought that the representation of the Titans and Charon's boat was magnificent.  Additionally, the enemies not only become more difficult as the game progresses, but also a tad smarter.  If you do not time your jumps just right, the archers' aim follows you.  If you do not break shields, enemies use them wisely.  Random button mashing typically won't yield the results you're looking for.The final battles were just what I'd hoped for.  The weapons I'd procured throughout the game were not useless, but necessary, and the Bosses were legendary, not just some overgrown guard or creature.  The plot also get a bit poignant at the end, which was a bit of a welcome surprise for me.GraphicsAmazing for the PSP.  I almost went out and bought the PSP component AV cable, just to see this game bigger.  Both gameplay and cutscenes are engaging and you don't feel like you're combatting a bunch of pixels, there is quite a lot of detail for the tiny PSP screen.  Load times are virtually non-existent and the whole experience was very smooth and seamless.SoundBeing that this is my first foray into God of War, I must say that Kratos' voice kind of bugged me.  I realize the guy is intense and extremely angry, but every word out of his mouth was way too dramatic for me.  I found it kind of cartoonish, instead of passionate.  The other character voices were much better and not so much over the top.  The background music blends well with each situation and adds to each scene instead of overpowering it.Replay ValueThe game is somewhat short, I finished in just over 8 hours on Hero (Normal) mode, but surprisingly didn't feel too short.  I probably wouldn't go back and play the game in one of the harder modes, but there are different costumes to unlock, as well as some Challenges of Hades levels to unlock more Treasures.  I'm definitely ready to move onto the God of War collection on my PS3.Rating8.5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2011"}

Not only is PlayStation Portable designed to work in unison with PlayStation 3 in many ways, but both long-time fans and newcomers to the series who choose to watch and playChains of Olympuscarefully may very well pick up clues as to the direction the franchise will be heading in withGod of War III.Regardless, whether you find yourself playing for the current chapter in Kratos? saga or preparing yourself for the battles to come on the PlayStation 3,God of War: Chains of Olympusis a must have title for any current owner of a PSP or those considering getting in the handheld game with one.","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"An actual God of War game","reviewText":"Before I played this game I was actually expecting a dumbed down version of God of War since this game was for PSP. To my surprise this game was nearly as impressive as original God of War in terms of gameplay, graphics, story and art. After finishing the game once colleting as many upgrades as possible (~6h) and attempting the challenge modes afterwards, this is what I thought.***********PROS***********ORIGINAL GOD OF WAR EXPERIENCE ON PSP: Yes that means Kratos punishing enemies in the most brutal way possible with his chain blades, climbing/jumping type of platforming and plenty of exploration in ancient greek/roman landscape. This game truly delivers nearly the same experience as God of War 1 on PS2. Quite impressed.GREAT ARTWORK, ANIMATION AND GRAPHICS: The game looks gorgeous on PSP. I truly can't believe we live in an era where we can enjoy such graphics on a handheld device. Truly astonishing. Also, this game contains very elegantly designed characters, carefully crafted structures and sophistically designed levels. It truly lives up to expectation.HECK&SLASH; GAMEPLAY: Just like in God of War PS2 games, you will be able to pull wide range of combos using dual blades and other weapons. Proper use of these combos will punish your foes in most ruthless manner and will give you bonus orbs (for upgrades) while simply button-mashing will get you killed easily. While the combat is not as strategic as say Devil May Cry games, it still delivers.WEAPONS, MAGICS AND MORE: As you progress through game in addition to your dual chain blades, you will get access to some unique godly gears and devastating magical powers. Fortunately, these new tools of destruction are not simple rip off from previous god of war games, rather they are quite distinctive entities that when used right can overwhelm your foes or overcome indomitable  obstructions. Some of them are quite fun to use.UPGRADES: Just like previous God of War games, you can upgrade your blades, new weapons and magics giving this game an RPG element. Upgrading your blades unlocks powerful new moves through which you can improve your combos and punish your enemies better while upgrading your magic will give you an edge in battles that would be too difficult otherwise. These upgrades also encourage you to explore each and every corners of the game and do better in battles to get more orbs making the game all the more enjoyable.GREAT STORY: As this is a PSP game, I was expecting a half-baked story, but to my surprise it was pretty decent with depth and twist in it. It takes place before God of War 1. Unfortunately, I can't describe much without spoiling it.VERY CINEMATIC: This game has some cutscenes that can go head to head with PS2 God of War games. Cutscenes, nicely designed by animators and carefully performed by voice actors, add great depth and drama to the story. Again can't describe much, but the cut scenes towards the end are simply magnificent.UNLOCKABLES: You can unlock Hades Trials and art/video gallery after finishing the game. Hades trial provides you with challenges and adds length to the gameplay experience. Competing these trials and finishing the game on harder modes unlocks more just like previous god of war games.*************CONS.*************SHORT CAMPAIGN: As I decided to explore each and every corner of the game, it took me about 7-8hrs to finish the game. But if you are an average player who just decide to run through the game, I expect you to finish in 5 hrs max. So this is something they should definitely improve in the next installment.**************CONCLUSION************Contrary to the con described, God of War: Chains of Olympus is a great experience on PSP. It was one of the few games on PSP at the time that pushes PSP gaming experience to its limits. Regardless you are a fan of God of War series or not if you own a PSP, you must give this game a shot.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2010"}

I would not pay $60 for it so I was glad to get it at a better price here on amazon. It is a pretty average game that plays like a ps2 game. The graphics are average and the gameplay is linear and kinda boring. Overall I enjoyed the game being a big Terminator fan, but I was disappointed in the length of the game and also no multiplayer.

All kids in the family think it's a blast!","reviewText":"I purchased this game based on its many positive reviews on this site, as well as on the Gamespot and IGN websites. It seems almost everyone who has tried this game has enjoyed it, and having now played it myself with my kids, I can see why. The game has fantastic visuals, lots of action, spunky music and attitude, and a fair amount of customization. Another big appeal for many players will be the ability to let your creativity come into play as you shred down various mountain slopes. Much like a real slope, you can ski or board down it many times without ever having an identical trip. This game lets you takes advantage of many rails (improvised or placed), moguls, half-pipes, jumps and othe constructions to give each ride a unique experience. The number of individual trick combinations is huge, too, so anyone who plays the game will not only be playing against the computer but also against themselves, as they try to pul off new, unique, and extravagant trick combinations.The game is challenging without being overly so. I have not attempted to play it online, but I'm sure that could be a fun ride, too. I would recommend this to any family with kids who enjoy any sort of skating or other sports. It's a fun game the whole family can enjoy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2013"}

The presentation is slick, the characters are unique, both in personality as well as fighting, and the gameplay never gets old.  While tekken doesn't have the same depth as virtua fighter, its more fun, and more accessible.  The controls work just right so if you're a novice you may have some fun, but if you put your time in, you're very rewarded.  The only complaint I have it that there are few minor glitches, including a glitchy online system.  Though this should be corrected through updates, and there's nothing amazingly innovative that makes the franchise feel fresh.  But these things don't hugley detract.Overally, Tekken 6 is an excellent fight game, with a ton of replayability.  Recomended!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2009"}
{"product_name":"B004P7VGF2","description":"As Vincent, a man recently succumbed to the irresistible beauty of the game's titular diversion, players find themselves swept into a treacherous love triangle. Catherine's core themes-those of free will, of the delicate nature of relationships and the choices we make within them, marry perfectly with the intense, terror-filled gameplay that serves to accurately reflect Vincent's growing sense of anxiety. It is an experience wholly unlike any to come before it, and is certain to leave gamers talking and thinking about Vincent's tribulations long after the credits have rolled.","reviewerName":"Nona","summary":"A fun puzzle game with a great story","reviewText":"Catherine's gotten a bit of attention in the gaming world because of its unusual story and reputed difficulty, not to mention its unusually prominent (at least for a video game) sexual themes.  Fortunately, Catherine succeeds both as a puzzle game and as a tale about adulthood, infidelity, and love.  The actual game is nowhere near as sexual as its packaging or advertising makes it out to be (though you probably still don't want your 10 year old kid playing this game), so if you're looking for that, you'll probably be disappointed.There are three main characters in Catherine - Vincent Brooks, the protagonist, Katherine (yes, that's with a \"K\"), Vincent's longtime girlfriend who is starting to push Vincent towards marriage, and Catherine, a mysterious young woman who enters Vincent's life out of the blue.  Catherine is unusually aggressive in pursuing Vincent, and before he knows it, he has a drunken one-night stand with her.  Needless to say, this causes all sorts of complications in his relationship with Katherine.  The fact that various men around town are dying strange deaths in their sleep only adds to Vincent's stress.There are two distinct modes of gameplay within Catherine, and the game keeps them more or less separate from each other.  On the one hand, there's the story of the game, which occurs during the day.  The story is told through anime cutscenes and an interactive environment in the local bar, the Stray Sheep, where Vincent can walk around, talk to other patrons, the staff, play an arcade game (which is a variation on the puzzle game which takes place during Vincent's nightmares), watch the TV news, and even get drunk.  The gameplay here is surprisingly deep - your interactions with other customers early in the game can drastically alter their stories in the latter part of the game.  Responses Vincent makes to other people (and there are lots of these decisions) also alter an \"order/chaos\" meter, which impacts the ending of the game.  The story-driven part of the game probably occupies something like 1/3 or so of the total playtime of Catherine.The puzzle part of the game takes place during Vincent's nightmares.  He needs to climb up massive block structures before the bottom part of the structure falls out from under him, thereby killing him.  It's a bit hard to explain the gameplay in words, but you can watch lots of videos on game review sites or Youtube.  Basically, you want to climb up this large vertical structure, and can climb onto blocks one level above you, so you need to push and pull blocks to arrange them in a pattern which makes it possible to keep moving up.  The bottom of the structure gradually falls away, which acts as the timer for these puzzles.  The game starts out relatively simple, but as you get further in the game tosses more and more types of blocks at you, like heavy blocks, spike blocks (which kill you if you don't immediately walk off them), bomb blocks, ice blocks, and monster blocks.  There are also items which grant beneficial effects to Vincent.  Each night concludes with a \"boss fight\" of sorts, where you don't actually fight a boss, but each boss has its own distinct mechanic it adds to the climbing puzzle.It's not immediately obvious from the description above that the game is hard, but as many people have already mentioned, the game is hard - definitely harder than the average game out there.  Fortunately, Catherine comes with three (actually four, there's a \"secret\" Very Easy difficulty) difficulty levels, and \"Easy\" isn't prohibitively hard, although I don't think the average player would call describe it as \"easy\" either.  The developers did a good job making death frustrating.  There are checkpoints scattered throughout most levels so you don't have to restart at the very beginning if you die, and the levels aren't prohibitively long.  As the story puzzles are designed in advance, if you repeatedly die on a level you will gradually get better at it as you learn to climb more efficiently.  There was really only one level (out of more than twenty) which gave me any noticeable amount of frustration.A full initial playthrough of the game should take most people between ten and fifteen hours.  Fortunately, Catherine has A TON of replayability.  Replaying levels you have already completed (for higher scores or just for fun) is incredibly convenient.  If you get gold medals on enough levels, you unlock bonus levels which are outside of the story.  These levels are randomly generated, long, and incredibly difficult (substantially harder than any of the story levels), so if you're up for the challenge they will keep you occupied for many, many hours.  (If you look at the online leaderboards for the random levels, only about 250-300 people in the entire world have posted a completion of the most difficult bonus level.)  The arcade puzzle game, called \"Rapunzel\", has over a hundred (short) levels, and is a nice variant on the primary puzzle play in that it requires you to complete block puzzles not in a fixed amount of time, but in a fixed number of moves.  The story also has immense replayability; the game has eight distinct endings, all of which are quite different from each other.  The conclusion of the story can vary tremendously based on your actions during the story portion of the game.  In perhaps one of the most pleasantly surprising design decisions in Catherine, once you get a gold medal on a story puzzle level in either normal or hard difficulty, you can skip that level entirely at that difficulty.  What this means is that if you want to see all the different endings or just see how the story part of the game changes if you play differently, you can quickly do so by skipping the puzzle portions of the game.This game really does a lot of things right; to be honest I can't identify any major flaws.  There are some frustrations with the controls and camera work when Vincent climbs behind the blocks, but this happens so infrequently that I can't really describe this as a \"major\" flaw.  The game definitely is not for everyone; if you hate puzzle games you're probably not going to like Catherine.  If you're aren't sure whether this game is your cup of tea, try downloading the demo from PSN or borrowing it from a friend.  The story is surprisingly mature and grasps with issues that no other game really has addressed, like commitment and infidelity.  The initial playthrough takes a comparable amount of time to most other non-RPG games, but the replayability can easily extend the amount of time you play this game by a factor of, say, five.  It's good to see original, unique games like Catherine being published and doing well, and hopefully the creative minds at Atlus will keep up the good work.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2011"}

But no game has ever surpassed it in its genre (multi-player racing games). Wanna know why?First there is the single-player mode. I must say that for a children's game the adventure mode is remarkably challenging. But if you want to play all of the levels, (and certainly if you want to unlock all the hidden characters) you'll have to play through it. The challenges are interesting (if a bit repetitive and possibly even annoying). But once you get passed the main single player mode, the REAL game starts.You can describe the multi-player in this game in one word: Perfection. Every character handles differently, and has a unique personality. Every levels has short-cuts and a unique look and feel. The four-player graphics are remarkably fast, detailed, and smooth for being on a 64-bit system. And the controls really are perfect. And since you have to get bananas to go faster, find and hit every speed boost pad you can, and collect balloons for offense and defensive power-ups, you can never let your guard down. Each and every level can be experienced a variety of different ways. You can play every level reversed, and you can try every level with cars, hover-crafts, and planes (and players can even use diffent vehicles on the same course at the same time!). When this game came out it won awards for technical achievement. They were well deserved. I do not think there has ever been a split-screen racing game to match it. Not in gameplay, not in graphical prowess, and certainly not in fun factor. A great game for kids and adults.

{"product_name":"B005J5K9UW","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Idiot's Delight","reviewText":"\"Lollipop Chainsaw\" is one of the most genuinely stupid games I've played in my entire life. Its dialogue is reliant on a nonstop barrage of crude jokes and puns, its gameplay consists of decapitating hoards of zombies as a cheerleader, and it makes loving references to 80's pop music, internet culture, and, most obviously, zombie films. This is a game where Dead or Alive's \"You Spin Me Right Round\" blasts as you're mowing down undead mobs with a tractor combine, and where a motor attached to the protagonist's chainsaw propels her fast enough to jump hundreds of feet into the air and produce a giant rainbow behind her. Everything about this game is over the top, silly, and utterly idiotic. That is why it's one of the best games I've ever played.Suda51, creator of beloved gems like \"No More Heroes\", has teamed up with the writer of \"Slither\" to produce a brilliant throwback to the insane arcade games of the mid-90's. You know the ones I'm talking about. The brawlers with vibrant colors, nonsensical plots, and infectious music. Games with satisfying gameplay, insane characters, and boss stages that are as creative as they are punishing. In a market brimming with dark shooters and motion control minigames, this game is a beautiful, bloody spew of rainbow vomit. Not content to put forth any less effort than 120% at all times, the world Grasshopper Manufacture has created is nothing short of extraordinary.The concept is about as out there as they come. The gleefully destructive Juliet Starling, along with her sisters Rosalind and Cordelia, has been trained in the ways of zombie killing since she was a baby, killing her first fiend when she was six months old. She also has a pathological obsession with lollipops and is an ace cheerleader. Her boyfriend, Nick, has fallen pretty hard for her, but doesn't know quite how to react when she decapitates him and begins to wear him on her hip to save him from a zombie infection. This unlikely couple, one a ditsy optimist and the other a sardonic pessimist, have to work together if they hope to exterminate the root of a zombie plague that threatens to destroy humanity.This re-donk-ulous concept is anchored by Juliet herself, played by the wonderful Tara Strong (Twilight Sparkle in \"My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic\"). No matter the situation, Juliet always has something witty to say, whether it be a unique observation or an entirely abstract musing about the most random of things. She is not a cold female warrior or a victimized survivor like too many female protagonists are these days. This character is funny, courageous, and a true lead in every since of the word. Her actions are defined by nobody but herself, which is such a rare thing in games today. Hats off to Suda51 for breaking the mold once again with another stellar lead character.The gameplay should not be overshadowed by the zaniness of the game itself, however. What has been cooked up in this department is nothing short of miraculous, a sweet slice of brawler goodness. Juliet is, pardon the pun, a cut above every other beat-em-up protagonist today not because of the strength of her attacks, or the arsenal she wields. No, because even though both of those things are great, what defines this character is the fluid and creative way her cheerleader routines get thrown into the combat. Wielding a chainsaw is much more satisfying when it's prefaced by piggybacking over an enemy, whacking them with your pompoms a few times, then executing a twirling jump into the air before slicing straight through their neck. But this is all stuff you can do at the beginning of the game. When you start unlocking more moves and new upgrades, combat gets elevated to a whole new level within an hour or so of playing. \"Lollipop Chainsaw\" delivers some of the most intense and fun fights I've ever had, and the level of control it gives is enough to alleviate the occasional frustration brought on by camera quirks and cheap enemy knockdowns.Variety is the spice of life, though, and the game also delivers this in spades. Sure, the brunt of the experience is spend chopping zombies to bloody, rainbow-tinged bits, but that's not all you do. No, you also get to baseball by shooting zombies with explosives while Nick (temporarily possessing a body) runs the bases; you get run through a kart racing-style obstacle course and hurdle off of rainbow ramps. Shooting, obstacle courses, driving... this game offers such a wealth of varied gameplay styles that one's head begins to spin, not knowing what's going to happen at any given second, which is exactly how the developers intended. It's constantly defying expectations, which sets it apart from the pack.Graphically, it's not a triple-A title, but what it lacks in polish it makes up for in inventiveness. You'll be slashing your way through schools, farms, arcades and hallucinatory dystopias inhabited by giant killer chickens. You're not going to get these types of locations from any other game. Same goes for the overall aesthetic look of the combat. Instead of just packing on the blood and guts (which it does as well), the carnage is punctuated by giant glowing hearts and vibrant rainbows. Nothing says \"brutal murder\" like a huge heart exploding from a decapitated corpse, after all. Also a nice touch are how remarkably well-designed all of the characters are, including the zombies. Juliet herself can be decked out in a ridiculous amount of costumes, her older sister looks like a butch biker, and her younger sister looks like something the 80's threw up. Zombies range from obese farmers to lanky rockers to bubblegum-chewing baseball pitchers. There's a big emphasis on clothing, so much so that there's an Achivement/Trophy for staring up Juliet's skirt for an extended period of time. You're welcome.The sound is just as wonderful as everything else. Musically, the game is broad and diverse, covering a huge range of genres. This is thanks to famed composer Akira Yamaoka, whose wealth of musical knowledge fits this game like a glove. Techno, jam band, and garage rock are just a few of the types of music you're going to hear. Spicing this up is an astounding amount of licensed music, my personal favorite being Toni Basil's \"Mickey\", which cranks up every time Juliet activates her powered-up mode. Others include cuts by Dead or Alive and The Runaways, which round out one of the most diverse games of the past decade. Also worth noting is the boss stage music by Mindless Self Indulgence frontman Jimmy Urine, who also voices the first boss stage.While the game itself is somewhat short, this isn't something you play just once. So many costumes, so many unlockables, and (from my understanding) an alternate ending are all good reasons to keep playing, but something else may drive players out there to wear this disc out: Scoreboards. This game is more arcade-style than most of the \"arcade games\" on the Live Marketplace or Playstation Network, and it's perfect for single-level playthroughs to get JUST ONE MORE POINT than the other guys and gals playing. It was a smart inclusion in what was already a great package.Grasshopper Manufacture has struck gold once again, and created the best game to come out of them since \"No More Heroes.\" \"Lollipop Chainsaw\" is a bright, gaudy, and joyfully stupid breath of fresh air to an industry plagued by far too military shooters and kiddie games. There has never been, and most likely will never be, another game like this. On top of that, it's a dang fine time for just about anybody. Years from now, I'll still be remembering this game, and comparing what I'm playing at the moment to it.Exceeding all expectations, \"Lollipop Chainsaw\" has become one of the greatest games I've ever played. Well played, Suda51. Well played.Plot: 10Gameplay: 10Graphics: 9.75Sound: 10Overall: 10 (Must-Play)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00005TNI6","description":"Final Fantasy Xis the first title in this landmark RPG series to be released for the PlayStation2. The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"Dressi \"K N D\"","summary":"Is it everything you expected? No...  but that's not bad...","reviewText":"Lowdown:Genre: RPGSetting: 1000 years Postapocolyptic... World named SpiraFF elements Present: Save points, 3 member battle party (with a twist), White mage and black mage, Summons.We all expected something grande, big.  Probably something like a brand new Final Fantasy with everything in it big and full... kinda like FF8 was.  Luckily we got all that and hardly any of it at the same time.  This FF team was the same team that did 8 (notice the character design).  There are many things that make this game a good addition and just as many that make this a thorn in the Final Fantasy legacy.  Why is that?Well from the beginning Final Fantasy has always been the saving grace for Squaresoft.  It wan't until Square's break with Nintendo over the N64 secrecy and move to Sony that Final Fantasy saw changes.  Yes there were differences, like the Job class system in Final Fantasy 5 that differed from 4 and 6 which was a complete opposition to 5 in so many ways (in so many good ways - there is a reason FF5 never came to the states to begin with).  FFVII opened up a whole new door that was amazing and venturous, the limit break system, a system of Materia the first developing items in FF (with exception).  FFVIII added more and more micromanagement that somewhat saved the game from it's lack of story line (and in reverse the story line saved the game from the redundant and complexities of the management system).  FFX takes this management into a simpler light.  They returned to a system common to FF: Item enhancements upon characters; and then added the ability to enhance the items....  The only micro management available in FFX is with the piece by piece management with the Aeons, which really isn't necessary and can be left out completely without hindering the game progress.What does it have especially similar to Final Fantasy's?  It has summons... but not a lot of them.  Nothing like FF6, 7, 8, 9... Just the most basic, Ifrit, Shiva and Bahamut are carryovers.  The Magus sisters are a cameo and the others are new in their own roles.  The magic is similar, no changes there... Ultima is returned after an absence in 9.  Cait Sith makes a Cameo as weapon.  Chocobos have a large role and of course there is a Sid.  Weapons are there, Cactars and Qactars... other enemies Ultima and Omega.What's New?  The system of Spheres, the leveling system is completely new.  You build your character according to XP gained to earn Sphere Levels... these levels are spent to move to a place on the Sphere Grid.  THere's a wonderful tutorial to teach you all about it.  The Character Change idea is the greatest new addition... ability to change characters, equipment and so on during battle.  The other great thing is the removal of the wait in ATB.  ATB is still present as it was back in the day when the wait until the next action was cut out.  You move from action to action.  If you use haste you get more actions.  But you can see ahead and see your opponents turns and plan for them.  The escape allows the current character to escape leaving the other two.  A Summon is now a playable character.  There is no MP spent in summoning them but they now have HP (As in FFVIII, kinda) and MP as well.  You can't fully control them but you have more control than ever before.  And also a great change has occurred... HP's of 99,999...?  damage of 99,999? higher MP too... a superbeast with i don't know how much HP...  A monster arena that you can't die in and lets you achieve all this.What's Missing?  Moogles, whose role in FF9 was huge and in FF6 became a playable character Mog.  The Ultima Weapon... missing in FF8 (done by the same people as FFX).  Almost as few class distinctions as there were in FF8 (again... same developers).  Other classic Summons we've grown to love and adore (and probably found useless anyway, honestly how many times did you summon Carbuncle...)  The World map is missing... you have to walk everywhere until you get later in the game.  There IS a map but not there has been before.  Wonderfully a card game is missing, and Namingway will probably never return to your local Inn.So a lot is new... a lots missing... and enough has returned.  It's a whole new game on a whole new system.  The CG is the best i've seen in a game, Period.  The 3D environments aren't that disimilar from the pregenerated images of the past and are wonderful to gawk at in the beginning.  The vocals are wonderful as well and really add to the Movie like quality of the game.  I remember playing Xenogears and wonder how i managed during the second disk.Its good.  Get it.  Any FF fan would.  Many non FF players have found this to be their first FF ever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2002"}
{"product_name":"B0009XEC0C","description":"Mario Baseball delivers terrific arcade sports gaming, combined with classic Mario game action! All the challenges of the popular sport combined with the weird, wacky fun of Mario's world come together, for laughs and thrills.","reviewerName":"JoeAZ92","summary":"Mario Baseball is easy to pick up and rewarding to master, but most importantly it's just plain fun.","reviewText":"Mario has proven himself to be a diverse character in the world of video games. Not only does he save Princess Peach repeatedly, he also races karts, embarks on grand RPG adventures, and even participates in many sports. Mario Superstar Baseball (MSB) is one such sport game in which everyone's favorite plumber goes head to head against other characters from his world. The first baseball outing for Mr. Red is quite awesome, and it's sheer fun all the way through.MSB starts off with a cutscene that basically explains the gist of the story. Baseball is the popular sport in the Mushroom Kingdom at the time, and Bowser sends out a challenge to all the major characters of the Mario universe. The challenge is basically to beat all the other teams, and then beat the Koopa King himself. This is the back-story behind the challenge mode, and while it isn't exactly intriguing or interesting it provides a background for the game, which is what it's meant to do.The Challenge mode is the game's main single player mode. It has four difficulty levels to play through like all Mario sport games. That's about the only thing about MSB that's similar to other Mario sport games, though: the rest is very unique. You pick one of the major captains (Mario, Peach, Yoshi, DK, or Wario) and play the other four you didn't pick, making their players join you along the way. This is done in an especially interesting mission template; where throughout a game missions will come up and for each completed mission you earn a flag, and earning enough flags for a character makes them join your team. This character element is one of the standout features of the Challenge mode, but even more so is the ability to make characters reach Star rank. You have to perform certain tasks with each individual character to earn them stars which, when you've earned them all, upgrades them to the Star rank, which in turn makes them better, more skilled players. These challenges range from hitting the ball to pitching a perfect game to reaching a certain score on a minigame, so it's easy to see the range of difficulty and variety of missions offered. You can even keep the stars you've earned by saving over the file you used after you beat the game to play through again and get more stars, encouraging many replays.Although the Challenge mode is MSB's main attraction, the game offers a few other diversions as well. There are a few minigames, none of which are particularly great but they're decent enough to enjoy and incorporate the game's elements nicely. There is also a unique Toy Field mode where the four participants (human or computer controlled) try to collect the most coins by various means. This mode is pretty solid as well, but it still can't divert much attention from the actual baseball games.Playing MSB is simple, which makes the game easy to pick up and play. Everything moves very smoothly, whether it be positioning a batter in the batter's box or running to catch a ball. Batting and pitching is as simple as pressing or holding A, and running involves mashing B to speed up and Y or X to advance a base or turn back. This all works great, but there are some control issues that are outside the realm of the controller. For example, a runner on base will sometimes go when you don't want them to, and some fielding situations are done incorrectly because you take automatic control of the wrong character. Issues like that are really annoying but not too frequent, so it doesn't hinder the experience much.MSB's simplicity makes it easy to jump in and play, but there is also some depth to the game. Advanced players can play the game more strategically, especially since there is a very wide variety of characters with unique skills. Making proper use of characters that can catch balls from farther away, jump extra high, and run extra fast takes more time to learn, but is very rewarding. Each character has a special Star ability too, where they hit a fireball or bullet bill, for example, or throw pitches similar to their special hit. Using all these techniques also deepens the actual gameplay, because you have to have a deeper skill in controlling the characters. So while MSB is easy to play, it's rewarding to look deeper and enhance your knowledge and skill.MSB is also a great looking game. The typical 3-D Mario graphics are at their finest for the time, with everything looking sharp and smooth. Character animations are fluid and fairly realistic, although occasionally a player will catch a ball without their glove in front of them. The menu interfaces are also nice; switching positions is a cinch and changing up the batting order is just as simple. The animated cutscenes, though, are the finest graphical points in the game; they look simply fantastic.The game also sounds just as good as it looks. All the sound effects, whether it be hitting a ball or characters making noise, are all great. The sound of hitting a ball is particularly satisfying, especially when you know you've hit one out of the park and it goes flying up into the air. The music tracks are also very good and fitting to their respective stadiums. The only problem with the sound is the two songs in the game that have lyrics in them: they're really lame. \"Let's play baseball every day! Let's play baseball every night!\" and \"Let's play a baseball game!\" just don't sound very original; in fact they sound extremely juvenile. I could see a little kid enjoying the songs, but anyone over the age of seven won't appreciate these two jingles one bit.Overall, Mario Superstar Baseball is an awesome game. It stands out within the Mario sport series with its deep challenge mode and simple gameplay that offers some good strategy and skill for advanced players. Most importantly, though, MSB is just plain fun. It's really easy to just kick back and play a game of baseball with this title without worrying about loads of complications and realism, and that's why MSB earns itself such a positive review and loads of play time.Positive:+ single player Challenge mode is great+ vast selection of characters+ plenty of depth for advanced players+ simple but fun gameplay+ sharp visuals+ satisfying sound effectsNegative:- some confusing control issuesTHE FINAL VERDICT: MSB is a fantastic sport game that's simple enough for beginners but deep enough for advanced players, and the Challenge mode will keep anyone playing for hours. Above all else, though, it's just plain fun.FINAL SCORE: 9.0/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2009"}

Alone, or with a friend, you could tackle giant rats, undead monsters, dark elves, and even a white dragon, as you uncovered a plot against the good city of Baldur's Gate. But the ending indicated there was more adventure to come. Fans were worried that the sequel wouldn't live up to original's promise when the original design team jumped ship to work on Sony'sChampions of Norrath: Realms of EverQuest. They need not have worried;Dark Alliance 2is a worthy successor, retaining the weapons, monsters, Dungeons and Dragons action and rules, sharp graphics, responsive controls, and high adventure of its predecessor.The plot is a bit darker this time, but you're given a wider range of character classes to help face the elevated threats. There's the mighty barbarian, a dwarf rogue, a cleric, the monk (a martial artist), and a necromancer. The quest is huge and there are character-class specific side quests you can embark on--an extra incentive to play again as a different character. The level design tends to be a little too maze-like, and there's lots of boring backtracking, but the annoying jumping puzzles from the first game are gone.The biggest problem withDark Alliance 2is that it doesn't measure up to the competition. It's a 2-player game, whileDungeons & Dragons Heroes(on the Xbox) andChampions of Norrath(on the PS2 and Xbox) allow four-player play.

This 2nd installment of Dark Alliance expands the characters the classes and the missions allowing for sub-missions for each class and a prestige reward for completing the sub-missions.  The Human Barbarian, Drow Monk, Dwarven Thief, Human Cleric, and Elven Necromancer made the game well worth the time to play.  Learning off the first game and play to subtle hints and well crafted voice acting the tradition of fine game-play is not lost in Dark Alliance 2.  For story purposes it's not a bad idea to play the first Dark Alliance game but the way this game was designed it certainly is not a requirement.  Plug, play, enjoy.

This one is nowhere near any of its predecessors (except maybe Call of Duty 3).The Zombies thing is standard affair, and the multiplayer takes a lot from Modern Warfare 2, adds a lot of new things, but overall still feels the same as World at War's multiplayer (which isn't really a bad thing; my biggest problem with WaW's multiplayer was that bolt-action rifles were made virtually pointless against machine guns) including identical menus and perk icon designs.It may definitely be a troublesome task trying to pick between this and MW2 for casual multiplayer gaming.The single player campaign, however, is a total disaster, by the standards set in every Call of Duty game since COD4, or perhaps even COD2.The story:- The story doesn't even begin to come into shape until mid-way through the campaign.  It starts with Generic Loner Badass Alex Mason, the guy with virtually the same name as the guy from Red Faction: Guerrilla, and so badass, John F Kennedy tells him directly he's the best they've got, in a pretty non-Cold War looking room full of television screens, apparently strapped into a chair and being questioned angrily by a distorted voice.  Every mission save for the last are in the form of flashbacks from this location.Alex Mason is painfully unlikeable, with no personality and no real redeeming traits, and the acting done by Sam Worthington with him is so painfully dull, or painfully overacted, it makes his \"Avatar\" performance look Oscar-worthy.  At no point in the game did I care about what he was doing or what was wrong with him.In fact, I realized he was pretty stupid for a CIA agent and BEST FIGHTER GUY IN THE EVAR, given not only the poor decisions made for the control interface (such as taking twice as long now to throw back grenades, or being unable to pilot a Hind to have it rise up or down, while being able to do everything else in it).  The plot twist at the end involving Reznov was alluded to, which helped in making the preceding scenes not seem stupid in hindsight, came about quite confused and unclear, and Alec Mason's brutish reaction to it is the sort of thing that, given that there is a TIMER RUNNING on the DESTRUCTION OF THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND PERHAPS THE ENTIRE WESTERN HEMISPHERE, makes him cartoonishly buffoonish, especially given that this plot twist has virtually NOTHING TO DO with the very ending in stopping this aforementioned destruction.The story is so convoluted, that I honestly don't even remember what the first five or six missions were, and why.  It just seemed like they were there solely for the action.  Which you'd think would be a given for a video game, but this is not exactly commonplace in the Call of Duty franchise.  Considering the Jason Bourne-style rapidfire incoherence they approach it with, it might be a short stretch to say they were intentionally attempting to fill the game up with confusing early missions filled with nonstop action.When it finally gets to the story itself, it involves the Soviet Union attempting to wipe out the United States using a nerve gas called NOVA-6 that causes quick death, and is planned to be launched on the US mainland in several dozen spots, to pretty much destroy the entire country and its entire population.  Such a direct, apocalyptic action, given the theory of Mutually Assured Destruction, with both the US and USSR posessing over 9000 nuclear weapons each, the sanity, or even basic common sense of such a plan is... pretty nonexistent.  I know the Soviets were villainized harshly by the Americans, but I highly doubt they and their leaders were suicidal, homicidal, genocidal cretinsThe Missions:- The first few missions are a scatter-brained assortment of big set pieces with obscenely copious amounts of gunfire and explosions.  While scenes like the Bay of Pigs are surprisingly accurate with regards to scope, it still feels excessive with the sheer amount of gunfire that gets poured into you, and the enemy, in just the few minutes the level lasts, which amplified over the course of three days, would become excessive; the actual Bay of Pigs had between 100-200 dead, and 500+ wounded (not including civilians); the way it's depicted in the game, this all would possibly fit into the few minutes depicted.Virtually every level is a colossal mess of hundreds of soldiers (endlessly respawning, of course), constant explosions, a cacaphony of nutty weapons that I often question even existed in the 1960s (such as a proto-version of the Thermal Scope in MW2, or gun-mounted flamethrowers that somehow don't melt the gun's barrel after constant use, or high powered assault rifles with five different attachments on it), and gore that gets so copious, it becomes cartoonish; like shooting a soldier in the hand with a pistol, and having his ENTIRE HAND AND WRIST be blown off.  Or worse; shooting once at a soldier on a motorcycle, while also on a motorcycle, and having him literally explode into a vapor of small pieces of gore.- But the single worst, most frustrating thing about the missions is the legendarily thick AI.  I have NEVER seen AI this atrocious in the Call of Duty series since only the last mission of Call of Duty 4 (on Veteran Mode) with Ssgt. Griggs rushing out into the open, standing in front of an enemy, and shooting wildly in random directions.At least 70% or 80% of all missions will be You vs an Army, because your allies rarely, if ever, hit anything, and they ALWAYS take a few seconds before even RECOGNIZING an enemy soldier; I could not count the times a friendly unit would simply RUN PAST an enemy unit, and that enemy unit of course ignoring them and targeting ME exclusively.This sort of stupidity is even scripted, as in one sequence a group of friendlies is ambushed by Vietcong soldiers, and as one of them is shooting a friendly soldier dead, one of your allies rushes up to him, holding his assault rifle near his waist, Hollywood-style, the gun jams, he looks down at it, struggles to fix it, and the Vietcong soldier turns around, LOOKS AT HIS GUN, then uses his own gun to bash the man upside the head.  THIS MAN IS SUPPOSED TO BE AN INSANELY WELL-TRAINED SPECIAL OPS SOLDIER.Another frustrating problem, almost as bad as the horrendous AI, is actually SEEING who is an enemy and who isn't.  Whereas in the WW2 games, people wore uniforms, and even in Modern Warfare 2, you could tell who the OpFor agents were, due to their haphazard attire and occasional turbans, or who Russians were based on their dark red fatigues, here, EVERYONE IS DRESSED EXACTLY THE SAME in the same assortment of pants or jeans, shirts, vests, jackets, masks, headpieces, ALL DARK.  The only people not dressed this way are Vietcong and NVA soldiers (and Nazis in a flashback mission).The horrendous AI doesn't help with this either; there's such a gape in the reaction time for enemy AI, that I've never EVER adapted to turning a corner, seeing someone there, and just waiting for a full second to see if they're a friendly, or if they shoot me, or if I end up shooting at them and they turn out to be an ally.Another incredibly frustrating element is the Hind piloting.  Alex Everyman gets to do BOTH the piloting AND the shooting, and the limitations means that while you can't crash your helicopter into caverns or walls or upside big ships (which is a good thing) you also can't elevate or descend (which is a very very bad thing).  There comes a point in one mission where you have to destroy two opposing Hinds, and you're all alone.  The missiles do NOT lock on in ANY way, and the enemy Hinds CONSTANTLY rise and descend to avoid YOUR incoming fire, whereas YOU can not.  Sometimes, they will even fire DOWN at you, with you unable to hit them unless you turn on your side, strafing wildly and trying to shoot at them while you're moving at high speed.  Add to the frustration for achievement-hunters, there is an achievement for accomplishing this mission WITHOUT using the Hind's cannons, and ONLY using its rockets.  The rockets are infinite, but they reload slowly.  Fatally slow, up against the two Hinds, if you're not a good shot.The Weapons:- Like I mentioned before, I think there's a slight credibility gap with regards to some of the weapons in the game, or weapon upgrades which seem either ridiculous, a bit of a stretch to picture existing in the 1960s, or incredibly goofy.  A gun with a bottom-mounted flamethrower is an awesome thing in game, but I've never seen or heard of this being used before, and it would seem to me that, given where the flame begins, continued use would melt the gun barrel.  There's a neat variety of guns, perhaps more than in Modern Warfare 2.One of the great things is that most of the guns have a more realistic sound than in previous games, more like firecrackers than bombs.The multiplayer has a new system of upgrading in which you do not unlock weapons, perks, or upgrades in a linear way, but you earn \"money\" in each match, and use it to purchase weapons, perks, upgrades, etcetera.  This is neat, as you can choose to unlock a laser sight ahead of a grenade launcher, or to unlock your favorite Assault rifle before your favorite Shotgun, but this introduces a whole new issue, which would probably not be an issue for many players:It renders certain upgrades useless.  Why bother to buy Laser sight, when you can get a better sight, or a Reflex sight, which is exactly the same, and only different in aesthetics?  Why upgrade something you don't like?  Why buy a perk you never use?  With previous games, you could unlock certain things by kills, and unlock other things by kills using certain upgrades (such as unlocking Holographic sights by getting 60 kills with Laser sights), essentially forcing you to use virtually every upgrade in order to unlock the rest.The Characters:- There are the standard character archetypes here; the Generic Loner Badass protagonist, the Token Black Guy (who obviously dies first), the Sidekick Guy, the Scrappy, the Tough All-Business Veteran Guy, the Nerdy Politician (voiced by Robert Picardo), etcetera.  None of them are particularly interesting.Most of all, Alecks Mason, is called the BEST THEY HAVE and treated like a testosterone-souped Mary Sue, complete with no evidence of why he is the BEST THEY HAVE, no likeable characteristics, a dull tone of voice, total lack of charisma, and either a below average intelligence, or very poor judgement.  I found myself smacking my forehead, calling him such an idiot as, towards the end, he needlessly punches the guy trying to help him, and trying to SAVE THE COUNTRY FROM TOTAL DESTRUCTION just so he can stumble about in a drugged haze, and then get punched in return later on.However, there is the appearance of Viktor Reznov, Sergeant from World at War, boistrously performed by Gary Oldman.  With the dullness of playing as Alex Mason all game wearing me down, a flashback mission from October 1945 with me as Reznov, and also speaking, I was rejuvenated, and found myself actually having fun instead of going through the motions with the game.  We also get to see Dimitri Petrenko from World at War, and him speaking, but it's nothing remarkable.  It's also refreshing to hear music from World at War returning for the flashback mission.Possibly the single biggest problem I have with the characterizations is that they all behave like movie stars in a generic Hollywood action flick.  The military professionalism of the special ops teams and armies in the Modern Warfare series was taut and compelling and COOL.  Here, the actors chomp scenery madly, spouting lines with ridiculous intonation, a total lack of professionalism among them.  There's no dry humor or wisecracks, military-slanged quips, or \"Cut the chatter!\"s, but tons of \"Hell yeah!\" and \"Kick some ass!\" and all other sorts of adolescent trash talk.Playing through the campaign was a dismal, frustrating, boring experience.  The multiplayer is not any MAJOR improvement over Modern Warfare 2, and its true staying power may, as with World at War, lie with its Commie Zombie functions.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2011"}
