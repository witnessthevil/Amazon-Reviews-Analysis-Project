It looks like this is another game that I fell for the hype on and is NOTHING like advertised.This is a SINGLE PLAYER review.This is a Fun, Short, game... Worth a rental on a console but not to be bought on a PC.I beat the game in about 8 hours, so I played it all the way through. This is even after, and I use the term loosely \"Exploring\" and doing \"Side missions.\"It runs fine on my computer at the in-game locked rate of 60fps at 1920x1080 Resolution: A quad core 3.0ghz Intel chip, with an evga 790i ftw digital motherboard and a 460GTX Nvidia card running graphics and an Nvidia 9800gtx+ handling physics (when applicable). Windows 7 x64 ultimate, and 16gb of DDR3 1600 ram.I'm going to break down how badly this game missed the mark by using the very lies that were in the description here on amazon...\"-Visceral 1st-person gunplay and exploration - Take on bandit gangs and hordes of mutants using an arsenal of exotic weapons and special items,Such as wingsticks, personal turrets, sentry bots, and remote-controlled bomb cars.\" --- The gunplay was fun but most badguys take massive amounts of shots to finally go down and stay down, so most gun fights involve running backwards while reloading to take care of the last two badguys in a \"horde.\" I wouldn't exactly call the amount of weapons in this game as being an \"Arsenal\" More like a \"Few\" projectile weapons and an okay amount of gadgets. And you cannot even pick up the weapons that the enemies drop, they just sort of \"magically\" vanish... Same thing happens with most baddies bodies, they just POOF. Though I have to admit that the enemy A.I. was pretty decent when compared to most FPS games out now.\"-Frenetic 3rd-person vehicular mayhem - Upgrade and customize your car with special parts, paint jobs and weapons.\" --- Again, the wrong use of words. I wouldn't call the vehicle combat \"Frenetic\" I'd call it more along the lines of a bunch of boring driving from point a to point b with a few moments of shooting and blowing up randomly appearing cars in obviously open areas. Though the car customization was very limited as you could choose, at most, two different paint schemes for each of the 4 cars and 1 ATV, it was still fun to upgrade and race. Though no matter how much you upgrade your vehicles, the other racers will always be able to match your speed or catch up (look up Rubber Band Racing A.I.), except in story races where they suddenly don't know how to drive.****\"-Graphics that have to be seen to be believed - Powered by id's cutting-edge new id Tech 5 engine, new Megatexture technology brings the vast wasteland to life in never-before- possible detail with action running at an astounding 60 frames per second.\"*** THIS IS WHERE THE GAME IS THE MOST DISAPPOINTING!! The graphics are, simply put, way out of date!! I mean, Read Dead Redemption on the Xbox 360 looks better than this, even Fallout new Vegas on PC without environment shadows still looks better than this game! I was led to believe that the whole new \"id Tech 5 engine\" was supposed to be all high tech and Next Gen... What a bunch of B.S.!! They don't even give you in game options for graphics other than Anti-Aliasing and screen resolution. There is no day or night cycle, the clouds don't move, I couldn't really tell how good the lighting was because it just seemed they would use massive amounts of bloom to emphasize bright light. Everything seems like it is out of focus or blurred, even looking at a big yellow and black Rail Road Crossing sign the RR and black line just seem, out of focus... Sort of like they were using 256bit map images for graphics instead of High Definition sized images. (it just seems this game was made purely for the outdated Xbox 360s DX9 system, or they didn't want to go to the trouble to use HD graphics) There is also this, annoying, \"POP IN\" of images and textures. If you suddenly look or spin left or right or up and down, the images and textures pop in a second later. There were just TOO MANY things going wrong here to make the game immersive.***\"-An expansive experience - Beyond the first-person action and vehicle combat, RAGE offers a world open to explore, with unique characters, side quests, and a compelling storyline.\"*** I absolutely HATE when companies label their games as \"Open World\" without knowing what that actually means. I don't know what their definition of \"OPEN WORLD\" is but it certainty wasn't GTA San Andreas, or Just Cause 2, Fallout 3, and New Vegas open world, or even on a lesser note, Fable style open world, though I would have to say this game seems to have a similar layout to fable, with less choice. I would call it a mostly linear corridor shooter with slightly open world driving areas and two different \"City\" areas. In almost all missions and areas you can only enter one way and exit another way, Point A to Point B kind of stuff. You cannot really walk up on a mountain and snipe at bad guys or sneak in from one way and avoid them or such, so don't buy this expecting Fallout or Deus Ex FPS choices. As for the story line... it ends WAY TOO SOON! The ending of the game feels more like it SHOULD HAVE BEEN the midway point, if that had been the case, then it would be getting a star or two more.\"-Three ways to play for unlimited action - Immerse yourself in a rich story-driven single-player experience, grab a friend for exclusive co-op modes, or go online for all-out multiplayer mayhem.\" I cannot attest to multi-player as I couldn't care less about multi-player games, and if I wanted a co-op post apocalyptic driving and shooting game I'd go for Borderlands, as it lasts MUCH, MUCH, MUCH, longer, and has infinite re-playability due to its unique weapons system. As stated above, there are just too many things going wrong to make this a truly \"IMMERSIVE\" game for me. Though I do have to give some credit to the facial animations and the top notch voice actors! But the game is just too short to really get me involved with its world.I may update this if ID decides to upgrade or patch this game in the next few months to give PC gamers the game they were expecting, but until then, it's just another console port and quite forgettable after finishing it. No real re-playability for the single player. But it is still a fun game, even with all the flaws and hype let down.---BOTTOM LINE----This is not the big 5 star AAA game it was hyped up to be.Again... It is a fun game on the first playthough... I just cannot recommend actually buying it for the PC at this time.Rent it on a console, because it just isn't the type of game worth owning.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2011"}

I'm a moderate gamer; the new controls are generally more complicated than I'm willing to commit to. He is a hard core gamer. Some games are easier to watch than others, and some are easier to play. This review is not for the hard core gamer. This review is for the girlfriend (or boyfriend, who am I to judge?) that sits on the couch and watches.Before Bayonetta even came out, we had to decide which console to purchase it for. This meant a demo play-through on both the 360 & PS3, followed by playing each demo to different parts of the game, then switching the input back and forth to compare the graphics. Mike liked the game play of the PS3 controller a little better, but the difference in graphics, at least on the demo, wasn't even close. The detail on the 360 made it a clear winner, and so that's the console we went with.I have to say, I really dig that whole naughty librarian, and Bayonetta rocks that look like no video game heroine I've ever seen. I'll have to see how brave my friend Deanna is, I think I've found her next Halloween costume!!I enjoyed watching this game, even if the dialogue seemed a bit accidentally campy at times. The story was decent, though not fantastic, and the game was very easy to watch. Play timed out at about 20 hours, but that was with Mike playing almost every chapter at least a second time. With a stack of unplayed video games in queue, Mike enjoyed this game to do something I rarely see him do, go for a second play-through on hard.

Very false. It is true that the Japanese version of MGS2 Sons of Liberty is slightly different from the US version, but the differences are relatively minor; e.g. You select the difficulty at the beginning of the game by answering questions, rather than simply choosing your desired difficulty from a list. Come to think of it, I can't name any other differences.MGS2 Substance is much MUCH more than merely an American release of the Japanese version. The skate boarding, the VR missions, the Snake Tales missions, playing as the Ninja, all of it is brand new. Both Japan and America will have two versions of MGS2, A) Sons of Liberty and B) Substance.

How in the world did I ever miss this one?  It must be over 5 years old now, and I've been gaming on the PC for over 10 years.  All I can say is shame on me!!  I used to wonder how people could get involved with RPG's that consist of tiny action sprites and a static overhead \"camera\" view.  Now I know -- do I ever!Note that this game is an absolute killer if you have any kind of life.  I would sit down after dinner just to play for a couple of hours and the next thing I'd know the clock would show 3:30 AM (with a workday coming up).  Make sure you eat and do other \"chores\" -- like taking a shower -- BEFORE you sit down to play.I know absolutely nothing (and don't really care) about D&D; rules (2nd version vs the 3rd, etc.), but it doesn't matter.  Create a character that appeals to you and just role play.  As you become more comfortable with the system, go for a dual class character.Your party of 5 NPC's quickly become like old friends with their own opinions, romances, squabbles, likes, dislikes, etc.  If they are strongly at odds with your decisions or if your reputation is too low/high, they will complain often (very annoying) and even leave the party.  Many of the walkthroughs I've seen seem to  stress the hack and slash aspect of this game, but I feel the character interaction is equally if not more important. It is what truly sets this game apart from the others (this game is the beginning of the Bioware \"touch\" which you can see in later games like KOTOR 1). And if you can choose one of three very different female NPC's to romance, why not go for it?  Most fun of all is to have a party composed of people with different alignments (good, neutral and evil).  Some of the byplay this creates is truly priceless.Certain other reviews have stated that the game should come with a printed manual (instead of the electronic one that is on one of the disks). I've found this to be unnecessary. The game controls are very intuitive, and you can identify any item or button immediately by placing the cursor over it and pressing the TAB key.  No need to wait.  Also, try to realize there is no way you can see everything in this huge game (150-200+ hrs.) during a single play-through (don't frustrate yourself by trying).  It takes AT LEAST two times through to learn how to use magic properly, do all the quests, learn the difference proper strategy can make, the effect of higher/lower intelligence, wisdom, charisma, etc.  Playing through as a different character class, using different NPC's and making different choices re the main quest will turn each play-through into a completely different game.In this vein, I would suggest that new players check out one of the many Baldur's Gate sites to learn some of the more advanced features of the game. Examples include how to use the \"wish spells\", the Deck of Many Things, how to have custom armor and weapons made, create and use \"familiars\", etc.  Using magic (probably the most powerful force in the game) correctly seems to be the hardest thing to master.Finally, I would recommend installing both Baldur's Gate 2 and Throne of Bhaal at the same time (if you intend to play the Throne expansion).  This makes the transition between the two completely seamless (as a single game).  The expansion is not quite as good as the main game, but it offers a definite and final end to the saga.  It's a bit combat-heavy, but I still enjoyed it.  And all this for 20 bucks -- what a deal![Edit:  7/17/06:  Be sure to check out the many mods available for BG2 and ToB.  There are easily installable mods for new party members, improved weapons and other items, additional quests, improved gameplay and just about anything you can think of.

Every first person shooter has to have 1) great controls 2) great feel 3) great presentation and overall a great feel. The first Modern Warfare was a great surprise in 2007, although the hype around it was buzzing, nobody really knew what to expect and the overall execution of the game was excellent, it was critcially acclaimed primarily for its multiplayer but as well as its single player campaign which provided thrills and chills all throughout. Modern Warfare 2 was expected to exceed the original (of course) in every possible aspect and it pretty much just did that. Everything from the graphics, new weapons, CO-OP (FINALLY!), and overall presentation has been turned up a notch; and the same great multiplayer people loved from the first one is the same great feel in this game.However, this isn't a perfect game, there are some minor problems I have with this game. The Single Player Campaign is great, it is pretty much almost completely different from the first game. The first modern warfare was great because it was very diverse, like hardcore sniping missions, to controlling vehicles etc. but Modern Warfare 2's missions feel a little too much alike at times. The game has a lot of moments where you just run and shoot which can get really hectic at times and a lot of moments where you are at the brink of dying haha which is kinda annoying. Another problem is that it is actually shorter than the first game which was very unexpected. Also i feel that the weapons in this are too overwhelming and are not really as balanced as the first game. There are a lot of cheapo cheapo weapons available and there are way too many weapons that are too similar to each other. But other than that, this installment is a worthy sequal and I believe it will sell another 10 million copies in the next couple of monthes. So Buy This Game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2009"}

There are four game modes which are all good, there is zones, capture the flag, team deathmatch and just normal deathmatch.

When I first started playing, I revived people, dropped medpacks, manned/assisted and repaired tanks etc. etc. I spawned on my squadmates when I got shot and was back in the action. On top of that I spotted enemies hitting the select button, which usually my squadmates and myself attacked and received a kill. This game not only is user friendly, it also has great sound and sound effects. A couple of weeks ago, my PSN friends and myself helped each other out to get the Platinum award by allowing us to use the repair tool to get the dentist award, get killed by 5 friends etc. We did this because we decided that we would move onto Medal of Honor.That didn't work out for us.The message I am trying to give is that this game is what my friends and myself want more of. Medal of Honor plays like COD4, without all the fun diverse classes. This game requires teamwork and skill.  Finally, my friends and myself are looking forward to purchasing any downloadable content for BBC2. ;-)For the n00bs, if you need pointers check out-Battlefield: Bad Company 2 - How Not To Be A Noob on YouTube.EA Dice, please keep this formula for BBC3.

A small vigil was held.Everything about this.... is. Just. Horrible. I was really looking forward to an improvement on the (already great) left 4 dead recipe. Players dropping in and out. Classes. Competitive online play. Couch co-op. Oh the fun times my wife and i were going to have. Shame on you gearbox.The graphics seem like they are still in development. The whole game does really. It FEELS like you are playing a rough draft. On some lower-rated games, I might throw out a phrase like &#34;get it from the $10 bargain bin&#34;. Not this time folks. The clipping and bugs, mixed with the blend of poor graphics torque you. They show you well enough what could have been, but is not.What upsets me most is that the Alien franchise/concept rarely gets the justice it deserves. If you are hinging a product to a franchise you should be held to certain quality standards. What is going on here? Instead Aliens are following Nicholas Cage's career recipe; start off strong and sell yourself to anyone.As for gear box, sometimes I wonder if they are the real life Producers (yes from the musical).  They've found a way to make more from a flop than a hit, under certain circumstances.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2013"}

It is very authentically American, reminding me a lot of the city of Pittsburgh with the freeways surrounding the city and the Italian flags on townhomes. When you drive, you will hear familiar tunes that you haven't heard in years and can't quite name.The detail is phenomenal. Walk into a bar and it really looks like a bar that you might have a drink in. It isn't a rush job like how GTA 4's interior's felt. It feels like the developers spent a significant amount of time crafting it, and it really shows. It feels like an American bar. Same for the other stores. You actually see other customers in these places doing their own thing.The game was so realistic that I found myself actually following the rules. The world was so authentic that I felt that it would be wrong to wage destruction on the citizens. So I stop at stoplights and I follow the speed limit. When I broke the speed limit, the cops pulled me over and I paid a fine. In the beginning, you see the protagonist Vito praying with his mother. How many games do this?Contrast this with GTA which is cynical to the core of it, down to like skipping out of a hospital completely healed up and still holding guns after murdering dozens of people on the street. GTA 4 is a game which I just cannot get myself to finish.I'm careful with my car because it costs money to repair the car. So I follow the rules of the world. There are more rules that are followed. I actually honk my horn at rude drivers. One driver side-swiped me and I got out in a fit of road rage. HOW DARE HE SIDE-SWIPE MY VIRTUAL CAR. Then I pulled out my gun but he shot me first.All of this makes for an incredibly immersive game world, because you really do have to act like a good citizen, much more so than other games.The games graphics are pretty good. They are on a whole better than GTA or Assassin's Creed graphics, while giving better detail in the character faces and animations, and populating the streets with a healthy number of people (more than you see in real life, actually). The PhysX makes for nice little touches that make the game more immersive like better flowing clothes.The AI is extremely good. For instance, in one mission, I'm sneaking around a building. I go in a room and I leave the door open. The guard sees the open door and walks in the room. I die.So next time around, I have to remember to keep doors closed while sneaking. Even stealth games like Splinter Cell don't have AI behavior this advanced. and speaking of doors, the game world makes me actually want to be a good citizen and close the door of my car or of the store I just exited.Another nice thing is that the game levels don't lead you around by the nose. They let you discover things yourself. For instance, in a level where I'm tasked with stealing some stamps they tell you about getting the key and opening a safe.What they don't tell you is that there's an alarm system tied to the safe. You have to discover this for yourself and disable it yourself.Might take multiple playthroughs, but is pretty neat. You have to really plan it out for yourself. There's no \"hit A, B, and C\" which I feel a lot of games end up doing.Now, there is a fair amount of tedium in this game, from driving around the freeways. I like this as it makes you feel like a regular guy driving his car around to the job -- like real life. You also get a chance to listen to the radio while doing this. Game reviewers and Call of Duty-heads don't really like it, but to me it just adds some more to the immersion.Amazing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2012"}

He is the last of a noble and respected line. Raised in a series of safehouses by families loyal to his father's memory, Lucas will not rest until the Legion is rebuilt, and his family's honor is restored. Lucas has been taught the art of combat in the ancient and deadly style of the Legion. Lucas is a skilled swordsman, and a master of two combat stances. He can fight with a sword and shield, which allows him to attack quickly, deal heavy damage, and interrupt and stun single targets. When outnumbered, he wields a massive two-handed sword. While slower to swing and less practical for one-on-one combat, it can strike multiple foes and knock them back, making it an ideal weapon for crowd control.AnjaliAnjali is an archon - a legend, come to life.

But Anjali was raised by friends of the Legion, and she does not know how she came to this world, or what happened to the others of her kind.Anjali can shift freely between her human form and an incarnation of elemental fire. In human form, she fights with a staff or a spear, allowing her to fend off multiple attackers while leaping in and out of the fray.

{"product_name":"B001E8VB6O","reviewerName":"DanD","summary":"An amazing, atmospheric, all-around engrossing game.","reviewText":"I've never been much of a comic book guy.  Or a video game guy, for that matter.  I just recently bought a PS3, however, and I knew that one of the games I wanted to purchase was \"Batman: Arkham Asylum.\"  Why?  Because it looked amazing.Well, it is.  The graphics are spectacular, and I'm not using that word lightly.  You can see the holes and tears Batman's suit acquires as he progresses through the levels; you can see minute details in the floors and walls and plants.  The water ripples, the leaves blow.  This game is about as real as a video game can be.It's an amazing story, too: The Joker has taken over Arkham Asylum.  What's Batman to do?  Stop him, of course!  You get all the Bat gadgets, plus some cameos from the vehicles.  You get to beat the living daylights out of the Joker's henchmen.  You get to take on some of your favorite villains (though I was sorely disappointed that the Riddler was absent; you spend much of the game trying to solve his riddles--to unlock content--but he's not actually in the game).  You get to use the Detective Mode to find clues and weaknesses.  And the voice cast--featuring Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill from the classic cartoon series that I was fortunate enough to grow up with--is spectacular; the cinematic scenes (many of which actually require you to move your character) look and feel just like a movie.  I would pay money to watch somebody play this video game.  The scenes leading up to the Scarecrow encounters are perhaps the best--the first and third are absolutely terrifying (I got chills, I really did), and the second is just plain haunting.  They don't pull any punches here.There are a few negative things, of course; at certain times, you have to multitask; I can't count the number of times I got shot in the back trying to hack into security doors.  Of course, I solved the problem by taking out the armed guards first (duh!), but the problem is there: like any game of this type, you don't have complete control over the camera.  It'll come back to haunt you.  And while the Detective Mode is spectacular, you often spend too much time in it, thus missing out on the amazing scenery of the game; I found myself saying to hell with the mission, and just walking around enjoying the stellar graphics.I can't tell you if this is the best Batman game out there, though I'm gonna go out on a limb and suggest it is.  If there's a better game, then I really need to play it.  \"Batman: Arkham Asylum\" is perhaps the most beautiful game I've had the luxury to play; granted, until my PS3 purchase a couple weeks ago, I haven't owned a gaming system since Super NES, but I think you get the point: This is a must-have game.  As in, if you play video games, you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't buy this.  It'll blow you away.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2009"}

Also note there is a few bonus characters designed by Japanese manga artists and the inclusion of two Star Wars characters.- Build your own unique characters from tons of costume items (and you can change the colors on any one of these items as well). You can pretty much make any character you want. Also you can edit the clothing of any of the regular fighters as well.- Finally be able to play Soul Calibur online over Xbox Live (note this is only for Gold users).BAD:- A lot of the cheesy/easy win moves discovered in Soul Calibur 3 are back and there are some new ones are well. This is really a pain online and worse with laggy.- The story is total nonsense and thankfully be just ignored.- Laggy online, while this is more of an issue with your internet connection if you don't have a strong connection your gonna see lots of lag online.IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- Has medieval theme, both European and Chinese/Japanese.- Not traditional fighting game in the sense that there is no real combos and or supers, and there is limited projectile moves.- Fight with weapons, like a 3D Samurai Showdown type of game or a Tekken/Dead or Alive with weapons.- A 3D fighting game that really uses the 3D space (with eight way run).- Build your own unique characters (pretty much costume only, you pick a pre-set fighting style) and fight with them in Versus, Tower, as well as online modes, (Lots of the new items and costume parts should be unlock to really get a better selection of costume accessories, not much to pick at default).- Have to unlock most of the game content like fighters, stages and items through many different modes of play, which takes time and skill (some people do not have either and will be upset with this).- Tower modes help you earn in-game money to unlock stuff. This tower mode is broken down into two different areas. The first Ascending the tower has you playing matches against the CPU in harder and harder matches and you can save and rest at the end of every level. Descending now has you doing a similar trial but you can not save after each level, since it more like endurance encounters.- Earn in-game money (like in Tower mode and playing ranked online matches) to unlock tons and tons of stuff from new fighters to new costume items for your custom character, or art work and videos.- A new finished system makes it so if you get enough powerful hits on your opponent with our being interrupted you can now do a splashy finisher type move to them, wining the match.GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Soul Calibur 3- Tekken 6- Samurai ShowdownADDITIONAL NOTES:- The Premium edition comes with the game, a download code for more exclusive costume items, a real world t-shirt (with Yoda on it), a mini comic, art book and it all comes in a metal case for save keeping.- There are a few download packs for this game in terms of new costume pieces and weapons, but be careful some downloads for this game are nothing more then unlocks for content already found within the game. There is also a download the add music from the first Soul Calibur game from Dreamcast.- There are two Star Wars characters in Soul Calibur 4, Yoda the little green Jedi master from the movies and The Apprentice from the game Star Wars: Force Unleashed. These new Star Wars characters can use Force abilities (limited use energy use but they can recharge).

At least they were if you liked 2-D platform games, andYoshi&#x92;s Islandis indisputably one of the best ever made.Yoshi&#x92;s Islandgoes back in time to recount the touching story of the various Yoshis' attempts to unite Baby Mario with his parents. You don&#x92;t actually control the Italian plumber-to-be but instead his dinosaur pal, who has the curious ability to eat his enemies and then immediately turn them into eggs, which he can then fling at more enemies.Since Yoshi isn&#x92;t particularly fast and can float in midair for a few seconds after making a jump, the whole dynamics of the normal Mario gameplay have changed, but the same incredible attention to detail and endless imagination that mark all of Nintendo&#x92;s best efforts are still here in full effect. In fact they&#x92;re joined this time, after the rather plain-looking prequel, by some wonderful pastel-shaded graphics that were jaw-dropping when the game was originally released in 1995 and still manage to impress now.As with the otherSuper Mario Advancetitles, this game also contains a four-player version of the originalMario Bros.arcade game, making it even more of a bargain than it already was.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Alex \"47\"","summary":"Z","reviewText":"What a great game.

Now she must face the Space Pirates once again in an all-new adventure.","reviewerName":"\"duobpm\"","summary":"One Word: Awesome","reviewText":"Metroid Prime, which was part of Nintendo's Big 4, along with Super Mario Sunshine, Star Fox Adventures, and Zelda: Wind Waker, was one of the most anticipated games of the year.  Everyone knew that Samus was going first person, and wanted to see what the outcome will be.  Well, the title says it all basically, as this game is definetly one of the best on the Gamecube.  Why is it the best game on the Gamecube?  Well, let me dwelve into the game a bit.The graphics are far and away incredible.  Never before have I seen a game take advantage of the Gamecube's full graphical processing.  From the rain falling and running down your visor, to the blizzards and lava pools, the game's different intriguing environments are just great to look at.  Samus looks even better, her suit is incredibly detailed and makes you wish you could see her in 3rd person all the time.  The framerate has some issues at times in certain places, but that is easily ignorable.The audio section of the game is probably the low point, but it is excusable.  While there really isn't too much music to speak of except the occasional theme song when Samus gets out of the save pod, the game's sound effects is what makes this area shine.  The firing of the different types of weapons, wiping out an enemy, and the chilling scream when Samus is defeated, all add to the depth and emotion of the game.  Samus doesn't speak too much herself, but why would she, seeing as how she is the only human on the planet.Gameplay is where this game tops practically any other game in the action genre today. Basically you go through level to level completing objectives and trying to get a higher % on the game completed chart.  To raise your % you will need to collect data on environments and enemies, find power up suits, and locate different weapon add ons, among other things.  The only gripe some people have had is that you must backtrack in levels a lot.  While that is true, each level contains so much to do and so many secrets this will be easily ignorable.  Samus also has a variety of cool abilities, such as the morph ball where you can see Samus as a ball in 3rd person, to help get into small spaces.  Did I mention the boss battles rock too?  I could go on and on about the gameplay but I'm trying to keep it short here.To wrap it all up Metroid Prime is my favorite of all the metroids and I am really glad Nintendo took this approach.  Don't listen to the people on this site that said the game sucked, because it doesn't.  They are just mad they either don't have the game, or can't get past the first level.  Oh the ignorance...anyway pick this one up if you have a Gamecube or are just looking for one of the greatest action games out there.  Have Fun!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2003"}

I was using this game to cover my Diablo playing needs while waiting for Diablo 3 WITHOUT having to play Diablo 2. I'll get straight to the pros and cons and I'll give you gamer tips as well.PROS:1. Pretty decent graphics! I'm guessing Diablo 3 will have these quality graphics or a tad higher. It is created by ex-bliz folks.2. It has a very familiar Diablo feel to it that I like quite a bit.3. Pretty fun, good for a few dozen hours.4. The map has height variety that effects the way you fight. Example would be firing a gun or shooting a spell at something that is at the top of a ramp. Your shot may miss due to your shots not reaching high enough. Having leverage over enemies below you.5. Three fun classes to mess with. Alchemist, the best mage that can summon, Destroyer class is the equivalent to the melee specialized barbarian class like it is in Diablo 2, and the Vanquisher, specializing in range and traps. However, what's nice is that every character has different enough skills so that if you don't want to do a typical build, for example Destroyer that concentrates on hand to hand combat, you can use him to summon as well etc.6. Including a load full of mods to spoof up the game (beware that overuse of mods can ruin your game very easily).7. Different difficulty levels. Easy, normal, hard, very hard, and hardcore. Changeable by console command, instructions available if you search up cheats. Thoughts on this on the section after CONS.Overall, I'm impressed and am thinking of the MMO version of Torchlight....Torchlight 2.CONS:1. Small game with no expansions at the time this review is being written and published. Expect to beat the main game in about 20-30 hours per character, give or take of course. That's a leisure estimation. However, there is a post-game area, but usually by the time I get to it I'm bored with the character I've used so I haven't really gotten far into it. It's mainly there to test how far in you can go.2. Biggest con is that there's no multiplayer version yet, but the game is nowhere big enough to make it worth the multi-player experience just yet. Too short.3. Once you've used one character, you sort of used them all. At least it feels like that with me. Again, this game has no expansion and therefore it is still too short and small.4. No especially awesome moves or abilities, meaning after awhile of playing, you get tired of using the moves. This holds true with people that play these kind of games. The moves get a little dull and you end up wandering what's next.5. Due to the game being small, you'll also get a handful of enemies. The maps are also commonly reused, sometimes making you go backwards over the same map. You can definitely see this if you buy map scrolls.6. Combining gems/socketable items is a daunting task because there are so many different grades and you have such a small stash to work with as well. Also, when you choose to remove the gems, you lose the item, or if you just want the item and the gem gone, you lose the gems....no way in the middle.7. So many mods are there because the game is still very flawed.Overall:- You beat the main dungeon at around level 35-40~.- Your maximum skill level per skill is 10, but a few skills can still receive bonuses through items that add skills and can go up to 11-12. You can use a mod to boost it to 30, but I wouldn't do so until the post-game.- Each of the three main characters can pretty much specialize in pretty much everything; summoning, casting, melee. Of course, some character have better overall skills then others. It gives you a challenge.Advice and Gamer Help:1. If you choose to use the console, you can change your difficulty levels between easy through very hard without receiving the CHEATER penalty. I heard if you go from hardcore and revert to lower difficulties during mid game, you get penalized. You also become a cheater if you use the console to receive anything like items so don't use it. Once a character becomes a cheater, it is singled out from all your other characters in that it no longer has the shared stash available, meaning all the items on that character cannot be shared with any other characters.2. If you want hand to hand combat, for easy to hard, you can do 3+ strength and 2+ defense per round, very hard you might consider adding 3+def, 2+strength. Magic and dex only needed for equipment use aka ignore when you can. For range, concentrate on dex. Same thing as the melee hand to hand combat build right above, but instead of strength, you go for dex since dex is the range damage modifier. For magic casters, you concentrate instead of dex or strength, you go for magic, same build concept.3. Some typical, but very effective skill builds:A) Destroyer: Max--> Martial weapon mastery, critical hit, armor mastery, devastate, dual wield, frost shield. One and I mean ONE point in slash, it's all you'll need, but you can do whatever... Critical hit is awesome, it gives you so much damage and lands quite often, especially when you have weapons that add to the percentage. Cool thing about dual wield is that per each hit, the bonuses of both items are applied. For example your right hand sword gives you 5 leech and the right gives you another 5, you get 10 leech per hit. You do NOT leech when you use special attacks or cast spells and you can't leech through your minions. Devastate is the ultimate attack and slash will be your right mouse clickers main attack.B) Summoner Alchemist: Max--> Imp, Both Golems, Burning Bind ASAP (it's godly and makes your minions A LOT better), armor mastery, and whatever else you might think of. Put one point into thorn minion and start pouring more when you have a good amount of points in the other more important skills like burning bind. Give your pet a summoning Spells like skeleton archers. You should also buy the latest skeleton archers spells. TAKE NOTE! Spells are those that you have to learn by buying them or finding them and they come in different levels. Charm increases summoning spell levels, offensive mastery increase offensive spell levels, defensive mastery increases offensive spell levels. SKILLS on the other hand, are things that you get by adding skill points into. So there is a differences between spells and skills. If you go in game, you'll notice stuff like Heal I and heal II and so on. Take note that as you put points into mastery like offensive or defensive mastery, the level in those skills will increase. However, a level 10 Heal 1 will NEVER be as good as a level 2. So always get the higher skills when you can.C) Caster: Max--> Ember Bolt, Ember Lance, Critical Hit and Pyre and Ember Strike. All skills, but Pyre I believe, get bonuses from the weapons that you wield. Ember bolt receives bonuses from items that give poison bonuses while lance, and strike receives bonuses to fire. I'm not super knowledgeable yet so please continue the research, I've only played for two weeks or so. The rest of the other skills you can go into armor mastery, etc.D)Vanquisher range build. Max--> Dual wield, ricochet, explosive shot, range expertise, armor mastery, critical hit and then try some points into adventurer just because of the experience bonuses. Ricochet will be your main skill, but explosive shot will be your best skill.4. I highly suggest hard to very hard, IMO for those that have played these kinds of games, only hard and very hard will give you enough challenge to make this game worthwhile. This game has been known to be called too easy. You can easily over level and make this game a cake walk by buying portal scrolls through the female merc in town so use it but watch out, it can make the main dungeon a bit too easy.5. Good skills for pets are: Heal All, Summoning (if you have points in charm, their summoning skills for that summon also increase). Web is also useful.6. Heal your pet by going into your inventory and taking a potion and throwing it onto your pet icon at the top left.Well, have fun with the game! Remember, you can build these characters HOWEVER way you want, these are just things I've gathered along the way and am sharing back.I might play the MMO for this if they add lots more gaming to it and more characters etc. Check out the mods too, but remember to beware and keep yourself in check or you'll kill the game really fast.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2010"}

Daneker","summary":"Another \"Fable\" falls short.","reviewText":"When you first start Fable 3 you immediately feel as if 2 never ended. That's where the good things end. Each Fable game starts off really strong, story-line, weapons, questing, it's all great except it all deteriorates into banality and monotonous repetition. Like the previous Fable's, 3 has an annoying and eventually boring interaction mode that prevents you from talking to people and instead demotes you to village idiot, you have a handful of actions like dancing or clucking like a chicken that you can use to interact and try to get people to like you. Unlike 2 where you had to figure out what worked on what people in 3 pretty much any positive will work and most negatives will not. The game starts with your character as the sibling of the king who is the child of your character in Fable 2 (shame there's no import option to truly give you history) and you have to overthrow him, stop the darkness and then build a kingdom. Sounds like a big game, it's not. In all it can be done in 20hrs or less, not even close to a Zelda or Final Fantasy. But, that's not the downer, the disappointment is the ease and simplicity with which you goals are accomplish.So, you set out on your quest, win the hearts of the people while becoming a hero. First of all, interact, so go to EVERYONE and do something positive and get a guild-seal (These will allow you to advance, you spend them to earn skills) and if positive doesn't work hold them to your ass and fart on them, then move to the next person. When you \"talk\" to most people long enough at a some point in the game they'll give you a courier quest, there are so many of these, I think fifty or a hundred as I've barely found anyone that doesn't give one after six to ten interactions. These are boring as hell, track down a book, pass on a letter, lead someone to somewhere and complete the quest. There's some good/evil options here like dragging children into a factory for slave labor, but for the most part, not much.I didn't even care about the quest, mostly it was just walking, killing things as you go and moving on. After certain quest you move forward on the \"road to rule\" where you spend your guild seals to level up, learn new expressions and buy colors to dye yourself. At almost no point did this game ask me to think, just walk and interact, kill and walk. You don't have a menu, just a series of rooms and a butler where you change cloths, weapons, etc. You approach the map, look for quest, warp there, complete, repeat. This is easily the easiest of the three Fables, the simplest and the least satisfying.Fable three was supposed to be a three part game, each is incomplete. First the quest, overthrow your brother and become king. Next, the darkness approaches. Set tax-rates, decide on spending or cutting spending like keep a shelter at a cost or convert to a brothel to raise capitol, drain a lake for mining or spend money to preserve it for the rich-folk that live on it's shores. This doesn't last long enough nor is the system beyond a kindergarten level to master. Once the darkness comes you fight, defeat and then spend endless hours on meaningless side-quest. Nothing like 20 hours of chicken races and taking letters from one person to another, but this is the way you complete the game, to truly complete it, if there is a true ending, I've not completed all the menial task.Over-all the graphics are good with some frame-rate drops, sound is better with less of the same voices/phrases constantly in the background as the other two games. The fighting system is much improved with a \"devil may cry\" quick-switch between weapons and magic, but magic has to be charged to be worth anything and there's little in the way to improve it. The quest are short, simple march in a line with only finding keys and side-quest offering any challenge but little reward. The game is painfully short, what could have been a grand-quest mixed with the complexities of taxes and social programs, raising an army and growing a nation becomes little more than a sketch-pad for these ideas.In Fable III Lionhead reaches further, promises more and delivers less than any other Fable. Some of the preview stuff they showed for two years was near mind-blowing cool -- none of it's in the game. It's so simple and tedious that it really feels not like an action-rpg but like a simple child's game with adult themes. Once again, lots of sex of-screen (why rate it \"Mature\" if sex is going to be PG and violence / gore barely exist???)Over-all a fun game used for $20 in six months, but too simple and unsatisfying for a new game at $60. No doubt a $100 in add-on packs will quickly emerge with quest that should have been on the disk to begin with. Let's hope a new team takes over for Fable IV, sees the short-falls of the first three and finally gives us what has been promised for years.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2010"}
{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Daneker","summary":"Action and story but where's the exploration","reviewText":"Uncharted 3 easily takes the best of story-telling, animation and graphics that set the first two apart while correcting most of the little issues at the same time. The graphics are more varied and the color pallet is deep and rich, the sound is spot on and the voice acting pitch perfect. Now that Drake's a full-fledged franchise game and a flagship title for Playstation the story is deeper and better fleshed out without being just an explanation for the action. The bad guys are more than shallow evil menaces and the overall scope is on par with any big-money action film.There are some negatives here though. Nathans movement feels stiff, he didn't seem to turn well and when he walks he looks like his back is bothering him. At the same time, Sully, who needed Nathan to open an easy walking path for him in the first two games is suddenly much spry and though you don't see him, he must be performing much of the same acrobatics as Drake to keep up. Also Sully moves from side-kick to father figure, we see sully pull young Nathan off the streets and mentor him in flashbacks, and in present time we see him more assertive and certain than in the previous games.The one other issue is the sudden onslaught of enemies. There are a few points in the game that have Drake dying over and over and over as he is swarmed from all sides, something I expect at every moment in Halo but here it seems a bit much. The mercenaries have a large, unending army of clones that seem to attack perpetually at times and shooting them can feel like a game of wak-a-mole. Less enemies, more strategy would serve the game better.The last issue is exploration. There's more vast, excellent locations to explore, except mostly you run through them. I only got about 30% of the artifacts on my first run because the game just isn't geared towards exploration. More options for explorations and more tangible rewards could have added hours to the game play. Given the style of game, trying to work it like a FPS just isn't the best approach.Like the first two, this is a fun game, looks good, sounds good and is highly addicting, but the payoff comes too fast and the treasure hunter aspect is once again left behind for long, drawn out firefights with the clone-army. A good game, just misses being great but a must-play regardless.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000A76ZNO","reviewerName":"NeuroSplicer","summary":"THE ABSOLUTE ACTION cRPG!","reviewText":"If you haven't yet played this game, well, you don't know what you are missing...FABLE-THE LOST CHAPTERS is a game so full of great ideas that later games could not stop imitating (and isn't imitation the best form of compliment?). After being an X-BOX title for too long, it eventually got released for PCs.The game is a Third-Person cRPG starting with your character as a little boy made witness to his village burning and his family getting murdered. The orphan then gets schooled in a military academy (one of the most subtle and best designed tutorials EVER!) and graduates to face his first quest. From then on, this beautiful non-linear and multileveled game never lets you without a fresh surprise!Sure, there is hacking and slashing and sharpshooting to our hearts content; however, this cRPG's ambitions do not expire there. Your character will grow, acquire scars and marks, get haircuts and tattoos - whereas his body shape and height will depend on his habits, training and alignment. You can buy a house, impress the ladies and even get married. There are also a number of mini-games within FABLE, from gambling to fishing and prize-duels.The graphics are beautiful (a bit dated today yet still much better than most systems can handle). Facial expressions and body movements are fluid and natural, whereas, grass, flowers and tree branches move to the wind and in your path. There is a weather system and night-and-day alterations. In FABLE you will see the best sunrise and the most rich sunset sky colors EVER! When a scenery moves you enough you can even take a...in game picture that can be viewed later (they are saved in a special folder in MY DOCUMENTS). I am telling you, Peter Molyneux left nothing to chance! Whatever could be turned on its head, well, it was...The gameplay is plain brilliant! The controls are intuitive and the lower-edge-of-the-screen shortcuts could not be more user-friendly. Looting is usual and merchants are abundant. Weapons and armor are well designed (nothing like the childish ones in...NWN) and special unique sets (rarely) available.I have completed this game at least three times (the last one was this summer) - and I have enjoyed all of them immensely! Now that the price has dropped, it's even a bargain!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2007"}

I'm guessing that many of you are thinking that I think the game is only great for a special breed, but its not. If you are a gamer, you will enjoy the game probably. If you are not, try something else. The game requires your time, but it is a better way to spend your time than other games.The game basically has you lead a second life. There isn't THAT much to do, even though people say there is. After you get the game you will understand what I mean. Fishing, Digging, Catching Bugs, Making Designs, and Desiging a house. There are other things, but they aren't as important.I think the game has a few problems, some are not bad, some are slightly bad. The A.I does not really know you. They know you by name, sure, but they never really want to do anything except give you jobs, or tell you something that you don't care about. Then there is the time spent chatting. It is alright, but once you take trips regularly to another town,(which you can do if you have 2 memory cards) you will basically have to talk to rover every time. You can't just pick up the pace. Then there is the dude at the library, he will not shut up. Aside from that, the game lets you try out tons of differnet items to customize your house and what not.The bigger problems now.... Clothes, wallpapers, carpets, and umbrellas are not needed at all. It is a joke to even buy them. You can just set up a design and pay nothing, bam there is your wallpaper. Just spread it out, and you have your stuff, no buying necessary. This means that whenever people give you these things, you can just sell them because they are useless. The other big one is the letter system. Why? Typing. I HATE typing with a controller, and I don't think there is a keyboard for the gamecube. You can cheat so easily by sending like 50 different ai's a letter with nothing but the letter &quot;C' or &quot;f&quot; and they will usually write you back a long reply and give you something. It is so easy to con people in this game that is somewhat boring.Good things? giving letters and things to your brother or sister if you are on the same town or travel to each others towns. A massive music, item, and item-code thing lets you listen to music and of course trade items on the internet without the internet. Also nintendo games. I got 2 at the start. This excite bike game which is fun, and donkey kong which is kinda fun, but is old now and hard.Sure, the game has somewhat alot. I would reccomend this game to anyone who has a brother and sister willing to play. It works on real time, so fighting over who gets to play in the day may be a problem. Have fun though, its fun, and its a good game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2003"}

When the PC version was released I picked it up right away as the PC is my preferred gaming platform. After all these years I'm still blown away with everything they crammed into this game. There are very few games that have the longevity of this one. Yes the graphics are a little outdated by today's standards, but for me fun is more important than graphics any day. This is a game you can feverishly play day in and day out then put it away for a few months and come back to it only to discover new things. I can safely say I've seen every pixel III and Vice City have to offer but with San Andreas there's always a nagging doubt that I haven't seen it all. Months will go by without playing it then  I'll take it out for a spin yet again and discover some Indian ruins in the desert, a parked vehicle that triggers a race, A funny poster in a tavern, ANYTHING! IV will never find a home on my hard drive unless they remove all the crapware that comes with it so for now and for always (probably) San Andreas is the ultimate GTA experience for me.

{"product_name":"B001D7T2VC","reviewerName":"Franz Escobar \"franzescobar\"","summary":"Darksiders is Worth Every Penny!","reviewText":"I just finished this game last night, and I can honestly say that it is one of the best games I've played in the past year. You can tell the developers really put time into making a really special game. Here's my review:StoryListen, I'm not much of a fan of storylines in videogames, but having said that, I do recognize when a game has a great storyline (Drake's Fortune) and a terrible one (Resident Evil 5). The story of Darksiders is forgettable and confusing. I found myself skipping most cut scenes. This is easily the weakest part of the game.GameplayThis is where Darksiders shines. The gameplay is really, really fun. As people have mentioned it is a combination of God of War and Zelda, but in no way is it a copy of these games. It's definitely it's own, unique game for sure.You get plenty of weapons and magic, and upgrades to both throughout the adventure, which by the way, will take you 20-25 hours to complete. As the game progresses the puzzles become much more difficult and new things are added, such as the glaive and portal gun. Simply put, this game has a terrific balance of combat, platforming and puzzle solving. I found myself looking forward to playing it every day and making progress.GraphicsThe graphics are great, a little on the cartoon-ie side, but still very sharp. Combos look and feel great and the level design is really unique. As I mentioned earlier, the developers really did a great job creating this open world.EnjoymentI enjoyed this game a lot. If you are into games like God of War and Zelda, this is a perfect fit for you. My only complaint is the puzzles become too difficult the last 3rd of the game, kind of ruining the great pace by having to stop and look at walkthroughs to figure out what you're doing. Small complaint...bottom line...this game is 100% worth a purchase. It is a game that I will not soon forget and really was a great experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"D. Ross \"Lil' Ross\"","summary":"Wow...Next Gen has arrived.","reviewText":"I was fortunate enough to receive a system that, so far, has not bricked or given me any problems outside of PSN being down for maintenance.  I will give my experience with the console so far.First of all, the system is a lot smaller and lighter than i expected.  I would expect a system this size in a PS4 \"slim\" edition with the way things have been going with Sony.  You know what I mean...original console launches in a \"fat\" version, then we get a slim model, then a super slim.  I'm guessing this may happen again, but I'm not sure how much smaller they could make this thing without killing it's nice looking design.  In the box you get an HDMI cable, controller, and a flimsy little microphone that is pretty sad.  It's staticy and is basically an earpiece and some little box that you can't even tell is a mic. Aw well...better than nothing right?  Also you get some nice little starter deals from Sony.  A 30 day PS Plus membership, a 10 buck voucher for the PS Store, and a free trial of Music Unlimited.IF YOU ARE DOING CROSS BUY PLEASE TAKE NOTE OF THE 10 BUCK VOUCHER!  I PAID FOR MY CALL OF DUTY GHOSTS UPDATE FROM PS3 TO PS4 AND COULD KICK MYSELF FOR NOT NOTICING THE VOUCHER FIRST!As far as user experience, the system is fast but the UI is pretty bland at this point.  There's not much there.  There's not much in the PS Store.  You can't do anything besides gaming and watching videos at this time.  You can't really customize the interface at all.  There is no wallpaper mode.  I can't help but feel these features will be patched in later.YOUTUBERS- YOU CANNOT RECORD VIDEO USING HDMI AT THIS TIME.  I DO YOUTUBE VIDEOS AND WAS HOPING THAT THE REPORTS WOULD BE WRONG BUT I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET MY ELGATO TO WORK.  THERE IS SUPPOSED TO BE A PATCH AT A LATER DATE TO ALLOW CAPTURE CARDS TO WORK BUT IT MAY HAVE STRINGS ATTACHED.I have played Resogun and Warframe-both are free to play games although I think Resogun is only free with PS Plus membership.  They are pretty good for free games.  Resogun is a classic arcade space shooter that looks and sounds great.  Warframe looks very good and is a good romp with 3 other random players or buddes.  So far its gameplay isn't too in depth.  It's a \"get from point A to B\" shooter.  I only passed the first stage, though.The games take up quite a bit of space on the hard drive.  The digital version of Call of Duty took up 31 gigs alone.  I would suggest upgrading right from the start if you plan to do a lot of digital downloading.Social media is integrated heavily.  Facebook and Twitter options are available.  Also Twitch and UStream are integrated for sharing videos.  There are already lots of videos in those sections to check out other gamers and their experiences with the system.  You can show your real name and Facebook account profile picture IF YOU CHOOSE.  It can be public, private, or friends list only.  There are lots of customization options when it comes to how much you want to share online.  Parental controls are here as well to stop the kiddies from logging in when you don't want them to or getting into those online lobbies full of cursing \"gangstaz\".For 399 dollars, I couldn't be happier with what I've purchased here.  I feel this is truly next gen gaming and I've only played a few launch games.  Killzone makes me pause and marvel at the level of detail and lighting effects.  And the scary thing is it is only a launch title.  Games have all been in full 1080p.  There has been no \"up-converting\".  I can really tell the difference.  The frame rates have all been 60 fps.  Whereas the PS3 was console that hit right in a transition period, where no one knew where gaming was going as far as high def and networking, this is a fully-realized true next-gen console that takes full advantage of high def televisions and pushes out graphics in eye-popping detail.The only con for me, and I'm in the minority, is that I truly loved the classic DualShock controllers.  I thought they were perfect.  Well, the triggers on the DualShock 3 did suck, but if they had simply put the DS4 triggers on the new controller and kept the exact same design otherwise, that would have been great in my opinion.  I'm sure I'll adjust but it will definitely be missed.  I even like the old analog stick shape better than this new indented style.  Remember, this is personal preference...the controller is GREAT and very comfortable.I can't wait to see what future games do with the hardware.  Maybe it's because I've been gaming since the NES era, but I have been nothing but impressed with the visuals I've seen out of these launch titles.  I've seen a lot of bashing going on...mostly from PC gamers and people who I must assume have not seen the system in action.  A lot of these early reviews probably have tons of trolls hanging around leaving fake comments and low ratings just because they happen to be XBox fans or PC fans or just plain internet trolls.  I truly feel we are in for some amazing experiences this generation and that Sony has learned a lot from the mistakes last gen.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2013"}

You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or braving it solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death.

Everything in this game, from the combat to the environments, is simply amazing.  There are a variety of weapons to choose from that offer unique advantages so you can be strong in offense, defense, speed, range or a combination of the four.  The upgrade system for weapons and armor is excellent.  You can change your appearance to your liking with different types of armor, weapons look cool, and there are tons of different upgrades to purchase.  Hunting for materials is one of the biggest parts of the game.  Maybe the next quest you want to go on is extremely difficult.  Just go hunt for some materials to upgrade your weapon to something better.  That can make all the difference in making your next monster a defeatable foe.The monsters come to life and are extremely believable, which is a very important aspect of this game.  Big or small, the creatures that inhabit this world are appropriately varied, interesting, and feel natural.  The battles against the larger monsters are truly epic, leaving you with a huge sense of accomplishment when you actually emerge victorious.  And the larger enemies have an impressive repertoire of ways to turn you into monster food.  No battles in any video game have ever given me this much pleasure or satisfaction.  Fighting Barroths and Rathians online with friends is beyond amazing.Also important to this game genre (action RPG) is that battles actually require strategy.  Not only does your choice of weapon affect your tactics, but each enemy requires a completely different approach.  This keeps the battles fresh and interesting even after fighting the same monsters numerous times.The graphics and music are excellent as well.  Epic music with gorgeous scenery is a great combination, and when you combine that with monsters galore it just doesn't get any better.  Get ready to pull out some big weapons and go for a hunt.  4 player online is very enjoyable, but playing alone is just as satisfying (at least for me).  No matter how serious you want to get with this game, you will find it to be a truly remarkable experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2010"}

I would love to see RAGE 2! Also from the graphic novel I was expecting another playable character or at least some choice.The dlc's are worth the money, except for wasteland sewers missions, which was too short and too boring.Another downside for the game is the unexpected, kind of quick ending. You are able to roam free in the game once you've completed everything, but then, some characters are gone and authority enforcers are still where they were ,once you choose to start the final mission. It makes no sense. The game feels incomplete just because of that. It's like everything that I've done changed little to nothing. It's okay if there will be a sequel, but without it, it is incomplete. Else, it's a great game that gives away a very special atmosphere and I am happy to have it.

{"product_name":"B00H5V9S6E","description":"","reviewerName":"Sreenadh","summary":"A Great Game (Detailed Review)","reviewText":"This review is from: Rayman Legends - PlayStation 4 Standard Edition (Video Game)With Rayman Origins setting a new standard for everyone's favourite French hero, and rubbing shoulders with the leaders in the platforming genre, Michel Ancel's long overdue sequel has a lot to live up to. Fortunately, Rayman Legends is a tremendously fun and brilliantly designed title that is the very definition of a must-have for fans of the hop-heavy genre.The release takes Origins' fundamentals and polishes them to within an inch of their life. The controls are as tight as ever, allowing you to run, jump, swim, swing, and glide through the environments so smoothly that it's as if you're not really controlling your character at all, but working on instinct and manipulating the action with your mind. Levels are so meticulously detailed that you'll be blown be away by their delicious visuals, charmed by their impediments, and delighted once you master their unique challenges. And through all of these emotions, a stunning score will add peaks to your enjoyment, driving your adrenaline through difficult stages, and calming your blood pressure as you explore. This is a game that masterfully links each individual part of its makeup into an exquisite whole, culminating in a true sensory treat.While its predecessor was fairly narrative-driven, Legends puts much of its focus on content. Rayman and his friends are awoken a century after the events of Origins to find the Teensies &#8211; peculiar wizard fellows &#8211; have been captured by Dark Teensies, and the Glade of Dreams has been overrun with demons and monstrosities. It's up to the limbless hero and his friends to save the land and retrieve the mythical creatures. Of course, this rescue mission provides loose context for a slew of different environmental themes, spanning castles, lush jungles, dank swamps, and more. You even get to explore under the sea, and the fiery horrors of a nightmarish kitchen. There's an unbelievable amount of variety &#8211; with many of the best levels from Ubisoft Montpellier's previous adventure revisited for good measure.It's not just a question of visual variety either. While precision platforming is certainly the order of the day &#8211; demanding impeccable timing and focus &#8211; it's augmented with stealth sections, boss battles, and more. The sheer number of ideas on display prevents the action from ever outstaying its welcome, with even minor minigames such as Kung Foot &#8211; a competitive multiplayer mode where two teams battle it out trying to score goals by jumping and attacking the ball &#8211; bringing hours of entertainment. However, it's the music levels that truly take the crown. Featuring a Rayman remix of a classic song, these stages push you to the right while a backing track plays, with your jumps, attacks, and general interactions overlaying accompanying melodies. It literally results in a symphony that's written in gameplay, which is perhaps the biggest compliment that you could possibly pay such an imaginative set of levels.While you'll need focus to beat the main campaign, adding three other players to the action via drop-in/drop-out co-op brings a chaotic dynamic to the affair. Multiplayer is a barrel of laughs and negates the challenge a touch, with death resulting in your character blowing up like balloon, waiting to be tagged back into play with a slap from one of your team mates. However, it can get confusing with so many players on screen, and detracts ever so slightly from the pure presentational treat that you'll derive from the single player mode. It's not bad, it's just different &#8211; and it's a testament to the quality of the title's design that it manages to appeal in both options. I enjoyed exploring the levels alone first, and then returning with friends to gobble up Lums, where standing on each others' shoulders makes it easier to reach those high hanging goodies.Adding buddies to the mix is also useful for handling the duties of Murphy, a floating frog-type fellow who aids you occassionally in levels by interacting with the environment. In single player, once Murphy appears, he'll automatically fly over to the next object that he can interact with, including platforms, enemies, and ropes. This mechanic is a remnant from the game's original Nintendo Wii U exclusive days, where the Gamepad's touch screen is used to navigate the amphibian, while the computer takes control of Rayman. Here on the PS3, the automated solution works fairly well. You don't have the accuracy that you would with the Gamepad, but you don't lose control of the main character. However, it doesn't always flow; the pace of the game can reach such speeds that using Murphy is unwieldy. Fortunately, another player can take control of the sidekick in multiplayer, allowing everyone else to concentrate on surviving the stage.With six worlds, oodles of collectibles, co-op, re-mastered stages, and more, Rayman Legends is absolutely bursting with content. It can feel a little overwhelming at first, but once you start freeing Teensies and opening up the game, it's hard not to want to sample everything. Each individual level is packed with its own challenges, including grabbing the aforementioned Lums. These happy-go-lucky organisms unlock scratch cards &#8211; another leftover from the Wii U release &#8211; that you rub away at with the analogue sticks to unlock even more content, including the previously touched upon Rayman Origins stages, as well as creatures which generate more Lums for you to collect.Finally, there are daily and weekly online challenges, which task you to promptly gather up Lums, dash through a level, or survive for as long as possible while something deadly gives chase. Your score is uploaded to the leaderboards, and you're rewarded with tiered trinkets and Lums depending on how well you performed compared to the rest of the community. It can be a little frustrating watching your gold trophy decline as others compete and the score thresholds for the awards adapt, but it's a compelling mode that will pull you in for multiple runs as you attempt to better your score.ConclusionRayman Legends winds up with a fistful of content and scores a knock-out blow with its impressive visuals, infectious audio, and exceptional controls. Some of the Wii U features may struggle to translate, but this game still more than lives up to its name, and is destined for a place among the platforming elite. Chaotic with friends and addictive alone, this will leave you intoxicated by its charm, and with so much to do, it won't outstay its welcome anytime soon.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2014"}

{"product_name":"B001C6GVI6","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Back for more","reviewText":"Well here we go again...Persona 4 is basically a polished up retread of Persona 3. If you enjoyed that game and want more of the same, here it is...if you want something new, well, ummm, this is not the game for you.Persona 4 sees a transfer student (you) join his class at the local high school. Here he makes new friends and accidently discovers a hidden world where monsters roam...which of course has to be explored! First up, let me tell you that the social-sim aspects of this game are virtually identical to P3. You go to school everyday, have exams, make friends, spend after school time getting to know people better, do homework and visit the shops. I was actually quite annoyed at the way this game simply re-cycled all the same features as it's predecessor with regard to school life. So make sure you are prepared for another whole year of studying, making your friends feel happy, and sitting in noodle bars. However a lot of other stuff has changed.What is great here is the new storyline. Gone is the tower of Tartarus and the full moon monsters. Here, we have a mystery TV channel that only appears at midnight when it's raining...if you switch on and see a person on the screen, it means that person is destined to die...spooky! So the chapters of the game involve trying to save a person each time they appear on the TV channel, which means you have to \"enter\" the TV world and find them. And yes, that does mean that you dive in through the screen! Once inside the screen, you need to enter a dungeon which is cleverly built around the missing person's particular fears or repressed desires (there's a lot of things driven by the subconscious in this game). To my surprise and enjoyment, this includes a strip joint and a gay sauna! Rather adventurous for a social sim RPG! And in a rather boffo idea, each boss is a twisted version of the missing person's anti-persona. At the start of the game the missing people are destined to become your team mates in battle, so each twisted boss you fight becomes the \"persona\" that the rescued person goes on to use in battle later.As in P3, the battles in this game are great fun. Characters have to summon a persona to cast spells (although the shooting in the head part has been dropped!), and they all have specific weaknesses or strengths. As before, your character can summon from a choice of several personas, and these are a mixture of the classic monsters from the series, plus a few new ones (I think they saved a few that weren't in P3 for this game). Improvements and changes are as follows: You can now directly control all four players - hooray! And now the knock down status only causes a missed turn if it is followed by another kick to the weakness - good idea, as in P3, a hit to a downed character made them stand up again, which made little sense to me. As characters level up and your social links with them imporve, there are some nice touches - characters with strong social links will rush in front of the main character (you) and take a heavy blow, or do funny things like slap people out of the confused status, or help downed team mates stand up, etc. I will say this though - the game on the whole seemed a lot easier than P3, and it also had less variety. Remember the Tartarus tower was not the only place you had to fight in P3 - there were also the full moon bosses? Well, the TV channel is the only place anything happens in this games and it seemed a lot shorter. Another plus point for me - you can now be friends with more than one girl rather than just picking one as a romantic interest and discarding all the others - which I found rather mean in P3!Back on the plus side, the story is great this time. The mystery behind the spooky channel and why people keep cropping up there really kept me hooked. This time, your timescale for the plan of attack is governed by the weather rather than the cycles of the moon, which was a refreshing change. There were also some really good plot twists that kept me guessing. The people you befriend are also very well rounded - all have distinct personalities and great voice acting - although the voice of Chie got rather irritating for me during battles. Sadly the levelling up process has been changed - as you get stronger the points gained for winning fights begins to shrink, so levelling up in the final dungeon eventually became pointless as I was only getting a few hundred per battle once I got in the 70s-80s - very annoying if you are a grinder like me! The final boss was still challenging, but there was no bonus dungeon at all - although I did play the FES version of P3, so I had been spoiled!So my bottom line is that P4 is a great addition to the series, but as P3 was so clever I felt that this sequel was doing a bit too much re-hashing and not offering enough new ideas. I still spent weeks playing it though, so it's a good solid game that will give you many hours of distraction.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2009"}

A brave New World is rising--a hostile yet beautiful world, filled with innovative gameplay, new strategic scenarios, eye-searing graphics and much more. Welcome to a world calledAge of Empires III.CampaignIn this action adventure tale of historical fiction, players take on the role of Morgan Black and his family, struggling against the hostile wilderness and a mysterious cult that's crept in from Europe.In a series of 24 scenarios divided into three acts, Morgan Black and his descendants help the Aztecs resist conquest by Spanish conquistadors, pit the French against the British in the French and Indian War and help Simon Bolivar lead revolutions in South America.MultiplayerWhether you're searching for a quick game or hoping to talk strategy with friends online,Age of Empires III's Multiplayer site is your community destination.Here, you can play with persistent Home Cities that gain power and strategic options the more games you play, compete for a spot on dozens of ladders, help organize your clan or chat after a game -- all without leaving the multiplayer portal.Fans ofAge of Mythology's Quick Search can still look for games swiftly, while players looking for something specific can browse game lists to find the set of options that matches their tastes.New Feature--Home CitiesThis revolutionary new feature to the RTS landscape is incorporated into all aspects ofAge of Empires III-- from Campaign to Multiplayer -- and is unlike anything you've experienced before.Much like the persistent character from a role-playing game that encourages you to keep playing, your Home City is an important support system to your efforts in the New World. During a game, your Home City can regularly send you supplies or military reinforcements.You are the leader of your colony, but your success brings glory back to Mother Europe. The more games you play, and the better you do, the more powerful your Home City will become. Every few games, you gain the ability to both upgrade and customize your Home City:Upgrade your city by unlocking new types of soldiers or buildings, or improving those you already have.Broaden your tech tree in whatever direction most fits your play style--invest in warships, native alliances, cavalry, artillery or economy.Customize your Home City by changing the appearance of buildings, the weather or even the types of people who walk, work and perform in its streets.Throughout a game, as well as in between games, you can visit your Home City to watch its citizens go about their lives, get an opinion on how you're doing, plot your next move or just marvel at the beautiful sunset.Full 3-D Graphics, Destructible Environments and MoreWe first set out to reproduce the rich detail ofAge of Empires II: Age of Kings. As we strove to make the fascinatingAge of Empires IIItime period come alive, that goal quickly evolved: We at Ensemble Studios wanted to create the best-looking game ever. From the stunning water effects to the hundreds of units battling on-screen, you'll feel like you're a part of the action in the New World.Tone mapping--This photo imaging technique balances the colors in a scene on the fly. The end result is a rich, warm game where bright colors are vibrantly rendered alongside darker counterparts, such as shadows.Lighting and shadows--The sun is always shining inAge of Empires, so it's important that lighting and shadows be an awe-inspiring experience. Units and buildings cast shadows according to a real sun position, and even cast shadows on each other. High Dynamic Range rendering allows us to represent the shiny glints of sunlight that bounce off highly reflective surfaces.Bump and specular mapping--Water glistens like water. Metal shines like metal. These advanced techniques serve to provide an extra level of rendering detail heretofore unseen in real-time strategy (RTS) gaming.Water--We felt that portraying stunning, realistic water effects in the game was so important that we devoted a programmer to it full-time. You'll find the water rich with details like foam near the shore, accurately modeled water motion, flotsam in rivers and realistic water colors. Plus, reflections change with the viewing angle, the angle of sunlight and the motion of the water. The overall effect is breathtaking.Cliffs and Riverbeds--Instead of just stretching terrain, we built a system to attach geometry to the terrain map to allow for realistic overhangs and steep cliffs, from areas like the American Southwest. This effect is supported on random maps too.CivilizationsBritishQuick access to Settlers gives the British one of the strongest economies in the game. The ability to upgrade two key units -- the Musketeer and Hussar -- make the British military formidable in the late game. The British Home City emphasizes improvements to technology and naval warfare.DutchAlthough Dutch Settlers are limited and costly, their civilization makes up for this economic disadvantage by building Banks and generating coin automatically. The Dutch Home City emphasizes upgrades to defense and economy.FrenchAlthough the French economy starts slowly, the Coureur unit, a Villager with strong fighting skills, makes the French difficult to attack early. The French also have the strongest cavalry unit in the game -- the Cuirassier. Plus, the French are experts at allying with the Native Americans.GermanThe Germans have fewer Settlers and therefore a slower economy. Fortunately, both the Settler Wagon and Uhlan cavalry spawn for free from the German Town Center. Plus, the Germans start with the ability to send Mercenaries from their Home City (long before other civilizations can).Native AmericanEuropean civilizations can learn new technologies and gain troops by forging alliances with the Native Americans. A British player who allies with the Iroquois is essentially playing as two civilizations: the British and the Iroquois.OttomanFor the Ottomans, Settlers spawn automatically from the Town Center. Building a Mosque and conducting research help keep that Settler production steady. Befitting their position straddling Europe and Asia, the Ottomans have more unique units than any other civilization.PortugueseStarting the game with two Town Centers, the Portuguese can quickly produce Settlers, control territory or support their allies. The Spyglass ability allows the Portuguese to easily spy on the enemy. The Portuguese also have a strong navy, strong light infantry and the best Dragoons in the game.RussianStarting the game with extra resources but fewer Settlers gives the Russians the flexibility of focusing on economy or an early raid. Russian infantry, individually weak, are trained in blocks at a faster rate, providing the Russians with the opportunity to overwhelm their enemy with greater numbers.SpanishThe Spanish have a strong military, with both hand infantry and cavalry. Flexibility in early shipments from the Home City give the Spanish the option to attack early or set up for a strong, late economy. Spanish Home City improvements benefit soldiers, buildings and naval units.&nbsp;CombatAge of Empires IIIgives players an amazing amount of control over their side of the battlefield.More to command -- Not only are you in command of large and diverse armies of infantry, cavalry and artillery, but also Native American warriors, mercenaries and tall ships.Multiple formations -- You can assign different formations to your army for different strengths and weaknesses, or have the game automatically choose the most appropriate formation. Examples include:Volley -- ranged infantry, like musketeers, take turns firing at enemies ahead of them.Charge -- your soldiers walk, then run into combat. Cavalry wield sabers, and musketeers fix bayonets. This formation does tremendous damage but makes your soldiers more prone to injury.Bombard -- your soldiers protect the cannons, while the cannons shell enemy ranks. Available only when you have artillery in your army.Battles are easier to follow -- You can still command individual units. But when the units fight in formation, you'll be able to tell exactly who is winning the fight.Real-time physics -- Infantry struck by cannon fire will be thrown like rag dolls, perhaps even over a cliff and into the water. Cannonballs bounce and ricochet.Detailed destructions -- Shingles, shutters and whole towers may fly off a building and interact with the terrain, such as crashing into nearby water. This next generation effect is done on the fly so that each building always has a unique destruction, no matter how many times you see it.Unique animations -- With hundreds of unique combat animations, you'll never see the same battle twice.","reviewerName":"Jason W.

The game is beautiful if you have a video card that can handle the graphics and lots of ram..........and the story line is great which is lacking in other RTS games like R of N and Empire Earth series.So why does it need updated? Well, look at the year (it's 2005-2006) and RTS games are exactly the same. Sure there have been some advancements such as Ragdoll physics, storyline inplamented in, more/different units and a different time period but where's the change? Where's the intovation? There is none. This is the exact same game as it was back in 1997 when the first a of em came out.I know they didn't want to risk losing long time fans of the series including me by changing the gameplay but they could of at least made a few changes to it. I really hate resource gathering because it takes away and distracts you from the core gameplay which is fighting battles and saving people's lives so I'm not impressed with this game but it's an adverage RTS if you include the updated graphical effects which is not what makes great gameplay. I'm sorry. If I want graphics I can just fire up Earth 2160 or something to that effect.All in all, the same hum-drum RTS gameplay, resource gathering and base building as in everyother RTS now days.

{"product_name":"B0050SVLI2","description":"","reviewerName":"C. H. Mauricio","summary":"You can put the number 6 in the title and it will be just fine.","reviewText":"Resident Evil Revelations is unique in several aspects. It isn't an officially numbered sequel, but it is part of the main story cannon. In fact, as we wait for the sixth official installment, we may see some characters from this game make an appearance on  that game. It's a jack of all trades game that combines the tension of the classic RE titles with the more modern run and gun shooting of the modern games. It's also the first main cannon Resident Evil game to be released on a handheld platform.The plot here revolves around series veterans Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield on their quest to uncover a sinister plot from a terrorist organization using bio-organic weapons (B.O.W.s) against citizens of the world. Ever since the outbreaks from the original trilogy, the spread of B.O.W. has gone global where terrorist organizations have been able to acquire them. Revelations is a thrilling game of cat and mouse where each chapter only uncovers a piece of the puzzle for the truth, or an even bigger problem arising from it.Most of the game is set on a luxury class cruise ship the Queen Zenobia where its hollow halls and creepy architecture give out a classic Resident Evil vibe to the game. The game mainly revolves around Jill and her new partner Parker Luciani on their search for missing team members Chris Redfield and Jessica Sherawat. The ship you explore is vast and expansive with multiple deck levels filled with monsters and other dangers. The game is cut up into episodes and done in a \"24\" like TV series progression and it keeps things brisk despite the huge ship. Parts of the chapters are also flashbacks that reveal situations on the game's plot and characters. This is where you leave the ship environment and explore other kinds of terrain such as snowy mountains, abandon military bases, and a city under siege with Hunters, the lovable Resident Evil baddies that love to decapitate. There are about 12 episodes with each lasting 20-40 minutes a piece, you'll be hooked from beginning all the way to the climax, like a good TV serial.The gameplay is done in 3rd person style that was established in RE4. However, new and much needed improvements introduced in the first Resident Evil game for the 3DS, Resident Evil The Mercenaries 3D, like the ability to move,reload, aim, and shoot at the same time make an appearance here. Since the game's main themes are about investigation and snooping, you have this new tool called the Genesis. The Genesis is a pistol-like device that whenever aimed, goes into a first person view and allows you to scan your surroundings for hidden items scattered around the world. If you spot something, it's only a matter of holding the X button for a few seconds and the item will be attainable. Even the enemies you face have a roll with the Genesis. Scanning a foe fills up a percentage meter that whenever is reach 100% you are rewarded with a green herb for health replenishment. This is an important tool as health items are scarce and the only form of lifebar you have is the amount of distortion appears on screen as your health degenerates.The game introduces new enemies called the Ooze, these are creatures that can appear anywhere at anytime in the bowels of the ship and can go through ventilation ducts, hide in cabinets, and other gaps as they are very flexible and are quite skilled at chasing prey. Whenever you get caught by one of them they release a leach-like organ that sucks blood out of the prey. They are skillful and powerful with this regard and can easily kill their prey with one grab. There are a few forms of these Ooze from basic forms to ones with claws, a bow gun like contraption, to one that explodes on impact releasing harmful substances into the air. While they are good hunters of prey, they are also not the fastest. Jill can easily outrun them or use evasive maneuvers to escape harm. When you have weaker weapons in the beginning, it is easier to evade them if you can as they take a lot of bullets to fall. They're not quite the limb shooting reaction Ganados and Majinis from Resident Evils 4 & 5 where shooting them in a particular body part has them reacting to that particular gun shot. However, as you get more access to weapon upgrades about mid-game, you can carry more bullets and more powerful firearms to easily dispose of these Ooze. Broken up into two segments per episode are linear sequences that are more action based. These serve to break up the pace and to provide more insight into the plot of the game.Upon completion of the main story you are treated to a post game addiction known as Raid Mode. Because the first Resident Evil game on the 3DS was all about Mercenaries Mode, Capcom had to create something new for Revelation's bonus mode. Think of it as a Phantasy Star meets Resident Evil loot obsession game. A session usually goes that you pick a stage based on locations from the campaign. The point of the game is to reach point A to point B and to kill everything that gets in your way. In between you'll be picking up weapon upgrades, cold hard cash, and experience points.Graphically, Resident Evil Revelations sets the benchmark of Nintendo 3DS games on to uncharted territory. Simply put there's nothing both artistic and technical that has been pulled off on the 3DS so far, that can go against what Capcom achieved here. The amount of detail is staggering, surpassing even any of Nintendo's efforts so far on the system. Only Kingdom Hearts 3D has gone close to what this game has achieved. Every nook and cranny on the ship is detailed and the 3D adds only to the creepy immersion factor. You'll even notice Jill's \"assets\" displayed proudly on the game. On the sound front you'll want to play this game with a good set of earphones to enhance the immersion of the game. Multiple voice language tracks are added and for the first time, Resident Evil characters can now speak in Japanese.A few things do show up that cause issues in the game. The story can be often confusing to follow with the way the flashback sub-chapters are thrown at you. Because the game has huge areas to explore, load times become an issue whenever you ride elevators or enter new areas. While the game is loading a new area you still can move around the elevator or room opening a lock, but the game will chug and become unplayable during these sequences. They used these kind of loading instead of having loading screens to make the game feel seamless in transition. It succeeds in the end as you are not doing anything vital during these loading sequences. Just like in RE5 you constantly have a partner here. However, unlike in RE5, you never have to worry about them eating up ammunition and health supplies. But still, a bigger issue in Revelations is that they are practically useless. While its impossible for them to get killed, they won't help you with anything unless its a scripted part of the game. At least in Resident Evil 5, if you give Sheva a sniper rifle, she'll take out bad guys from yards away and will help you in dicey situations. Some of the areas in Revelations are so huge it's hard to tell which direction to go. The AI could have helped you by perhaps leading the way or mention if you are going the wrong way.RE Revelations is a mandatory buy for all RE fans including those who think the series has strayed to far off course. As one who enjoys the new style Resident Evil more (it is the shooter of my choice as I don't play first person shooters and not much third person shooters like Gears of War), I had a hard time playing this game on its slow more methodical paces at the beginning but grew in to the groove once the bullets became more aplenty. Go buy this game, it still shows that Capcom still can release games without an overabundance of reliance on download content. This is a full fledged Resident Evil title on a portable with all the bells and whistles included.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2012"}

But, Final Fantasy Tactics built a strong fan base, and I'm sure many still replay it today.FFT is a game that took a different direction rather than a traditional RPG.  Most of the game revolves around battles that are much harder than you may think.  The manual even advises that you save after every encounter.  Before a battle ensues, you can place usually up to 5 characters on a platform, which represents your side of the battlefield while the enemy starts on the other side.  You then begin to advance, a little like chess, planning strategically to smite all the enemies before you.I definitely agree with the people who say this game is hard.  If you don't plan one character's move correctly, the whole battle may be out of your hands.  But, if strategy games isn't your cup of tea, then don't get strategy games!  FFT is a hard game, but it is definitely beatable and conquerable, it just takes a lot of time and patience.All in all, Final Fantasy Tactics is an exceptional game.  The engrossing gameplay, great graphics, story, and characters make it a must have for fans of the genre or considering fans.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00004U1R2","description":"Conker's Bad Fur Dayis for adults, the ESRB has rated thisgame Mature; it should not be bought for--or played by or around--children. That stated, the story of the game is the following: Conker's verygoodnight turns into a very bad day. He has to deal with a crazy and abusive world, all while suffering through a massive hangover. Conker encounters abusive paint pots; jabbering dung beetles; trigger-happy, scar-faced Tediz; and a belligerent giant, with only a frying pan as a means of self-defense. He is resourceful, however, and makes the best of his situation. The game combines elements of 3-D exploration, combat, and puzzle solving. It features cinematic cutscenes, movie parodies, facial expressions, dozens of unhinged characters, and 1- to 4-player deathmatch games in a variety of styles.","reviewerName":"Nate","summary":"Overall Pretty Fun","reviewText":"My only complaints are the $60 used price tag, which is very unreasonable considering you can have just as much fun with other platform games on N64 (Banjo Kazooie and Mario 64 of course). Only difference is this game is adult themed, which is unique in it's own. Also it suffers from the same thing most games in this genre do, bad camera angles. Can't express how frustrating it can be having to wrestle with the camera just to correctly jump to certain ropes, ledges, etc. Although these aren't enough to make Conker's Bad Fur Day fall apart, because it really is a great game. This being my first playthrough it has a hysterical and well thought up story. The difficulty like everyone else has mentioned is well..... INTENSE... This game can make someone rage quit, just a heads up. Though it's just that more satisfying upon completion. I liked the challenge personally and I don't usually play hard games.The positives are well known. Especially the graphics and voice acting. Extremely well done, props to former RARE. I'm actually shocked that this title as well as 007 and Killer Instinct didn't save their company. Anywho off topic. Overall this is a pretty fun game and not an easily forgettable experience.

We won't advertise it, we won't show it in the commercials, and we'll make the AI dirt easy so we don't have to waste time developing it.\"That's what they did.  One third of the game is an amazing action adventure game, with a beautiful jungle environment, great controls, and thought provoking puzzles.  Sort of like Prince of Persia in the rain forest.  This is what the reviews, the previews, and the commercials emphasize.  This is false advertising.Most of this game is a slow, boring, 3rd person shooter.  The enemies come in waves of about 20.  They stand behind an obstacle, and really don't move.  So, you're at a stalemate.  You can't move forward because you'd be shot, so you have to poke around, kill someone, and do it again for the entire wave.  Then, most likely, another wave pops up again.  So very boring.  It doesn't help that you can't keep more than two weapons without even being able to keep bullets from your previous weapon.  This whole sequence makes entering any new room a dreaded chore.It doesn't even make sense.  You would climb some perilous ledges, make some scary jumps, knock down a pillar, find a key, all to open a door.  What's behind this ultra secret door with such a super difficult barrier of entry?  Fifty enemies just waiting.  Wait, what, why didn't I just take the same route these fifty guys took?However, this game really shows off the PS3s amazing graphical power.  I doubt anything like this could be done on the Xbox360.  The story is your typical ultra clich&eacute;d story which is just a plain rip-off of Tomb Raider/Indiana Jones.  If you play games, your used to this, so it's not that big of a deal.There are some other details.  In the middle, there's some jet ski and driving missions which are actually done pretty well.  There are also mutants or aliens of something near the end that adds some difficulty and a little twist.All in all, if it was an action-adventure game through and through, this would be one of the best games around.

I thought maybe the bad reviewers simply got a lemon due to poor quality control.Here is the truth: The first grip I bought was indeed very loose.  The clip that secures the Vita wobbled, even when in the locked position.  I thought that maybe I, too, got a lemon.  And since Amazon makes it so easy to return items (5 stars to Amazon service), I simply returned it for a replacement.  Well, the replacement was exactly the same.  Unless I am extremely unlucky, then this is simply a badly designed accessory.  The only thing I can figure is that the positive reviewers don't mind if their $250 device wiggles loosely in the grip, and might even fall out.Given the price, you can't expect too much.  But honestly, if it is unusable, then there is no acceptable price, because you will just be throwing your money away.

Fun with a friend and easier with a friend. Good character designs.CONS: Okay, here we go, the game has some very poor technical issues, and the graphics are the worst I have seen in newer games.

C. Ege/Acedoh \"acedoh\"","summary":"After all it is a Little Big Planet","reviewText":"In the world of Little Big Planet lives little sack boys and sack girls.  These cute little creations live a life to run, jump, and explore.  The journey you guide them on may take them to many different places.  Some may be a lot of fun and others may be a little frustrating.  Little Big Planet is the game that may change the way you think about gaming.  It's much than just playing.  It's also about creating and sharing your creations with the world.  Let me go over each part of the game.First and foremost a game would not be a game if it's not for playing.  In Little Big Planet your character is a little sack boy or sack girl.  Of course you can dress and design your character whichever way you like.  The sack boys and girls are also able to show different emotions that range from happy to angry and sad.  There are many combinations to make your character that much more expressive.  The characters movements are rather simple.  You can run, jump, and grab.  You really don't have to worry about seven or eight different controls.  As you progress thru the game you may be wanting more controls.  The game is narrated beautifully by Stephen Fry.  He will give you tutorials thru many of the beginning levels.  This is a side scroller game.  Which is something the gaming consoles don't see of much nowadays.  Although it's a little different than standard side scrollers in which the game has three layers that can make some challenges that much more tricky.  Many of the level designs are beautiful and well thought out.  Each level is part of a theme that comes from all different parts of the world.  From Europe to Africa, North America and Asia the whole world is covered.  The music that accompanies each level is also from the different parts of the world.  My only qualm is that the game does get difficult about halfway thru.  The levels can become quite frustrating if you get stuck on a certain spot.  I am more than familiar with the frustrated feeling.  Now you can play with up to three other players in co-op mode which is a lot of fun.  This allows you to take on some two player challenges to unlock extras on each level.  Although this is an important part of the game it is only one piece.The next part of the game I want to talk about is the create part.  In Little Big Planet you can create just about anything you have floating around in your head.  If you are the creative type or just want to recreate your favorite game or movie this is your chance.  As you progress further in the regular game you will be able to unlock more items to decorate your creation.  It's a lot of fun just to try out some of the tools that are accessible in this game.  The psyhics are incredibly realistic.  If you want to build something you have to remember that items can have a mind of their own when you put them into your world.  What makes creating a level that much more exciting is the ability you have to share them with the world.  Players can rate your creation or creations.  The better your creation scores the easier it will be for other players to access that level.  You as a player well be able to access others creations from all over the world.  This could lead to hundreds if not thousands of excellent levels over the months.  This will lead to unlimited replayibility in the game.The last part of the game I would like to cover is the community aspect.  You as a player will be able to play with up to three others.  They can be off your friends list or just individuals you have never met.  All in all this will add quite a bit more fun to the game.  A game like Little Big Planet is meant to be played with others.  With the latest patch the online portion of the game is working much better now.  It's a great time to play many of these well crafted levels that the public at large created.Overall Little Big Planet is quite a step in terms of gaming.  Simple in many aspects and utterly amazing in the creation aspect.  This is a game that can be enjoyed by the entire family.  Some aspects of this game are not perfect but that shouldn't stop anyone from playing.  Gamers and non gamers can have fun with the sack boys and girls.  See you in the Little Big Planet...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2008"}

{"product_name":"B002I0F5M8","description":"","reviewerName":"Matt","summary":"Disappointing","reviewText":"Let me start things off by stating that, like most people, I really enjoyed Batman: Arkham Asylum. It was a mature and refreshing take on the Batman universe and included a solid and mature storyline, enjoyable Metroid-style gameplay, and a good amount of innovative gameplay features. For this go-around (Arkham City), the developers at Rocksteady chose instead to forego the innovative gameplay features, bring back essentially the same rehashed combat and predator scenarios, triple the number of meaningless collectibles, and turn the once-focused storyline into a broken, tangled mess of Batman heroes and villians.GRAPHICS: The graphics are nice and pretty, but so were those of Asylum. Very little has changed in this department actually, so if you liked the look of its predecessor, you'll find yourself in very familiar territory with this game.COMBAT: Speaking of familiar territory, the combat of Arkham City is essentially the same as Asylum. It's the same \"square to punch\", \"triangle to counter\", \"circle to stun\", \"x,x to dodge\" as it was in the first game. The only difference is that you have new gadget tricks available (most of which are unnecessary), and there are some new enemies to pummel (blade wielders, shield carriers, etc). I found this combat system refreshing when I first played with it in Asylum, but it's awfully repetitive at this point, and Rocksteady really beats you over the head with it here in City. After about the first three combat encounters, I found myself groaning audibly nearly every single time I heard someone yell \"OY IT'S THE BATMAN, GET HIM!\", only to be immediately swarmed seconds later by that one guy plus 10-20 of his dearest friends (reminds me of the playground fight scene from Matrix Reloaded with all of the Agents pouring out of doors and windows). The battles also seem to take longer in this game than in the last, with the enemies taking more blows to the face than seems possible, which adds a ridiculous \"clown punching bag\" feeling to the fights. Seriously, how many times do I have to bury both of my fists and both of my boots in your nasal cavity before you call it quits? Overall, I'm not saying the combat is bad or broken... it's just more of the damn same, and there's not enough new to keep it from getting stale very quickly. There's no way in hell I'll be playing through the extra combat challenges offered as additional replayability.PREDATOR: Also very familiar territory. Remember the rooms in Asylum where you were forced to take down 3-7 armed guys stealthily in order to progress? Well, they're back and..... nothing has really changed. There are very few new elements, like bad guys that jam your detective mode, but most of the predator scenarios are the same as before (hide in the floor or on a gargoyle and take people out one at a time when they're isolated). Again, like the combat it's done competently from a design and programming point of view, but I've DONE ALL OF THIS BEFORE, and it doesn't take long to get repetitive. Couple these predator rooms with the fighting rooms and what you get is a sequence of brawls and predators alternating back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And given the general lack of innovation and shameless reproduction of the elements of Asylum, it makes the game feel more like an expansion pack than a stand-alone game.OTHER GAMEPLAY: The general flow of the game has changed from a relatively linear, story-driven one in Asylum to an open-world quest-driven game in City. Obviously openworld games are popular with the masses (Grand theft auto, Infamous, Skyrim), but if you happen to find them tedious like I do, then you may not like the current Batman setup. My main problem with this style of game is that story always take a backseat to the abundant questing, and it makes me feel less like a critical element in the gameworld, and more like some random dude who just happens to stumble upon some significant set-piece in between various fetch quests, escort missions, and loot raids (in other words, it feels more like a jumbled collection of time-wasting quests than a solid story-driven experience). It's more of the same in Arkham City (minus the escort missions, thank God): You're always given a primary objective, but rest assured that en route you will be interrupted by at least one side quest that will pop up randomly somewhere else in the city. These side quests range from getting from point A to point B within a time limit all the way to destroying particular containers/objects hidden throughout the city. Again, the exact same kind of stuff you'll find in any other openworld game that sadly never really adds anything to the main story... just distracts from it.STORY/TALENT: The story in City is a jumbled mess and lacks the interesting and disturbing tone of Asylum. As another Amazon reviewer put it, it's basically a whole bunch of Batman heroes and villians battling for screentime. Truly, you're going to experience more momentary encounters with Batman villains than you ever thought possible in Arkham City. It's like Rocksteady challenged themselves to put every single Batman villian in this game, regardless of whether it made sense plot-wise or added anything to the experience (NO, on both counts). I even thought some of the characters were made up, given how ludicrous they were. This airplane hangar-load of extras only served to cheapen the overall experience and make the script and plot seem more inane and disjointed.The voice talent is good for the most part, with Mark Hamil again stealing the show as Joker. Other characters are not so good. Batman sounds like a constipated B movie actor who takes himself too seriously. Part of the problem is some of the terrible lines of dialogue they're given to read, but oftentimes a significant statement or threat just comes across as corny (and this bad in such a dark game).MUSIC/SOUND: No complaints here. Sounds effects are appropriate and pack a punch. The background music is always appropriate for the current mood and often climbs in intensity when combat ramps up or if you're discovered by an enemy.REPLAY: If you're the kind of person who loves to spend countless hours searching for collectibles, then you'll have plenty to do (over 400 riddler trophies, I think) once the game is over. The extra combat challenges and predator challenges are available too, if you're not sick of them by that time. If you don't like any of this stuff, you can always play through the game again with your upgrades (new game plus), although this doesn't really change anything about the game. I felt the number of sidequests was also on the low side (compared to other openworld games) and that the developers opted for fewer but longer sidequests in lieu of a larger number of shorter ones (like other games). This turns out to be a poor idea, as it decreases variety and increases repetition, unfortunately. I also can't help feeling that all of the pay-for-DLC packages that are meant to add replayability should've just been included with the game. It's one thing to have a long, involved game that feels like $50-60 well spent, but this game just ain't it. I can't speak about the Catwoman stuff (apparently free if you buy the game new), because I didn't redeem my voucher and honestly, I don't really want to.BOTTOM LINE: I feel cheated by paying retail for Arkham City and wish I had rented it instead. It's not a bad game, it's just that I've essentially played it once before in Arkham Asylum and the story is not remotely interesting enough this time around to make me want to come back to it. It feels more like a bunch of quests wrapped up and sold as an expansion pack, and that's not good. If you're not sure how you're going to like this game, it's never a bad idea to rent it first.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2011"}

{"product_name":"Assassin's Creed III Liberation PlayStation Vita Wi-Fi Bundle","description":"","reviewerName":"G. Lindquist","summary":"One game only goes so far to cover the flaws","reviewText":"There are a lot of positive reviews likely written directly after the item is delivered and the person is thrilled with their new toy, but take this review of an early adopter for consideration if you will.The reason why this is the first game bundled with the Vita that you hear about is because of it's brand recognition. Before this game there was a long period of time that the Vita provided nothing that a console wouldn't, and also lacked in quality titles that only a hand held could offer. The answer to that was gravity Rush which came after months of waiting. It was a blast, but that was still really the only game that made this system uniquely worth having. Fast forward months and months later to this new Assassin's Creed game, which sorry, but is a watered down experience compared to the new console version out. It's good, it's just not as good as what else is offered out there. The point is, they are putting the AC:L and Vita together because they want to claim this game is worth owning the system for. Even if that was the case, what happens afterwards? The Vita is still being used as a perpetual tech demo, getting every toned down console game ported that it can. I really makes you wonder if you should just have a vita, or just have a PS3. They try to combat that by giving you a code to have both versions in very few select games but that adds to more problems, which is the memory card. It is a complete rip off. The memory cards are low performance and slow, not to mention nearly 4x (at launch, now 3x)the cost of other, higher performance memory cards like it and they completely required for the Vita's use. 4Gb is not only not enough space, but it will make your experience with this system abysmal as you will have to use their extremely clunky program to transfer items back and forth to manage the card and its limited size. Many games are even larger than the 4Gb memory card which instantly hinders your positive experience.I ask you to consider that after the &#34;WOW&#34; of this new game wears off, what are you left with? You are left with a battery eating, heavy, supped up PSP that seeks to drain your patience and money through overpriced store items. Plants vs Zombies for example is $14.99 when you can get it for the iPad HD (using that as an example because its portable and has a gorgeous screen) for as low as $0.99 or even $6.99 at it's most expensive.  The PSV's web browser is terrible and its more than apparent that it was just tacked on with little consideration for how it would perform. The system is great while you play a game that is worth owning but so far it's too few and far between to warrant a purchase. Gravity rush moved a lot of Vitas but then all those people pretty much had to wait for this game months later to enjoy the system again. There is nothing that says this will be different.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2012"}

One of the reasons the game has been so well received is because of how versatile and appealing it is for all different kinds of gamers. The level of customization in this game really makes the player feel like they apart of Tamriel (the world Skyrim resides in). From being able to intensely customize your character, to being able to customize your abilities and even name your weapons. Because we are in the genre of high fantasy, the world of Skyrim is so mystical and magical it makes it very exciting to explore all the different parts of the land.The way the game was designed you can easily play for 100 hrs (I played for 200 collectively) and still have quests to do. Most games don't produce in excess of 30 hours of gameplay let alone 100+. Because the world of Skyrim seems so infinite and there are so many quests the fun essentially never stops. The story is a great and epic tale of a chosen one called the Dragonborn, who has the ability to 'shout' like the dragons of old who flew high above the skies of Tamriel. Overall I believe it is one of the greatest (if not the greatest) RPS ever made thus far.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2013"}

Also with the vast library already out for the 3DS but with its backwards compatibility to play DS games also expands the library even more.  I do admit though I wish the 3D was somewhat better during gameplay as like with many other players when I play I tend to move the console around a little and that does affect the 3D to a point where I usually just turn it off.  The setup was amazingly easy to do and the basic instructions on how to use the 3Ds was very helpful.  It's just a little sad that Amazon won't sell them and I was not going to pay $15.00-$25.00 dollars more from 3rd party sellers then just having to get it at a gamestore for its true price.

The creativity, imagination, and just fun game play reminds me back to the old Mario and Sonic games where games always seemed original and innovative at the time.  Today, most games emphasize on creating games that look like the real world, while it's impressive, it just doesn't have the uniqueness of an imaginary world.  It's great how the player interacts with the world to have a customized feel.  One part of the game asks you to draw a snow flake.  Then the rest of the stage it snows with the snow flake you drew.I loved Little Big Planet and didn't expect much from this game when I saw trailers, but this game exceeded my expectations and I prefer it over LBP.  It's sad knowing not many people will play this great game.  People would rather play the same military shooters every year instead of trying something new and original.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SWVIQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Thomas Riccardi","summary":"A worthy sequel in the Dead Space universe!","reviewText":"When I was living in a one bedroom apartment I came across a game that was being hyped as an unusual horror survival game. Instead of taking place in some city or a haunted house the game took place in the far future in the depths of space. You controlled a character named Isaac Clark as you were trying to figure out when the USG Ishimura went dark. The events that happened in the first two games have been incredible and have left the gamers wanting more. Now EA games has released Dead Space 3 but is this going to be another worthy entry in the series or will this be the game that should be flushed out of an airlock?This installment puts you back in control of Isaac Clark and picks up where the last game left off as you try to make you way to the frozen planet of Tau Volantis. Unfortunately as you approach the planet the ship breaks up and you are left stranded on this frozen rock. You can play the game in single player but there is also a co-op mode where your partner can control Sergeant John Carver (a survivor from a necromorph outbreak and was part of EarthGov forces). What is interesting about the co-op play is that each have their own view of the events of the game. There are some points in the game where one of the characters will experience dementia and it is up to your partner to keep you covered while you work thru it.Another upgrade from the previous games is the weapon bench (instead of the tool bench) and of the neatest parts of this game is that you can combine weapons! So if you wanted to have an buzzsaw launcher that shoots flaming buzzsaws you can build that! There are blueprints scattered throughout the game so you can build them easier instead of building them from scratch.Another cool feature is only available on the XBox 360 and that is Kinect voice commands. This can be used for simple things (such as finding your next objective), inventory control (giving your partner ammo) or even switch weapons and use stasis. Granted most of these voice commands are supposed to be used while playing co-op and I am unsure if they are going to be available in the single player campaign. But I think it's an awesome feature to just say reload and the game does it for you!All in all Dead Space 3 is a worthy sequel to it's predecessor and if you are a fan of the series you need to pick this game up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}

As such, I was absolutely ecstatic when its sequel came out and I could once again resume Link's quest.  Unfortunately, that excitement lasted for roughly 10-15 minutes...or until the gameplay actually started.I realize that there is a large contingent of people who consider this game to be one of the best ever produced, but from the perspective of a casual gamer, it is largely a disappointment for the following reasons:-The time element.  One of the great things about \"Ocarina\" is that the gameplay was almost completely left up to the discretion of the player.  One could go from temple to temple in short order, or you could wander around exploring a little bit, trying out some mini-games with no fears of \"falling behind\".  With the time aspect of \"Majora's Mask\", however, you always feel pressured to complete certain tasks by a certain time.  That sprawling, epic feel of \"Ocarina\" is completely gone.-Saving.  As players of the old NES system learned decades ago, there is nothing more frustrating than not being able to accurately save your progress within the gaming experience.  Some of us are not hardcore gamers, and often life intercedes with an ability to find an owl statue or play an Ocarina song.  This is a MAJOR flaw in this game that renders it painfully frustrating at many occasions.  If a game is to appeal \"to the masses\", it must have a straightforward saving mechanism.-Too many sidequests.  While \"Ocarina\" struck the perfect balance between \"major quests\" and \"side quests\", \"Majora\" is positively riddled with mini-games, to the point of absolute overload.  Again, whereas \"Ocarina\" was straightforward with room for adventuring, in \"Majora\" there are so many things going on that it produces a sensation of fear and overwhelming.Overall, I feel as if \"Majora's Mask\" was made for the hardcore gamers instead of the casual fans of the series.  Whether that was a \"good\" or \"bad\" choice is up for debate, of course, but in my experience it completely turned me off from the whole experience.  I've tried to \"get back into\" this game on multiple occasions, but every time it just leaves me frustrated.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2012"}

You can grab, give headbuts and punch peoples pieces (both illegal moves), block, or and lean to dodge attacks.Throughout the game you earn money which can be used to either buy new gloves or other equipment that will help your stats, or buy a more skilled and expensive trainer to give you higher stats while working out. Thats another thing - in order to get faster or stronger you have to hit combo dummies, punching bags, and lift weights.You fight in various pay-per-views and other sponsored fights by big names like Under Armour, Burger King, and Dodge to either win belts, unlock online achievements, become more popular, earn a shoot load of money, or unlock new equipment.Lets talk boxers now. There are ALOT of big name boxers that you can battle or play us such as Muhammed Ali, Evander Holyfield, Roy Jones Jr., Sugar Ray Leonard, Bernard Hopkins and many more. There are also random, made up boxers for the 60+ fights you'll have to trudge through to be the best. In FNR3, any one of these people could become your rival meaning they will hate you and challenge you over and over and over again.During matches, just like real boxing, if you take damage you have to heal yourself. This includes placing ice on a swollen ice or taking care of a cut. If you fail to do these, your boxer becomes weaker and unable to throw decent punches.Graphics are excellent. You can see each particle of sweat dripping down & off your enemy, blood pouring out of cuts, broken noses, hair swaying as punches are thrown, lights pounding down on both the crowd and boxers.. its amazing and really makes it feel like the boxers are actually not in a game but are really battling it out in front of you. The arenas are great - and though the crowd attendants are sometimes recycled - they look realistic as well. Easily a 10.The soundtrack to this game can be annoying, but its still good. EA Sports did a great job liscensing real life musciains like Akon & Sean Biggs to perform in FNR3. It really fits and it helps pump up your & your fighter for his battle. The sound of a fist pounding into the face of your oppenent, then his jaw cracking as you destroy him with a hook, the sound of his blood squirting out of his mouth, his cry of pain & anguish, and finally the sound of his body slamming into the canvas is GREAT and extremley rewarding (especially if your a heavyweight and fighting a welterweight). I love it.Three downfalls to this game is the fact that everything seems to tire your boxer out. For instance, you'll throw a quick jab, your enemy will block, and your guy will just stand there staring stupidly for a few seconds giving your enemy a chance for a counter hook. Secondly, when you reach the higher 30s in age, your character becomes old and useless - he literally loses stats after each fight and becomes bald. They make it seem like he is thirty years older than he really is, and forces you to retire him. Finally, if you care about your boxer's appearance then doing speed training is a bad thing - I had a boxer who had a solid & tight 6 pack, I did one session of speed training and he had a loose gut. I was forced to lift weights for three sessions to get it back. Its not really that bad but kind of annoying.I'm not a big sports fan, but Fight Night Round 3 is filled with so much content and plain fun that it's easily one of the most addicting games the X-Box 360 has to offer. Sure it can be repetitive, but each fight is more rewarding then the last - especially when you drop a rival, earning $10,000 and taking his title - and just watching your created boxer rise to the top is just so satisfying after all the hardwork you put into him. I highly suggest you buy this game","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2006"}

Call of Duty has been on a serious decline.  After the epic package of trash that was Black Ops, the glitchers ruining MW2, and the disregard for the servers for World at War, I was hoping MW3 would save it.  It has not.  I've picked up Battlefield 2 (even though I have never liked it and always played COD) and it honestly where its at, since BF3 is just a sad attempt to merge both COD and BF.First thing that REALLY made me mad was I paid extra for the hardened edition and all I get is a bunch of COD Elite crap?! No one cares about this!  Its not worth an extra $40.  Guess I'm the world's biggest sucker.Ok, storyline yes, MW3 completes it out, its a great story, all 3 games have been fun to watch unfold.  Spec ops...zombies its not nor will it be.  MW2 spec ops is better.  There, that makes quick work of what no one really cares about.  Now the online,  its pathetic.  Good intentions, and I honestly love the way they laid it out, but here is a brief description of why nothing, no matter how well planned, could save it.Guns are unbalanced, handle horrible, sometimes 1 bullet kills you sometimes it takes 2 clips.  Weapons are complete crap and you are punished for not playing every second of your life to unlock better stuff.Hit detection is the worst it has ever been in a COD game.Quick scoping is back and easier than ever.Maps look like something from Black Ops, laid out perfect for campers, too hard to see the other players, all hall and tunnel based crap well you just basically shoot back and forth.Took out danger close.  Wouldn't have been a problem had they not put sooooo many places people can den up in.  No chance of clearing them out since gernade damage has been retarded to the point where its useless.Lag, lag, LAG.Spawn system is the WORSE ever.Killstreaks never reset on recon class.  Too many UAV type killstreaks.Juggernaut killstreak...WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?! Wait, honestly I like it, and I will tell you why.  Now all you idiots that whinned about it on World at War because you couldn't figure out the MP40 was purposely put in the game to counter act that perk can see what Juggernaut really CAN be hahahahahaha.A lil page from Treyarch's FPS book, he who has shotgun, kills in one shot.First we had no recoil, now the guns hop like jack n the boxes.I can keep going but I think you get the point.  The graphics are disappointing; horrible no, but still not what you would expect.  This is just the same repackaged crap that I've come to expect from Call of Duty.  I tried to like it, but its just too irritating.  They've lost a loyal follower.  Every 10 year old in the world can keep playing but I'm done.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2011"}

Players can execute synchronized attacks and collaborate to unleash a deadly blow to the enemy.

The story begins asStar Ocean&Otilde;s protagonist, Fayt Leingod, brings his family and childhood friend, Sophia Esteed, to the Federation-managed resort planet Hyda for a vacation, but the dreamy holiday is abruptly ended when Hyda is attacked by an unknown space military. In the heat of the attack, Fayt is separated from his family and Sophia, and he begins an emotional quest into the unknown to find his loved ones. Along his journey, he gets caught up in the war of an uncharted planet, but in the end, he learns the terrible untold secret about the world and himself.","reviewerName":"Destitute","summary":"4.5 Stars. A frustrating, controller-smashing, yet fun and oh-so-satisfying experience.","reviewText":"The Star Ocean series is sort of a Star Trek meets Final Fantasy kind of experience, mixing laser guns with swords. The first 3D game (not in the new sense of the word meaning that it has depth, but in the old sense that it has polygons)in the franchise manages to still hold up well to this day; it's much better than some of the JRPG's for newer consoles.GRAPHICS: It seems like yesterday when the PS2's graphics were mind-blowing. Not any more. But the graphics are pretty easy on the eyes, with smooth anime-like characters and environments. There are some FMV's here and there that still look great as well. The game also is very cinematic, with some pretty lengthy cutscenes.SOUND: The soundtrack in this game is fantastic. There is seriously something for everyone in this OST, including rock that sounds like 80's Rush, slow acoustic tracks, jazzy tunes, techno, J-pop, and music that sounds like your typical fantasy game. It's on par with older JRPG OST's from the SNES and PS1 era.The voice acting is pretty much meh. From around the early to mid 2000's, most English dubs in games were pretty much between being awesomely bad, such as Star Ocean: The Second Story, and very good. The voices are very hit or miss, but nothing too awful. Also, the music tends to be way too loud in comparison with the voices at times.STORY: You don't need to play the first two to know what's going on, as this story is pretty much in its own little corner in the SO universe. What really fleshes out the story in this game is the dictionary, which describes every term, place, and person in detail. The story itself, while having the usual JRPG cliches, is solid. The characters are decent, though some are more fleshed out than others. The main character himself is alright, but is sort of your typical JRPG teenager.And of course, I can't talk about the story without pointing out the elephant in the room, which is the infamous plot twist. I won't give it away, but there is nothing in any of the games that alludes to it. It's like they hired M. Night Shyamalan to write the last third of the game's story. While I find the twist kind of intriguing philosophically, it should have been used on another game series.GAMEPLAY: Let's talk about the main meat of the game, the battle system. Battles are thankfully not random this time around, and like the previous games, you control one character while the others do their thing while you unleash some cool moves and combos. One feature is the bonus battle gauge, which is filled after so many attacks on the enemy. When it's filled, you get rewards such as triple EXP and increased item chance. What's frustrating is it can easily break, either from escaping or getting hit.Another interesting feature in the battle system are the trophies, which are saved to another file on the memory card. Pretty much, this game had achievements before they were cool.Perhaps the most intriguing yet unfair feature of the battle system that breaks RPG law is the fact that you can die when your MP runs out. I repeat, running out of MP means death. That means you have to constantly heal both, and sometimes, it can be such a pain.Speaking of a pain, this game can be unforgiving later on, and sometimes the difficulty can be more unfair than challenging. With enemies' spamming attacks, a constant need to grind, and you repeatedly having to stock up on more items, this game is harder than your average RPG. Every time you beat a dungeon or kill a boss, it makes it all the more satisfying.Speaking of dungeons, one feature I like is the map system. The map fills out as you explore, and when you fill it up 100% (meaning you search every nook and cranny) you get an item.The rest is your typical Star Ocean experience. Item creation with more items than necessary, more characters than the amount you can actually recruit,(with some of them being way too underleveled when you obtain them,) secret dungeons, choices that determine the ending cutscenes, (though the choices are much more vague this time around with no private actions,) and being on a fantasy world during most of the game as opposed to being in a sci-fi one. The games itself is pretty long, around 60+ hours excluding the extra dungeons, and it spans two discs, something that's rare for a PS2 game.Overall, if you're looking for a JRPG experience with a bit more bite, check this game out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2012"}

Squires \"theDrizzle\"","summary":"Best game ever!!!","reviewText":"Wow! I expected to check out the reviews and see that it had a solid 5 stars. But of course there's a lot of people who always have to give it 1 star because they didn't like one little thing about it or because they suck at the multiplayer. If you want to know what to expect from this game; it's COD4 with a lot of stuff added to make it even better, which I wouldn't have even thought was possible.It seems like they really listened to player feedback for this title and they fixed a lot of things in the multiplayer that I found annoying in COD4. And the killstreaks....wow! They've totally revamped killstreaks to be real game changers. In COD4 someone would get a helicopter and everyone would just hide inside...sometimes it made a big impact in the game, sometimes it didn't. Now that you can have multiple killstreaks going on simultaneously and you can get ridiculous helicopter and air strikes from care packages, the game can turn around in 20 seconds. I always hated showing up to a match where you were down 2000 points and it was hopeless. Now, I show up and get a care package and then a Pavelow or something, and it's actually possible to win.The new perk system is awesome too! Don't want to be a spoiler, but if you were a newb who relied on Martydom...better learn how to shoot. You can only get it as a death streak now, and not until a higher level.The bling perk is awesome; I really hated having to choose between a red dot site and a silencer; now I rock both on the P90. And you can use hardline to get your killstreaks faster...NiceIf you didn't like this game then there's something wrong with you. I don't know what people were expecting, but this is the epitomy of multiplayer perfection. You can't beat these graphics and sound effects, not to mention game balance. I think that they've really maxed out the potential of this gen of consoles.If you gave this game a 1 star because of the campaign, you're an idiot. The campaign is only there because it's tradition. The COD series is all about the multiplayer. Don't judge a game based off a 10 hour campaign when it has the potential to give you endless hours of online carnage.Ratings:Multiplayer: 10/10Campaign: 9/10Graphics: 10/10Sounds: 10/10Game balance: 10/10Improvements over COD 4:  10/10In summation, if you don't buy this game, you're only hurting yourself","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2009"}

Prestige Level 8. Prestige Level 50, I could care less. If a game isn't fun, there's no use in playing it (save maybe those wonderful little achievements). It doesn't matter how many hours you put into it every night, accusing 12-year olds from Australia for being hackers. What sells me on the game is the campaign. The campaign for Modern Warfare 2 is cool, sure. It's diverse, true. But it's not quite as gripping as the one inCall of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, even though it does take two plot turns that (without spoiling anything) might shock or upset you. If you've seen most of today's action blockbusters, it's possible you'll just shrug it off and move on though. And that's a bit what happened with the campaign this time around; interesting, yes, but too scattered all over the place to be truly memorable. Khaled Al-Asad was a name that rung through your head over and over again in the previous game, a clear bad guy, a clear objective. What's going on in Modern Warfare 2? There's Makarov, clearly evil, but is he really the main bad guy? Who is who from the first game, where are their allegiances now? Who was I in the first one, who am I now? Soap? Someone else? I can't really make sense of it. Give me a clear cut bad guy and a clear cut good guy, don't jump around in time and around different characters, it's dizzying. It's daring, sure, it's cool and stylish, yes, but is the plot actually good and involving? Not as much when you're literally thrown all over the place.So what makes up for it? The Spec Ops co-op mode is absolutely amazing, wonderful little mini-missions with different sorts of challenges for one or two players online or off. You'll have to be tactical, action oriented, think on your feet and take your time if you hope to make it through them all. You might also have to resort to dirty tricks for the truly hard ones, but as long as that's only done in Spec Ops, no problem.And multiplayer? It's overrated. Yes, I said it. There's more content and customization, but does that actually make it better or more fun? To begin with, maybe. Throwing knives are cool and fun to play with, making your dream-class is nice, and there are many weapon (and other) specific mini-challenges to tide you over. But when thousands or millions of players (and the majority you're likely to run into being young males) devote their time to something as they do, it's likely to become watered down. There's no fairness to all the killstreak stuff, one team or player is likely to dominate because of their cowardly tactics or superior experience (statistically). There's prepubescant swearing, camping, cheating, hacking, singing, goofing, all kinds of players speaking different languages, and a general lack of players just out to have fun with their gaming. If you happen to come across a female player who's just having fun about the whole thing, or can actually carry on conversation, you're in luck. The bottom line is that people are the worst. Young people even more so. Competitive young males in large quantities, the absolute worst out of all of them. If you're with buddies you know and trust, have some fun. If you play with someone you know and trust, jump in a private chat and kill some time. Other than that, I see no real point in going online, because it's surely not enjoyable on any level (meaning fair, lighthearted or with pleasant interactions). Unless you absolutely have to complete every little challenge you can as your own personal goal.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2010"}

The real problem in this game is a lack of variety in the storyline missions. You basically get to drive and shoot, back to the days of GTA III. No planes, parachutes or pimping side missions. Gone are the days of being an EMT for fun and glory. There are no missions like 555-WETIP, there is no green goo mission, and it really translates into play. You may hear yourself saying \"C'mon, this type of mission again? I did 4 just like it an hour ago.\"Well, if this game consistently fails to meet the SA level of excellence, why the hell did I say it was great? Because there are some amazing new features. The pedestrian and police AI is way, way better. The level of interaction is also much more in depth than any past edition.The cell phone feature is awesome. I love the fact that you can instantly reattempt a mission without all the driving. The mini-games like bowling and darts are great, and I personally think the new technique required in driving is a step up. I'm also totally fine with not having to eat every day etc.Again, the graphics are enjoyable, the storyline is solid and gameplay is fun overall, but parts of it are starting to feel a little stale. I expect R* to re-integrate some of the abilities lost from SA in future versions. Then we might have the perfect game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-10-2008"}

Critics were unfairly harsh on their reviews, and they pointed out a lot the fact that the game is not long enough by their standards. How long do you want your game to be is a matter of opinion.  The production values found in this game are second to none, the cinematic, dialogue and story are top notch.

{"product_name":"B00004U5VK","description":"PlayStation2 owners with a passion forResident Evil's  genre-launching gameplay are in luck: Capcom delivers the same  world-famous gameplay style (sans zombies) in a beautiful action-adventure  set in a mystical medieval Japanese kingdom.Onimusha: Warlordsprobably won't win any awards for groundbreaking gameplay, but the  fast-paced action promises to overload the senses with more than enough  stimuli to notice.The experience is set in 16th-century Japan, a fantastical era in which  warlords clash for control of the country. As the samurai Samanosuke,  players volunteer to rescue the kidnapped princess Yuki. No surprise  that the ultimate goal (and the entire story line, for that matter)  falls by the wayside as hordes of demons converge on the player hour  after hour. The weapons system benefits from the flashy graphics--as  players discover and add gems to a gauntlet, weapon upgrades increase  firepower with increasingly dramatic effects.Graphically, the game is stunning. Carving through the levels--forests,  tunnels, and the requisite dark, dank castle environment--isn't  anything less than a spectacular experience, thanks much in part to the  game's unusually high production values. Character models are built  from up to 10,000 polygons each--high detail, even for a PS2 game.  Subtle environmental effects--the wind flowing through the trees, for  instance, ripples the fabric in characters' clothes--furthers the  game's realism. The game's backgrounds are painstakingly detailed and  nicely enhanced by dynamic lighting effects.The talent behind the aural effects is just as impressive. Japanese  actor Takeshi Kaneshiro lent his voice to the main character, and a  200-piece orchestra delivers a dramatic score.Call over any PS2 skeptics in your neighborhood, then load upOnimusha: Warlords.

But, when you set down the controller after beating the final boss, you'd have thought you went through at least 10(most likely because you'll be playing it on and off). There's just so much story packed into those 5 hours.Another great quality is the graphics. Most of the time, you'll see a pre-rendered backdrop behind your character, something not too unusual if you've played alot of PC games in the 90's. It also leads you to pressing X to go up ladders, stairs, or opening anything interactive-fading to black, then reappearing with the object affected appropriately. Aside from that, later on in the game, backgrounds begin to move in a strangely beautiful animation, such as in the Dark Realm or out on a lake at night with a moon reflecting in the water. But what makes it beautiful is that it actually seems to be moving dynamically, rahter than some obvious loop. So it's not as painful as you think it is to not have the background move with the character. In most games, alot of developers screw that part up anyway.One final note on the graphics is that with Playstation 2's new engine, the character model looks almost exactly as detailed as a model in an FMV. And indeed, the game doesn't seem to find much use for an FMV transition, as the models look realistic anyhow.So, now that I've sold you on the graphics, let's talk gameplay. I felt that this was the only obvious feature that I had trouble with. Basically, you don't even need a Dual-Shock controller to play this game. It's all done with arrows, buttons, and the L R buttons for blocking and such. Well, that's not too bad. Except that left and right turns you left and right, while forward and backward makes you go, well, forward and backward. So, it's something to get used to, especially in battle. After playing the game for a few minutes, you get the feel for things.And finally, difficulty. This game can be one sick little monkey as you get farther in the game. The whole game runs off of the Resident Evil engine, which makes health and ammo hard to recover. You'll have to stick it out by using alot of your blocking and dodging skills, not to mention making the right attack at the right time. So, I guess it's good in that there is some skill required to beat it. But some bosses, and even just getting from place to place can be difficult without getting sliced or shot with arrows.I give this game 4 out 5 because it's everything I wanted in a good, involving story(as well as some side plots by reading pieces of a journal that you have to collect as you play), a steady theme, an excellent soundtrack, and a perfect legacy for the other sequels. It's not my favorite game, so it doesn't get a 5, but it's definitely something to look back on.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00005V6BB","description":"Medal of Honor: Frontlinemarks the debut of the Medal of Honor franchise on the PlayStation2. InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Great in the day, didn't age well","reviewText":"The Good: High production values, solid action, great sound effects, good animations, varied enemies and levelsThe Bad: No multiplayer, lots of slowdown, aiming sucks, the controls are bad, no checkpoints makes the game very difficultThis was one of the first games that blew me away when I was a kid and made me proud to own a PS2. The opening D-Day scene took my breath away, all the explosions, the scripted scenes, the death animations, the sound, it was all here and the productions values were through the roof. Looking back at it 11 years later throwing an egg on the floor is more excited than watching this game. While I can't compare it to games that came after it, even back then there were issues with the game, and they just really stick out now.Frontline's realism dropped off after the opening level. After D-Day you get recruited to do special missions across Europe and are a one-man-army. It's very unrealistic when you're running around by yourself killing squads that an entire army takes to take down. You're blowing up fuel depots, sabotaging equipment, assassinating important Nazi figure heads and various other things. The game is solid, the scripting is still nice today, but the shooting mechanics and controls suck. There's no aiming down the sights, instead you just zoom in. Shooting from the hip has no reticle so this is useless. My biggest issue with the game, and even back then, was that it is insanely difficult and there are no checkpoints. If you die you restart the entire level which can be infuriating.You have to be careful and run around finding health packs and ammo. You can pick up enemies weapons and instead are stuck with what you are given at the start unless you find a placed weapon. I did like the variety of enemies such as fat chef's throwing knives at you, engineers, cooks, butlers, and even enemies in robes. The death animations are still nice, but where's the damn blood?! The game almost comes off as campy because it is so far from capturing the tragedy of WWII. Even back in the day I felt this way. The pacing of the levels is also off because some levels will be really long and tough while others are super short.I did find that the game had some fun cheat codes, but there's no replay value. Multiplayer wasn't put into the PS2 version, and even the graphics are lacking. There's a lot of aliasing and the framerate drops tremendously during explosions. Everything does look clean and you can tell a lot of time and care was put into the game. I just can't get over how bad the aiming is, it's so squirrely and hard to get a bead on enemies. The game has a pretty decent length campaign and is worth the cheap price if you never played this game. Frontline was one of the best WWII games for a reason because it was one of the first to really have high production values.In the end, Frontline feels very dated, but you can see why the game was praised so much back in the day. The production values still show, but the PS2 can't keep up with the action. The aiming is terrible and controls are all wrong, but what can you expect from an 11 year old game?","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2013"}

If you haven't, I recommend buying Fallout 3 GOTY Edition before you buy New Vegas.  It's not that you'd have to play one to understand the other, but Fallout 3 is just a better game.  That said, if you enjoyed Fallout 3 and are looking for more, Fallout New Vegas will scratch that itch.The pros:  Fallout is a huge game that could easily take up 100+ hours of your time.  Like any good RPG, it is extremely flexable, letting the player choose how they wish to enjoy their stay in Vegas.  You can be good or evil, helping or destroying everyone and everything you meet.  You can sneek around all day stealing valuable items or you can accept every quest that comes your way or just hunt mutated animals around the Wasteland.  Everything you do nets you experience points that allow you to level up and increase stats that help you in the game.  The nice thing is the game doesn't get bogged down with stat building and grinding like some RPGs.  The focus is the gameplay, and you won't spend all your time in a menu.  Five degrees of difficulty ensure both newcomers and veterans alike will enjoy the game.The cons:  The game is almost exactly like Fallout 3, with a few minor exceptions.  Even most of the textures in the game are reused from Fallout 3.  The gameplay is good, but still isn't precise enough to be played like a FPS.  VATS (the in-game targeting system) is still necessary to pull off efficent kills.  Also, there are some game breaking glitches that will rear their ugly head.  Often reloading the previous save rectifies the problem, but it is still annoying.If you enjoyed Fallout 3, get this game.  Despite the software bugs, it is still worth your time and money and there is much fun to be had exploring the Wasteland.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2010"}

With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents.

In short, Mass Effect 2 is the most refined and presented action RPG I have personally played. The narrative is perfectly paced, guiding the player through a well-realized world that isn't exactly an open ended sandbox, but certainly isn't restrictive or linear (you're free to complete the major missions/story points at your own pace while you pursue other content, and your decisions along the way will shape the story). The game play has been calibrated to remove almost all tedium associated with the RPG hybrid genre. Combat is real time and plays smooth as butter. The visuals, especially at 1080i or 1080p, are nothing short of spectacular. This is an incredible game, it might just end up being my favorite.Aspects that I enjoyed are preceded by a (+), things I disliked a (-).GAME PLAY(+) Bioware (the developer) has taken many of the elements common to the \"RPG hybrid\" genre (which they themselves have greatly forwarded over the years) and stream lined and calibrated the experience to better suit the action-oriented focus of the Mass Effect series. Itemization and character customization have been made less bulky, and yet magically remain robust and even more rewarding. Just as in their past games, there are still various vocations you can pursue (soldier, engineer, etc) and many ancillary skills to learn and improve. Each vocation feels wholly unique (though many abilities share similar animations), and there are no wasted skill points or useless abilities.(+) Combat is a blend of third person shooter (Gears of War) and tactical RPG (Dragon Age). Damage is area-sensitive (head shots hurt humanoids more than shooting them in the leg, etc), various damage types are strong against certain defenses, etc. It plays perfectly well and rewards the thinking player as well as the twitcher.(+) It feels like Bioware took a step back and acknowledged many of the tropes common to the genre, particularly the variety that lead to tedium, and provided replacements that integrate flawlessly into the game world. These refinements vastly improve the quality of the gaming experience. For example: the process of sorting through incoming information and managing your crew. In past games you had to laboriously check your messages after each mission, run from NPC to NPC trying to figure out if they were ready to offer new dialog, etc, etc. In real life, if you were the captain of a starship, you'd have people around to help manage these tasks for you - right? Secretaries, yeoman, that sort of thing. Well, that's precisely what you get in Mass Effect 2: within your command center is a NPC that audibly informs you whenever something demands your attention. For example, you might be jogging past the helm on your way to the lab when she mentions to you \"Captain, you have new messages\". Or \"Captain, Miranda would like to see you, she seemed upset\". When engaged in conversation she will offer advice and relay information regarding the crew and the ship - just like a real yeoman would. And though she was created to fill a niche, she feels doesn't come off as artificial: she's a NPC like all of the others, with a history and personality to explore (as well as a relationship, if you choose).There are many such refinements that make Mass Effect 2 such a joy to play. From combat to exploration, customization to character interaction, you can take every thing you hated about past games and throw them out the window. Well, almost - I'll get to that shortly.(+) You're always an active participant, even during the conversation and cut scene sequences. Not only are they complex and responsive, but there are points in the action where you can intervene with either a \"renegade\" option (typically more forceful actions) or \"paragon\" decision (the more traditional good guy action or response). These prompts to intervene happen in real time, and they can be ignored if you so choose. This transforms the task of merely listening to dialogue and selecting responses, or watching a villain monologue, into an actual engaging experience for the player. It pulls you in and makes you feel like you're a part of the game world, instead of merely someone navigating through a series of predetermined choices like in previous games.(+/-) Resource gathering. This will be a point of contention for many players. In your journeys through the universe, you will discover and/or learn about various technologies that you can research - such as weapon or armor upgrades, additions to your ship, new weapons and skills, etc. The currency for these research projects are elements - one of four, to be exact. You come across small amounts of these elements while you're conducting missions, but your main supply will come from scanning and probing planets. It works like this: while you're flying through space in your ship (The Normandy 2) you will enter various solar systems. You approach a planet, enter its orbit, engage scanners, and then move a radar over the surface of the planet with your mouse. A graph will alert you when a certain element is found, you launch a probe to obtain it, rinse and repeat.Many people will find this boring and tedious. I -kind of- do. However, I enjoy the aspect of exploration and this itch is scratched here: each planet is accompanied by a brief explanation and history, such as its scientific properties, geographical anomalies, the history of the civilizations that have inhabited it or how it plays into the mythology of some alien race. Being a science and history buff, this is a lot of fun for me at times. In addition, many planets will have side missions you can find by scanning them - they range from simple exploration to search and destroy and rescue. They're all unique, and take between 10-30 minutes to complete. If you don't visit and scan the planets, you miss out on these side missions.I gave it a mixed score because, well, it's the only repetitive task heaped upon the player during this otherwise perfectly stream lined game. But don't worry, it doesn't kill replayability: after you successfully finish the game, you'll be rewarded with 50k of each element each time you start a new game. The costs of research projects are also reduced. So even if you don't enjoy this aspect of the game, it is vastly alleviated during subsequent play throughs.STORY, PRESENTATION, AND SETTING(+) I mentioned that the pacing and narrative were exquisite. I'm going to go ahead and reemphasize that here. The story is so well told and presented that I could envision myself sitting back and watching someone else play it and still enjoy myself a great deal.(+) The cast of characters are truly memorable and interesting. It ranges from prosaic space marines, to sensational bio-engineered clones, ninja-like alien assassins striving for spiritual peace, and more. The voice acting for each and every character is the best I've heard in a video game.(+) The setting is kind of a mixed bag, though overall it's still amazing. Many locales are well realized exotically creative, and appeal to all of the players senses. There are plenty of planets and stations to explore and no two places look alike.(-) But, on the other hand, many mission areas feel artificial - in regards to their layout. They look great, and you can tell that a great attention to detail was employed during their creation, but many things are just kind of \"there\". Such as obstacles and walls that facilitate combat but otherwise have no practical use. That kind of thing. And many are noticeably and artificially linear.PERFORMANCE(+) I have a middling system (three year old video card, one year old middle-grade CPU).

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"OregonBay \" OregonBay - 1999 to 2014\"","summary":"Best game ever made","reviewText":"Where do I start?

After all, isn't the controller enough? Well apparently I didn't learn from my Xbox 360, which I own the remote for. Now it wasn't the cheapest thing around, but it's made by Sony and was cheaper than the Bestbuy knockoff they sold. Now I had read reviews claiming you couldn't turn the console on and off. Well that is false. The PS button works just like it does on the controller, as does the dashboard button on the 360 controller; holding it either turns on the console, or holding it while the console is on pulls up a menu asking if you want to turn off the system. There's the off/on button!! Now when you unbox the remote, which requires a knife, you'll need to pair it with the console. Go to settings, scroll down to accessories, and find the remote. It will prompt you to hold the 'enter' and 'start' buttons on the remote until the console recognizes the remote. Bottom line: Get this remote if you watch blu-rays, it's worth it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00149MEWI","reviewerName":"Michael J. Covino","summary":"Not the Silent Hill I remember","reviewText":"Homecoming is a good horror game, just not a good Silent Hill game. This little jewel does not stand out from the plethora of other horror titles like Resident Evil or The Suffering. In fact, in many places I felt like I was playing The Suffering instead of Silent Hill. It pains me to say, but there will never be another Silent Hill 1 or 2 again. I think the old school Silent Hill fans like me will just have to wait until some genius dreams up another physiological horror title that will be more powerful than the fear the original Silent Hills instilled in us.Rest assured, though, that this is in no way a bad game. With an American team building upon a Japanese horror concept, this game plays like a toned down version of The Suffering. You have extremely violent creatures coming after you in this game, and Alex Shepard, the man you control, to dispose of them acts just as violently. A simple combo system of three fast attacks and one slow strong attack is what you will be doing throughout the whole game. In addition to this easy system, you must dodge the attacks of your enemies, especially if they are bigger than you, until you are able to attack them from the side or from behind. I always thought that if the other Silent Hills were lacking something in their combat, it was this. I'm actually glad of it.Other than that, there is really nothing new about this game. Shepard's Glen, a town neighboring Silent Hill, is being swallowed up by fog and the streets are infested with creatures as the evil of Silent Hill spreads. An idea borrowed from Silent Hill 3 and The Room. Alex Shepard returns home to visit his family in Shepard's Glen to find only his mother in a catatonic state and his father and brother missing. The story that unravels as he searches for them in both Shepard's Glen and Silent Hill is rather disturbing. The other characters you meet, especially the four founders of Shepard's Glen, are completely insane, having all broken a sacred vow with certain demonic deities. Their actions and behavior remain completely inexplicable to the player probably up until you play through the game a second time and have a better idea of what's going on. This is good, since I don't like answers being spelled out for you. It's a good story, but it is not as emotional as in other Silent Hill games. You want to know what's going on, but you are not as intimately involved with the character as players were with James Sunderland or Harry.Atmosphere is important in a Silent Hill game and the lack of creativity as you explore this world is disappointing. Much like Origins, the world of Silent Hill just seems so bland. What I mean is that whenever you walked into a building in the first games, you saw many personal belongings of the people who once inhabited the town. Each apartment left behind the personality of the person who had lived there, the bar you had to walk through still had an unfinished game of cards on the table or empty beer bottles lying around. In this game, it's like the people just packed their things and left instead of mysteriously vanishing and what we explore is empty rooms. Boring, right? Even the prison cells of Silent Hill 2 had articles of its previous inhabitants lying around. Learning a little something about the lives of all these missing people in a town now overrun by monstrosities did not just have a haunting effect, but it brought the town to life and gave it a personality.I don't remember so many big open areas to explore in Silent Hill. Call me claustrophobic, but narrow alleyways and hallways creates a real sense of helplessness, having little space to run or move when you know something will be coming out of the darkness soon.And the flashlight in this game is so weak it's almost not worth having. I like to turn down the brightness of a horror game. So it's nice to have a flashlight that illuminates things nicely, whether it be a bed, a wall, the floor in front of you or that creature standing in the corner. That was a huge highlight in the first few games.Still, Homecoming delivers a worthy experience for anybody who is into the horror genre, especially at the beginning of the game that somebody at Team Silent did a good job with.I loved the music.And the alternate realities that Alex transverses through can be mind bending.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00005LOXE","description":"The two classic RPGs in this compilation not only represent hours upon hours of story, character, and action, they also present the background for two recent bestselling, critically hailed games:Final Fantasy IXandChrono Cross.With all the different names for the original 1991 release of the first title in this compilation (Final Fantasy IVin Japan,Final Fantasy IIin the U.S.), role-players new to the game may get confused. Make no mistake, though:Final Fantasy Chroniclesmarks the first time this pivotal installment of the cherished game series has ever been available on the PlayStation. InFinal Fantasy IV, players take on the role of Cecil, a loyal captain who questions the orders of his king, and for it is sent to slay a mysterious beast in a nearby valley.InChrono Trigger, Chrono must follow princess Marle's teleportation through time and locate her before an intergalactic parasite arrives to destroy the world. The original game, also on the PlayStation for the first time, was one of the first nonlinear role-playing games. The decisions that players make during the game will point them toward one of more than a dozen possible endings.These new versions retain the authentic Japanese SNES stories and characters while updating their graphics and adding new full-motion video sequences and other features.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"2 classic games, one package","reviewText":"Games that were released in the Super NES' heyday have been often named some of the best games ever released. Despite dated graphics, not-as-deep storylines or interaction-heavy gameplay, people still hold these games in huge regard and not just for nostalgia value. While personally I would've put Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger in one package, we still get Final Fantasy IV instead so it doesn't really matter. I'll do each game separately.Chrono TriggerStory: Crono is attending the Millennium Fair in Leene Square. He encounters a young girl named Marle who has a strange pendant and she tags along. While trying out Crono's scientist friend Lucca's new invention, Marle gets sent to the year 600 A.D. Crono goes after her and soon uncovers a future that is destructive to say the least.Graphics: Probably the best looking of the games on this package. Sprites are well-detailed, graphics are colorful and there's a certain charm among many of the different time periods. But the overworld graphics look genuinely ugly.Sound/Music: No VA but the music by Yasonuri Mitsuda is outstanding as always. The music tends to range from eerie atmospheric music to upbeat ones and even rock. My one complaint is that at times there's sections where a piece of music would be perfect for an event but then you get in a battle and that upbeat theme kills the mood.Gameplay: CT introduced many types of ideas including the New Game+ where you can replay the game and get a different ending depending on when in the game you beat it. Also characters get special skills in battle which you can combine with other members to create more powerful spells. Frog and Crono can combine to create a swordsman skill but combine Crono and Lucca and he can use Fire-based sword attacks and so on.Final Fantasy IVStory: You are Cecil of the Red Knights and are ordered to do some rather morally questionable things which gets him kicked out. He finds out that Golbez is plotting to steal the world's crystals and throw the world into chaos so it's up to you and a diverse group to save the world.Graphics: Let's face it, these graphics now look iffy. While a lot of people can manage playing a game with visuals like these, you still look at it and notice how far along things have gotten.Sound/Music: No VA but Final Fantasy IV is often regarded as Nobuo Uematsu's first genuine sonic masterpiece. Me? I think he started hitting his stride with VI. Don't get me wrong, IV has a lovely soundtrack but I find myself listening to VI and up's soundtracks more.Gameplay: Like games such as IX or VI, IV has distinct job classes, offering party members with specific skills. You have Cecil with his dark attacks, Kain with dragoon jumps, summoners, monks and bards. Other than that it's fairly straightforward and familiar from levelling up to item hunting and whatnot so there's nothing new but then again IV made a lot of things new so go figure.My one complaint out of the entire package is that CT has some annoying slowdown where there's a fair amount of delay going into battle and your menus but then again it has some nifty anime cutscenes as well as IV's FMV's so all in all, it's a good package for RPG fans.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00B59L9T6","description":"The fear that was originally brought to players in Resident Evil Revelations on the Nintendo 3DS system returns redefined for home consoles complete with high quality HD visuals, enhanced lighting effects and an immersive sound experience. Furthermore, the home console version will deliver additional content including a terrifying new enemy, extra difficulty mode and improvements to Raid Mode such as new weapons, skill sets and the opportunity to play as Hunk and other characters from the series. Raid Mode, which was first introduced to the series in the original version of Resident Evil Revelations, sees gamers play online in co-op mode or alone in single player taking on the hordes of enemies across a variety of missions whilst leveling up characters and earning weapon upgrades. The critically acclaimed survival horror title takes players back to the events that took place between Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5, revealing the truth about the T-Abyss virus. Resident Evil Revelations features series favorites Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield, plus their respective BSAA partners - Parker Luciani and Jessica Sherawat.  The action begins on board a supposedly abandoned cruise ship, the 'Queen Zenobia', where horrors lurk around every corner before players head for the mainland and the devastated city of Terragrigia. With limited ammo and weapons available, the race is on to survive the horror of Resident Evil Revelations.","reviewerName":"C. H. Mauricio","summary":"Never booked a cruise on the SS Queen Zenobia? Now's your chance!","reviewText":"Originally released on the Nintendo 3DS back in early 2012, Resident Evil Revelations was the first main cannon Resident Evil title released on a portable platform. The title would remain exclusive for almost a year and half until Capcom ported the game over to consoles and the PC. Porting a portable game to a full screen HD set? What is Capcom thinking??? How does RE Revelations hold up on the HD consoles?Revelations tells the story of how the BSAA organization from RE5 was set up. Told through a 12 episode sequence, some told in different order, the game's bite sized chunks was perfect for portable play.I played the PS3 version of this game and not much has changed from the original. The biggest, most obvious change was the resolution upscaled to 720p. It looks okay for the most part. Character models look decent; Jill's butt is still there. But the environments look like it was a game blown up from the small screen to a big screen. You'll notice blocky objects from door knobs to candelabras that lack detail.The 3D effect so pronounced on the original version is gone. Not even the PS3 supports this option for those of us with the novel sets that can handle it.The highly addictive Raid Mode returns with all the thrills of killing and looting for upgraded weapons. This time, with support for the RE.net web service, you can receive or send game items to your virtual friends and compare your stats against other RE Revelations players worldwide.Not much is changed for this version. You do have new costumes for Raid Mode. A new monster introduced that can kill you in one hit. And a few of the items have been rearranged in the main campaign.Revelations on the HD consoles was meant to widen the players who've never tried the original and I can see why Capcom did such a limited job with it. I don't really recommend this to any original players unless they want to get more trophies or achievements on to their game accounts. Those coming to this game expecting a return to form of classic Resident Evil gameplay will be sorely disappointed with Revelations. It's still action packed, incredibly ridiculous, and is far from scary. You do backtrack like crazy which an aspect is found in the classic games. But that's it. You'll never feel the need to conserve ammunition once you know where to look.For those that never booked a cruise in to the SS Queen Zenobia, now's the opurtunity to board ship and experience a different and fresh chapter of Resident Evil once exclusive to the Nintendo 3DS.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00004U5VF","description":"The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.--Jeff Gerstmann--Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

I went to play Tekken Tag and saw that the graphics are basically just as good.The game rules. Tons of different characters. Tons of different moves. The most important thing is, this game is fun. I've spent hours trying to master all the characters and I never get bored. On a plus note, there is a &quot;tag team&quot; system. You tag in your partner whenever you want. Now there is even a cooperative (selected from the vs. menu) in which you and a buddy can fight trhough the single player game. There are also some tag combinations with people like Jin and Jun. These aren't used by many, but you can grapple an opponent and have your partner run in after you are done and do another grapple which looks really cool.The awesome story is still there. Problems? It doesn't fit into any Tekken game. It does bring back every character from 1, 2, and 3. With the exception of Forest Law or Marhsall Law, I forget which. It also leaves out the dinosaur, and Dr. B who I never got in tekken 3. The new character is Unknown. She is pretty fun.After it is all said and done, this game is the best tekken in my opinion.

{"product_name":"B000BXKA38","reviewerName":"Sir Edmund Hillary \"Tenzing Norgay\"","summary":"EPIC!","reviewText":"This is one of the greatest video game titles of all time. This is only one person's point of view, but the only games that are on par with the production values of this title are GTA: San Andreas, God of War, and Ninja Gaiden Black for the XBOX.I played the orginal Snake Eater before this and was torn between both loving and hating the game and for only one reason: The adjustable 3rd person camera, or lack there of, was a horror that ruined the experience. Subsistence now brings the 3rd person fully adjustable camera into play, as others have mentioned, and changes gameplay entirely for the extreme better. Splinter Cell Chaos Theory (SC:CT) was an incredible achievement in gameplay and was always one step ahead of Metal Gear for this reason as well as on-line play. Subsistence is now truly the king of stealth in every way possible. That says a lot because SC:CT is pretty awesome in its own right.Graphics - Simply put: Breathtaking. I was in constant amazement throughout the entire experience.  There is also virtually no frame speed loss; even on-line. These graphics are on par with Ninja Gaiden Black on XBOX, maybe even better in some areas. They are certainly comparable to SC:CT on XBOX. Again, that is saying a lot because XBOX is a more powerful platform.Gameplay/Control- As tight as, if not tighter than, SC:CT. There is a learning curve, but once you are over the curve, the controls fit like a glove. The game is a stealth game, and excels like no other in that genre. If you decide to take on enemies in head-on action sequences, the controls do faulter a little, especially in on-line play. I do agree with some concerns below about on-line. However, utilizing the Scorpion gun with lazer beam bead will help you blast live opponents away. I hardly ever play any on-line games getting my a$$ handed to me by 8 year olds in Halo 2. With Subsistence I didn't have too much trouble being competitive on-line. One thing that SC:CT does have over Subsistence is the ability to save at any point in the game. Subsistence has a weird transition/save point system that is decent, but can not compare to the \"save at any point\" functionality that SC:CT utilizes.Sound - Voice-acting was excellent, though cheesy at times. Weapon and environment sounds are life-like.Story - Again, only from one person's point of view, but to me, God of War had the all time best video game story. Subsistence comes in second. It was a great story with excellent visuals for cut-scenes. Some of it is a little cheesy, but the twists and turns learned at the end of the game were clever.Extras: The Dual Mode, Theater Mode, Secret Theater, Snake vs. Monkey, On-Line, and original MG1 & 2 games justifies this title being one of the greatest of all time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2006"}

It's almost mandatory for you to get this. They try to pitch that this is optional because you can use thePlayStation 3 Dualshock 3 Wireless Controllerbut it's uncomfortable and trying to maneuver it in a less frustrating spot is almost impossible. The best way I could come up with was to try and hold it up with the side of my leg. After a hour or so of gaming like this I immediately ran to the store and bought the Navigation Controller. First impressions was how well it's build. This controller feels and looks solid. The joystick doesn't have a track to fall in like how on the Wii's nunchuck. The joystick moves very smooth and has the same rubber on the top as the DS3. The controller comes in those plastic clam packaging, it does take time to open but you know it's very well protected. Nothing is really included with the controller. The only thing it comes with is the reference guide. I was hoping it came with a strap but it doesn't. You may think this controller has too many buttons but every button is needed. Thankfully, everything was well planned before release. I plugged it into my Mac to charge. It took about an hour to charge then I synced it with my PS3 just by plugging the USB wire into the PS3. The controller feels thick to me. It doesn't feel natural like how the move does. It takes some time to get use to the design and I'm still on the learning curve. I highly recommend this controller.

{"product_name":"B00005ME8S","description":"Originally released in 1998, the PC version ofHalf-Lifechanged  first-person shooters forever by proving that a compelling story can be told within  the genre. Prior to the game's release, first-person shooters were mindless  action games.Half-Life, while containing its fair share of action, also  contained plenty of exploration, puzzle, and story elements. Now released as a  PlayStation2 game,Half-Lifehas never looked or played better. This  version contains the outstanding single-player story mode, as well as a few new  ones. While the new additions aren't so great, the story mode is one of the best  escapades available on the PS2.The game follows the adventures of Gordon Freeman, a young research associate at  the Black Mesa Federal Research Facility. A typical day at the office goes  completely awry as numerous alien life forms invade the facility. The fate of  the facility, and quite possibly the world, is in the hands of an unlikely hero.The graphics here trump the original's (understandable, as more than three years  have passed). The character models have four times as many polygons, as well as  smoother textures and animations. The sound is also very good, with some of the  funniest voice acting yet heard in a game. Of course, the single-player gameplay  is excellent, thanks to some very well-developed enemy artificial intelligence.Unfortunately, the new modes aren't nearly as brilliant. Decay, the new  cooperative mode, seems like an afterthought and pales in comparison to the  cooperative modes inPerfect DarkandHalo. Deathmatches only  support two players, which is incredibly lame considering many PS2 first-person  shooters support four. Despite these flawed modes, the single-player story is so  superb that it totally warrants a purchase.--Raymond M.

{"product_name":"B000GPVUOY","reviewerName":"Morgan Cahall \"so many books so little time\"","summary":"A good idea strangled by control and pacing issues","reviewText":"Game Story:A cop with a past (Tequila) finds that a escalating gang war has connections to a family that he thought he lost forever. To save his wife and daughter he must cross the line from cop to viglante in a one man war that will take him from the back streets of china to a history musem in chicago to the walled mansion and manicured garden's of china's top gang lord.------(The following is based on my experience and since I'm reflex challenged the ratings should be taken in that context.)Graphics:B+Mostly realistic looking, some characters do look like they game out of the uncanny valley. The Slow motion effects are great as tequila bounces around the screen with slow mo bullets flying by his head. Also stuff does blow up real good and most of the eviroments are destructible.Controls:C / Camera:BThe character didn't always dodge that shotgun blast I wanted him to no matter how much I pulled the trigger or in other cases would dive in some random completley useless direction that gave me absolutley no aim and the enemies a nice targe practice dummy to fire on. The crouch and cover controls are a little dectection wonky in some spots as the character would seem to rather take about a hundred bullets than crouch behind the chest high wall that was in front of him. I didn't have much trouble in this game with the camera but in some places it did have issues usually when a enemy was shooting off screen and was difficult to find.Game Story/Progression/Difficulty:There wasn't much story to this game besides the back story that gives a reason for all the shooting and blowing up that goes on. About the same with the stages. Your there to put as many holes in the stage and anything that moves on the stage as you can and to do it as stylishly as possible. The one thing I will say about the difficulty is that it can be like shooting fish in a barrel one second and then the game will throw a few waves of \"special\" foes at you that require special skills or head shots to take out and these points are usually at the worst time (health low/ammo low) or in one case in a ball room where you have to keep a band alive so you can't shoot everthing that moves for fear of having to restart. Also I must mention the very annoying circle shoot that comes up ocassionaly. One it's annoying and breaks the flow of the game and two in the later ones I just stopped bothering to shoot and dodged until the game gave up and let me bounce off walls again. It was just to hard to dodge and try to shoot while being stuck in one place.Overall:This wasn't a bad game. If your looking for somthing that just lets you shoot anything that moves and makes pretty good use of slo-mo then this might be the game for you if you can look past its rough edges.If there is a sequel:Get rid of the annoying circles of death that introduce new stages/rooms. Instead use one of those usually annoying button sequences. In this case it could be used to control moves that would be to difficult for players to pull off normally and would really put the slo-mo acrobatics to good use. If the sequence was done right then it would put the player at an advantage (less enemies). If done wrong then the player would start off in a bad spot or be outgunned and have to fight his way out.m.a.c","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00170823O","reviewerName":"Son of Tiamat","summary":"It's like Gears of War with a jet-pack!...and a weird story...","reviewText":"So, I recently beat Dark Void, having wanted to try it for a while after seeing trailers of the guy in the game hijacking a UFO and getting in vertical fire-fights. Overall, this game didn't dissapoint...except for where story is concerned.To start, the shooting segments are Gears of War style. Behind the back camra, hiding, shooting from cover, the occasional melee attacks, you know the drill. What sets this apart are the transitions to flying.At first, you don't get your wings. This may be dissapointing to people who want to get right to the meat of the game. Getting the jet-pack requires a few hours of gaming. Once you get it you'll find the game is designed to smoothly trasition from 3rd-person shooter to airial dog-fight simulator. Once more, you can even hover around with your jet-pack and use your normal weapon for a kind of harriar mode of gameplay. This kinda reminds me of a Macross or Robotech game where there's three modes of fighting. You can zoom around at high-speed, shooting twin machine-guns mounted on your jet-pack and trasition to normal ground combat in a heart-beat. This blend of gameplay works very well...but maybe a little too well. If you're not careful, you can take off and crash into a wall (ouch!) or you could accidently land into a fray of bad guys with no cover, ready to get your junk handed to you.Overall, the game plays spectacularlly. However, there only six different guns to choose from (with upgrades available) and the game felt reletively short. When I beat the end boss, I didn't even know I was fighting the end boss and was dis-heartened when the game began the closing scenes. I blame this on the bland and bizzare story-telling which I will now get to.You play as Will, your typical cut and paste reluctant hero dragged into a big conflict. Along side you is Ava, the gutsy lady who can take care of herself and has more guts than most men (gee, haven't seen THAT before). As near as I can tell, it's either the 1930s or 40s. WWII is going on and you hear the Fascists are on the war path. I'm assuming they're talking about the Italians since Fascism and Nazism are two different species of Authoritarian government. You're on a cargo plane leaving Nassau when you enter (gasp!) the Bermuda Triangle! Your planes crashes in a strange jungle teeming with heavily armed alien robots which you must fight off.You get to a village. Entering, Will comments on the strange statues of reptilian lookin' beings. Ava comments that they are the Annunaki, ancient reptilian gods.Wait...what? Annunaki? The gods from Babylonian myth? Okay...that's a long way from the jungles of South America. And anyway, the Annunaki are not described as being reptilian, at least not in Wikipedia.You watch a few cut-scenes and are introduced to some new characters; and when I say introduced, I'm being generous because a lot of character introductions-and deaths-are treated like mere cliff-notes in the story. Soon, you enter the Void and are given the back-story. Long ago, reptilian gods came to earth and started civilzation through the enslavement of man. They gave man knowledge and man soon revolted and cast the reptilian beings into the Void, sealing them up. The plot is the reptiles have found a way back to earth and are sending in dopple-ganging agents who disguise themselves as important political leaders in order to control man-kind from behind the scenes.Okay, now this is just getting silly. Is one of the guys at Capcom just seriously into David Ike? Reptilian beings who transfrom into humans? They're secretly helping the Fascists and, by now, the story is looking pretty black and white with no sympathetic villians or sympathetic hereos for that matter. Ooooh! Fascists are evil! and so are the reptilian gods who want to enslave us but...who also gave us knowledge in the distant past, much like Romans who conquered, enslaved, but also spread art and culture and the Latin language throughout much of the world.Three-dimensional villains, what are those?Yeah, so the story is pretty unremarkable, save for the fact that it's so screwy. That whole Annunaki thing is bound to piss followers of Zecharia Sitchin who believe they are benevolent gods, as well as anyone who knows about ancient religions. And shape-shifting reptiles? Puh-lease!! Don't encourage the loonies who beleive that crap!Ignore the story and just enjoy the game for what it is.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2011"}

From the overly specific full synchronization mission objectives to the walk-between-cutscenes missions, the player is stripped of the sandbox style of play. The game forces you to play a predetermined style, which rids of the fun. In fact, the entire game plays out like you are more of a soldier than an Assassin.Connor is the least strong of the AC characters and I actually found him quite annoying. The game is rather shallow in that it does not delve at all into the Creed or Brotherhood, but only that it exists and is there to stop the Templars.The game lacks any polish. First, the game suffers from poor mechanics. Fluidity and consistency are the biggest problems. While there is the random ledge grabbing and haphazard horse controls, the combat is the biggest misstep. I use to love the combat, but in AC3 it is tiresome. The counters work like half the time. The gunplay ruins any flow. I died so many cheap deaths because of the odd mechanics. Second, there are more glitches in bugs in this game than in any other game I&#8217;ve played, which is sad for a blockbuster franchise like AC.Next, the extras do not tie into the game whatsoever. I completed the game without doing any extras. I did not find them fun and rather unnecessary unlike previous installments where I did everything. They were not explained well. Also, I did not see weapon upgrades or costume upgrades.Other serious complaints are the rather terrible fast-travel between zones, strange menu design, and the insanely long 4 hour tutorial at the beginning of the game.The Assassin&#8217;s Creed franchise is one of my favorites and AC2 is one of my favorite games of all time.

I wasn't totally thrilled about the campaign mode.  The multiplayer is pretty good but i like the modern warfare series better.  It just feels so different than MW2, MW3.. Even the first Black Ops felt different.  Perhaps not as \"realistic\"?  I don't know.  I prefer modern warfare's graphics.-The new class systems give you a lot of customizations on weapons.-The thing i don't really like is the new \"point streaks\" - doesn't feel as rewarding as MW.-Oh yeah, i had a lot problems with freezing and then crashing when i first got this game..

Every game has its own hardcore fan community that swears up and down their game is the best on the market.  So when I swear up and down that Mafia is one of the best games EVER on the PC, you probably don't believe me.  All I can say is it's your loss if you don't try this game.  Mafia is one of those games that people play years after its release and kick themselves for not picking it up earlier.  The game takes place in the days of abolition and Al Capone gangsters. The engine is a 3rd person shooter and while the game is action oriented, it has one heck of a story to go with it.  The game is historically authentic with the gamer being allowed to drive a variety of classic cars as well as wield classic weapons from the days of the 1920's gangsters.  There were a few missions in this game that I played at least five times just to enjoy them again.  If I could compare this game to anything on the market, it would be a vastly improved Grand Theft Auto 3. Mafia is about as close as you'll ever get to playing a role as a gangster fighting against the Untouchables and you'll never forget the story and the final conclusion of this classic.  If you own a console, Mafia is finally being brought to some of them but I recommend you try the PC version instead because obviously it's cheaper, but the graphics are fantastic with a good video card and the shooting mechanics are easier to control with a mouse and keyboard.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2004"}

I just wanted to put my opinion on it.I'd start off with the best of the two.  The Ballad of Gay Tony.  If you miss San Andreas, than again get the Gay one.  After playing both, Gay Tony's seems longer than the Lost and Damned, and the humor and entertainment of the game doesn't go stale.Lost and the Damned feels weak.  The only thing new are some weapons and cars.  Since you're in a biker club, you have to roam with them haft of the time.  A lot of follow the leader.  Mini-missions are stale.  Either race or go to war with other biker clubs.  Also the main vehicle you use is slow.Their are some good things about the episode.  The continution of the game main game.  The story sorts of interact with the main Niko missions, and you're more stable on the bikes than you did before.  And a tid-bit for me, in the beginning of each mission, your bike is there waiting.  I wish now that we can choose which vehicle could be available for us would be great.  This thing works for me.  Soundtrack has expanded, but talk radio only has one available.Gay Tony has a lot of things to do.  Manage Clubs or go clubbing that include dancing, drinking and then having sex.  Yeah the sex is back.  A new better batch of vehicles.  A lot more mini-missions.  A cage fighting style mini-mission.  An almost new pack of weapons.  Soundtrack has expanded with also a radio talk show.  During mission or mini-missions, you can leave one of your team mates and they will drive another car independently.  You can either do missions and mini drug missions or just live legit.  Oh yeah, A LOT MORE FUN THINGS TO DO:  Play golf(yes I said it).  It actually feels peaceful.  You can play air hockey, but I haven't gotten there yet.  Base-jumping... ah, but the only problem is that you have to purchase an item everytime you do a basejump activity.The only problem I do have with the game is that it is glitchy as well.  The GPS is screwy.  It will show you on path to the location and then change when you're near a bridge and subway tracks.  Also, sometimes items that you need to finish a mission is missing or located in out of reach areas.If you can purchase the DLC, you'll really need only one and the other can be purchased later or when the price is lowered.That's it for now.

The single-player uses the worse catchup A.I. I have ever seen in a racer. Couple this with the fact that you have to place first in order to progress and you end up with a game that is neither fun nor accessible, it's just frustrating. The issues don't end there though--even if you only want to play multi-player you will be frustrated by incredibly long load times. Sometimes the load is longer than the actual race! The developer promised to fix this but 2 months post release and not a single patch has been released for the game. Finally the cart handling is just too sensitive. You will find yourself frequently over-steering and bouncing into walls because of the controls. Eventually you may adjust to them but it still is not fun to drive in this game. This game could have been brilliant but the developer spent too much time focusing on the creation tools and not enough time on the core game-play.

I own a Gamecube, and giving in to all the hype, decided to give Resident Evil a try.  I can now see why everyone likes it.For people who beat it before, there is a lot of familiar territory. Many of the puzzles are the same, with similar ways of solving them. I never actually beat the first one, but I got pretty far, so getting to where I was was not difficult. To be honest, the first few areas of the game are the toughest, after that, it gets easier.The most noticeable improvement is in the graphics and sound. The mansion is very well detailed, and the music gives a constant feeling of dread throughout the game. The atmosphere is much more ominous on the Gamecube version. The candles cast ghostly flickers, the hollow sounds of your footsteps echo throughout the mansion, and perhaps most frightening of all, the zombies sound more life-like. Their moaning and chewing (on you) is all amplified to add to the realism. For those who think the Gamecube is a kiddie system, just look at the amount of glood and guts in this game and think again. The control is vastly improved, thanks to the design of the Gamecube's controller. It still takes a while to get used to, but the controller is more responsive than the Playstation's was. I found navigating the mansion to be easier. Also a vast improvement over the Playstation version is the load times, which are much faster on the Gamecube. For those who recall, the load times on the Playstation version could be excruciating.The only real flaw is the fact that I got stuck in several places. I am a very apt player, so it is not that the puzzles are too tough. I found myself backtracking to find items I overlooked. This is not only frustrating, but time consuming. While RE is easier than Silent Hill or Eternal Darkness, there is still that frustrating trial and error gameplay. This was the biggest problem with Resident Evil 2 for PSX, which had be looking around for hours for something I missed.I was very suprised with the Gamecube translation, which is miles ahead of any of the earlier Resident Evil games. And with the new ones on the way, and Eternal Darkness already here, the Gamecube is looking to be a good choice for Survival Horror fans. Once you play this version, you will not be able to go back to the original.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2002"}

{"product_name":"B0088MVPRY","description":"","summary":"Great fun for the entire extended family!","reviewText":"Never before have I seen a video game bring together so many people that I care about. I am used to my brother and I being the main gamers in the family, so I was shocked when not only he and I, but most of our family got into the game as much as we did, ranging in age from 7 to 62 years old. That right there is worth the admission price alone!The #1 complaint I see about Skylanders is the cost to collect all the figures. While it is true that collecting them all is costly, you absolutely do not have to buy them all. The only reason to purchase every single one is if you are a collector or a completionist. You are at no disadvantage completing the game with only one of each element. The only difference is a very slight damage increase for collecting all of a certain element which is barely noticeable. I really appreciated the fact that they didn't bring out 30+ all new characters for Giants. Instead they reproduced many of the old characters in new poses. There are only two \"new\" characters per element this time around. So parents, don't skip out on picking this up for your kiddos just because you don't want to be suckered into buying all the figures. One of each is all you need.Giants brings more of the same in regards to gameplay. It plays pretty much exactly the same way that Spyro's Adventure does. There are no graphical improvements of and kind and the interface is almost identical. This can be good or bad, depending on how you look at it. I personally enjoy it. My family loved playing through the first game and those of us who have to unlock every secret have gotten dozens of hours out of the original. So far Giants is proving to be just as enjoyable in that regard. One of the great things about this series is that it's easy enough for younger kids (my son is 7 and can do very well on his own) but is also extremely challenging for even the most seasoned gamer. You can change the challenge level which will drastically change your gameplay. Playing on easy is pretty much a face roll for most of the game, but you will need an experienced duo to clear the game on the highest difficulty. I also love the heroic challenges. They are insanely difficult but are rewarding by adding permanent stats to your characters.The graphics aren't ground breaking but they do look good and gameplay is smooth, responsive and highly enjoyable. There are a good variety of environments and every few levels you are introduced to a new area with a totally new theme. This helps to keep the game feeling fresh and exciting as you progress. The added adventure packs add new levels to the game so even if you've completed the game and have no interest in unlocking all the secret goodies, you can still come back to new experiences when adventure packs are released. The figure swapping seems to be the most exciting part of the game for the younger crowd. The huge number of secrets to unlock and the character progression via skill unlocks is most appealing to the middle crowd, and the simplicity of the game appeals to the oldest of our gamers.My only gripes about Skylanders are the lack of online play and the fact that the adventure packs are too short. For the price tag, you would except much more than 10-15 minutes of gameplay from a new adventure pack. You can kind of look at them as DLC and if I paid that much for DLC for a game like Skyrim, I'd get many hours out of that $20. Online play would revolutionize the series. Online PvP would keep the game fresh and entertaining for much longer than it currently is. Even online co-op would be fantastic. We know this wouldn't be difficult for Activision to accomplish, so I can only assume they are avoiding it because adding online play can invite non-family appropriate content to their games. However, they have had a lot of success with their free online version of the game which has no text chat at all. All responses are pre-written and selected from a list. There is absolutely no text input, ensuring it stays child friendly which I do appreciate. Allowing parents to disable voice and text chat in an online version of Skylanders would be all that is needed.On a final note, just as with the previous game in the series, the 3DS version of the game is entirely different than the console version. Rather than being a dumbed down version of the original, which many handheld ports are, they went in a totally different direction and designed a game that's perfect for gaming on the go. The 3DS versions make a great companion to the console version because it allows you to continue leveling your characters while you're away from home. Your characters retain the experience gained between all platforms, which I think is fantastic. If all games of this nature had a portable counterpart, I'd be thrilled (and probably broke, too!) If you have a 3DS, there's no reason not to pick up both versions of the game. I haven't met a kiddo who doesn't love Skylanders and even so-called \"non gamers\" have a hard time disliking Skylanders. :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2013"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

Graphics are amazing. The only real complaint I have is that this game plays way too much like Gears of War, which I hated. The traditional rpg elements have been thrown to the wayside so this game is not nearly as challenging or fun as the first, but the detail in the story makes up for this. The story definitely starts off much slower compared to first one. I had to bite my lip for about the first few hours before things really started to pick, but from there on it was worth it.

My self i wasn't a big fan of oblivion so i was a little nervous on getting this game, but i am very happy i did. The graphics and detail are so much more improved, the combat is great as well. The thing that just blows me away is how big skyrim and how many different types of enemies there are. Theres always some new enemies whether its a giant crab or big foot, to a wizard to a walking tree. Also the customization is great. So many things to unlock with the skill tree, armour  ,weapons and much more. Also when you go to a town you can cut wood, work at a farm, get a house,ever get married.Some things that get annoying would be when your getting chased by a enemy and they are too fast and too strong to kill/run from they will kill you in like one shot. Im only a level 10 and its hard to kill giants and saber cats. Something else that is annoying is if you steal something from a shop or something from someone in a town the whole town will chase you and even after you leave if you come back they will try and kill you. That was super annoying when i took a horse from a imperial guard and he started chasing me, but the stupid thing is im a imperial guard as well, so i had to load another save since i couldn't go back to that town or they would kill me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2011"}

Just like Oblivion, 100+ hours will be invested easily.  I have the same issue with the map that I have for most games: I wish more developers would incorporate the Bioshock overhead directional arrow.  For areas that are multi-leveled with many rights and lefts, the 2D map isn't much help, and having to access it frequently while running around in circles cuts into fun-aliciousness, so having the overhead directional arrow when I want would save time and double the fun-aliciouness.Some of the bugs include the game freezing, either as part of certain quests or just for the fun of it, quests that can't be completed because the game doesn't recognize when you've done what you're supposed to do, and on and on.  Bethesda needs to give the rights to this and Fallout to another company that can actually handle massive open world games.  Bethesda just cannot release something that isn't loaded with bugs for some reason, and isn't capable of fixing bugs once discovered.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2012"}

And it blew both of them out of the water!Not as deep as NWN, yet the story engaged you enough to make it more than a hack'n'slash. Not as dark as DIABLO II, yet blood fever will take hold of you once in battle. A number of innovative ideas made DUNGEON SIEGE a unique experience: the cinematic perspective, the original characters (machine-gun shooting medieval robots!), the fighting-back pack-mule...At the same time, both the enemies' and your company members' AI is well above par.Graphically, this is a 4 year game yet it plays much smoother and it has further horizons than most cRPGs today. Even if, to any true cRPG fun, graphics is not everything (otherwise DAWN OF MAGIC would have been considered a great game), DUNGEON SIEGE is found wanting in nothing when it comes to graphics. Not until TITAN QUEST got released could any cRPG hold a candle to DUNGEON SIEGE! Tress and grass move as you pass by, water ripples as you step into it and wakes as you walk through it. Everything worn or wielded appears on the character; whereas, magic spells are not shabby at all.The game also sports a GREAT CAMERA PLACEMENT (zoom capable and totally customizable) and has one of the BEST SOUNDTRACKS - the theme music will stay with you as the appropriate theme for any epic battles in the future.Those of you who were (rightfully) disappointed with the truly bad and much shorter DUNGEON SIEGE 2 (I still cannot fathom how they managed to botch that one!), keep in mind that it has only skin-deep similarities to its predecessor.

The game is rated E-10+. My 4 and 7 year-olds are able to play the games but three in particular are for more mature children, those being Buttock-o-gram, Horse Jockey,  and Silhouet.Also a warning about the game Headbutts: This game could cause injury.  Please bend at the waist and rock or \"headbutt\" with your entire torso and not your neck.  Make sure your neck is always aligned with your torso and don't jar it.  It's still possible to play this safer way and win. No need to head butt and tweak your neck and injure yourself.While the menu is fairly user friendly to maneuver, it is often easier to use a control.  The \"hand\" version is very sensitive and with so much on the menu, it is easy to miss the option you are trying to choose.The directions are sometimes vague and that can be frustrating in some of the games.There is no \"exit\" to the party games once they are started. The party games have the potential to last for several hours.  An option to exit would be nice.The disc has 34 Quick Play games, 3 party games (one which utilizies the quick play games), there is an extra category that I haven't yet explored and then some additional features that I also didn't explore as of yet.The quick play games can accommodate 1-4 players (depending on the game).  The party games can accommodate up to 16 players.A brief rundown of the quick play games. I may have the names of the games a bit wrong. I was trying to jot down notes in between games and must have been really into the games as I couldn't read some of my handwriting.1. Hacked Off- Up to 2 players.  Think old time magic shows where the magician saws his assistant in half.  The rabbids are in a tower of blocks. The players work together to saw the block, then kick it out of the way.2.Udder Nonsense- Up to 3 players.  You are a cheerleader and must follow the moves of the cow mascot. Examples of the moves are the chicken and the madador. Fun types of movements.3.  Slapping Station- Up to 2 players.  The Rabbids are hangning out of train cars. You must slap them as they go by, reaching or squatting depending on where they are. If two players are slapping, they are instructed to switch sides.4. Crazy Sales- Up to 2 players.  You are a security guard in a mall. You must run and punch your way through a crowd of Rabbids.5. Rabbids in the Hole- 1 player. This one has several levels that can be unlocked.  Think old school Donkey Kong type of screen. You have  to maneuver 3 rabbids into a designated area by pressing buttons to make ramps and floors to get the beam you want them on.6.Flaming balls of fire- Up to 2 players.  Firestation. There is a fire pole on each side of a truck where two rabids are roasting marshmallows. The balls of flaming marshmallows get loose and the player must reach and squat to move their firefighter up and down the pole to deflect the fire. Much like old school Pong.  Very fun.7. Salmon Rush Day- Up to 2 players. Swim upstream like a salmon trying to hit some targets and avoid some obstacles. Full use of body in this one.8. Rabzilla-Up to 2 players.  The monster Rabizilla is throwing things.  A target appears in the spot you must reach for in order to keep the projectiles from hitting you.9. Life's A Beach-Up to 2 players. Crazy Rabids in diving masks are making their way toward you. You must pump and aim water at them before they reach you.10. Hot Dogs in Danger-Up to 2 players. You are in a hot dog suit and protecting a bunch of hot dogs.  You must block the rabids with your weiner suit and then shake them off so that you can block more.11.Pumped Up- Up to 2 players.  You are a body builder.  There is a picture of the pose you must stand in.  Do this and your muscles pump up.12. Rabbid -o-meter-1 player.  The Rabbid is in a car wash. The player must MAKE NOISE to get the rabbid to walk to the obstacles to hurt it.  Not a fan of the noise making.13. Snot Funny-1 player. I thought this one was hard. A rabbid sneezes. You must spin to  make a fake boogie fling to the rabbid.  I wasn't successful at this game at all.14. Tenderfoot Dance-Up to 2 players.  Players move around to avoid projectiles.15. Wack-a-Rabid-Up to 2 players. Stomp and kick the rabbids that appear from the ground.16.Sauce Wars-Up to 2 players. A rabbid makes a mess on the floor. Move your feet as if you were speed skating to clean up the mess.17. Guitar Zero- Up to 2 players. This game has levels/songs to unlock.  This is a family favorite.  Follow color coded notes to \"catch\" them on your guitar.18. Big Brother-Up to 4 players. Another faily favorite. You are standing behind 2 oblivious rabbids. You wiggle and dance. When it looks like they are going to turn around, you must run and hide. So much fun.19. Now You See Me-Up to 4 players. You are in a dark room. The rabids have a spotlight that they are shinging in the window. You must duck and jump to avoid being detected by the light.20. Inner Journey-Up to 4 players. You sit on the floor for this game. You lean forward to move through the body of a rabbid.  Some targets you want to hit, some you want to avoid.21. Silhouet-Up to 4 players. This is one of the games that is iffy for younger children.  You are in the shower, behind a curtain.  An image appears on the curtain. You and the other players must maneuover your bodies to form that image.  This is hard. The key isn't to fill the shadow but to point your body in the direction that the game wants you to. So, if you cheat, the shadow won't register. For example, one image was like a sumo wrestler squatting. I didn't necessarily fill the entire shadow but my feet and hands were in the right direction so I succeeded at that shape.22. Ninja Yoyo- Up to 2 players.I still don't know how to play this game. It is like a bungi jump.  I have yet to score points on this one.23. D.J. Sniper-Up to 2 players. Another game that I don't really know how to play yet. You are supposed to \"quick draw\" once the disc is thrown. Again, no clue how to actually play this one since I have yet to score points on it.24. Rabbid Skin. Up to 2 players. You have to dodge a target for 10 seconds.25. Bon Appetit. Up to 2 players. Move your body to clean/suck up a trail of spaghetti sauce.26. Buttock-o-gram. 1 player. This is another iffy game for young people. You face your rear to the Kinnect and must wiggle your booty in the same pattern that is shown on the game.27. Horse Jockey-Up to 2 players. This one you are on a pretend horse.  You have to kind of hump the horse to get it moving. This is the third game that is questionable for a younger audience.28. Run Rabbid Run-Up to 2 players. You have to run over 80 meters within a certain amount of time. You have to exaggerate your leg movements for it to read them.29. Rabbid-o-tron 1-Up to 2 players.

Then the images go away and you have to choose the correct answer.30. Rabbid-o-tron 2-Same as above but with a different type of question.31. Rabbid-o-tron 3- Same as above but with a different type of question.32. Rabbid-o-tron 4-Same as above but with a different type of question.33. Rabbid-o-tron 5-Same as above but with a different type of question.34. Pie face-Up to 2 players. Use your body to move around the pie tin to \"eat\" it.35. Scanner Surprise-Up to 2 players. Use your hands to clean off the xray film to see the silly xray.There are 3 party games, Forfeits, The Kitten, and Carrot Juice.  In the interest of getting this review posted quickly for hoiday shoppers, I am posting before having played The Kitten and  Carrot Juice. I will update my review once I know what those games entail.In Forfeits, up to 16 people can play.  You set up a character for each player. Kinnect takes a photo of the player and the voice can be recorded. The Xbox picks a random Quick play game and tells which two players will play.  The loser has loses points on their meter.  He/she then has to do a stunt like singing their least favorite song or do an Irish dance.  This is called a forfeit.  The other players get to vote on whether the forfeitted player does a good job. If they vote yes (by standing by a thumbs up image), the player doens't lose any additional points on their meter. If they vote no (by standing next to a thumbs down sign), the player loses additional points on their meter. The XBox then chooses another game and players.  Once a player's meter hits zero, they are out of the game. The final player with points on their meter wins.Overall, I love Rabbids.  I would buy it.  My kids enjoy the quick games.  They can easily play it for an hour and get in some exercise and burn off some energy.Like I mentioned above there were a few games that my husband objected to...which surprised me considering some of the game he plays. So, I do feel the need to deduct a star for that because the games are geared toward minors.Not to say these wouldn't be really funny party games for adults. Anyway, I do recommend this.It would be helpful if the game included an instruction bookelt and with cautions for the head butt game.  But, it's still worth the retail price for what is offered on the disc.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2011"}

Generally, it's a fantastic game, and a drastic improvement on the first game (and on other MMOs). The storylines are where the game really shines. I've played as two characters so far, and both are distinct and interesting, with their own storylines that are fully-fleshed out.The one area where Guild Wars 2 lags in on older/slower machines. I tested the game on a recent desktop (with pretty good gaming \"specs\") and an older desktop and laptop (both of which had so-so hardware and gaming \"specs\"). It performed very well on the recent desktop, but on the two older computers, it suffered a good amount of laggy-ness, choppiness in the graphics, etc, even with the settings turned all the way down, despite the fact that both computers were within the game's minimum requirements.Otherwise the game is fantastic, and by far my favorite MMO.

{"product_name":"B000087H7T","description":"Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

The things that I love most about it are the clamshell design, the backlighting(so you can see your games now) and the built-in lithium-ion battery(all you have to do is charge it up and you're ready to go). All these things combined make this one sleek system. One that will continue to dominate even when everyone else comes out with their handheld systems. Why? Lots of reasons. Like the fact that it's alot more affordable to get and the games for it don't cost you an arm and a leg(mostly in the $25 to $35 range depending on what games you get for it). Beyond that, there's a huge library of games for it as well as a huge back library of games(from the original GB up to the GBC). That said, I urge all those who's thought about getting one to get one. You'll be glad you did, trust me. It's more than just a handheld SuperNintendo system.

{"product_name":"B00GV4V8XC","description":"","reviewerName":"Bryan","summary":"Overrated rehash, but it's not terrible","reviewText":"I've been playing role playing games since Final Fantasy 1 was new, so I thought I'd give this game a go given the comparisons to the classics. Unfortunately, Bravely Default falls completely flat with its characters and story, and the battle system is nothing special.The game has a class system that is incredibly similar to the also overrated Final Fantasy V: you can choose to be any class you want on any character, and mix the skill sets from any two classes at a time. This gives the game a lot of strategy on the surface, but just like FFV, the class balance is terrible at times. Some classes have insanely overpowered skills, while others will have you wondering why they even exist at all. Take the merchant, for one. This class will help you earn more money, but its skills cost money to use. Why would you want to give up stats to take a class whose only benefit (more money) is counteracted by the fact that you need to spend all your money to get the benefit of his skills? It's just a class that you'd level up for the sake of having its passive skills, and then dumping for a \"real\" class. That's always the issue to me with games that have a class system. Why are so many classes not viable? Every class should be a legitimately good choice for a main specialization that you'll use through the game. That's simply not the case here. It does not feel like much effort was put into making every class a genuine contender. It's obvious that some classes merely exist because, well, why not? Might as well throw more into the game to give the illusion of choice, right?The battle system has a gimmick that is being touted as refreshing and unique and strategic. I'm not impressed with it. What it comes down to is that you have some control over when your characters take their turn. You can take a lot of turns all at once, but you will wait that many turns after to act again. It's not a new concept in a turn-based RPG to have some ability to control when your characters act in battle. With Bravely Default, you have so much control that it almost becomes a fault in the game. For example, obviously in almost any non-boss battle all you're going to do is use all your turns right away to kill everything in round 1, or kill as much as possible before the AI has a chance to act. For most of the game you can just put it on auto battle with that as your setting, and you'll be fine. The only time you need to change it up is on bosses where you might need to defend from a special attack on a given turn, or save turns on your healer so you can heal the right people when needed.All that being said, the above complaints are not meant to say that this is a bad game, just that it's not nearly as original or well designed as I would have hoped. It has high production values, good presentation, good sound, and a lot of great options. Overall it's definitely a competent RPG, and gives fans of old-school RPGs another game to mess around with using a formula that a lot of people still like.If the review ended here, I'd be giving the game at least 4 stars, but I have one more complaint that really bothers me enough that I considered dropping the score even more than I did: The characters and story in this game are really awful. I absolutely can't stand the narrative or the script. One of your main characters spends the entire game just making lewd comments about women, even as the other party members tell him to stop. He's not even the only one - there are at least two other instances where characters were portrayed as being extremely rude towards women. I realize this is supposed to be a joke, but in life, a joke stops being funny when it's making those around you uncomfortable. It's not that I'm offended or have no sense of humor. It's that I want a character to be more than just a series of pick up lines and rude commentary. The character is one-dimensional. Being lustful isn't just one aspect to him, it's virtually the only aspect. The fact that he ignores the pleas of the women to stop makes it uncomfortable.In the end, if you loved Final Fantasy V and games like it, you might love this game if you can ignore the terrible story and characters. You might even be not quite as annoyed as I was - I'm guessing most people weren't. Still, I thought it would be helpful to lend another voice to the large number of overwhelmingly positive reviews, because the game absolutely has flaws and is not for everyone.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00BI83EVU","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Looking to the Future, Stuck in the Past","reviewText":"As a critic, divorcing a product from the hype surrounding said product is exceedingly difficult, especially when it comes to video games. Giant publishers hype up their games to ridiculous amounts, rewarding preorders with extra content in order to generate more publicity, making grandiose claims about the features of their game, and showing off beautiful footage that isn't indicative of the final product. Some may argue, of course, that a game should be respected and admired for its own qualities, and not the qualities initially promised by the promotional materials. While I'm liable to agree, I feel that if a publisher promises certain things with their big titles, there's a certain obligation to deliver those things to the audience who is going to gamble sixty dollars (more if they purchase expensive collector's editions) to get a taste of those promised features. If the game is released and doesn't deliver the things promised, it should get called out for it, as publisher hubris in this industry needs to be kept in check.That's why &#34;Watch Dogs&#34; is, for all intents and purposes, a middle-of-the-road affair in my book. It shows initial promise, but the more one plays, the more one begins to feel like they are playing the same game they were six years ago when &#34;Grand Theft Auto IV&#34; hit the scene, albeit stripped of some integral features and with some neat twists thrown on top of it. This is not a revolutionary game by any stretch of the imagination, and reminds me of a time when the market was positively flooded with games attempting to ape Rockstar's success. The problem, then, is that several other open-world games have come along since then and improved the formula in drastic ways, making this game's fight an uphill battle as it tries and only partially succeeds to distinguish itself from the rest of the pack.The story doesn't do this struggle for identity any favors, as it is one of the most by-the-numbers and generic plots out there. It follows Aiden Pearce, who is a stereotypical stoic white dude out for revenge for his murdered niece. He's shunned by his sister for his efforts to protect herself and her son, but the game makes it pretty clear that we're supposed to support his endeavors and not question them too much. Even when, y'know, he associates with people who break into apartments and tie up the occupants just to use their living space as a temporary base, or feels no qualms about stealing invading people's personal privacy yet lectures other people about the evils of doing the exact same thing. Allegedly, the game is about finding out who ordered the hit on your family, and getting even with old allies who are now enemies, yet it meanders so much and changes in tone so often that it's hard to keep track of what you're doing, why you're doing it, and why you should even care.Further compounding this narrative problem is the extraordinarily boring cast. Aiden is essentially an unmasked Batman with less combat prowess and more gruff angst that's hard to really care much about. Clara is a walking, talking ripoff of Lisbeth Salander from &#34;The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,&#34; but stripped of any personality beyond &#34;punk rocker wet dream.&#34; The rest of the cast, what little there is, consists of unremarkable stereotypes and archetypes that don't do much to elevate the narrative beyond the uneven revenge yarn. And while it might not be the &#34;cool&#34; thing to talk about in a game review, I really hate the portrayal of black characters in this game, as they tend to be portrayed as thugs who speak in painfully stereotyped slang, a problem that spreads even to the NPCs. It's 2014, and such a lack of diversity in a cast feels dated at this point. Overall, this is a story that lacks consistency, bite, and a diverse cast of characters for people to connect to, and is downright embarrassing when looking at its contemporaries.Saving the day, then, is the gameplay, in some respects anyway. Sadly, the missions are mostly the same old song and dance we've seen in sandbox games time and time again. The first few hours of the game feel fresh and fun, sure, with a small arsenal of hacking tools at your disposal and a big world to explore. As things wear on after that, though, there starts to be a familiar feeling that's hard to shake. That is to say, the missions start slowly deteriorating into &#34;chase this guy,&#34; &#34;kill this guy,&#34; &#34;tail this guy,&#34; or &#34;take out this base,&#34; the same generic guff we've been slogging through since the earliest of GTA clones. This is hurt by a patently annoying checkpoint system that feels particularly unforgivable considering what else is available on the marketplace today. There were points where I actually uttered, &#34;I don't care,&#34; to myself repeatedly, then quit the game for a while to go play something else. The missions are generic, and generally speaking, there's very little proper explanation as to why you're doing them.Fortunately, the game is actually fun to control, and certain missions can be played differently depending on how you want to approach them. You can stealth through an enemy compound, killing no one and getting the information you need, then getting out. Or you can hack cameras, blow up steam valves, and take control of machinery to take out whole squads from afar. Of course, you can also just run in guns blazing and kill everything in sight. In more than a few missions, it's entirely up to you how you play the game, which is always a big plus in my book. That's why it hurts when the game forces obligatory shootouts or stealth sections, as it feels incredibly out of place with the rest of the game. While the controls are generally solid, especially the excellent driving mechanics, I can't help but feel gypped at not having more options when it comes to tackling them.The central gimmick, which is hacking, is a bit of mixed bag. While it's fun to raise bridges for quick getaways and to blow up grenades in enemy's pockets, these features are incredibly limited and generally useless when it comes to most missions. Yeah, you can make some cars chasing you crash, or take out two enemies sometimes with a well-timed explosion, but that doesn't mean more cars won't randomly appear beside you, or that you won't have to finish up that fight with an assault rifle. It doesn't help that the rest of the hacking is relegated to minigames that feel like a low-rent mixture of the hacking mechanics from &#34;Deus Ex: Human Revolution&#34; and &#34;Bioshock.&#34; For a game based around hacking, there's a real lack of substantial usage of that feature, and for the most part, it feels ancillary.&#34;Watch Dogs&#34; has gameplay that works, but that's just it. It only works. It doesn't do anything special, or bring many new things outside of hacking to the table. It simply works, which is more than I can say for a lot of games, but a far cry from innovative. Also, it should be noted that the shooting mechanics are really barebones and obnoxious. Aiming your weapon feels sluggish and lacks any sort of real weight. Furthermore, there are no options for blindfiring or shooting from the hip, or drive-by shooting for that matter, which is pretty inexcusable for a game made in 2014 with an emphasis on cover-based shooting. So, yes, this gameplay works, but only just.This whole review sounds like I'm ragging on &#34;Watch Dogs,&#34; and in some aspects, I really am. For something is purporting to be the next big thing, it sure feels like a lot of other &#34;big things&#34; that have been executed in a far superior fashion. Yet this isn't to say that Ubisoft's GTA-like is bad. There's a lot of fun to be had here if the flaws can be overlooked, thanks to a large, varied world and some really great vehicle controls, not to mention a healthy amount of side-activities and some decent multiplayer. And the story, for all of its tropes and lame characterization, is made entertaining by snappy dialogue, pretty cinematics and a frankly amazing original score that helps offset the embarrassingly paltry soundtrack. As far as GTA clones go, this is one of the least offensive ones, and while it doesn't approach the heights set by competitors, it's still a good deal of fun. Unoriginal fun, sure, but fun nonetheless. It's a polished, slick game that sets out what it's trying to accomplish. Problem is, what it's trying to accomplish has been done before and done better.So, to the chagrin of eager GameStop employees who have tried to convince me that this will be the be all, end-all &#34;next gen&#34; game, I have to say &#34;Watch Dogs&#34; is pretty ordinary by most accounts. I've played this game when it was called &#34;Grand Theft Auto,&#34; &#34;Saints Row,&#34; and &#34;Sleeping Dogs,&#34; and I enjoyed it those times, because each entry offered something different and unique. But what &#34;Watch_Dogs&#34; brings to the table isn't very special, in my opinion. It makes up for this lack of originality with a wealth of content, though, and a world that feels very much alive and populated, especially with the funny NPC dialogue and ability to read anybody's identity at any time. Maybe the graphics aren't the best, and maybe the gameplay is derivative, but at least &#34;Watch Dogs&#34; is a fun, inoffensive game with plenty to do that should tide you over until some of the bigger releases of the year hit in the coming months.Score: 7.25 (Pretty Good)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2014"}

Sure, people complain and say that it is addictive like it's heroin or something but that just means it's a good game.  If it sucked no one would play it unless they really did stick drugs in the game.  It's not Blizzard's fault if you have no self restraint and can't say no to a video game and let it ruin your life.  If you set aside time to do other things then you won't become a shut in that plays this game constantly with no life.  Still, people are right to say this game is addictive but really there are worse addictions to have.  If I had kids I would rather they played this game and maybe make a few friends online (granted, that's asking a lot) than go out and smoke crack or something.That being said all the good gear requires you spend hours upon hours of play time to acquire.  Although I can't say I like this I think it makes sense.  Otherwise when you logged in everyone and their grandma (well, maybe not their grandma) would have fancy elite epic gear.  That would just suck.  You gotta pay the time to get the results.  If you don't like it play a less tedious game.  So in summary, if you have a life you'll probably never get the best gear but you don't have to have the best gear to play the game and have fun.  You can always PVP, explore undiscovered territory (there are a few easter eggs to be found in this game) and other activitiesNow let's deal with some of my complaints, first off, in regards to equipment once you start playing you will quickly learn that the auction house is the place to get good equipment.  I remember fondly, sort of, the days I actually saved up money to buy stuff from the various item vendors only to see that the stuff on the auction house was much, much better and also in many ways cheaper.  I'm not sure why they even have weapon vendors in this game, no one buys from them except people who don't know any better.  I'd like to see vendors at least sell decent gear.  Anyway, the auction house is key but people sell stuff on the auction house for way more than it's actually worth.  The good stuff anyway.  The only way to afford it is to buy gold off the internet or get higherlevel characters to buy said items for you.  If you have a higher level character buy an item with his accumulated wealth and send it to a lower level character that you play that is what is known as 'twinking'.  Basically, what it means is that first time players will have a hard time competing with people who have played for a while.  They can never afford the best gear.  Once you start to get towards the higher levels it gets better but there will always be some item on the AH you can't get.  The cloudkeeper legplates and the skullflame shield are two examples.Although leveling your charcter and questing is fun during the early levels once you hit the level limit it becomes a lot harder to just hit up a dungeon and get some nice loot you can work all the lower level dungeons with \"pick up groups\" which means you hook up with random people for a specific goal.  Well, try finding 39 other people to go with you somewhere.  Um, it ain't happening.  I'm not even sure why the designers thought a 40 man dungeon would be fun.  Way too many egos and personalities to mangage.  Furthermore, IMO having 40 people in a group takes a bit away from the whole sort of intimacy that you usually associate with sword and sorcery dungeon crawl games.  I've never read a fantasy novel or seen a movie where \"forty heros rose up to slay the mighty dragon whatever it's called\"  Frodo didn't need 40 people to destroy the one ring, sheesh.  It's hard to feel tough even once you hit the level cap because there will always be someone tougher than you, never mind the almost godlike npcs you interact with on a regular basis.  I always find it funny when an npc gives you a quest to kill some lame thing and usually my response is \"why don't you friggin' do it?  You're a level 63 elite with ten times more hit points and better gear than me.\"  Arrgh, my Morrowind charcter was an unkillable machine, my charcter in this game gets owned by random blacksmith's in alterac valley.  Granted, I'm sure this a problem with all MMORPGS but as I mentioned before this is the only one I've played.Getting back to pick up groups even if you mangage to get a group together then you probably won't do well since 40 man dungeons are very hard.  You can't just 'wing it'. Every boss fight is very tough and requires knowledge of the boss and in many cases third party software, the acquiring of which is almost a prerequisite.  This leads to an experience that can be summed up as...not fun.  IMO of course.  Thus comes the need to be in a good guild with people that have run the hard runs and know what they are doing.  But all the really good guilds are hard to get into.(Or so I've heard, I don't obsess like some people about belonging to an elite guild since I don't need to have the best gear in the game to have fun) I've heard about how people have to fill out applications to join guilds.  Sheesh.  I don't filling out applications when it's required to have a job and not be broke why would I want to do it in a friggin' game.  That means if you don't belong to a top guild you will either have to find ways to entertain yourself that don't involve raiding dungeons with large masses of people or make a new charcter so you can have your level 60 spoil him with gold (been there done that) This makes getting the best gear hard.  True, as I noted earlier you don't want everyone in the game to have the best gear and make it less special but still, if you don't have a good guild backing you it doesn't matter how much you play or how bad you want it you ain't gettin' it.Your only option in this case is to enter the PVP system where you fight other players for honor and hope to advance in the ranks.  Once you reach a very high rank you get rewarded with good gear.  Although, as other reviews pointed out it isn't quite as good as 40 man loot but if that's your only option... It takes long hours spent farming honor.  I know I've done my time.  I was ranking up fairly smoothly until I hit rank 9 and then the proverbial door got slammed in my face.  Oh, well, once again if you really want something bad enough you'll put in the time.  The only thing I don't like is that if you don't PVP for awhile your rank will go down.  This sucks, because it means once you start PVPing you have to keep going or you risk losing all your progress and starting from scratch.  This develops a very tedious grinding process that makes it more of a job than a fun game.  I heard they will be fixing that in the expansion though, which I am hopeful for as I'm tired of Alterac Valley.Anywho, although I've given a much longer list of cons than pros concerning this game I still have to say that I love it.  Every day I wake up and see the fugly face of my dwarf it makes me want to play.  I like hanging with my homies in the lower level dungeons and playing one of my many lower level characters.  Sure, I would like to have all the best gear in the game and am frustrated that I can't get in a Molten core run to save my life but I still have fun with this game.  Having real life friends play this game with you helps I guess.  Let me put it this way, if your playing this game just to get cool gear then you may or may not enjoy your gaming experience.  But if you can make friends or bring pals with you then the game becomes a lot more enjoyable.Have fun, and always remember, it's just a game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2006"}

It beats out the entire God of War Trilogy in scope, as well as Batman: Arkham Asylum and both Uncharted games.  Uncharted 2 can't even hold a candle to MGS4.The cinematics and cutscenes are literally breathtaking.  It's like you're both playing a video game and watching an Academy Award-winning movie all at the same time.  I'm actually very surprised that a single Blu-Ray disc could hold this much stuff on it (between the game itself and HOURS of cutscenes...it took me 20 hours to finish the whole game).  My favorite parts of the game were the battle between Raiden and Vamp, and then the final brutal battle between Liquid and Snake.  Just the best...those action sequences couldn't have been crafted any better.MGS4 showcases the sheer brilliance of the PS3 operating system, and I don't think any video game (both past and present) can come close.  Hideo Kojima has created his magnum opus, and frankly, he's got Shigeru Miyamoto of Nintendo, Inc. beat in every possible way.  For the price, your best bet is to pick this one up IMMEDIATELY.  Fortunately for me, I got the game from Amazon at $9.99 due to a ten-dollar promotion from a previous video game purchase.  How can you possibly go wrong?!?Also, don't forget to download the MGS Database DLC from the PlaystationNetwork.  It explains a lot of the background from previous Metal Gear titles.  Believe it or not, I never even played any of the former MG games.  I just started with MGS4, and to be honest, you don't even need to play the others to figure out what's going on in this game.  It would certainly help you to play the previous ones, however, since you would gain a greater appreciation for the frequent flashbacks littered throughout the cutscenes.  What I also noticed in the Database is that upon completing the game, there are certain sections in the \"Timeline\" section that remain blocked off.  Now normally, as you progress through the game, these sections would be filled in with new info.  That's not the case here, thereby leading me to suspect that there might be another Metal Gear title coming out in the future.  MGS4 is definitely not the last one, mark my words.Overall, MGS4 is a must-buy.  Get it now!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2010"}

I think its a pretty fun game. Its not game of the year but its still fun.  You still get to run through raccoon city and shot zombies.  The downsides i find with this game like in the other review on here was the firepower. It takes a lot to kill just one spec op guy even if your shooting him in the head.  I would think thats something to fix.  The other thing is the story line, its a decent but not much in depth.  I also agree with the AI sucks but not as bad as everyone makes it out to be.  Sometimes those guys save my butt so i cant really complain to much.  I think the review IGN was pretty harsh, i would have given it a 6.0 instead of 4.0.  Its not that bad.  The reason i'm giving it 5 stars on here because people are making it sound bad and its really not.  So if your expecting the same gameplay as the old resident evil games, then you will be dissappointed.  Its definately a shooter game.  Which is pretty cool but they should have hired a company that makes good shooter games like rainbow 6 vegas. If you are unsure to get this game i would atleast rent this game before you buy it, so your not wasting your money if you are disappointed.  But i really like it.

However the Nintendo 64 user would remember that the N64 controller was just a snazzy, maybe even more so. The XBOX controller is like a brick when compared to both. The PS2 delivered on a vibrating Dual Shock controller as standard with the unit. This controller feels great with the thumb pads / thumb sticks allowing for all sorts of movement. Suddenly in 2005, four years after the PS2 was released, games like Metal Gear Solid III: Snake Eater and God of War improve on this thumb pad function with the new mini-games feature. The controller has been given new life because of this.The big negative is the problem that Sony PS2 controllers are extremely poor quality. This controller, for all its design, will give you a dual shock. First of all you will be shocked at how suddenly they break. Drop it on the floor and you will easily damage the L1, L2 or R1, R2 wing buttons. Even if you don't drop it the wing buttons will usually break in less than a year if you enjoy gaming. The next shock is going through so many of these controllers because of this design flaw. Adding up the cost of each controller I could easily have bought myself another PS2 and then some more. The cord also has an uncanny ability to just wrap around itself and kink. I have never seen one that managed to remain straight. Also when a button breaks it tends to release little pieces into the controller so even if you don't need that button for the game the controller feels like it has sand rolling around inside of it.For all its handheld conditioning the controller is far from robust. I have used a very similar Logitech Cordless Rumblepad 2 for the PC that is the same design as the PS2 controller and that is a proper robust model. Just comparing the two side by side makes the PS2 controller look like it was developed in the USSR in the early 80s or something. The fact that Sony have done absolutely nothing to improve on the quality of their own generic PS2 controller is probably the reason why they have made so much money out of the PS2 unit. It is a way too expensive even if the controller was more robust. I hope Sony get it right with the PS3 next time. Make these controllers more robust please. The PS2 controller was always far from a quality device since its inception and is the only item that let the PS2 down badly.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00000K1VA","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"A thrill minute","reviewText":"This review is actually in reference to both the Dreamcast version and the Playstation version. For PS 1, RE 3 offers some of the best graphics available on the system, on DC the graphics are a sore disappointment as there were only minimal improvements, and while it does look better on the DC there are other enhancements that I would have implemented. This game had scared me when I rented it on the PS 1 so bad that I set it aside. It had got my heart racing, the whole running away and running for dear life... and me without a guidebook! Several years later I buy the DreamCast version just to complete the collection, and while waiting for the remake of RE 1 for my GCN I dust this game off and played through it, without a guidebook. This time I didn't get spooked at all. I was up pretty late that night I got scared anyway.RE 3: Nemesis focuses more so on action than anything else, and there is (thankfully) more than enough ammo and herbs to go around. I think that this is probably the easiest of the Resident Evil games, not saying that you won't encounter the \"You Died\" screen on occasion, but less often than in other installments. This is also the shortest game in the series. The voice acting is dramatically better than previous games, as well as the in game cut scenes a little more fleshed out. However the story is not as fleshed out as it should have been. The game does have some advantages. It is the first game to allow you to ascend and descend stairs without using the action button, and it was the only game of the series to have a functional dodge button, which was great. I also enjoyed the gunpowder mixing. All in all this game is a lot of fun, short, but sweet, and although it is not the pinnacle of the series it is a worthy sequel. Plus the DreamCast version has more than enough extras to keep a person busy for a while. Lie RE 2 this game is being ported to GCN with minimal improvements. I only wish that Capcom would consider a total remake of this game as well with more story elements. If future installments of RE are to keep the tank like movement than I hope that they will reincorporate the dodge button.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2002"}

Infinite does not disappoint. The atmosphere, story, visuals, voice acting, gun-play, were all superb. The AI was absolutely amazing, especially Elizabeth, who is one of the most memorable non-playable characters I have ever seen in a game. The only complaint I have is the variety of enemies; there were about 5 or 6 enemy types and no true 'bosses' which could have improved the battles.I highly recommend this to any gamer who enjoys a good story along with great action.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2013"}

With a protective clam shell design, it&#x2019;s perfect for easy access and storage at home or on the go.","reviewerName":"Christopher Engel","summary":"No-frills, bare-basics plastic case with a good shape","reviewText":"This is an absolutely bare-bones plastic case that does nothing but open and close, with slots for a couple of memory cards and eight games. It is literally nothing more than shaped plastic that at least feels sturdy enough not to break if you step on it by accident.It's great that it's slim, because it'll easily fit in your pocket. The slim-case design is convenient if you want to do that, making carrying it effortless. The unit itself is extremely small, only as large as it needs to be, considering that cartridges for the Vita might even be smaller than DS cartridges, and are certainly slimmer.Still, it's just nothing at all to look at. It's a mostly opaque off-gray plastic case. That's it. There isn't the slightest work done on aesthetics here. Considering the PSP UMD cases that at least had a big logo and a couple of colors on them with a solid-colored exterior and had at least *some* design sense to them, this is kind of lame. But if you simply don't care what it looks like and just want something ultra-cheap that probably took less than a quarter to manufacture that holds games, well, here you are. If you're the type that wants a little more in the design department, this definitely isn't for you, as the off-gray plastic isn't exactly pleasing to the eye in any form or fashion.You get what you pay for, I suppose. I'd gladly pay a few extra bucks for some color and a Vita logo, though.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2012"}

Armed with state-of-the-art technology, top-of-the-line-gadgets, deadly combat abilities and an elite team known as the 4th Echelon, Sam Fisher holds nothing back to get the job done through whatever means necessary to stop the Blacklist countdown before it reaches zero.

I've bought a few of these for my sons friends for their birthdays. My son is almost 12 and most of his friends are all the same age. Every month there's another birthday party for him to go to, but coming up with gift ideas is getting harder and harder. There are a few neat toys online that work for this age group, like the Syma S107/S107G R/C Helicopter, which makes a great gift and works for kids with all sorts of interests. But just about every one of my sons friends has one of these now, so I needed to come up with something else. Many of the boys have an xBox and are always coming over to play games together. They often ask if they can buy and download new games or game ad-on's. These points give them the ability to use the money for whatever they want on xBox Live, without the need for them to use a credit card number. It's a great idea for putting into a card as a gift, and is a little more personal than cash. It's like giving them a video game they want, only doing it in a way you don't have to worry if you're buying something they already have, something someone else is getting them too or something they won't like. This is a terrific gift idea for anyone with an xBox.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2012"}

One day, an assassin named Helter Skelter appears before Travis and the two face off in a battle. Travis emerges victorious and finds himself in the presence of Silvia Christel, a mysterious French woman who claims to be an agent with the UAA. Silvia gives Travis official rank of 11 in the organization. Now, it's up to you to become #1. No More Heroes takes place in the city of Santa Destroy, and you are free to explore the town to your liking, taking on missions large and small to collect money and purchase new weapons as you work up towards the 10 main killing contracts. Gameplay is all about using your Beam Katana (via Wii remote) to defeat enemies.","reviewerName":"James J. Schultz","summary":"Oozes Style and Baditude","reviewText":"I just got to the very end of No More Heroes and thought a review was in order.  In one word: fantastic.  I haven't had this much fun with a video game since I can't remember when.  Sure, there are technically better games, but I don't know of any that are as stylish and flashy without losing good gameplay.  It's just outright fun and cool.  A bit short, yeah, but I managed to stretch it out to over eighteen hours somehow.  (By struggling on bosses and buying more stuff than necessary.)Let me take on the various arguments against the game:\"The overworld is boring and the bike controls suck.\"The overwolrd is not meant to be like Grand Theft Auto.  It's just a map for you to traverse to get from one place to another.  It's not supposed to be fun, it's just there to link the main areas of the game.  It's also kind of a way of putting the boredom of the daily commute against the fantastical life of being an assassin.  But yeah, the bike does control badly, but if you don't go too fast or use the running dash in stead, it's not a problem.\"The story doesn't make any sense.\"You've never played Killer7 if you think NMH's story makes no sense.  The storyline doesn't make sense because at first it's not explained all of what's happening.  Seventy percent of the backstory comes in the last mission or so.  Then it all becomes clear.  Well not clear, but mostly understandable.\"The fighting controls are bad.\"Not really.  You tap A to do normal attacks and B to do a stunning kick or grapple and finish off opponenets with a flick of the Wii Remote.  You hold the Wii Remote up or down to switch between a high or low stance.  It's like any button-masher of old but more fun and intuitive, and those button-mashers weren't accused of having bad controls.The game goes at a somewhat linear fashion.  You slay your way through a boss's lair or general area, take him or her out, take his or her rank, go to the overworld, earn money through jobs and small-time killing gigs to pay for the next match, and repeat.  But the bosses themselves are spectacular.  They require precise timing and patience to beat.  You can't just rush in and swing your sword wildly.  You have to learn all their moves, take advantage of their recovery times, and be like the Samurai Travis wishes he was.  The bosses are also interesting and unique from a guy that dresses up as a technologically-powered super-hero to a revolver-toting stadium singer.  And some of the fights go completely against everything you expect from a standard boss battle.  I especially liked rank number 3.And the music and sound?  It goes perfectly with the type of game.  Electric instrumentals and driving beats line the halls as you slay your enemies and almost every boss battle track could be considered a favorite of mine.  Much of it is very similar to that type of music used in Killer7.Content-wise, this game's M-rated for a reason.  Characters drop the F-bomb on several occasions and there's blood and lots of it.  But the graphics are cell shaded and so unrealistic that the violence becomes almost whimsical and never really borders on the side of gory.  Honestly, the stuff you see in C.S.I. is worse.  And when every few enemies you dispatch yell \"My spleen!\" it's hard to take it very seriously.Overall, as I just said, this is a fantastic game.  Some may say it's not for them--that it's just not their kind of game, but it sure is my kind of game.  And maybe yours, too.  From the killer combat system to the plethora of memorable bosses, the sneaked-in 8-bit graphics to Travis's pet cat, I give No More Heroes a Frank Miller's Sin City out of Viewtiful Joe.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J5JW","description":"","reviewerName":"Mr.Chunky Monkey","summary":"Three Great Games With Some Technical Problems","reviewText":"Tomb Raider Trilogy for PS is a great bundle for a Tomb Raider fan. Although upon their initial release none of the three games received exceptionally high scores, all three are very proficient at what one might expect having played the classic Tomb Raider games. In each game Lara Croft goes to a variety of exotic locations where she is faced with organized crime and sometimes supernatural enemies. You learn a lot about Lara's background, childhood, and life story. Games take themselves more seriously than the original three games from the past generation. If you've played other games from Ubisoft where a character has to use their acrobatics to navigate walls, climb cliffs, and avoid insane danger, this feels like that. Something like Assassin's Creed would feel very similar. Another cool addition is that there are items scattered around and you may choose to collect them to unlock information and other extras for the game. Underwater diving and navigation has been improved and works great.Now you should about some potentially not so nice things about this three game bundle. While the first two games listed on the cover run well(720p only) The third one, Tomb Raider Underworld runs poorly. By poorly I mean the graphics are choppy and frame skipping occurs. As a result it makes movement and jumping less fluid and more jittery. That is not how most games are so I think it is a poorly finetuned port of the game from the PC, because on PC it runs smoothly.So I'd say its an excellent three game in one combo. It is really fun because you can see what the games leading to creation of modern high end games like Uncharted and Assassin's Creed were like. Trophies have been added as well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0000503MO","description":"The third title of the Gran Turismo series takes full advantage of the new PlayStation2 game engine, which is capable of rendering about 20 million polygons per second--roughly 10 times the number of total polygons of the series' previous installment,Gran Turismo 2. Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course. They don't drive perfectly, either; some will spin out and make other mistakes over the course of a race.","reviewerName":"M. A.

{"product_name":"B001G3B0HC","reviewerName":"D_Strasse \"D_Strasse\"","summary":"Not the KH you expected","reviewText":"First, like many reviewers have already stated, this is not the Kingdom Hearts you have experienced on the PS2.  If you expect somthing like those games, or forget to take into account that this game was originally released for the Gameboy Advance, you will constantly be shaking your head in a \"why did they do this\" kind of way.Some history, this game  - the remade PS2 version of the GBA game - was originally a bonus feature to a director's cut of Kingdom Hearts 2 released in Japan. (The Japanese market actually gets a lot of these.  I think that is because as JRPGs are usually released in Japan first and then tweaked for the NA market, they feel the need to go back and re-release the game in Japan with the tweaks and possibly some added features, who knows.)  Because of this I think it would be a bit much to expect the entire GBA game to be completely remade.That said, this game does sport some impressive production values, i.e. some actual voice acting by many of the original actors including Haley Joel Osment as Sora.  The use of the KH1 engine bring most visuals up to par as well.But this is where things can get confusing.  Many people will wonder \"why do I need to use these cards - wouldn't it just be easier to have the old control setup back????\"  Well the truth is, without the card battle system this game would be almost TOO simplistic.  This game is really a dungeon crawler with a veneer of strategy derived form the card system.  Gone is almost all the exploring and platforming bits from the first 2 games.  So without the card system to occupy a lot of your time, that is thinking about your deck, you would spend a LOT more time complaining about just how generic that individual rooms are.Which gets us to the dungeon crawling bit of the game.  Each \"world\" is a floor in Castle Oblivion and you complete the world by using a map card to \"generate\" a room.  The number of rooms and the general layout is constant but what is in the room is generated by the map cards.  Progress through the rooms to unlock the story elements.  Wash, rinse, repeat.What keeps this from getting repetitive and old is the strategy of the card system and the unlocking of the story bits.  The worlds themselves generally follow the same storyline as that of the first game, i.e. the Queen is still irratated with Alice and you need to help her, and so on.  The real meat of the story, which keeps you playing, is the bits that are revealed about Organization 13 and what happened between KH 1 and 2.Downsides?  Well, the camera is still pretty hectic though nowhere near as bad as KH1 if you don't lock onto the heartless.  I never did as locking on seemed to keep you targeted to a single enemy where you seem to attack the closest enemy without lock.  Not really a problem as most magic still hits without the manual lock and combos attack the same enemy as well.Breaking stuff in the room reveal goodies as well but the fact that these acquired goodies don't register for a couple of seconds after grabbing them can be very frustrating.  This is because battles aren't random per se, but engaged after you touch an enemy in the room.  The issue is that enemies appear or \"pop\" on screen when you get close.  This is only problematic of course you are waiting for that magic card you just snagged to register when a heartless appears nearby and bee-lines it for you, touching you before you collect the card.  The common Hearltess (those little black guys) are really fast making this happens more than it should and can be very aggrivating when it does.Still, nitpicks aside and understanding what you are purchasing can make this game a good experience.  The gameplay value is here lengthwise as well.3.5 stars.  Bump that up to 4 if you are very interested in knowing more of the KH storyline and have an affinity for a little strategic thinking with your dungeon crawlers.  3 stars if you don't fit the above description; fun but you won't be getting the most out of it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2009"}

The game features Dolby Digital sound, comprehensive voice acting, and a completely original soundtrack.","reviewerName":"Jobe","summary":"The Best RPG on PS2","reviewText":"I thought Dungeon's & Dragons was long dead, resting comfortably in a grave with a colourful wreath of the success in endured in the 80's. I had never heard of the Baldur's Gate numerous times for the PC, and the last game I played of Dungeon's & Dragons was all the way back with \"Slayer\" on the Panasonic 3DO. Simple game, 1st person navigating through basements and castles while fighting off hordes of ugly looking enemies like ogres and the infamous Gelatinous Cubes. And now, at least 8 years later comes Baldur's Gate for the Playstation 2, the same idea as Slayer, but a whole new world of action/RPG gaming.Baldur's Gate has enjoyed a successful run on the PC for the past few years, and just now has been transferred to the console masses, and PS2  is lucky enough to be first to receive it. However, instead of direct ports from already existing titles, Dark Alliance creates and entirely new gaming system for the PS2 version (About time). We've seen this type of game before no doubt, most recently Drakan and Dynasty Warriors 3, and even back as far as the original Gauntlet for that matter. Baldur's Gate is nothing more than a hack & slash at heart, but manages to become so much more than its blood vein genre has ever offered. Being this is the first PS2 title taken from a PC game that actually utilizes the full power of your Playstation system.Three playable characters are offered for your journey, the female elf who possesses great magic capabilities, the male human who is a master with arrows and the physical powerhouse male dwarf. All characters can be armed to the teeth with dozens of weapons from axes, swords, hammers and armour from leather to steel. Grab a friend to join you in the melee and I can guarantee you'll be [in] your chairs in no time. And it is very nice to finally play a 2-player game that doesn't use a split-screen method, but rather and overhead so both characters are displayed on screen at once which is a welcome for those with small TV screens. The 2-player mode is a fantastic breather from the typical deathmatch that's carelessly thrown into every game for a quick buck on replay value (Half-Life's PS2 is my prime example). Which could have been added into this no doubt, but thank god, it wasn't.The story is drawn straight from the classic blood vein of old school medieval adventures. Your arrival in Baldur's Gate is greeted by being beaten and robbed by a band of thieves who are currently at war with another guild of thieves in Baldur's Gate. And as you seek your revenge, the ploy of the war of thieves is a mere tip of the iceberg of events to come as an ancient evil threatens to burn Baldur's Gate to the ground. And your journey takes you to distant lands in mountains, swamps and your final destination a sinister tower that seemingly rises from the earth itself.Whether you draw big on story driven games or not, Baldur's Gate has to be commended for its astonishing voice actors and probably the best lip-sync ever created in gaming history. The battle system is simple button mashing but increases its life-span by intertwining dozens of hand weapons, bows, and magic spells to lay waste to enemies, not to mention many special items that can be claimed for the wide assortment of side-quest and for those who prefer to search every inch of the levels will find that their efforts will be rewarded. Armour also plays a huge part in Baldur's Gate not only actually improving characters defence (Unlike Drakan) but literally giving players a mind-boggling assortment of customization for their appearances. Elements such as fire and ice are attributed to swords and axes, for instance swords with ice have a great chance of freezing enemies then allowing them to be smashed to pieces with the following attack. I was amazed to see a hack & slash game be so incredibly addictive and enjoyable. It's even more fun if you play with a friend and the experience system will keep you playing for hours to master new techniques and gather the ultimate weapon arsenal. It's one of the few games that grows beyond its genre and creates a pedestal for all others to follow. Dark Alliance is a fantastic game and one I sincerely hope to see continue, a must have.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2002"}

Silent Hills always get ten stars, but I guess there could be a first time. The games are downright nerve bending. Play Silent Hill 1 on Playstation1/PSP/PS3 and the soundtrack alone will pound you down.OK! Update, Got by the first couple of chapters and this is definitely a different version of Silent Hill. First, the graphics are the best ever for SH, and the game play is also quite different. Control scheme is fairly good. Some of the other SH games were a little goofy with camera angles and movement at times. Back to the graphics for a second, the slicker this game looks, the less scary it is for me. We'll see how it goes. I find that I'm not squinting as much to find things. Which brings us to one of the tweaks in the menu, you can actually choose to highlight obtainable items. Without the highlighting effect you may waste a lot of time attempting to pick up non-grabbable objects. Nice feature, but I found I had to learn not to grab everything. You will still need to open drawer and cabinets for blind explorations without highlights. There has also been some games where I wish they hadn't highlighted interactive objects, and so you can choose to hunt and peck for everything. I know for a fact a couple of items I would have blown right by an item though and missed it if it wasn't highlighted. Try it out.The first level of monsters are the fastest in Silent Hill history. They will materialize and hit you fast. I guess that is the rage now. Faster monsters! Even Zombies or Walkers in movies and TV are running now.

I was worried that Portal 2 could not live up to the first game's groundbreaking gameplay. I'm pleased to report that if anything Portal 2 is even better than the first one!You pick up with Portal 2 many years after the initial Portal left off. You're the same person being woken up from stasis by a little floating robot. He is trying to save you, but soon enough you are back in the system, solving puzzles, using your portal gun to create in and out portals. Then it gets even more fun. There are new goo substances that let you do even more amazing things. I won't describe them all because half of the fun is discovering what they do and how to use them. Suffice it to say that it brings gameplay to a whole new level.The humor is simply spectacular. The subtle comments had me laughing out loud the entire way through. The main character is female and I have to wonder if them only really trigger in a female player's brain. I was playing with my boyfriend and some of the sly comments about weight went right over his head, while I was rolling with laughter at the prods that were being made.The graphics are great, and when you go through the commentary track you realize just how hard the team worked to get everything to look just right. Their attention to detail is impressive.The voice quality is also spectacular. The slight lilting of one character's voice, the deliberate pauses and emphasis of another - these are voice actors who know what they're doing. It really shows when a gaming company finds the perfect person to embody an on screen character.There's single player and co-op mode. This could be tough for solo players; they'll have to find someone to play with to get through those. I know several people who get massive headaches at watching the physics-mind-bending portal play on the screen so this might not be as easy as it sounds. Still it's well worth tracking down a fellow player to go through those levels with.Is there a down side? Well, as mentioned, some people just can't handle watching the gameplay because of it's jumping-from-heights, rotating-quickly-in-all-directions style. It simply makes them nauseous. And it's also worth mentioning that some of these puzzles are *challenging*. They're not meant for four year olds to hop through. They require a great deal of logical thought.But to me that's the beauty of it. It's almost a shame that walkthroughs are so easily available on the web, for people to give up after five minutes and find the solution. The joy of this game is that it trains your brain to find solutions, to seek out the answer to a puzzle by breaking it down into logical steps. In pretty much every case here, you can see *what* you need to do. You just have to figure out *how* you get to that end point. I strongly believe that this logical puzzle solving ability is a superb thing for all of us to get better at, and that Portal 2 is a fantastic way to boost that skill.Plus it is just SO much fun from start to end.Once we finished the game we immediately went through the commentary track and it is even more fascinating. So be sure to check that out!Highly highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000FPM3HS","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Clunky to handle but still arouses interest","reviewText":"\"Rule of Rose\" is an adventure game that I suppose falls into the survival horror genre, but on a very gentle scale. It plays a bit like a sanitized \"Silent Hill\" crossed with \"Haunting Ground\", with notable visual comparisons with the former, especially in the game's locations, enemies and general bewildering ambience. That's not to say it's as good as \"Silent Hill\", in fact in some respects it's quite a let down, but you could have some fun playing it if the story intrigues you. Hopefully it will, because the gameplay is a bit lackingThe plot involves a young girl named Jennifer who finds herself stranded at a spooky orphanage where a group of children who have named themselves The Aristocrats seem to be in charge. These children set Jennifer a series of trials and it's these that form the main stages of game play. Working almost entirely without explanation or motive, you must carry out the children's requests to find missing toys or dead birds to complete each level. Along the way you meet creepy enemies and occasionally the children play tricks on you just for the fun of it. That's about it for the plot, you'll have to play the game yourself to try and make sense of the situation and see if you can get Jennifer out of it. Playing  \"Rule of Rose\" is not that difficult but you'll find out early on that there is little explanation about what is happening to you. As the game starts, Jennifer wanders around the orphanage being generally menaced for a while and then at an allotted moment she falls unconscious and wakes up on board a giant flying airship (!) with the same band of children once again in control of everything. She finds a dog called Brown cruelly tied up and hanging from the ceiling, which she frees, and then girl and dog form a team for the rest of the game, searching for various clues and objects (by getting Brown to find them with his sense of smell) and dodging or fighting with an assortment of bizarre enemies. All the time, the children of the Aristocrat club will tease, trick and punish you whenever they feel like it.The game does a good job at creating an unsettling landscape for you to play in, with creepy children's scrawls covering many walls of the orphanage and airship, and lots of torn up toys, caged animals and general dereliction everywhere. Had the gameplay been more involving, \"Rule of Rose\" could have been a reasonable success, but sadly the experience is let down by several major factors. Firstly, the action is dull, dull, DULL! There are only two things you have to do for the majority of the game. By far the least involving is the \"Find\" feature in which Jennifer let's Brown have a sniff of an item in her inventory and then follows him as he picks up the scent of something and trots off to follow the trail to it's end. Now this feature is used A LOT, which is a real drawback as it's pretty boring to do, just following a dog around through room after room and picking up items that he discovers is the way to finish nearly all of the trials that Jennifer is set, and some of the Find quests become chains, as one found item leads to another, and then another, with nothing else going on in between. Brown is quite cute but he takes no effort to control and he always finds what you set him to find and never misbehaves, so he's a lot less interesting than Hewie the dog in \"Haunting Ground\" (which this game resembles a lot) was.The other thing you spend time doing is dealing with the game's enemies. Now let me say that the monsters in \"Rule of Rose\" are pretty good. Starting off as short, impish mannikin type things (very \"Silent Hill\"), they progress into wearing animal masks (getting fatter when wearing pig heads), and even donning huge conical head-dresses as pecking birds. The game also gives you a fun collection of weapons such as cutlery and hardware tools, which get better and sharper as the game progresses. Now this would all be great if only you had a playable character who knew what to do with them. But in this game I'm afraid you don't, and this is the other major pitfall of the entire experience. The main character of Jennifer has to be one of the soppiest, weakest, most irritatingly feeble creations I have ever played. She spends the entirety of the game whimpering and crying at everything, whether in cut scenes or actual gameplay, and it gets old REALLY fast. Any normal person would tire pretty quickly of the ridiculous ordeals the Aristocrat Club dish out, yet Jennifer never once challenges any of the children who torment her (she looks older than all of them put together, for crying out loud, and she's certainly a lot taller and bigger than all of them, yet she meekly submits to every demand they make). The game goes to some lengths to impress on us that Jennifer is timid and weak by design, but where's the fun in that for the player? And when it comes to facing monsters you'll need to move all breakable objects out of harms way as the controls for combat are awful and you are liable to want to smash something in frustration. The response time for pressing the commands is way too slow to accurately plan your blows or dodge, and the recovery time when Jennifer is knocked to the floor (which she is nearly all the time) is horrendous, seemingly set so that the time it takes for her to stand up is the time it takes the enemy to have another swing at her, which often left me in an endless loop of being floored, sloo-oowly getting up, only to be straight down again before the command to be able to make her run out of the way of the next blow could kick in. The camera angles and general directional controls are also flawed. The camera is automatic and will revolve to suit itself as Jennifer runs, which means that you have to change the direction of the analogue stick even if Jennifer is running in a straight line, just because the camera angle has changed from facing one way to another. So imagine what that's like in a small room where the camera waves around wildly as Jennifer runs to dodge the various monsters ...you'll be running in circles or hitting walls - or dead - in no time.Now I will relent slightly here and say that the hard combat in the game does at least give you some challenge to stick your teeth into, but it seems poorly balanced. A fight between a slick and agile character and a strong and lightning fast enemy is a much more exciting challenge than a weak and hard to control character fighting against a weak and not very threatening enemy, so I still think it's poorly designed. Which is a shame, as throwing Jennifer into a room with upwards of 6 or 7 enemies, plus some quite old school bosses (the mermaid princess was fun) could have been much more entertaining than it currently is.Apart from the combat though, the game is pretty easy and therefore, it can get boring especially when all you are doing is running through rooms after Brown while he sniffs out key items. There are only two locations in the game, and the environments are pretty repetitive The orphanage looks pretty similar throughout and although it's small I still got lost all the time, but the airship is huge and has endless passageways and gantries, including several remotely situated engine rooms that you never need to go for anything so I wondered what the point of them was - and some infuriating cabin areas filled with multiple doors that are never unlocked. Oh yes and on that topic, the game arbitrarily locks and unlocks various doors as levels progress, which is very annoying, because you can never commit to memory which areas are accessible and which are off limits if they change all the time. What I also found annoying was the miserable maps which were very hard to decypher, and the game's annoying habit of glitching frequently between game-play and cutscenes, flashing up incorrect subtitles on several occasions and dropping music and audio in all the wrong places - this is something that should have been tested more thoroughly.The game's strengths are its twisted take on childish pranks, with some quite sinister overtones in places ( a small number of scenes verge on being pretty sadistic), and an overall sense of the bizarre. Don't expect to understand the plot too clearly, even at the end of the game I was still a bit confused. And there are some great illustrations in the books that Jennifer in each stage, all done in childlike scrawl but showing highly violent scenes like goats being disembowelled or people getting buried alive, which adds to the atmosphere! And if you like chasing Brown, you can spend an awful lot of your time just searching for rare items that he can sniff out, with a few bonus treasures to be found for subsequent playthroughs. But as general gameplay goes, all this dog-following gets very tiresome, and adding that to the sappiest main character I have ever played makes \"Rule of Rose\" a game that you might go off playing after a few hours.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2008"}

I like the hyper-realism of something like Gran Turismo or Midnight Club 3 but it's kind of boring cause you just race period. Mario Kart has gameplay elements that actually make you interested in the race. It feels slightly slower than the 64 version but it still looks great.Story: No story literally. Basically you have racers that want that gold cup and go through different race sets to do it. Old favorites return like Rainbow Road which looks more stunning than the old one and some new ones.Graphics: Very nicely detailed. Areas like Rainbow Road are simply great to watch but then you have to actually watch the road. Others look rather bland like souped up 64 versions instead of complete overhauls.Sound/Music: Traditional voice one-liners like \"let's-a go!\" or \"Yoshi!\". The music has that nice bubbly catchy music but it's not catchy. What the?Gameplay: The big change from 64 to Double Dash is right in the name: you have 2 racers per kart now. So Mario is teamed with Luigi, Peach is with Daisy(Luigi's chick I guess), and Baby Mario with Baby Luigi and others.If you get a red homing shell but don't wanna use it, move your guy to the back and get something else until you need it. The specials are roughly the same with the backwards ? which derails you, homing red shells, ever-travelling green shells, awesome-but-inexplicable blue ones(I have no idea how they work, I just fire them).Courses in a way are a little complicated than in the past. You'll be bumping into walls a lot and even falling into pits/water which is incredibly frustrating especially when it's such a sharp curve with very little turning room.There's plenty of secrets to be found and shortcuts that you can explore but this game as usual best works with multiplayer which you'll get your fun's worth in bucket loads.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2005"}

Guilds can challenge other guilds to battle, compete for control of key parts of the world, and be ranked on a worldwide ladder.Unique Streaming TechnologyArenaNet's unique streaming technology forever eliminates the concept of patching a game. You don't have to wait a month for the next big patch to experience new content. Instead, the game constantly and intelligently streams new content to your computer in the background while you play. The world can change continually.

All-new dungeons and dialogue scenes to challenge and thrill gamers","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"2 FF games in one package so why not?","reviewText":"One time I reviewed a movie that everybody said was a film classic but when I watched it I find it to be laboriously paced and not fairly interesting. So is it a film classic cause of its popularity or is it actually good? That dawned(no that's not an in-joke to the title) on me playing the first Final Fantasy. Everyone says that it's an RPG classic and deserves a spot on the best games ever. Its influence is certainly felt but is it a really great game? I don't know. Final Fantasy II is one of those experiments that has as much problems as it does pluses.Final FantasyStory: The world's environment is pretty much regulated by 4 crystals: earth, fire, water and wind. Well lately they've been causing trouble and it's up to the prophesized 4 Warriors of Light to save everyone. There's no backstory for the characters and events rarely go beyond that.Graphics: This is an update so it looks more closer to the SNES incarnations. Not to say this is on the same level but it's kind of close. Nothing overly impressive but certainly better than the original.Sound/Music: No voiceovers of course and effects are kind of limited to roars and sword hits so everything comes down to music. The music perfectly suits wherever you are, whether a dungeon, a town or the overworld. There's no outright catchiness like Terra's Theme or anything but it gets the job done.Gameplay: It falls apart as well as it working. The problem is that the ATB hasn't yet been introduced(which was first seen in IV) so you basically choose your commands for all 4 characters in a row and see how it plays out. It's fine until you hit problematic sections where enemies can smack you around long before you ever got a chance to cure. Also items are EXPENSIVE, moreso than they should be. Potions aren't that bad but Phoenix Downs(which revives fallen characters) are 500 and it's not like enemies drop tons of cash either. Also, did Inns ever bring back fallen characters or did they need to be revived first cause you have to waste a Phoenix Down THEN go to an inn here.Final Fantasy IIStory: 4 people from the kingdom of Fynn have their parents killed during an invasion by the Emperor of Palmecia who wants to dominate the world(what else?) So 3 of them with a rotating 4th have to save the world.Graphics: Same as I's really.Sound/Music: Songs were given a bit more oomph but it lost its catchiness I found.Gameplay: Completely different battle system than what you're used to. Basically here's how it goes: your stats level up according to actions in battle: get hit a lot and your HP and defense goes up, attack like crazy and your current weapon skill and strength goes up, cast magic a lot and your MP will rise and spells become more expensive to cost but are more effective. This made the game easy if you took the time to exploit as you can be overleveled within the first couple hours. It was a good idea to change it and it's a neat idea but it was mishandled.Is it a purchaseable game? If you have the other ones of course, it's a nice bit of nostalgia as well as being able to say you beat the original and its sequel. However they're incredibly straight forward with no plot rivaling VI and there's some problematic areas but get it anyway.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2006"}

You'll be totally lost and confused and won't know who the hell any of the characters are aside from the recognizable Disney ones. Plus, they are all suffering from amnesia and their long, too frequent, cut-scenes have an enigmatic feel to them so you'll still not really ever be sure what is going on no matter how far you get into the game.I think the card-based strategy of fighting and evolving is a horrible, badly conceived misfire of an idea. This kind of thing may be fine in a Beyblade video-game but in a Disney/Final Fantasy game it's just inappropriate. The whole concept is scatterbrained and random and has no real skill involved. It takes ages to build up a decent combat deck and even when you do the fighting is endless, tedious and boring. You'll fight the same villains in every level and while in appearance the levels may look different (taking their inspiration from many different Disney films) they are essentially all the same.The fun comes from spotting popular Disney characters and trying to get into the story that involves them. But the plot is so incomprehensible and alienating that I just didn't care after a while.I did stick with the game for a good few months and found advancing through each level to be an exhilarating and thankless chore.

However, unlike the previous three titles (Advance Wars [GBA], AW: Black Hole Rising [GBA], and AW: Dual Strike [DS]) this game is set in a totally different universe. It's a change of pace to be sure; the question is whether this is for the better or worse.Those familiar with the previous AW titles shouldn't have much trouble getting used to this one. The general play is quite similar: turn-based, capture cities for funds, capture production facilities to make units, commanders with powers, etc. There are, however, many changes to familiar units, plus some units that are entirely new. For example, battleships can move AND attack in this game, and APCs (called 'Rigs' here) can build temporary airports or naval bases that can repair but not produce units. You'll also see a first in the anti-tank unit, an indirect attacker that can actually shoot back if directly attacked. Combat tactics are somewhat different as a result, but nothing that will take a veteran too long to get accustomed to. Additionally, you can zoom the map in, though I haven't found much use for this feature since it's quite easy to see all the icons in regular view mode.The units, COs, and animations have a more realistic look to them, and the general theme and plot of the game is more grimly realistic than playful. Most of the music is some form of rock/metal type track that sounds like it belongs in Command & Conquer, and the post-apocalyptic setting brings back memories of Mad Max and the likes. Themes are generally more mature, with not-so-funny plot twists and some profanity. In general, it won't take you long to realize that this is no Omega Land, and likely never was.Probably the most interesting new features in Days of Ruin are the veterancy system and the reworked commanding officers (COs). Units that destroy other units get promoted up to two ranks, and become more powerful as a result (merging units grants the higher veterancy). It's not overpowering, but enough that if you have mostly veteran forces you'll have a substantial advantage. Additionally, COs no longer just hang around the HQ- they can actually take to the field in any unit, deployable one at a time from the HQ or any production facility. The chosen unit is granted immediate maximum veterancy. Additionally, instead of granting their bonuses to all of their units, as in the previous AW games, COs only affect a 'radius' of units around them. For example, Brenner provides a global defense boost to any kind of unit. However, for units to enjoy this boost they must be within 3 tiles of his unit. Additionally, the CO powers do not charge at all if you don't have your CO deployed and in combat, and the power meter will drain to zero if the CO unit is destroyed (you can deploy them again at no penalty if this happens). To top it all, there is no 'super' CO power, no 'tag' as in Dual Strike, and most of the regular CO powers are nowhere near as strong as those enjoyed in previous titles. In short, COs don't play nearly as major a role as they did in the past games. Is this good or bad? That really depends on how much you enjoyed the varied CO abilities and powers in the previous games. If you're one of the folks that preferred tactical play to marshaling stars for a super attack, or thought that some COs were overpowered (bit hard to deny this, even though I loved them), then this is obviously a good change. If your whole reason for playing AW was the COs, then obviously you're not going to like this. Personally, I think I'd be happiest with something in the middle: maybe keep the CO zone idea, but make them all bigger, for example. It's quite difficult and often undesirable to keep your units clumped up inside such a small area.The campaign is quite linear, with no bonus objectives or branches. You can play bonus tactical challenge maps, but these don't present any reward, so unless you're just bored there's not much point. Playing the campaign from start to finish unlocks everything. Yup, you heard that right- there's no Battle Maps or grinning Hachi looking for your credits in exchange for spiffy CO color arrangements. You can still change CO colors, but this and all playable battle mode maps are automatically available. There is also a music room and wireless play, which is probably the only reason to do free battle mode at all.In terms of customization, Days of Ruin has a ton of space for you to make your own maps. 50 maps, as a matter of fact- probably more than anyone will ever need. You can use these in online mode, and in general this is a good improvement over Dual Strike. In addition to wireless play, you can play using Nintendo WFC- a first for Advance Wars. Maps can be traded online, if you choose to do so.Dual Strike added a lot of interesting new features, such as the dual front battle, tag, CO experience, plus some new units (most of which aren't in Days of Ruin). Days of Ruin adds some more- particularly the Internet play- but also takes out many of the best new things in Dual Strike. In particular, Days of Ruin relies very heavily on its multiplayer for replay value. The campaign and versus mode offer nothing in the way of rewards for the offline player, and the COs aren't especially fun to experiment with.In conclusion, Days of Ruin is definitely a change of pace for Advance Wars. It's similar enough to its predecessors that fans of the originals will probably like it. How MUCH you like it depends heavily on what your favorite aspects of the past games were. If you were addicted to unlocking things, really liked the old COs and their powers, and mainly play offline, then Days of Ruin will probably be less attractive. If you were in it for the tactical play, want to see what happens when a battleship can move AND fire, and mainly play online matches instead of versus mode, then this game will be more fun. Personally, I don't think Days of Ruin is much better or worse than the previous games- it's simply different. I'm not big on multiplayer, so I found Dual Strike to be more fun. However, it also introduces some interesting new game aspects that I hope will be integrated with the best features of the others, and I can't wait to see what Intelligent Systems has lined up for the future of this awesome series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2008"}

The voice acting is abnormally fast and certainly hurts the overall experience. I was also disappointed that this title has very little in common with the console titles, particularly plot wise. I find that a little perplexing considering how great the universe in the Suikoden series is (with the exception of the half finished IV). Also occasionally there's not well defined direction. Oftentimes you will have to basically \"Search\" your base or other areas to trigger story progression.In a pretty big change the title focuses on missions. Many missions are \"accepted\" and \"completed\" as natural story progression, which is still pretty linear. You can also accept additional quests, many of which result in recruiting additional stars of destiny (Collecting all 108 is a huge nonsensical chore with little reward - often times you must do something during a certain season, with a certain character in your party or without a certain character).The characters in general are pretty disappointing. I'm usually not one to bash customization but I actually think the change from weapon upgrading to purchase hurts the overall experience and makes a lot of the characters kind of blend together. When you have such a huge selection of characters to choose from it makes a lot more sense for them to have fairly well defined roles.Gameplay wise this is a solid RPG. Not bad at all for a hand held title. This is very much typical Suikoden or turned based Final Fantasy fare done well. You have alot of different options for party setup and choosing what spells or magical attacks to equip characters with (similar to the rune system of the console Suikodens). This is by far the best aspect of the game, even if the difficulty level is pretty low.The graphics are also nice (very reminiscent of Final Fantasy III (Japan) - The DS release)In short if you're looking for good classic turned based combat on a hand held this is a good choice however if you're looking for anything ground breaking or that has anything to do with the Suikoden universe than this game is going to disappoint you.Finally PLEASE release a hand held version of the first 2 Suikoden titles in the US - I would happily shell out 3 times what I paid for this game to play the first 2 on a hand held.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2009"}

This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible.

Mario the best platformer, Zelda the best Action RPG, Metroid the best adventure, and Super Smash Bros Melee the best fighter...Most fighter games get old within a few days, but I've had this game since December and I'm still finding more than enough things to do in this game to keep me busy, and I'm beginning to wonder if there is even an end to all the things to unlock! So many trophies, side quests, alternate modes, and the more you complete the more you unlock, this game is simply amazing.This game is not the pinacle of the GameCubes graphical power, but for the most part it still manages to stand above the competing consoles. The backgrounds could have had more detail, but the characters looks imply amazing, and the real time clips mixed into the FMV movie at the beginning show such a smoth transition between prerendered and real time graphics you start to realize that GamCube is definately the most underrated system of the batch. The sound of this game is simply great, and the adventure mode gives gamers a chance to live the fantasy of playing through Super MArio Bros as Samus Aaron... though it would have been nice to have had the adventure mode a little longer and more elaborate (especially the metroid inspire level.)This game is nearly perfect for it's genre, and most importantly the game is a blast!

This is what you get with MOH: Warfighter. I've only played thru campaign and yet to get online. The campaign is pretty short about 4-5 hours on Normal. The story is pretty good as most missions are inspired by actual events. The guns and tactical equipment is what I like about games by DICE. They are real-world equipment actually used in warfare. Breaching doors have never been more exciting as there are mutiple ways choose from. My favorite? Shotgun blast the door knob and then breach. The cover system is REALLY helpful if use it properly. I actually like the addition of driving missions. I bet DICE could make a decent racing game. The AI can be really stupid at some times. An enemy would be about 15 feet away and they would not kill him. Or I would be behind cover and an enemy comes up behind me and they would not shoot him and I end up dying. The enemy AI will do that alot. Sometimes they will run up behind you when you least expect it. There are a few bugs in the game. One being my teammate just running into a wall and being stuck there. Another after I adjusted my settings and my screen would go black. Sometime when you're supposed to go to a specific place, it will not happen and I ended up walking outside the map where I'm not supposed to be. But with all those being said I still love this game. Gonna be playing it for awhile.*Update*I've been playing multiplayer for awhile now and I gotta say its super fun. The customizations on the guns are really cool. Being able to change the look of your mags, stock, and barrels are what I love about this game. Oh and there are TONS of camos for your guns so change it up to what you like. There are six classes you can choose from and each have their own unique weapons and skills. I prefer the Assaulter. If your a Call of Duty fan, this game will play about the same. Same for Battlefield fans. You can change the control schemes to either CoD style or Battlefield. I did encounter some bugs online. Sometimes when I start up a game, my gun doesn't show up or either the sights are gone! Yeah and sometimes when you reload it doesn't show the animation. Your gun will sometimes go mute on you and no sound will come when shooting. These are only occasionally and doesn't happen all the time. But I will still be playing this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2013"}

It was fun enough, but just seemed a little too silly and cartoonish. Over the years, however, game developers have taken huge steps in bringing Lara Croft to life as a more realized character with a story worth following...not just some big-chested broad who likes to play with guns and solve pointless puzzles. In this franchise reboot, I believe they may have finally reached the pinnacle they've been shooting for all this time. The story is incredibly well thought out and written to blend into gameplay, not just introduce characters and move along. Puzzling for the sake of puzzling is no more...the puzzles are incorporated into the tombs you need to access, and how you access them.

You are a hacker named Aiden Pierce who can hack almost anything in the literal sense of the meaning (trains, street lights, and so on). What this game does wrong is that it plays like every other Ubisoft game that I've ever played just about. So, it has the typical things that you'd see in an Ubisoft game (collectibles, viewpoints, etc). What is so different about this game is that everything does something for you, even picking up meaningless collectibles, so Ubisoft has appearantly learned from their enforced completionist drivel that ruined Black Flag for me. Another problem that burns me up to no end is Ubisoft's desire to enforce the same old checkpoint saved game bologne and in some circumstances, the game doesn't even save the checkpoint. The difficulty is perhaps my biggest complaint though, is their difficulty scaling, it's horrid to say the least. I honestly think that Ubisoft designs these sort of games for Assassin Creed fans, so they will have a new title to play while Assassin's Creed &#60;insert number here&#62;, because honestly... it plays like an Assassin's Creed game. They have even gone so far as it make it appearant that it takes place IN the Assassin's Creed universe. The game isn't bad, but as I mentioned, it plays like yet another Ubisoft game. If you happen to like the Assassin's Creed games, then by all means play this. While it doesn't allow you to perform the incredible feats of climbing like an assassin, you will still have as much fun as a super hacker.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2014"}

Wii, like all the previous releases in theSuper Mario Bros.franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiis held sideways, allowing for easy, classic inputs using the D-pad to direct playable characters, the 1 button to jump and 2 button to spit out projectiles like snowballs and fireballs.

Players can pick each other up to save them from danger or toss them into it.Supports 2-4 players in multiplayer mode.Mario, Luigi and two Toads are all playable characters, while many others from the Mushroom Kingdom make appearances throughout the game. Players can even ride different Yoshi characters and use their tongues to swallow enemies &ndash; or their fellow players.In some areas, players use the motion abilities of the Wii Remote controller. The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"B.

The shooting is somewhat lackluster of a real gun sound. And the new voice actor is a hit or a miss whether you like him or not.

{"product_name":"B001IK5TJI","reviewerName":"Yossarian","summary":"Definitely rent first","reviewText":"Like most people, I am a huge Bioware fan.  Mass Effect in particular was a transcendent experience.  Tragically, unbelievably, Dragon Age:  Origins is not.  In fact, it is surprisingly underwhelming.  I'm going to likely get dogpiled for this, but I think the facts speak for themselves.Simply put, both the graphics and the gameplay feel stale and dated, like something out of the early 2000s.  While the cutscenes are impressive, the actual in-game graphics are decidedly not.  Even at 720p HD they are oftimes crude and blocky, with pixels - actual pixels - occasionally visible in foliage and grass.  Water effects are tame and almost identical to what you'd see in Champions of Norrath or its like on the PS2.  Spell effects are the only place you see the PS3's graphics horsepower in action, and even those are adequate, not amazing.  There are numerous HUGE clipping errors, where characters literally walk through one another or objects.  During my playthrough of the Dwarf Casteless origin tale, a guard actually walked right through a guy I was talking to in the conversation screen.  That should never, ever happen.  Sheathed weapons float inches off character's backs, with shields like a foot away.  Ever seen a 3-foot long \"dagger\"?  Now I have.  Characters hands and appendanges look like plaster marionette hands, often passing through one another without bending, or holding items that float in the air as if the entire hand is fake.  It honestly looks like something out of the 1990s.Character controls are a mess.  Instead of smooth, free-flowing fights of the sort you'd see in Mass Effect or even Diablo II, you have robotic movements and cludgy code that forces you to run, rotate in place, trigger an attack, watch the attack go off almost in slow motion, and then wrestle with your controller to figure out whether your character has enough brains to keep fighting on their own, or if you need to button mash.  Characters often fail to defend themselves, simply standing there for a round or two before realizing they're being hit.  The melee attacks in Mass Effect - a FPS! - actually work better than the ones in Dragon Age:  Origins.  Combat messages are also a spammy, ambiance-destroying affair, with damage numbers rapidly spewing from people's heads along with seemingly random status effect messages from things you didn't even realize were happening.  It's not uncommon to see things like \"Miss!\" \"Resisted!\" \"Stunned!\" pop up repeatedly even though it's not entirely clear you were even targeted.  And god help you if you have multiple damage effects -- instead of adding fire damage, critical etc into one number, you will see each one individually.  So if you hit for 24 damage including various separate bonuses, you will instead see a 18, 2, 3, and then a 1 pop up in a row.The user interface is also extremely frustrating, with an overlapping series of arcane sub-windows that are hard to navigate.  Basic RPG staples are gone, like the ability to simply use a healing potion from your inventory.  Oh no, that would be too obvious.  For example, if a character on your team is KO'd in a fight, he's not dead, but after the fight will get back up with a crippling \"wound\".  The only way to heal the wound is with a first aid kit.  But you can't just go into inventory and use a kit.  Instead, you have to go into the \"quick wheel\" menu.  But you don't go into inventory from there.  Instead, you have to go into the \"potions\" menu, and then use it.  Because obviously when you have a first aid kit, the first thing you think of is \"potion.\"  Imagine this sort of logic applied to all equipment and you swiftly get a sense of how frustrating inventory management can -- and will -- get.Some of the characters themselves are also useless.  For my first playthrough, I started as a Dwarf Fighter.  Fighters cannot open chests.  Just makes sense, right?  The first Rogue I was able to get into my party was almost 7 hours into the game.  7 hours of not being able to open any chest.  Moreover, almost every recruit you get for your team is a Fighter, and they're all stronger and better equipped than you are.  So basically you should be either a Rogue or a Mage.  Rogues are as good as fighters if they are backstabbing, plus they can open chests and the like.  Critically, they actually get skill points faster -- every 2 levels compared to 3 for Fighters and Mages.  This makes a HUGE difference, and is only mentioned on like page 87 of the manual.But hey, at least the game has tons of loot and RPG-y goodness, right?  Um, no.  10 hours into the game, my Rogue was still using the same leather armor she started with, because with its set bonus (what?) it was still better than the generic chainmail and other garbage we kept finding.  Magic items are oftimes useless -- + 1 willpower, wow -- and there is almost no money to speak of.  10 hours into the game my entire team had less than 4 gold pieces.  4!There are numerous other annoyances.  Rogues can steal from NPCs, but unless it is money you get no message saying what you stole, just a success message.  So every time, you have to go into inventory and try to guess what you got.  Did I have 6 healing potions before, or 7?  Sometimes you steal plot critical items and have no idea about it because there is no message, and the item is hidden in a quest-related submenu instead of general inventory.  This happened to me with a stolen key -- I talked to dozens of NPCs looking for it, only to later discover by accident that I had stolen it at some point.  Rogues can also disarm traps, but it actually requires a separate animation, and you ALWAYS encounter traps in the middle of a fight.  So your character is not only out of the fight trying to disarm traps, but is inevitably getting peppered with arrows the whole time.  It's better to just run through the damn things.Oh, and your life bar?  Don't have one.  Each character has a thin red line around part of their character portrait that represents their life.  It is almost impossible to see it most of the time.  It is extremely easy to get killed simply because you didn't realize the bar was gone, or to waste healing potions on minor injuries because you thought it was gone.All in all, Dragon Age: Origins feels like an unpolished, old RPG.  It is simply not very fun to play.  You will find yourself wrestling with the crude, dated inventory and character controls, selling piles of worthless garbage equipment, and rubbing your temples as characters walk through one another or start out of sync talking.  My strong recommendation is to rent this game first and see what I'm talking about.  If I didn't see \"Bioware\" on the cover, I never ever would have thought they were associated with this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2009"}

Although still fun to play I just felt like I was playing the older call of duty back in time with deluted graphics.  Although I think it should have came out before COD4MW came out it would have been better.  When a play a newer version of the COD series I expect it to be a little better over all then the last.  But this one was not.Multiplayer:  I never could get CODWAW to work on multiplayer although I didn't mess with it day in and day out to get it to work but I gave up after a while and went back to COD4MW.I gave the game 3 Stars because overall I was disappointed but it wasn't a total loss.  I still enjoyed it but it could have been so much more.This review is basically based on single player only because I could not get Multi Player to work or even come up for that matter.  Again I didn't mess with it that much because the single player disappointed me enough and I knew the COD4MW would be probably better anyway.

Berk","summary":"Simply the best in this generation of consoles","reviewText":"The Xbox 360's controller is without a doubt my pick for the best gaming controller of the past decade.Its curved design fits comfortably in the hand, and feels solid.  The placement of the two analog sticks feels natural, especially when playing first-person games.  I grew up with Nintendo, and up until 2006 the PlayStation 2's DualShock was my go to controller.  Then I got my hands on the 360's controller.  Wow, oh wow!  It felt natural.  I'm serious, the instant this controller got in my hands it felt as if I'd always used one (and I never played an original Xbox at all!).  The layout is clean, and easy to use.  After playing it I can't understand why anyone would want a controller with the two analog sticks on the bottom of the controller (although, certain game types do still play better with the DualShock style controller, the Xbox controller fits me better for most games).The Xbox 360 Wireless Controller is heavier than controllers given by Sony and Nintendo, but I consider this a good thing.  I worry about the strength of the Nintendo Wii/GameCube controller (referring to the \"classic\" game controllers and not the nun chuck, etc) and Sony's DualShock.  They feel like they have a lot of empty space and that the shell is waiting for one good drop to break.  The Xbox 360 controller is rugged, with elegant curves that make it feel like it was born for hardcore gaming.That look and feel doesn't lie.  And it holds true to that: My controllers have seen some severe abuse over the years.  I've owned two Xbox 360s, and the controllers I had for the original may be battered and bruised, but still function perfectly well.  I own a Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo 64, PlayStation 2, GameCube, and PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 Wireless Controller is the only controller I've never had fail.  I've had to replace controllers for all of those consoles.  In six years I've never once had to replace a Xbox 360 Wireless controller.  (With the exception of the PS3, because I've only owned it for 1 year so we'll see how long it lasts).If you own a 360 you already know what's great about this controller.  If you have the money, and a controller for the long term you should definitely purchase the official Microsoft produced controller because it is well worth it for the build quality, and longevity.  Microsoft's team really knocked it out of the park, and the next Xbox's controller has a high standard to live up to.  Until then I intend to make the most of what I consider to be the best game controller of the last decade.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2013"}

The United States responds by dispatching an elite team of Delta Force Operators to recon the situation. As tension rises between the two nations, a massive alien ship reveals itself in the middle of the island. The ship generates an immense force sphere that freezes a vast portion of the island and drastically alters the global weather system.

The game is compatible with Windows Vista-64bit in case any of you were curious. The visual effects were stunningly beautiful, every detail was almost beyond realism. I would highly recommend this game to any fan of FPS. The storyline was fairly decent, just a little different from your typical alien shooter (1/2 of the game you deal with the Koreans, the other 1/2 of the game you deal with the alien encounter). Definitely leaves the ending open to a sequel, and we shall see it if the sales of this one are good. The game controls are fairly easy to use and can be learned to navigate through within the first 30min (The tutorial HUD as you progress in the beginning is easy to keep up with).

These games do not look like they belong on a PS3 by any means. I do give them kudos for porting the PC/Xbox versions of the games and not the epic crap PS2 versions. I do love these games, I can't knock them. The gameplay does hold up based on it's sheer uniqueness. I invested a lot of money into a new hard drive and disc drive just to be able to play them again on my old Xbox, little did I know that Ubisoft was going to try to start a movie company and generate interest in their IP and release this package a year later. Jokes on me there.Anyways, the thing that bugs me most about this 'HD Trilogy' is that this is basically a straight port of the games and nothing more. They didn't iron out any of the glitches or bugs they didn't smooth anything out or give you any extras whatsoever, Splinter Cell is actually missing two levels. The Chaos Theory multiplayer/co-op isn't there either. They took out all the behind the scenes stuff from Pandora Tomorrow and Chaos Theory, interrogations have no facial animations like they did on Xbox, which just bugs the crap out of me since generally you're looking right at the guys face while you interrogate him. The cut-scenes, also, they look awful. It's basically the old SD video blown up to 720 and it looks like a low quality youtube video with all the pixilation and fragmentation of an MPEG from 1998.I know I'm being critical and haven't had much to say about this in the positive but I just hold these games up to a higher standard then how they've been treated here. This is one of, if not my favorite games series and I just was expecting a little bit more out of it than just a sloppily slapped together revamp/pseudo-restoration with a bunch of missing bits. Honestly they should have thrown in a port of of the Xbox 1's Double Agent since that was a superior game to the PS3's totally different versions but I can see the clash of interest there.I think the younger people out there who never got to really experience these games when they were new will really get a kick out of them and won't have as much to complain about as me because I can nitpick on this thing until my keyboard burns up just because I know the games that well.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2012"}

Over time, you'll do battle on the front lines of both sides as this shift reveals high-stakes arms threats and a terrifying glimpse of the future.HAWX: The Elite, High Altitude Warfare eXperimental SquadronYou'll begin the game as former U.S. Air Force Pilot David Crinshaw, assigned to provide air support for the well-known Ghost Recon team. You and your fellow HAWX pilots are some of the most highly-trained specialists in the world. Based out of Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, you're tasked with everything from testing secret and experimental aircraft weapon systems to carrying out combat and recon missions, training other top pilots, and attempting to capture enemy technologies.With the rise of the PMCs, your unique skills in higher demand than ever before.

Featuring incoming missile detection, an anti-crash system, damage assessment, a tactical map, and weapons trajectory control, E.R.S. even allows you to issue orders to your squadron and other units, much like the iconic Cross-Com system in other Tom Clancy games. When you're getting started, you can ease into the rigors of flight and gain confidence by using a special assistance mode that offers support through the E.R.S. This mode can be switched off at any time, deactivating safety features and allowing you to perform advanced maneuvers.Cutting-Edge Realism and Innovative Multi-Player ModesWhether you're in a classic F15 Fighting Falcon or a new-generation Gripen, the controls and flight graphics are designed to keep you on your toes.

There are definitely a couple of things they need to work out in the online play but, once in a game, you find yourself in an intense dogfight where you're dodging missiles left and right!

Overall, the headset is decent, but for the cost, we expected more.Sound - The audio is great. It's clear, crisp, and it has a very nice range. No complaints here.Mic - I tend to get a bit of background noise despite the mic being directional. It picks up sound very well, which may also account for the background noise. This may not be an issue when using with games, but if using with a phone, it may be an annoyance. Of course, we don't plan to use this unit with the phone much, so this is only a minor issue in our case.Comfort - The ear padding is not very comfortable. In fact, it is pretty stiff. It may loosen up over time. Also, we found that the headset slips when you move your head. Even if the headband is adjusted (it is adjustable!) to fit snug, the headset still wiggles around. I assume this is due to the material on the ear pieces and headband. It is not leather or faux leather. Instead it is cloth mesh. So it tends to slip on your skin. And strangely enough, it gets warm too. The slipping happened on each of us that tried the unit on. Don't get me wrong. The unit doesn't fall off. It just slips a bit out of place. I prefer the faux leather on options such as the Afterglow. They stay put.Versatile - As is the case with most of these universal headsets, it comes with a lot of cables. Of course, that means you need to have the one necessary for whatever task you are undertaking. Xbox? Make sure you get out the Xbox chat cable and... Oh, this is where it gets confusing... Much of this depends on how your Xbox is hooked to your audio system. In many cases, you just need to plug the headset into the headphone port of your sound system and the Xbox USB port. In some other case, you may need to purchase the Xbox Audio Adapter (sold separately), so you can splice into the audio output of the Xbox. Similar for the PS3, except you can use the AV cable that comes with the PS3 instead of procuring an adapter. For most other devices, you can just plug right into the headphone port with or without the inline amplifier. The amplifier does offer some functions to adjust sound quality and volume, and enable/disable the mic as desired. One nice feature is that you can even hook your phone into the inline amp/selector and if you get a call during your game, you can swap over to the phone. And then swap back to the game when done with the call.Package - It comes packed very nicely. Everything is safe and secure, and you can easily pack it all away when not in use. It comes with pretty much everything you need to get started. As already mentioned, in some cases, you may need an adapter to work with the PS3 and/or Xbox 360. This is usually the case when you rely on HDMI cables to feed your video/audio from those devices. Otherwise, you should be ready to go.This unit has great sound quality, but I feel the other areas are lacking in quality to earn such a high price tag. Seeing as this is aimed at the gaming market, and gamers tend to play for hours sometimes and also move around while playing, I find there to be too many issues in those areas... despite some of the neat/nice features. At a lower price point, this set could be a contender.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2013"}

Alice will confront a host of weird creatures in surreal settings and solve numerous puzzles through more than 15 levels of gameplay.","reviewerName":"TigerPomme \"tigerpomme\"","summary":"This game begs to be played","reviewText":"I was stunned that American McGee announced the game a while back. I've been waiting anxiously for months for this game to be released and here it is! The story takes place after &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;. When Alice returns from Wonderland, no one believes that she has been there and is placed into an insane asylum (exactly the same thing that happens to Dorothy from OZ). It's not long before the White Rabbit pays her a visit and tells her she must return to Wonderland because the Red Queen has taken over again. So back down the rabbit hole she goes but, to Alice's surprise, Wonderland is no longer the same place she remembers. It's darker and more dangerous than before. Cheshire returns to accompany Alice on her trip (Cheshire actually acts like a Dmon, similar to a witch's black cat) and gives her tips. And like Wonderland Cheshire's health is in question, skin hanging off of his bones, nasty tattoos, a pirate's earring and bad teeth makes Cheshire one very nasty looking cat. Of course the rest of the characters have fallen on hard times as well. Mad Hatter sports gears in his body, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum look like they've been dead for a few days,  White Rabbit looks like he should be in the asylum. Wonderland also sports several new funky characters like giant oversized Ants, nasty fire  Imps, and flying Jabberspawn (don't ask).The game sports very nice dark brooding graphics suitable to Wonderland. The controls are very nice and solid given time to get used to the unusual third person view. (This is the same view and control found in Rune and MDK2) The levels are nice and detailed, however, I wonder why better use of curved surfaces is not utilized, since the Alice engine is based on the fantastic Quake 3 engine. Interestingly enough, the same curved surfaces are in use during the &quot;Psychedelic&quot; levels with twisting and warping backgrounds and what not. (I recommend a bucket next to the PC if you suffer from motion sickness.) All of these special effects require hefty PC power.The PC requirements are bit steep, but no worse then when Unreal was first released. Follow them like the bible since fine tuning Alice is very difficult. I'm also severely disappointed that the advanced features are poorly documented and that some of the advanced command issues do not work (strangely enough). And worse, Alice does NOT come with a level editor, this alone shortens the life of Alice down to mere months. A very unusual move since American McGee did work at ID software and knows the value of throwing in the editing package along with the game. (look at games like Doom, Quake I, II, III, Half-Life, Unreal, and Rune)The minor drawbacks do little to outweigh the game as whole, get the game or &quot;borrow&quot; your friend's. You'll certainly enjoy the game. If not, well . . . You're too old to be playing games. You should be sitting on your couch reading the media's latest attack on violent games and how it causes the youth of America (snicker) to be violent.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2000"}

A stationary camera helps reinforce this storybook illusion. The game's title is taken from the paper-thin characters inhabiting the Mushroom Kingdom. For example, when Mario is sleeping, he flips and flutters through the air like a leaf falling from a tree.Paper Mariois the sequel to the classic Super NES role-playing gameSuper Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars.

Classic characters, such as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Bowser, and Toad, are joined by the likes of Goombario and Kammy Koopa.","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Great RPG fun for all ages, with a few quirks","reviewText":"Anything with the name Mario on it tends to have the golden touch. Just look at Mario 64, one of the classics on the N64 and still an incredibly playable game. Super Smash Brothers was another Mario game that was amazingly fun.Mario Paper is more like an RPG/arcade combination. It lets Mario take on other characters to join his team, and rotate between them to choose his current companion. He picks up different weapons and items, each altering his combat techniques.Like Final Fantasy and other RPG games, it also gives you some degree of customization over Mario as he gains level in combat. You can increase his 'magic' (flower power) or his 'constition' (heart power). You can collect badges as you go, each giving you different strengths. You can manage which badge combinations you activate, giving you interesting pairings of power.Gameplay is much like any other N64 RPG. You go from town to town, killing bad guys as you go and talking to every friendly person that you meet. People give you clues about where to go and what to do.On the downside, for a RPG it's extremely linear - you can't go through X door until you talk to Y person and get your hands on Z object. You have to do things in a certain order even if logically that wouldn't be true.Also, the Peach character bugs me a lot.  She could try to resist when she's captured, but instead she sits and whines that SOMEONE has to come rescue her. No thought about doing anything for herself ...Fighting is both good and bad. The first fight is exceptionally annoying, because you get thrown into it with only one ability. Even if you do that the best that you can, you still get beaten and look like you've &quot;died&quot;. This will probably be really frustrating to first time players, especially younger ones.In general though it works reasonably well. It's turn based, so slower players won't feel rushed in making their choices. It's pretty straightforward - the options are all laid out right in front of you. You have to learn which things work on which characters, and the complexity builds slowly as you go.Definitely a game we'll play through at this house, and one I'd buy for my gaming friends, but it's a shame they didn't put just a bit more effort into player-testing it before releasing it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2001"}

So much so that when you are in the operational menu (from pressing the select button), you must move the menu around to view all the information. kind of frustrating, but again, nothing to complain about overall. i just like a full field of view.i'm sure single player mode is equally awesome (and full-screen super duper), but i wouldn't trade the co-op for it!highly recommended for tongue-in-cheek awesome gameplay!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2011"}

B","summary":"An extensive review for Call of Duty Black Ops (focused on Multiplayer)","reviewText":"Wow, there seem to be an abnormal amount of haters for this game.  Call of Duty Black Ops (BO) is a good game, I am not sure why people are rating it so low.  After reading many of these reviews, it seems that people have no idea how to logically rate a game, in fact, I would be so bold to say that regardless of the reasons given, it boils down to the fact that many people don't like this simply because it's different and more balanced then MW2.  I personally feel that most of the changes made in BO are for the better.The single player campaign is told in a more cohesive way and the story is pretty good, it doesn't have many of the \"wow moments\" that MW2 had, but it's still exciting nonetheless and has more of an emotional impact when it comes to your NPC team members.  It's about the length you would expect (5-7 hours) and there is an unlockable zombie mode upon completion.The meat of many COD games is the multiplayer and this is something BO excels at.  Not only do you earn experience points but you also earn COD points which is a form of currency the game utilizes (think Counter Strike).  This allows you to unlock what you want when you want it, it should be noted that some weapons are still only unlocked at certain experience levels, but you still have to buy them with your currency to use them.  It works well, although, I prefer the old system better of just unlocking new weapons as you level up as I find that the currency system lacks the addiction found in MW2 systems.  It's still fun and it leads to the biggest changes of the game which come in the form of `wager matches'.  Not only can you use that currency to buy weapons, sites, camo, killstreaks, etc..., but you can also use it as a down payment to enter a wager match hoping to come out of the match with more money then you had going in.  It's a fun system and something that works well later on in the game when you have currency to spare.  It certainly makes for some tense games when you have money on the line.So far most of the maps are great.  A lot of them have moving parts (train going by, missle launching, etc...) which is a nice touch and adds to the atmosphere.  The layout of all the maps seems to be stellar so far which is surprising because they did not have an open beta test period.  All enemies that I have come across hiding out in a room are vulnerable from some stand point, and no spot on any map really feels \"safe\".  I haven't really noticed an spawning issues like others have noted, although, on small maps such as Nuke Town, spawning close to the enemy probably can't be avoided from a code/design stand point.But the thing I enjoy most about BO's multiplayer are the small improvements.  Thankfully, the game ending killstreak - calling in a nuke, is gone.  The highest level killstreak you can get is 11, which is actually hard this time around because you can't spawn killstreaks like in MW2, so if you get killstreak 6 and call in a mortar strike and kill 3 enemies, you're killstreak is still 6, not 9, meaning you have to kill 3 more players with your gun to reach killstreak 9.  This is great because it makes it a lot harder to get killstreaks but more importanlty it helps prevent players from camping trying to spawn killstreaks, anything that prevents camping is a good thing.On the camping note, BO is not friendly to snipers, which is another awesome feature, I haven't played a map yet where it wasn't easy to spot snipers and take them out easily.  BO leans more towards a traditional run and gun type of play style which I personally prefer.Statistics!  Stats, and more stats, anything you want to know about how you play is located in the stat section of the muliplayer menu, how shots fired, deaths, kills, captures, etc... and much much more.  Also, at the end of matches you are shown more stats, not just kill/death info.  For example, at the end of a headquarters match you'll see your stats for; kills, deaths, kill/deat ratio, captures, and destroys.  This is a nice feature because it actually shows who on your team is actually trying for the objective,not just running around shooting people.Now the player has 3 spots in there inventory for items so you can have a frag, flashbang, and a claymore if you want.  There is new equipment you can carry now, a sensor which acts like a many personal UAV which you put in the ground and it displays movement near you, an UAV jammer which acts in a similar fashion, a camera that you can set up which replaces your radar with the camera feed.  There are also new special grenades to mess with such as the nova 6 grenade which emits a toxic gas cloud and a decoy grenade which emits gunfire and shows up on the enemy's radar as such implying that a real player is there which is great for causing confusion.Some of the perks have been rearranged too, stopping power has been taken out completely, although you really won't notice because you still die with only a couple of bullets.You can now dive to prone after sprinting which is just cool.Zombies, zombies, zombies, there is one level available to you from the start and you unlock the other one after completing the game.  I'm new to the whole COD zombie scene since this is the first game I've tried form Treyarch, but I find it to be a lot of fun.  It increases in difficulty quickly and you really have to work as a team if you want to make it far which is something that COD players have a hard time understanding and fail at so that adds to the difficulty.  I've made it further by myself then on a team of four!!!  The game style is a lot of fun, although it could be better if they added a simplified leveling system, I just don't feel like I get a lot out of it, some kind of permanent reward system (unlock special camo in multiplayer, or other guns you can use in zombie mode, etc...) would be nice.The graphics are good, they're actually a bit different then MW2 but still good.The game isn't with out it's faults though, but most of them are inherit to the franchise, not just this game.  Lag is still an issue, things like watching the killcam and seeing that you didn't fire at the enemy although you actually fired your gun twice, other players moving in segments, or watching the killcam and the enemy seems to be moving lightning fast, or the players who just drop to prone immediately but when you try it seems to take forever, etc...Also, they introduced a new game type called 'combat training' which is a great idea except it's executed horribly.  You can play by yourself against AI controlled opponents in team deathmatch or free-for-all, up to 10-11 bots I think???, this is great for new players to the franchise, or just for practicing out new techniques.  You level up just as you would in a real multiplayer match (points do not cross over) and it feels surprisingly similar to a real online match.  What doesn't make sense is that they require you to be online to play it???  Whaaaaaaaa, you make a game type specifically made to play offline and you require the player to be hooked up to the internet?  It doesn't make any sense.  I think it's mainly for tracking purposes (company feedback) so they can actually see how many people are playing combat training, but it's an odd design decision.This gameplay style will probably always be around, but it definitely is starting to feel like it needs a major refresher, game changing concepts need to start being introduced to this franchise.That being said, this is a Call of Duty game through and through, don't expect \"team play\" even if you're on a team, COD is all about lone wolf gameplay, although this is the most balanced COD game to date.  This is a great addition to the franchise and there is no reason you shouldn't pick this game up.Headquarters, here I come....***UPDATE (11/24/10)***Well, I have prestiged once now and have definitely had my fair share of multiplayer combat, both traditional and zombie mode.Here are some additional notes you might find important.  There has been an update which seems to have fixed most of the spawning issues found in the game (although I never really came across many), the downside is, now you spawn on the other side of the map to where the action is so it takes a bit longer to get back into things, which is a little annoying because COD games are all about quick kills, quick deaths scenarios, so starting closer to the action is more beneficial then starting far away.Zombie mode, is a lot of fun!  I\"ve made it to level 18 now and it's a good time.  The one major annoyance I have with zombie mode has nothing to do with that actual game play itself but the pre-game lobby that comes with it and how the server handles the host.  Unlike the standard multiplayer lobby where a countdown timer begins when the server has found enough players (requiring no input from players) and if the host leaves the game during the match the server switches to a new host allowing the game to continue, which is a great system, one that zombie mode doesn't use.For some reason, they've done away with that idea with the online zombie mode which requires 3 of the 4 players to be \"ready\", which is annoying because when you have a system that requires the player to input something before a game starts only half of them do, therefore the game never starts!  The game 'FarCry 2's multiplayer did the same thing for it's main online matches and you had the same thing happen, you would be waiting in the lobby for minutes, not seconds, sometimes 5 minutes, which is just dumb.  It ruined the multiplayer for that game.  So the fact that the zombie mode utilizes this system is baffling.  Once 4 players have been found the match should just start, the players shouldn't have to press the A button to say that they're \"ready\", it's implied that they're ready by them being in the lobby waiting for the next match!  Why they didn't take the main multiplayer match making system and utilize it in zombie mode is beyond me.Regarding the host issue, if you're playing zombie mode and the a player leaves the match who happens to be the host, the match just ends, doesn't matter if your at level 1 or level 20, the match is over.  No host migration and the game doesn't repopulate the player slot either (if a player leaves who is not the host), which again is a odd design decision and extremely annoying especially if you're far into a zombie match.Hopefully in the future Treyarch will update the zombie mode with unlockables of it's own, which would encourage more players to get into I think as well as reward players who play it well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2010"}
