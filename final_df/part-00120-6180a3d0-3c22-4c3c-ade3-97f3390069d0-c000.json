Then they had to go and make a game about pirates.  Oh well.  So is it any good?Well, if you like the Assassin's Creed series, but hated AC3 then there's good news and bad news.  Good news is for the most part they've ditched the handholding.  Gone is the awful 6 hour long tutorial - the tutorial levels in Black Flag feel like they forward the story and you can get through them pretty quickly.  They've also mixed up the formula a bit by giving you more pirate-y things to do, so while there's still the same old \"chase after the courier here\" type busy work, there's also a lot of freedom to take to the ocean and explore.  The bad news with the game is, much like AC3 and Revelations, it still lacks polish.  The actual fights can be frustrating, there's texture pop in and bugs that obviously need to be patched.  It would be nice if Ubisoft would stop releasing beta versions of their software and expecting people to plunk down $60.On the whole though, the formula might be getting a little stale but it's a relief that AC feels fun again after the awful AC3 and that alone is worth giving it 4 starts.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2013"}

RAGE was hyped up enormously prior to its launch and I was one of those gamers who looked forward to getting around to playing it. Don't get me wrong,  I enjoyed the game but I was always aware that it could have been so much better. The story is standard post-apocalyptic fare and, more notably, the script lacks humour. The gameplay and combat, while good at times, are never outstanding. It tries to create the illusion of open-world play but in fact it's pretty much a corridor shooter with defined routes and little opportunity to explore. The graphics are also deceptive: the landscapes look good from a distance but close-up the textures are disappointing. It should be noted, however, that the background music is quite impressive. There are echoes of both Borderlands and Fallout 3 here, but RAGE is a subpar game when compared to either. It's a shame that the people who brought us the excellent Doom series failed, on this occasion, to match their earlier success. I've no doubt, however, that they will regain their form in the future. 3.5/5","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2013"}
{"product_name":"B003P9FRGA","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"Red Faction Returns to its Roots...","reviewText":"Red Faction Guerrilla was a big step in the evolution of the franchise... going from FPS to a more Sandbox style game.  Despite its success at drawing in a new crowd of fans for the franchise, Red Faction Armageddon takes a step backwards to return to its roots.  In doing so this may alienate new fans of the franchise and Sandbox style, but may appeal more to the traditional FPS gamer.GAMEPLAYArmageddon changes it up from Guerrilla by going with a over the shoulder Shooter style vs the Sandbox element the previous title had.  Instead of running missions and driving around to pick up objectives you are given a clear cut path to travel.  Armed with a variety of weapons you find and can upgrade along the way, you will shoot, destroy and rebuild (only to blow it up again!) your way through the campaign.  Armageddon has a linear feel tot he game and does little to change that feeling up. While there are sometimes two paths you can take, it always leads you to the same place and puts you through similar trials(or just leads to a secret).  Despite being linear with little in the ways of exploration, the devastation this game brings is very enjoyable.  On top of your regular arsenal of weapons you have perhaps my second favorite weapon in the game.. the magnet gun (as seen in the demo).  This gun is just pro at causing mass devastation and squishing enemies between scrap.  Acquisition of your weapons like most shooters occurs linearly through gameplay.  Upgrades are tied to completion percentage to prevent you from becoming to overpowered.Overall the gameplay is a lot of fun.. Linear yes.. but very entertaining as the game almost taunts you to kill as stylishly and destructive as you can.  There is plenty to destroy, tons of enemies to have your way with so in the end you will be left satisfied.GRAPHICSThe graphics here are not anything mind blowing.. but they are very nice.  The real meat and potatoes here is the physics.  While not perfect the destructive and rebuilding elements of the game is what really sells the effects.  There are some cases where objects are rigid and do not bend nor break but for the most part, once you see your first large building almost implode on itself you'll be in awe.SOUND/STORYSound effects are fairly solid. Weapons have a fair feel and sound to them but the voice acting is a bit weak in my book. Not bad just could of been better I think.  Perhaps a lot of that has to do with the storyline.  It is very generic almost existing to take you from A to B, but I don't think people tune into Red Faction to get drama so as long as there is reason behind your actions I am fine with it.  Besides, a reason to go from A to B means more stuff to blow up!REPLAY/LENGTHReplay value I think is decent.  There are some online modes included with the game the main one being infestation mode.  Basically survival mode as you try to survive waves of mobs while using the environment to your advantage and mix in some objectives.  There also is a mode where you try to rack up as much damage as possible within a set time(Ruin Mode), but I have not checked it out yet honestly.  The campaign itself is short.. You can probably breeze through it in 5-7 hours if you just Rambo through BUT there is a plus here.. Game plus mode that is!  Once the game is completed you can re-start the campaign with all your existing stuff to further upgrade gear or just see how much more chaos you can cause.OVERALL 81% ... B-Red Faction Armageddon is not a bad game by any means.  It took a few steps back from the previous title, but returned to its roots with gameplay in doing so.  Storyline and Sandbox took a back seat to Linear progression and in your face action.  This might work for some and not for others.  With that said RF: Armageddon is a game one really needs to play to see if they enjoy it.  If you are a fan of the originals you will feel at home with this title.  If you are more into sandbox style this game might upset you with its linear, closed-in feel.  With that said I give the game an 81%.. a solid game but not for everyone.**NOTE: If you are on the boarder about the game, check out the demo to see if you like the feel of the game.  It does a fair job giving you a taste of the arsenal you will have and destructive capabilities.**NOTE: This game has perhaps the best weapon to date... Mr. Toots. Once you unlock Mr. Toots you won't stop laughing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2011"}

It just FEELS like \"You know what-  we designed this world, let's slightly change a few things and create a really weak story, record a little more dialogue, and still charge people $30 for it!\".  Lame.  I am not impressed.*You need to play the original first.  Otherwise you miss the humor here.  The controls and everything are the exact same as the first. **** \"Completely new gameplay mechanics\", as mentioned above, is an outright LIE. The game plays EXACTLY like the original - no new controls or anything here. *****The game is annoying and repetitive.  Mainly, you are literally SWARMED by hordes of undead.  The original design of the game wasn't meant to handle 10 people attacking you at once, so it's utterly annoying and frustrating to fend them off.  You have to always try and climb up on something to keep them from attacking you, which isn't easy since they quickly surround you and kill you.  You can only kill them with headshots, and since your deadeye is limited, this is pretty frustrating.  You can't buy Ammo, so you're always worrying about running out.  Or running out of deadeye.  You'll die a LOT.  And when you do, your only restart options BOTH leave you with whatever amount of ammo you had left when you died!!  ANNOYING.*Poor game design: After the initial game intro, I happened back to my \"home\" where a little cut scene showed John not going into the house and a woman's voice saying \"Remember what I told you John\".  HUH!?!!?  NO I DON'T remember, because nothing like that happened in the game!  BAD design.  I notice a lot of other inconsistencies with the writing:*MORE poor game design:  I rope a mythical creature!  Hooray!  I'm told it's one of the 4 horses of the apocalypse - named Pestilince.  \"Pestilince is nearly impossible to kill\" it says.  1 minute later, slide down an embankment, horse dies.  Good job.  John lives, of course.  But this is another example of a dumb, poorly completed game idea.  This game was made by overweight programmers in the minutes they had to spare in between designing the original and playing Call of Duty 4.*All you do is worry about conserving your ammo, and trying not to die.  It's not nearly as fun as the original.  Bad execution of an OK idea.  Story isn't much, and it's pretty quick to complete.  I think there was maybe a dozen or less actual \"missions\" I had to complete to win the game.  Weak ending - I thought it would have a better end, but it was dumb.  In fact, there is no \"ending\" - no end credits, nothing.  You just keep playing, though WHY I'll never understand.Someone at IGN must have gotten a HUGE payoff for this to achieve a \"10 out of 10\" as the sticker on the front of the box proclaims....","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular.

DiSpirito \"mentored1\"","summary":"For what it is, it is a great game","reviewText":"\"World at War\" doesn't pretend to be something other than another WW2 shooter.  With that in mind, let's discuss some of the finer points.Please keep in mind, the last COD I played was the original (COD Classic for you younguns out there), so there's a big gap in what I expect from a game.THE GOOD...- Graphics were top notch and the animations were smooth.  I noticed a few anomalies and visual artifacts, but in a game with this much detail, it's to be expected.- Audio quality was incredible.  Every gunshot, reload, death scream, war cry, and so on was done just right.  You get immersed in the sound and that's all that matters.- Controls were responsive and easy to understand.  The simple layout kept the game moving fast, which is a major plus in my book.  Complex controls are a no-go.- The story behind the campaign was great.  This edition covers the island-hopping pacific theater and the Russian push into Berlin.  The briefings were well-done and the level design was superb.  Kiefer Sutherland and Gary Oldman doing voicework is icing on the cake.- Era weapons, vehicles, buildings, and so on are all beautifully done.  Every detail sucks you into WW2.- Multiplayer is well-designed with plenty of options to keep you busy.  The Co-op campaign, split-screen play, and online play are all good.- Zombies mode is, of course, very cool.  If you can get a group of friends to play, it's a blast.THE BAD...- Campaign was very short and far too linear.  There was only one path and one way to do any of the missions, and the next objective wouldn't trigger until you pushed forward.  This is a fine idea, but when you kill hundreds of enemies in a small bunker only to have hundreds more respawn, the realism takes a huge hit.  Instead of moving into the objective area to \"win\", it might have helped to have an area be \"clear\" when X number of enemies were slain.- In some areas, it is far too easy to die.  This is war, so I'm not asking to survive without a scratch, but it seems you can take many gunshots and recover by resting a few seconds... only to die when a grenade goes off nearby.  Again, I've no problem with realism, but there's a disconnect with certain types of situations in regards to death.- It seems that the multiplayer matching system isn't the best, but maybe it's because the game has been out for a bit and everyone has moved on to the newest COD.- I know it's part of Black Ops, but a split screen or local play mode with AI enemies would have been a welcome edition to any of the older COD titles.  It could have been done way back in the day... what's the excuse?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00113JSCG","reviewerName":"Evildead11","summary":"Terrible.  Just...Terrible.","reviewText":"Are you one of those people that enjoys pain and self torture?  Does the idea of poking yourself in the eye with a sharp object sound pleasurable to you?  Then look no further - this game is for you!  I'm actually very disappointed in myself.  I typically read multiple reviews prior to buying a game and, for the most part, I am influenced on whether or not to spend any money on it based on those reviews.  However, for whatever reason, I let my curiousity get the best of me this time.  I ignored the scathing reviews and actually let the one or two decent reviews talk me into buying this farce of a game.  How diasppointed was I?  Well, I spent $3.99 + shipping, so about $7.00 total.  That's a complete meal at Taco Bell.  I'd have gotten 1,000 times more enjoyment out of some Taco Bell tacos than I did with this piece of crap.  It's really like I spent $7.00 for someone to kick me in the sack...hard.Why am I making this game sound so terrible?  Because it's terrible.  Unplayable.  I can't remember the last time I started playing a game and was already yelling at my TV in frustration less than 10 minutes in.  Oh wait, yes I can, it was the last time I tried to play this POS.  If this game has any redeeming quality whatsoever, it's that it looks good.  The graphics are clean and well done.  The good points end there.  Regardless of how good it looks, you can't enjoy it because you'll be too frustrated trying to control the idiot protagonist.  I read a review on this game that described the controls as being similar to a tank with a broken engine.  That is spot on.  Just trying to move the jerk so you can focus on a specific point is like pulling teeth.  Trying to actually platform is even more of a joke.  Sometimes, the B button will be jump.  Other times it will be drop down.  I guess it's whatever the game decides at any given time.  And combat?  YIKES.  You \"focus\" on an enemy and \"swing\" the right stick to hit enemies with whatever object you can find.  After 50 or so shots to the head with a chair, the enemy will drop...for a few seconds...and get right back up unless you drag the limp body over some fire to fully kill it.  Sound stupid?  It is.  Very.  The sound of the game is also lame.  The voice acting is hilariously bad.  Like something out of a C movie.  Not a B movie, a C movie.So let's see...it controls like crap, sounds like crap, has a convoluted story that I never got into because the game is so crappy that I couldn't bare to continue past the first 45 minutes, and well, it's just crap.  To anyone that claims to have played all the way through this game and considers it a \"hidden gem\" is EASILY entertained, has an unnatural patience level and has likely never played a truly decent game.  Otherwise, I can really think of no reason anyone would derive any type of pleasure from this title.  The developers of this game should be embarrassed to have been a part of this POS.  I'm actually embarrassed to have it on my shelf.  I tried to give it to my neighbor - for free - and I got a response of, \"No thanks, dude.\"  He must've read the reviews that I ignored.This game is easily in the top 5 worst games I've ever played in my life, and that's after only playing 45 minutes of it.  I refuse to give this farce any more of my time.  If you're considering buying this game, don't.  You've been warned.Overall: 1/5 - I'd TOTALLY give it a 0/5 if possible.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2013"}

The shape is almost identical and so is the joystick and button arrangement. The trigger buttons are shaped like the PS3's but everything else is like the 360's, including the concavity of the joysticks, which have several raised dots on them for traction just like Microsoft's controller. Even the quadrant lights are the same (numbered clockwise 1-4), indicating controller number. The only major difference is the textured rubber handholds. They are like little raised pyramids. It's like getting a free hand massage while you play.Here's what I liked and didn't like:PROS:- connected to dongle right away. No syncing fuss.- does not need line of sight- comes w/ USB mini-to-mini cable (though you probably already have dozens of these)- same features as PS3 controller (SIXAXIS, rumble, internal rechargeable battery)CONS:- is not Bluetooth. Needs a large and rather hideous USB dongle the size of a thumb drive- home button does not turn on the PS3- controller number indicator very difficult to read- analog joystick has weird gummy, sticky feel- sticks and buttons feel a bit different than both the PS3 and 360 controller- permanently assigns itself as controller 1, even when you power on the PS3 from another controller.NEITHER/NOR:- textured grip- red backlit buttons- size of XBOX 360 controllerIn terms of ergonomics, I didn't find this controller all that comfortable. It's the same overall size and shape as the 360's, but small design differences matter a lot and add up, especially if you're going to be holding this for an hour or more. I played for about 20 minutes and found my right index finger starting to get fatigued. R1 seemed a bit too far away and the right analog stick raised too high, forcing my hand to contort into a wider curl position than I'm used to. As for the textured grip, I've never had a problem with sweaty hands, so this adds nothing of value. The material on the joysticks is a bit weird. It felt gummy and sticky to the touch and I don't like it at all.The USB dongle is certainly something you may want to consider. It's just another thing to lose (remember losing your Guitar Hero dongle?!), and it blocks a free USB port, though you can plug the cable into the front of the dongle for charging. The Home button does not turn on the PS3 like the official controller does. It also has a smaller listening radius. I walked to the bathroom and the controller lost connectivity with the receiver, which the official PS3 controller does not do.Lastly, the quadrant LED indicator is very confusing and I could not tell which channel mine was. The entire circle lit up due to light bleed, not just a quadrant. It also doesn't turn on the PS3, a major consideration if you're lazy like I am.I love the original PS3 controller and recommend it over this product. There is no substantial savings buying this third-party product, and given the flaws, I'd happily spend a few more dollars for the official PS3 controller. If you insist on having a 360-like controller, you may wish to give this another look despite my caveats.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00149ILCK","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Grand Theft Auto: WWII France","reviewText":"The French Resistance is one of those shadowy organizations that poked its head out for one impressive run during the darkest days of Nazi occupied france. And while the success rate of Sean, our intrepid hero, is probably 10000% above where his real life counterpart made it, the experience is still impressive. The Sabotuer follows Sean, an Irish race car driver trapped in Paris and is sburban enclaves just after the invasion, and reeling from the murder of his best friend at the hands of a Nazi \"scientist.\"Graphics are fairly standard, up to snuff without any glorious trailblazing. The \"Noir\" color scheme, soft muted grays against with only the blood red nazi banenrs and arm bands stand out, is a pretty rejoinder that serves to spice things up.Audio is also spot on, and the accents are done well without being so thick you need a translation on the translation. I do wish there were more people to talk to, as even canned conversations are preferable to a personal army of mutes.Gameplay is surpisingly hit and miss. The immediate reminder is rather like infamous, clambering over structures to reach targets of opportunity. A collection of weapons and vehicles, as well as abilities improvements based on in game actions round things out nicely, but feel rather slapdash. The exchange system is a bit haphazard as well, as theres little in the way of loot, and thoguh they try to include snippets on what you collect, you can't bring yourself to care much, since its easier to bomb things. And bomb things you do. You set charges, and explosives, and rig booby traps, and plant munitions, and a few other analogys for slap a block of dynamite and light it with your lighter. And while it manages to hold its charm for a whiel, its eventually as repetitive as the sun rising in the east. Combats a decent mix of shooter and hand to hand, which is actually effective enough to justify, rather than feeling vestigial after laying hands on some guns.On the downside, there are bugs. Lots of bugs. Bugs on top of bugs. Clipping issues, teleporting enemies, total failures of sound, and spotting problems, and flying cars were all spotted in multiple numbers within the first two hours of play. And some of the characters are ludicrious to the point that you think they're \"special\" rather than evil. The kind of monologue where you seem to be mudering a baby with one hand while devouring a live puppy with the other are nice for Bond villians, but should've been toned down to reality like levels. And their DLC seems to be reaching for the bottom of the barrel, as its advertisement seemed apropo to some areas of Las Vegas, but not being 13 anymore, I didn't feel compelled to shell out extra dollars for a \"nudity\" option.For a swan song, the Sabotuer is okay. Not great, but definitely not a failure. Too much repitition of the \"free gameplay\" is balanced by some entertaining missions and dialogue. While the bugs are frequent enough to garner some serious stink, this latest nazi shoot is still worth a look.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2009"}

Maybe they could fly me to Japan and I'll give them specific design or art advice. I don't speak Japanese, but I can point and nod with precision. I could poke Miyamoto in the shoulder until he agrees to my changes. Then maybe, because I'm awesome, every Nintendo game would get a 100% on Metacritic.

Sometimes she likes to watch me play, but she'll help by blowing. Zelda's main plot is 25 hours long and this requires a lot of blowing from my wife. I'm tall and can't reach. The princess art is mildly erotic, but I doubt any kids would drool. I'm just particularly sensitive to large-headed empowered women. Basically, even though I'm American, and I think American, and I talk and write American, That's okay. This games would totally get mostly nods, and I would only poke Miyamoto a few times, but he would already understand, and Just Smile, because he's ticklish and knows that even 5-star games have 4-star moments, but they \"ain't gonna spank the fun\" (He said that in Japanese and I translated but I think his words were different because I couldn't hear because he was tickling me because that's what it's like to experience the Nintendo Seal Of Quality.BUY IT.

For all of the critical praise that the ongoing Legend of Zelda saga has received in recent years, the online backlash towards the past few entries has been harsh. While Twilight Princess and Phantom Hourglass introduced new wrinkles to the series, the dungeon-trekking foundation that's been in place since the original - or at least Link to the Past - is starting to feel creaky. Spirit Tracks, the latest Zelda and Nintendo's big handheld title from last fall, suggested that cartoony locomotives might be the solution, but unfortunately riding the rails is the worst part of an otherwise wonderful adventure.Phantom Hourglass was unusual in that it followed the events of 2003's The Wind Waker, instead of just hitting the traditional Hyrule reset button. If you've seen any cel-shaded Spirit Tracks screens, then you've probably realized that this game is another direct sequel. Unlike PH, this game takes place 100 years after Tetra, the King of Red Lions and all of that time-consuming sailing. It's clear that this is the same world though, with plenty of references to the old toon games sprinkled throughout.The leap in time means that the world has dried up, so wheels are required to get to each isolated outpost. I figure we should get the bad stuff out of the way first: traveling via train is a snooze. While the boat always offered some freedom of movement, the tracks in place only allow 90 degree turns, and there's just not much to explore in between. I know that some of you tired of changing wind direction or that heinous Triforce fetch quest at the end of WW, but if you look at it objectively, there were tons of little treasures and uncharted islands scattered around too. In Spirit Tracks, you've got some randomly spawning enemies, some rabbits and...well, that's about it.These long stretches of nothingness are made even longer thanks to the slow default engine speed and one-hit-killer locomotives patrolling near major junctions. You can upgrade parts of your train at a trading post later in the game, and warp points are uncovered if you complete side quests, but the reality is that you'll be spending about a third of the adventure shoveling coal and fighting boredom.The good news is that almost everything else about Spirit Tracks is wonderful. This is not the radical departure from the series' traditions that you may have been hoping for, but it is a much more refined handheld Zelda than Phantom Hourglass (and I thought PH was great already).From a storytelling standpoint, Spirit Tracks is surprisingly sophisticated. The villain is a toon-shaded dweeb and the imminent release of a big bad demon is familiar, but the direction of the cutscenes and the expressiveness on the characters' faces still shine.  This particular world always appealed to me more than the Tolkien-lite Ocarina offshoots, and this game looks really sharp whenever the camera zooms in. And while I expect nothing less from Nintendo's localization wizards, the witty script - with plenty of old-school callbacks - endears too.There's still some overworld exploration (which unfortunately puts you back in that conductor's seat), but you'll spend most of your time solving puzzles in the handful of dungeons. Again, it's familiar - find a new tool/weapon, track down the boss and collect your hear piece - but the designs rely less on obvious riddles compared to PH. Touch screen controls still feel great, especially when you're swinging across a chasm with your grappling hook or blowing into your mic to create whirlwinds with a big leaf.The main elemental dungeons are fun, but the return trips to the central Tower of Spirits are where Spirit Tracks comes closest to matching Link's Awakening as the best portable Zelda. In each of these segments, there are no new items to collect, boss keys to find or anything else to distract you from your ascent to the top. (OK, those droplets of light might qualify, but you gather them pretty quickly.) It's just Link and Zelda against the series' most devious puzzles, which play with perspective and almost every ability at your disposal.And yes, I did say Zelda. Nintendo has not hidden the fact that the titular princess is along for the ride as a disembodied spirit. After you strike tower guards from behind, she can possess their armor. In her clunky suit, Zelda can walk over lava and spikes. Better yet, her increased strength allows her to push hefty boulders and carry Link to safety. If you enjoyed the two partner dungeons in The Wind Waker, you'll have a ball here.While I wish these moments made up the entire game, the level design is strong enough to overshadow those bumpy train rides. I hope that Nintendo is using a new blueprint for the next Wii Zelda, but this DS entry shows that the old formula is still relevant.*In case you're wondering, I didn't get to try the multiplayer mode. Nintendo axed wi-fi support, so if you ran a Phantom Hourglass clan, you might want to reconsider your purchase.--Reviewed by Justin Hemenway","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2010"}

Studious Wizards survey the oasis-strewn deserts of the Silver Cities... The grim Necromancers worship in the wastelands of Heresh...and the ravenous demons are immured in Sheogh, their prison world.    During certain lunar eclipses the walls of Sheogh weaken and demons burst forth, plunging Ashan into war. And since the dawn of times, the demon legions have been repelled by the allies thanks to a powerful artifact known as the Blade of Binding.    Once again the armies of Sheogh are coming and the Blade will be wielded...     Your journey in the world of Might and Magic will be punctuated with riddles, extraordinary encounters and epic battles against creatures searching for some fresh hero blood. Your hero will travel thanks to a node system, so watch your step as some of these nodes might trigger special actions, hide terrifying traps or even legendary treasures such as forgotten artifacts or secret units.    To stand a chance against your enemies, your hero will have to equip magical artifacts and build up the most powerful army. Your army will be composed of Core, Elite and Champion units, each of them having specific sizes, strengths and abilities. It&#x2019;s up to you to choose wisely each of these units combined to the appropriate artifact and work out the best strategy to wipe out your enemies.    While roaming around Ashan or winning battles, you will discover new artifacts and gather different types of resources such as Ore, Gold and Blood Crystals. These earnings can be used to buy new Elite or Champion units for your army through specific Creature Dwelling buildings. Make sure to look everywhere as you will be able to unlock and collect powerful hidden units and artifacts!    You will be confronted with many challenges such as defeating the enemy heroes by crossing their armies in standard battles or launching into special challenges and Boss fights where your strategic skills will be put to a severe test. Finally, you can solve puzzle battles and get powerful rewards by finding the right combination and wipe-out the enemy in a limited number of turns.","reviewerName":"techmannn \"techmannn\"","summary":"Fun but there's a random luck element","reviewText":"The game is an interesting variation of \"match 3 gems\" games that are so popular on portable platforms. Random \"troops\" fall down in columns and you use your troops to fight the enemy troops that appear on the other screen.  As the game progresses, you get new heroes with a few special abilities (like defensive walls that heal or rebuild) and new troops that might be stronger or faster to attack.It is a decidedly fun game but there are issues too: Your troops are random, which obviously makes planning attacks tricky at best. One lucky \"gem\" for the enemy that sets up a bunch of stone walls and your plans that you've spent several turns on go poof.  Personally I didnt love the randomness and that's why I cant offer the 5 star reviews that others are giving this game.  Also, the campaign is carefully structured, but you _will_ encounter annoying difficulty spikes in which you cannot level up your hero, yet you have to fight higher level enemies and hope for a lucky win. There's that \"luck\" word again.There are just too many times when I am defeated easily then I replay that battle with no changes made by me, but get better ramdom troops during the battle  and then I win easily.It will be interesting to see what they do with a sequel -- there's a solidly good game here that just needs some tweaking.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2009"}

One of the best game graphics EVER!- Fun: This is where the problem begins... The game is too hard. You must spend something like 40 hours to beat it without a walkthrough... And you have to walk A LOT to go from a place to another one...This makes you REALLY tired... The boss battles make your fingers hurt really bad! You'll surely be confused about controlling Samus. It's really hard too. Every time I play this game, it gives me a big headache.

Newcomers engage old favorites in interactive, multileveled arenas. New strategies in fighting are introduced with the addition of walls, terrain effects, position changes, and enhanced side-stepping. Expanded game modes such as training, team battle, and the new Tekken Force provide the player with a deeper gameplay experience.","reviewerName":"Ted Del Prato \"technodemon\"","summary":"Adds some much needed innovations to the Tekken series","reviewText":"So what's different about Tekken 4 compared to Tekken 3 and Tag-Tournament? Well, the most obvious difference is the addition of walled in arenas. No longer do you have to fight on those weird looking infinite arenas. Now you can pummel your opponent up against walls, phone booths, trees, and many other obstacles. Also new to Tekken 4 is the position change technique. This is a new move that every fighter can perform that allows you to push your opponent where you want them (this can come in handy when being cornered up against a wall). New characters that make their debut in Tekken 4 are Craig Marduk (a huge Vale Tudo fighter that has a much better variety of throws and powerful attacks than Jack ever had), Steve Fox (a boxer who uses mainly punches but possesses incredible speed), and Christie Monterio (a female Eddy Gordo replacement). Most of the older characters have only a few new attacks, but Jin has been changed almost completely. He now uses a form of traditional karate...but don't worry, he's just as fast and powerful as before. The graphics are now more crisp and defined than ever. Few objects in the backround show any signs of blurriness at all. The music of Tekken 4 isn't very memorable, but at least it fits the mood for each stage. Unfortunately, the Tekken Force mode is a fun distraction, but it becomes boring after 10 or 15 minutes of pummeling of waves of cookie cutter goons. The older characters could have used a little more revamping, and I would have liked to see at least 1 or 2 more entirely new characters...but I believe Tekken 4 packs enough new features to satisfy fans of the series. Definitely buy it if fighters are your genre.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2002"}

One to four players control their characters on the same screen beating up on bad guys, gaining levels and learning new powers.  The game is substantially more complex than the Marvel series of games with the additional factor of finding and equipping a large variety of armors.Hardcore gamers will appreciate the fact that the console version of D3 is more accessible for casual gamers.  The equipment and skill menus do display an overwhelming amount of information that will take 15-30 minutes for a newbie to pick up and understand.  Nonetheless, the game is completely playble by casual gamers who don't want to obsess over minute stat differences in gear and simply equip what the game reccomends via the green up arrows (for upgrades) and red down arrows (for downgrades) that are displayed for three simplified categories for each piece of gear (damage, armor and health).In my opinion, D3 is the best game yet in the surprisingly sparse genre of local co-op video games.  It offers better story and gameplay than any entry from the Marvel series of games.  It offers more replayability and complexity than Castle Crashers and other similar Xbox Arcade/Playstation Store games.  If you relish local co-op games that can be enjoyed by hardcore and casual gamers alike, you can't go wrong with D3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2013"}

The whole screen fills up with tiles and the object is to spell words. The words can snake in any direction as long as the letters connect. Longer, more difficult words and words that incorporate special tiled letters gain more points.There are three modes of play.CLASSIC:In this version, the players can take as long as necessary to form the words. As long as the fire tiles don't reach the floor, the game continues. My advice is to use those fire tiles up as soon as possible. This is my favorite mode of play.ACTION:The longer we take, the more tiles turn to fire and we must hustle to use them up to keep them from reaching the floor.MULTIPLAYER:Yes, play against another player! Both players must have his/her own DS, but only one needs have the game cartridge inserted into the DS. The players take turns -- host goes first. The player who gets enough points to reach the goal first wins.Each player's turn is timed and he loses his turn if he doesn't spell a word. There are no fire tiles. Each player's screen is different and we see only the screen of the player whose turn it is. I actually don't like that, because I don't have a chance to ponder my next move as the other player is playing.SUMMARYCan you say addicting? I love this game, and so do my kids. They are 5 and 8. As you can see, this game can be played by all ages. Younger kids simply spell shorter words.Some of the words we spell will be defined on the top screen (on the left hand side, because the screen is rotated for this game). I like this feature, because sometimes I know a word but I haven't a clue what it means. I'm sure that is true for my kids and the definitions can make the game all the more educational.As for left-handed players, both my son and I are left-handed, and we manage to play this game. It would be nicer if they allowed us left-handed players to rotate the screen in the opposite direction so that our hands don't block the left screen, where the points and our progress is displayed but oh well.I highly recommend this game for adults as well as children.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2009"}

I've heard all the GOW comparisons and I really don't see it myself. It reminds me more of Castlevania Lord of Shadows than it does GOW.This game was worth the $59.99 I paid for it on release day.

HardwareNot nearly as powerful as the Nvidia Shield, but more powerful than the 3DS. Games look great regardless.2. Software/OSEasy to navigate and learn. Not much can be said.3. ButtonsThey're alright. I find the back touchpad to be unless, but it's needed for some games and remote play on the PS3 and PS4. Touchscreen it really accurate (not pen needed for accuracy). The Start, Select and PS Home buttons and small and oval. I prefer the buttons on the PS Vita 2000 more. They're circular. May not seem like a big deal, but I would takes those over what I got.4. GamesMany people say it doesn't have as many as the 3DS. That may be true, but the games it does have are great. And it's not like it only has five games. It has a ton! Again, not as much as the 3DS doesn't mean not much. To be honest I prefer more games on the Vita than the 3DS (I have both). Although both have great RPG's so you can't go wrong with either.5. AppsYouTube, Facebook, Netflix are some. Videos look beautiful in HD.6. OnlineNot really grand. :-/ Handhelds systems are not as big on this as consoles. You still can play online multiplayer.

The Ps4 literally has NO advantage over the XBOX one besides price. The graphics are the same but XBOX one does farrr more and is more than just a video game system unlike the playstation. I love video games but you always want your gaming system to do more than just video games, the PS4 isn't very good at that, the XB1 meanwhile is designed to be everything you want it to be. Frankly the PS4 feels outdated already compared to it, it's almost like a PS3 with a better controller and next gen graphics. While the xbox has a far better controller than the playstation, comes with kinet, you can jump from tv to a game without have to switch between inputs (more awesome than you think), also the xbox one looks far better and much more like a quality product. Plus Titanfall will NEVER be on playstation! Then there's the online experience. If you want to play online don't bother with playstation. Xbox live is the best multiplier service hand's down and they have far more reliable servers.Overall the Xbox one may cost more but you actually get way more for your money.

Capcom's Street Fighter series has been marveled as the most widely successful fighting game series to date. Among the more than half-dozen Street Fighter games that have come out, nearly all of them have been highly competitive and have been the highlight of many international tournaments. The secret to the recipe is the overall balance, depth and sheer difficulty of the games. With that said, this next-generation installment of the series has been highly anticipated for quite some time, and thankfully it doesn't disappoint.Unlike many other fighting games, Street Fighter IV is very combo-based. Button-mashing proves unsuccessful while speed and timing are absolutely necessary to win. The game sports a large cast of characters with all kinds of different unique abilities ranging from the defensive such as M. Bison, to the more offensive fighters like Akuma. Street Fighter IV includes several game modes that range from a typical arcade mode to a challenge mode that has dozens of very difficult challenges that reward you with unlockables. The arcade mode begins with an introduction the character of your choosing and sends you on a journey to fight different fighters around the world, and you eventually fight your biggest rival as well as the final boss. Subsequently, characters as well as videos and online titles are unlocked by just about everything you complete which makes this a very rewarding experience.Controls:Any fighting games controls can either make or break the game. Thankfully, Street Fighter IV has very quick and responsive controls which at times suck you into the gameplay. Each character has several special abilities which all require special inputs that take a lot of practice to master, and many experts recommend buying a fighting stick if you want to compete with the best. With that said, the PS3 controller's D-Pad work perfectly fine but with intense play your thumb will throb with pain due to the technicality of the game.Graphics:Thankfully, Capcom went with a 3D cell-shaded design for the game which came out looking amazing. The game is played on a 2D plane as seen in the previous titles but all of the graphics are rendered in 3D. Overall, the game looks great and the quality of the series has been preserved but given a very welcomed facelift.Sound:The music for Street Fighter IV is good but not great. On the other hand the sound effects are very well done and the unique sound of the series has remained the same. Also, both Japanese and English voiceovers have been included and both are absolutely top-notch.Replay Value:The story-mode can be beaten within about 30 minutes but that's only the beginning. Challenge mode has trial, survival and time modes which all have both normal and hard modes. Each challenge mode rewards you with unlocks as you progress. Also, there are more than half-a-dozen unlockable characters which take a lot of time to unlock, and all of them are very interesting. To top that off is a full-fledged online mode which features titles and icons to deck out your profile. The online mode is great addition and probably one of the best online fighting experiences to date. Overall, you're looking at over 60-100 hours of play time before you might feel like you've done everything, and that's assuming you practice enough to be able to complete the toughest objectives.Rating:Story: 5.0Gameplay: 10.0Graphics: 9.0Controls: 9.5Sound: 9.0Replay Value: 9.5Overall: 9.3Own, Rent, Avoid:Own: This is without a doubt the best fighting game this generation and the content included will keep any fighting game fan busy for a long timeLast Thoughts:Capcom has finally released their next-generation Street Fighter game and it's absolutely stunning.

The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Richard Kiel \"theThing\"","summary":"Just an upgrade on the GBA","reviewText":"Lets face it, the DS is a new, innovative system.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Brilliant, just brilliant","reviewText":"It's becoming ever more apparent that the PS2's days are numbered, but just like they did last year, Atlus has delivered once again.  Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 continues what Persona 3 (and Persona 3 FES) started in completely re-inventing the RPG series, and while it doesn't leave quite as large an impact upon the gamer as the last game, Persona 4 is a brilliant game in it's own right.  After meeting up with your group, strange killings begin to happen, leading you into being able to travel into the mysterious Midnight Channel, where you are able to unleash personae and navigate randomly generated dungeons.  While the dungeon floors aren't nearly as deep as the last time around, the game is all the more fresher because of it, and once again you're entrusted in keeping up relationships and personal growth in order to succeed during combat.  The characters and story are deeply developed, the combat is fun, and the multiple themed dungeons are inventive, varied, and beg to be explored.  If there's any drawbacks to the game, it's some occasional camera issues, and the fact that presentation wise, virtually nothing has changed since the last game.  That aside, Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 is an engaging, addictive, and brilliant RPG that offers so much to keep you occupied, and may very well be the last, great game we'll see on the PS2.  If indeed it is, what a way to go out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00005NZ1G","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions.

Since its release, the game has been updated and improved significantly, especially the removal of the forced Sonic Colors motion controls, which was one of the main complaints about the game. I do think this game has a bit of a learning curve for those used to the controls of 3d Sonic games of the past- I wasn't sure I liked it at first, but once I adapted to it, I found myself really enjoying it. Plus, this is the best looking Sonic game ever, with some of the most inventively fun levels yet.Now let me mention the DLC for this game, as it is something truly special. There is a NiGHTS themed level which is ok, but in an unheard of crossover with Nintendo, there is a Yoshi's Island themed level, and an amazing Zelda themed level, which seems mainly a mix of Ocarina of Time and Skyward Sword, and it's just plain awesome. And, all of the DLC is free.We may not get a Sonic Team developed Sonic game again, or at least for some time- the next Sonic game  has been turned over to a western developer, and what they have done so far with their new character designs looks truly dreadful, so I recommend you enjoy this one while you can.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2014"}

It has great Final Fantasy characters such as Cloud,Leon,Auron, and Sephiroth, the only bummer I thought was they left Vincent Valentine out of the game.

Start your rock career playing small clubs and bars -- if you play well you'll fill stadiums and arenas. Includes the incredible Guitar Hero SG Controller -- it looks and feels just like a real guitar. Strap it on and crank it up!","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"Rock out","reviewText":"Music and rhythm games have long found their prime in Dance Dance Revolution, the hit arcade/Playstation 2/Xbox dancing video game. Harmonix and RedOctane saw potential in something more than moving the feet of gamers-they decided to stand us up, put a guitar in our hands, and let us rock out. Guitar Hero, the guitar video game they released last November, is one of the most entertaining games to date and is far and wide the best,  most addictive music/rhythm game I've ever played.Such a bold statement isn't one to be ignored, but Guitar Hero is worthy of such praise. A little more than thirty songs and one guitar controller is everything this $70+ package provides. Featuring [cover] songs from 80's metal icons like Ozzy Ozzbourne and Motorhead as well as recent bands like Franz Ferdinand and Queens of the Stone Age, Guitar Hero has quite a variety of music that doesn't grow stale and I'd imagine that my guitar controller will wear out long before my attention to this game does.The songs are played with five fret buttons, colored Green, Red, Yellow, Blue, and Orange. These five frets must be held while a Strum Bar is pressed up or down to strum each note. That is the basic control of every song. Playing the fast notes of Pantera's \"Cowboys from Hell\" or Boston's slower \"More Than a Feeling\" are done very easily with these buttons. Of course, a fully-functional whammy bar is also provided to electronically alter any long note found in a song, and more difficult guitar techniques like hammer-ons are also possible with the controller. Mastering these techniques isn't really necessary, as I completed the game on a Normal difficulty setting before I even discovered them in the tutorial mode, but they're available for real-life shredders unlike myself.Suffice to say that nailing a solo or a long note gives a huge feeling of accomplishment, and Guitar Hero does more than make the player feel like a rock star. I really got into this game, and laugh if you want, but when I say I got into it-I got into it. Imagine the tongue hanging out, leaning back during a long note, head-banging, the whole shabang. I'd look like a fool in public, but playing this with a group of friends is no more embarrassing than stressing your vocal chords in Karaoke Revolution or moving your feet in Dance Dance Revolution. Needless to say, this game is just fun. Not only that, but playing these songs really made me appreciate just how difficult playing a guitar really is. Guitar Hero doesn't make you hit every note (at least, not until you switch to Hard or Extreme difficulty) but it sure as heck makes you work for your song.You know, Guitar Hero really nails something that has long been missing from a majority of today's games. It doesn't focus on graphics-the note bar that you stare at isn't particularly attractive, and neither are the band models that fill up the background-but Guitar Hero goes to show that there is some innovation, there are some fresh concepts, and there are some great ideas left in video gaming. This video game not only captured my attention, it captured the attention of my 40+ year-old dad, all of my little siblings, and pretty much anyone around me who set their eyes on the game. It's addictive as crack and the only thing stopping me from playing is sore fingers and tired legs from standing up, rocking out.If you like rock music, music video games, guitars, Ozzy, or anything even closely related to Guitar Hero, I strongly urge you to head to the local gaming outlet and buy this game. It might have a hefty price, up to $80 in some stores, but it is more than worth the price. You'll be replaying \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\" and \"Killer Queen\" so many times that the dent in your wallet won't even matter. It's a shame that Guitar Hero only has 30 songs-I not only predict, but expect a sequel or expansion pack-but that's beside the point. I bow to Harmonix and RedOctane for this product. I am simply in love with it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2006"}

Conker encounters abusive paint pots; jabbering dung beetles; trigger-happy, scar-faced Tediz; and a belligerent giant, with only a frying pan as a means of self-defense.

It features cinematic cutscenes, movie parodies, facial expressions, dozens of unhinged characters, and 1- to 4-player deathmatch games in a variety of styles.","reviewerName":"Simon","summary":"Nintendo will NEVER be the same again...","reviewText":"From the company that prides itself on fun, kid-oriented games like Pokemon, Mario, Kirby, and other mascots...comes Conker, the beer-drinking, frying-pan toting squirrel who's having a VERY bad day. When you have a mature title that's completely backed by Nintendo and developed by Rareware, the creators of such masterpieces like GoldenEye 007, Perfect Dark, Banjo-Kazooie/Tooie, Blast Corps, and so on, you know the game is going to be good. Heck, you know a game HAS to be good when it features a boss known as the \"Great Mighty Poo.\"Conker's BFD isn't as offensive as it was made out to be. All the really bad swearing is replaced by the standard beeping noises, and the strong sexual inneundo is limited to only one or two parts of the game. The rest of the game features either graphic, cartoon violence (exploding cows, flying body parts) or bathroom humour (urinating on bad guys, biting opponents in the 'twig and berries'). With the ommission of the more sexual stuff, my brother and sister, still in grade school, were mature enough to handle everything else, and the three of us had a blast playing Conker.Even if the gameplay was bad (which it isn't), Conker's BFD is still a great technical achievement. All the characters talk, which makes for A LOT of speech, and their words are lip-synched to their mouths, and they all have real-time facial expressions. Environments are varied, including spoofs on The Matrix, Gladiator, and Saving Private Ryan. Rare never fails to milk the N64 hardware for all its worth.Gameplay is very diverse. First off, Rare's habit of making players collect tons of stuff to add \"replay\" value is not in this game. All players will collect is money, and really, who doesn't want that? An all purpose \"context sensitive\" pad allows Conker to do whatever it takes to get that money. When standing atop one of these pads, one can pull out guns, a slingshot, or pull out some odd prop like a detonator to complete the task. The controls are easy to learn, and with Conker moving from one completely different situation to the next, the game never becomes boring. It's short, yes, but there is the option of allowing the player to replay their favourite scenes, which they can proudly demonstrate to friends. This is a great feature, because like a good movie, Conker's BFD features many hilarious situations and events which must be scene to be believed. The writing staff at Rare is sharp, witty, and even included some odd British humour. Above all that, the game includes tons of multiplayer modes which can be played against computer opponents or real friends.My one gripe with Conker's BFD are the controls. Conker can be difficult to maneuver at times, partly due to a clumsy camera system. You'll come across many frustrating events where you have to crawl across a beam or navigate an obstacle course, only you'll fall or get squashed, die, and restart all over again. It's nothing that a little patience can't master, and you'll be glad you did, but the game can go from fun to frustrating real fast.However, Conker is an excellent game. It's a technical marvel, with lots of humour and diverse gameplay modes. This odd, N64 classic needs to be in your collection. Get it before the N64 becomes completely obsolete.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2002"}

Typically I lean towards open ended, player driven RPG games over linear experiences, but the moment I started up Alan Wake I knew I was hooked.  This psychological thriller grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the end.Imagine David Lynch adapting a Steven King novel.  That is the best way to describe the feel of Alan Wake's single-player campaign.  As Alan Wake you are thrust into the quirky Washington town of Bright Falls where you encounter all manner of quirky characters as you try to save your wife from the evil darkness hidden with the lake.  Your only weapon against a never-ending stream of nightmares is light (flashlights, flashbangs, flares, etc.)  and your own will power.First off: Alan Wake is GORGEOUS!  This is without doubt one of the best looking games on the Xbox 360.  The Washington landscapes, the town of Bright Falls-- all of it just looks great.  The motion capture for the characters is also really good.The game play mechanics of burning darkness away from your enemies works great.  This isn't a typical action shooter (you're supposed to feel vulnerable) but that doesn't hold back the combat controls from being fluid and effective.  Lots of horror/thriller games don't have very good gameplay controls, but Alan Wake passes with flying colors!Writing is where Alan Wake truly shines.  The story is  well told and full of memorable characters.  Alan Wake himself is a fully realized character.  Playing as him you feel vulnerable and on the higher difficulties will struggle to stay alive.  As a character Alan is also an interesting case.  He struggles with anger management, and clearly has inner demons he's working through.  The way the plot unfolds you are given brief glimpses into this man on the edge and are constantly given reason to doubt his (and by extension YOUR) perception of reality within the game.The game is also accompanied by a wonderful soundtrack with original music by Poets of the Fall and old favorites such as David Bowie.  Petri Alanko's score can range from chilling to beautifully poignant depending on the scene.  All and al it perfectly adds to an already great game.In Alan Wake developer Remedy has crafted a masterpiece of interactive story telling.  We can only hope that one day we'll see further adventures of Alan.

Not so much for MPH's single player.  It has a decent story about a telepathic message that was sent telling about how the secret to the ultimate power lies within the Alimbic Cluster.  The Galactic Federation sends power house bounty hunter Samus Aran to find out the mystery of the telepathic message.  But Samus won't be the only bounty hunter on the job, 6 others are racing to find the ultimate power.  The single-player is somewhat fun but quite repetitive.  This is how each time a level goes.  You go into a level, you fight some enemies(There aren't even that many varieties of enemies, they're just different versions of it), you solve some easy puzzles, you fight a bounty hunter(or hunters), you find 3 artifacts, you take a portal to a boss fight(There are only 2 actual octolith bosses, they're just different versions that have been tweaked a bit), you get the octolith and evacuate.  That's it and the only thing that changes is what level you're in.  I'd have to say that the first four octoliths(There are eight, hence the name) are pretty fun since it's the first time you're in the level.  But the last 4 are pretty boring, you just cover the same ground with a few extra rooms and follow the same pattern mentioned above.  The hunters aren't really even implemented into the game, after meeting up with them you engage in a short 2-3 minute fight.  They change planets(Or space stations) and you can fight them again but, they're really easy.  In a game called Metroid Prime HUNTERS, you'd expect the hunters to be the beef of the game but they're not.  The bosses(excluding Gorea and the fire and ice bosses) are just long and annoying, they don't even really move.  The single-player music was boring and uninteresting(Though I found the Alinos music to be pretty cool).  And they even made the music creepy when the setting wasn't even creepy(Stasis Bunker in single-player).  The game has missiles, energy tanks, ammo upgrades, and even sub-weapons.  But they're so few it's not fun trying to hunt down every one.  They're aren't even any power ups, as you start out with them.  Here's my problem, there are no metroids, and for a game with METROID PRIME in it, there is no Metroid Prime.  Metroid Prime was the final boss in Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime was Dark Samus in Metroid Prime 2.  So shouldn't it make sense to have Metroid Prime in here disguised as one of the hunters or something?  Scanning doesn't play a big role in the game but you still use it and I miss reading what space pirates(There are no space pirates besides Weavel) and Federation troopers thought.  The final boss(Which has a secret second part) somewhat provides a challenge but it's just unimaginative(Though I loved the inclusion of a super weapon).  Phew...now you're done listening to the bad stuff.Now Multi-player, this is where the game rocks.  Samus and 6 other bounty hunters face off in 26 arenas and 7 game modes(With tons of customizable game options).  You can even turn on bots!  Something you couldn't do in the multi-player of Metroid Prime 2.  All the game modes are fun but the hunters aren't exactly balanced(Did I mention that each hunter has their own affinity weapon, HUD, and alternate form?).  But the real thing that will determine the winner will be skill(Or the omega cannon or dumb luck).  Wi-fi isn't that great though, it's fun to be able to search for opponents similar in skill level but you can't change any of the options when you do so.  That's only in a Friends and Rivals match.  You even have a hunter's license which keeps track of kills, wins,losses, and a whole bunch of other stuff(It keeps track against matches against bots Wi-fi or not)!Overall it's a fun game, the single-player is fun but it has big problems, luckily the multi-player makes up for it.  It has awesome controls(I mean the stylus one, not that bad button configuration) and beautiful graphics(Especially the cut-scenes!).  This is a DS game that every DS owner should have!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2006"}

Using the same battle system as the Game Boy games--think highly advanced  rock-paper-scissors--Pok&eacute;mon Stadiumallows players to enter  their Pok&eacute;mon in a variety of tournaments and other battle modes, all  featuring vibrant 3-D graphics and animation, as well as enhanced sounds and  announcer commentary.

The Kids Club mode  features nine cutesy minigames that make for great multiplayer fun for all ages.

Actually, I'd probably go play Pokemon Sapphire again if I were to come back to Pokemon fandom. Now, let me tell you: I'm not one to troll Nintendo. I'm a HUGE Nintendo fanboy, just so you know (See lots of my other reviews for proof).But then when you look at Pokemon Stadium, you'd probably think: \"OMG POKEMON ON NINTENDO 64!!!\" It would be one of the best Nintendo games ever, considering how awesome the series was on Game Boy, right? WRONG.Pokemon Stadium isn't what you'd expect to be the next big entry in the franchise. Rather than it being an RPG, the series's turn-based battles replace it all! It's all about fighting your Pokemon. Nothing else. In turned-based battles. How the heck is that supposed to work? It's not. If it's an RPG with that stuff, then we'd be all over it. You CAN'T have the turn-based battles make up a whole game by itself.Okay, maybe it actually isn't ALL about the turn-based battles. There are minigames, and some of them can be rather interesting. But they only remind you that this should have been an RPG. We had to wait for Pokemon Colosseum to give us the experience that we really needed.

Boy was I wrong.  Besides Nintendo with its mascots, the Wii software is full of shovelware with the few exception here and there.  The precision of the Wii mote is questionable. Playing a FPS on the Wii is not fluid as one would expect, most if not every game gestures are wrist movements at best.  All in all, after Mario, Zelda and Okami i was left with few games to play.  And the graphics, is a Gamecube with motion controls.  Also online gaming is barely a factor.The Move experience (so far)I bought it first day, set it up and was playing RE5 (Gold Edition), Heavy Rain demo, Time Crisis Demo, Tiger Woods demo, Sports champion game.  From the core games I already have to the table tenis games that reflected exactly how much i suck at table tenis in real life.  I play golf in real life and that Tiger Woods demo was insanely precise, maybe too much.  When the ball came out \"fat\" i knew that the swing i made was poor and the fat ball is exactly what i expected.  RE5 plays awesome with the move, love it big time.Upcoming games like KZ3, LBP2, Time Crisis early in this product lifecycle tells me that the Move is the real deal for core gamers and casuals alike.Interesting thing is that i bought the move to play games i already had or were planning to buy anyway, so i get two different ways to play my favorite core games, while having the option to invite the family for some casual action.ConclusionDont think of the Wii when considering the Move, is like comparing the PS2 to the PS3, pointless.

{"product_name":"B002BSA1MQ","description":"","reviewerName":"S. H. Wells","summary":"Sleek Shooter","reviewText":"Crysis 2 is a sleek game.  Beautiful environments, deep game play with tons of customization. The environment is also detailed.  I've played a lot of xbox games, and Crysis 2 feels and looks like a next-gen game you can play today.First, the single player campaign: for a FPS, Crysis 2's campaign is long.  It took about twice as long to play through Crysis (10hrs) as it did to play through Black Ops (5hrs).  Your futuristic armor (nano-suit) is capable of leaping high, running fast, and a very cool stealth mode.  You can dramatically customize how you play Crysis with these abilities.  The first time through, I was so enthralled with the stealth mode, that I found myself sneaking and breaking necks even when I could have won a fire fight.  The second play through, I worked on speed and gunplay.  These features place Crysis 2 in a category apart from the other great console shooters (Call of Duty; Battlefield Bad Company).  While there is a sense of \"super human-ness\" in the nano-suit, it is always tempered by a feeling of realism in the game.  You are powerful, but not ridiculously so.Next, the multiplayer: the multiplay modes are pretty standard.  Team battles, capture the flag mode, etc. Unfortunately, there is no co-op campaign.  The online community is robust, and your nano-suit's abilities let you play a number of different ways.  A lot of people out there are will be using stealth.  I have only really begun to play the multiplayer, but there are some cool perks that you can unlock as you gain experience.  I can see playing many hours on this multiplayer. But other than the particulars of the nano-suit, the multiplayer is very similar to Black Ops or Bad Company 2.Finally, Crysis 2 overall is a great game.  When it comes to graphics, game mechanics, and the amount of time you can play, Crysis 2 is a great value for your gaming dollar.  The graphics are unbelievably sleek.  After Crysis 2, I think you will hold other games to higher standard.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2011"}

I say, if you are going to use a \"main charater\"..then use that person. Silent Hill fans shouldn't see this \"on and off\" thing with the game.

{"product_name":"B0050SVMYA","description":"","reviewerName":"tdl","summary":"The sad launch is over, the 3DS is getting WAY BETTER!","reviewText":"The 3DS had a horrible launch, but it making a good recovery. Nintendo has a lot of plans to improve this system. The retail libary is growing rapidly. First Mario 3D Land, then Mario Kart 7, and just now Kid Icarus: Uprising and Mario Tennis Open. Paper Mario, New Super Mario Bros. 2, Luigi's Mansion, and Animal Crossing are on thier way. The 3DS also has downloadable games from it's eShop, like Art of Balance and Colors 3D. In addition to all of that, Nintendo occasionaly will remake an NES game in 3D. I played 3D Classics: Xexious and it nearly blew my mind. The Xexious Logo popped out at me and the ground below the spaceship was at an incredible depth. The 3DS also has a virtual console for Game Gear, Gameboy, Gameboy Color, and a few NES games, but they do not run in 3D. The Vita has not impressed me, it seems to be slow at recovering it's awful launch. The 3DS also has impressive graphics, not as good as a Vita, but almost equal as the Wii. Nintendogs + Cats had the most realistic looking dogs I have ever seen. Kid Icarus: Uprising was beautiful and colorful. The controls are okay. The circle pad is comfortable and works well. The bottom D-pad however, is hard and stiff for some reason. The 4 buttons are a little stiff, but work fine. The scoring on extra feautures:Camera- 7/10: Photos taken look better then on the DSi. The Vita's camera is just as bad. The 3DS also uses the cameras to scan QR codes and use AR technolegy.Microphone- 6/10: It is a good microphone, if a game would use it.Augmentated Reality (AR)- 10/10: The neatest part of the 3DS. On paper it sounds simple. You place a card down, and WOW! Mario is in your room, but it is way more complex then that. You can play mini-games like fishing and archery in your room using those cards.3D feauture- 9/10: It works as well as a 3D TV. Some things pop out, but it depends on what game it is. I wish Nintendo would put more effort into making games 3D, I was really dissapointed with Mario Kart 7.Battery- 2/10: The 3DS's biggest weakness is it's battery. I put it in sleep mode, come back 2 hours later and the light is flashing red. The system does have a lot of processes to handle when it is in sleep mode, though. It has to download games, check to see if another 3DS is near, download internet content, and maintain suspended games.Streetpass- 7/10: I enjoy streetpass, but it isn't for everyone. What it is is that when other 3DS systems are near it communicates with them and you can see other people's Miis and Status Messages. Then you make the Miis fight monsters in an RPG game built into the system. The other people can also give you rewards via streetpass (presents in Nintendogs, A Custom Grand Prix made by the user in Mario Kart 7, etc). Streetpass is only really effective in highly-populated areas, like schools, parades, or hotels.Overall, I recommened it if you are looking for something new and can stand a few flaws. The Vita is superior in graphics, but it lacks anything unique (Most of the games are just clumbsy PS3 ports), and the 3DS? Well, when was last time a Kid Icarus game came out? How many Nintendo consoles missed a sequel to Luigi's Mansion? Has any Mario game ever used 4 digits for a coin counter because of how many coins are in the levels (New Super Mario Bros. 2)? It does and improves everything a DSi/PSP can! Very good, and at the reasonable $170 price (The Vita cost $250!).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2012"}

If Garrett doesn't get involved, the streets will run red with blood and the City will tear itself apart.","reviewerName":"Dredded Deuce \"Dredded Panthyr\"","summary":"Thief should have stolen more from other games","reviewText":"Thief was a game I never played in previous incarnations and had heard many good things about. Many have said Thief gave rise to Splinter Cell, Assassin's Creed and Metal Gear.Some of those games that it gave rise to, I wish that Thief would have also taken notes from them.Don't get me wrong, it's not an entire mess of a game but for all the hype especially as one of the first games to arrive post next-gen launch it fell short of what I was expecting.The story itself is a bit muddy as somehow the main protagonist Garrett working alongside his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Erin end up at a mansion with some shadowy cult opening up a gateway in which Erin falls through and is presumably killed.  Garrett wakes up later and apparently has new thieving powers (a'la Batman's Detective mode) to help him traverse his terrain.  So it's up to Garrett to solve the mystery of the cult ad find out what happened to Erin.What is interesting is that this game plays almost like the thieving version of Skyrim.  If it isn't bolted down, take it and for everything you steal you automatically get credits towards upgrading your skills and weapons which would be fine, but Garrett is supposed to be a master thief so why is the game predicated on you being a petty thief and stealing everything?  One aspect I do like about the game which I wish more games of this genre would do is how it goes about dealing with light sources.  Garrett works best in the dark and in certain areas, Garrett has the ability to extinguish light sources with sometimes a simple switch or blowing the lights out or something more elaborate such as a water arrow.  While dousing some of these lights in the game is great there is still the questionable AI that I have a problem with.  A few times I have used a water arrow to only have the AI make a note of it via voice dialogue but not move to re-light it.  On other occasions, I have put lights out using other methods and the AI comes running along to light it right back up.  It's just very inconsistent on how this is done.One of biggest issues I had early on was I was stealing a mask in a house and was trying to make my way out and the house was pretty dark except for a woman reading a book with a guard stationed outside of her room.  I wanted to distract her to steal something else and just for the hell of it, I threw a bottle on the other side of the room which broke, very loudly.  To that, she only commented about who is there and the guard woke up and then dozed back off.  REALLY???!!???  So nobody is going to investigate a shattered bottle on the other side of the room in a dark house??  Ok then.Other issues I have had are with the controls.  Sometimes they work and sometimes they don't.  Lock-picking is a straightforward method that is reminiscent of Skyrim which works great.  But sometimes walking to a box or a drawer to open it for pilfering doesn't always work.  Sometimes if you aren't positioned `just so', you can't get the item.  Sometimes I have to double press the button just to get it to work.Combat is another issue with this game as this is one thing that Eidos didn't steal (pun intended) from Skyrim.  Garrett can barely manage his own against one opponent but the second he gets ganged up on, it's over.  And because he has this `do not kill' philosophy, swords are out and most of his opponents are packing to kill so my advice is if you alert too many guards, just run.  I will say this however, if you die, the save points are generous in placing you where you left off.Another issue is that unlike more modern games like Assassins Creed, there aren't many places for you to climb and you don't have that freedom to maneuver like you would in other games and the play-map is a mixed bag but at least you have the option of a guide-point on your HUD to direct you to your next location.  One thing that I heard complaints about was the constant loading the game has to do when you go from location to location.  I am fine with this actually as sometimes I have hated to have to travel from one point in a town to another like in Assassins Creed. BUT, the load times can take a while.  It's not game breaking but it's worrying.Graphically, Thief is really a mixed bag on the PS4.  Some of the cutscenes tend to stutter and for many of the characters in game, their facial models look very last gen especially Erin.  This was probably one of the things that dropped my expectations the most.  The City itself however looks really good at some points with the hi-res treatment that it got but I do wish that there was some kind of day/night cycle even if it was early morning and sunset and not just dark all of the time. Some of the light sources and water sources are good but if that is all going on for it graphically, then why bother?  For this to be a AAA title, I was expecting so much more in this game graphically.So is there anything likeable about this game?  The stealth aspects are cool as advertised; you can approach a mission in multiple ways.  So far I have tried completing levels with as very little contact as possible and so far I have done ok in doing it.  There is a ton of stuff to find if you have patience and a lot of side missions to do.  This game will hold me over for a short time at least until Titanfall comes out in a few weeks.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00HD4R5YU","description":"World-renowned Kojima Productions showcases the latest masterpiece in the Metal Gear Solid franchise with Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes. Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes (on sale Spring 2014) is the first segment of the 'Metal Gear Solid V Experience' and prologue to the larger second segment, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain launching thereafter. MGSV: GZ gives core fans the opportunity to get a taste of the world-class production's unparalleled visual presentation and gameplay before the release of the main game. It also provides an opportunity for gamers who have never played a Kojima Productions game, and veterans alike, to gain familiarity with the radical new game design and unparalleled style of presentation. The critically acclaimed Metal Gear Solid franchise has entertained fans for decades and revolutionized the gaming industry. Kojima Productions once again raises the bar with the FOX Engine offering incredible graphic fidelity and the introduction of open world game design in the Metal Gear Solid universe. This is the experience that core gamers have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Ray-Review","summary":"Ground Zeroes Delivers!","reviewText":"The Metal Gear Solid series is without a doubt my favorite video game franchise of all time, so you can imagine the amount of anticipation and excitement I had for the release of MGSV. Until \"Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain\" releases, creator Hideo Kojima decided to release the this game \"Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes\", which serves as a prologue to the Phantom Pain. This game is a direct sequel to Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker released for the PSP back in 2010 (later released for the consoles on the HD collection) taking place in 1975 continuing the tale of Naked Snake (Big Boss) and Kaz expanding what would soon be Outer Heaven.Before purchasing MGS:GZ, I was fully aware that this game was going to be shorter than the average game, and for a $29.99 retail price you can't really expect the overall experience to be at that of a new fully priced game. However, the replay value of Ground Zeroes in my opinion is extremely high. There are 5 missions to complete as a well as an extra mission depending on what system you bought this game for, that can easily be played for hours on end. The new gameplay mechanics are a ton of fun to mess around and tinker which creates a variety of experimental opportunities for players whether you want to attack with stealth or guns blazing. Besides the new controls and gorgeous graphics (courtesy of the FOX Engine) the most prominent change to the series is the replacement of Snakes voice from the iconic David Hayter to Keifer Sutherland a.k.a \"24's\" Jack Baur. I myself being a huge fan of the original voice acting David Hayter as Snake was a little worrisome of the drastic change, but since the announcement it eventually grew on me and canonically made sense since Snake would eventually become Big Boss, whom would need a different personality overall.Overall this is a must buy for Metal Gear fans as well as for newcomers. And please do not be intimidated by the $29.99 price or the fact that everybody saying it is short. I've bought games at full price in the past that turned out to be complete s*** despite it having a long story; this game is a great example of quality over quantity. This is a great game and a true next-gen experience!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2014"}

Not only did they get charged 2x what the game was selling for if you simply downloaded it, but on top of that seems like the disc copy sucks.Anyway I bought chapter 1 back in July (?) and finished the game with the last chapter this month. I give this game 5 stars for sheer originality. There are AAA $50-$60 rpgs out there that only dream of reaching the level of immersion this little gem from an Indie producer has done with TWD. The tension between the characters as the game progresses gets so thick you feel like it's sitting right next to you in the room, watching you play. But before I go into that... the story start off almost like the start of a TV drama series. Lee (Somethingorother) is being hauled off to jail for a crime of passion that resulted in murder, the state trooper bringing him to the pen. doesnt see the homeless looking stranger wander on to the highway...an accident ensues...the game begins.Lee is befriended by a girl who's parents spent the weekened in Macon...together, they come across a family of 3 and together they have a plan to find a boat and wait this thing out just off shore. From this point forward, the game does an AMAZING job of character analysis, though the use of voicework, assigning you to give out limited resources to the group and having the NPCs remember your actions (you fed this person, you backed up that person's story, you saved this person's life over that one's).Each chapter links to the one before and after it. Your decisions on matters are remembered by the group, people of like-mind will side with you, people who arent will speak up. There could be (and most likely will be) some heated discussions, maybe some fisticuffs get thrown...you can feel the pressure of the ZA getting to everyone, fraying their nerves, people start nipping at each other over small things.TL;DR - If you like zombies; a great story; a TON of unexpected events and something totally out of the ordinary, then try this game out","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2012"}

The game rewards the latter though with less plague driven rats and a lighter style given to those who spare lives than wantonly take them. The magic/mana feature within the game offers helpful and familiar skills such as instant transportation and the ability to see through walls, something that's used extensively. Unlike the more recent Deus Ex release, which I felt was ruined by ill-thought out boss battles, this game has no such game-breaking moments. You do not have to fear choosing one game style over another as they both have their rewards and their punishments. It's this freedom in what is in all honestly quite a linear game that's so gratifying and raises this above other peers of its ilk, which seem to offer choices of play but in reality the developers only expected you to go through the game their way.I do have a couple of caveats - one the graphics are stylized and it's hard to pinpoint as to what the devs were going for. The textures aren't realistic in places but are clearly crafted to look the way they do. The only way I can describe it is like cell-shading 'lite' - there's no black outlines but it's slightly cartoony in design and look. But some of the set pieces are stunning; massive concrete walled castle-like structures foreboding the trouble ahead. I really got into the look of the game once I was settled in.My other thought is that since looking through walls is so important and useful, you do spend a lot of time looking at monochromatic architecture. Creatures are yellow, useful objects are green and interactive objects such as switches are blue. Everything else is quake-like dirty brown during 'dark vision'. If you dark vision your way through the game as a ghost then you may miss out on some amazing looking places with it on. But that's a choice you make as a player - and that's why this game is so good.I've read that it's a short game. Well I would imagine that if you play with your pistol and grenades on easy you could storm through it quickly. But this game deserves to be savored at a realistic pace. Take the time to plan your route to give off the least visibility, choke enemies out and hide their unconscious bodies rather than assassinating them on the spot. I'm on my second play through and the first took at least twelve hours. This time around I'm trying not to get seen or kill anyone - now that's harder than any frontal attack and is a joy to play... and takes patience.What a great start to a franchise and I can't wait for the sequel.

{"product_name":"B0065NP39E","description":"","reviewerName":"Scott Peterson \"I.T. Sme\"","summary":"Not sure how to feel about it.","reviewText":"\"New Vegas\" is a sequel to Fallout 3; itself a sequel to two prior games.  In a nutshell America turns into a sort of future retro 1950's  that erupts into a nuclear war about 2075.  Two hundred years later the survivors come out of the fallout shelters into the new world.In Fallout 3 you started out from a shelter (called a Vault); in \"New Vegas\" you begin in the outside world, as a courier who is gravely wounded and enters the game as someone with no memory trying to find an identity.Along the way you can make choices, ally with factions, obtain sidekicks, and so on. There is no one way to play the game, nor good or bad choices.  Developers have tried to shy away from having \"good and evil\" character sets for something more realistic.  In \"Mass effect,\" for example, you can be a Paragon (virtuous but unyielding) or a Renegade (self adsorbed but doing what has to be done).  In \"New Vegas\" (and the prior Fallout games) you have a negative or positive karma, but it's applied to how certain factions view you, and to please one often ticks off another.It's something developers try to do is make a sequel that is bigger and better than the original. Well they did that, but it may also be the game's downfall. My time on completing it with most quests discovered and siding with one faction was 51 hours, almost twice what it was Fallout 3.  To have tried to see how different faction choices played out would easily added another 20 hours.  Overall I spent a few weeks on it, but looking back I honestly can't say I enjoyed it.  The problems I had with the game are best run off as list:A future where the economy runs on bottle caps (?) and despite 200 years of post apocalypse environment computers are still up and running; a 2075 computer looks an awful lot like 1980.  This was also in Fallout 3.If anything too many quests and complexity.  To get one thing done you have to see someone who gives you three quests, and in turn someone else on one of those quests give you more, and so on.  There is a LOT of searching and looking around, and the pointer telling you where to go is really only good for a general heading in the wasteland.  Many of the vaults and casinos are literally mazes to find your way around in.  This also results in things like you enter a room, surprise someone and get into a fight and kill them, then get a message you failed a quest you were never on as it depends on some decisions you made a few quests ago.Navigating the wasteland can be difficult as you try to get to one place by climbing a ridge and run into a mysterious invisible block as they don't want you getting over it. A lot of \"boss\" characters have the HHF (Huge Hitpoint Factor) where it takes multiple hits with a grenade launcher or a sniper rifle to take them down, despite looking like any other character in the game.As with Fallout 3 everything has a vague cartoony look and the color palette is a dull somber shading of browns, tans, greens, greys, and so on.  I realize this is a wasteland but still a depressing landscape makes a depressing game.Really?  Follow ons to the Roman Legions and Mongol hordes?The characters are nothing more than general roles (leader, follower, medic, seller, comic, etc.) with a repertoire of canned lines.  That essentially is most video game characters but in many you identify with them as if a from a book or movie, they seem real even if they aren't.  Here it just all runs together.  It doesn't help that so many canned lines are repeated over and over.The ending, however is what finally soured me on the game.  Without giving it away it's a slideshow of about 25 or so vignettes; with from 4 to 6 variations depending on how you played each major part of the game.  Some may never be present if you missed  that set of quests.  Therefore there is no \"cutscene\" at the ending, and easily a few hundred variations.  Some turn out the way you expected, many were \"well if I'd known *that* I would never have played it that way.\"Basically I entered a confused and uncertain mess, expended an enormous amount of effort, and left the place an even more uncertain mess.  Call it \"real\" or too much like reality, it felt more like a performance review than ending a game.If you want to see a story done right that is involving, colorful, and still a large world to play in with a surprise ending, look at \"Bioshock Infinite.\"  As it is I doubt I'll play this one again.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00005AV8W","description":"A dark shadow is spreading over the N64. Count Dracula has once again weakened the seals of his tomb, and the Belmont family is getting anxious.In the latest crusade against the forces of evil, players can choose between two brave vampire-slaying characters. Young Reinhardt Schneider, like his predecessors in the celebrated vampire-hunting Belmont family, will rely primarily on his whip. The other character is Carrie Fernandez, a young woman skilled in the ways of magic and spell-casting. Both are on the hunt for the dreaded Dracula and his devoted legions of vampires. You play a game all the way through with the character you've chosen, concluding with his or her own ending. Each character has an individual route to travel, and to see all of the areas you will have to complete the game using both characters.The passage of time and, especially, the fall of night, play a prominent role in the game. Players will have to search castles filled with dark corners, winding staircases, and other gloomy places. Daytime is the right time for exploring, but be on the lookout for vampires lurking in the shadows.Once the sun goes down, though, you should exercise extreme caution. When night falls, more creatures come out to play, and they become more aggressive as well. Some tasks are impossible to perform unless it is the correct time of day. A clock will allow players to calculate the time and plan their explorations accordingly.Konami has planted many cinematic sequences throughout the game. These scenes are surprisingly creepy, and may make you decide not to pick up your controller at night. Enemy characters are designed to terrify, ranging from the traditional horde of skeletons to half-woman, half-spider mutants. There are some gruesome bosses lurking in the darkness, as well. You will have to defeat Dracula in three different time periods, but don't expect the passage of time to improve his disposition.Reinhardt and Carrie will both have analog control, with different animation sequences for walking, jogging, and running. Reinhardt's whip works on a targeting system. When gruesome enemies are threatening, a green crosshair appears on the screen. If an enemy crawls, slithers, or slides within range of the whip, the target lets you know by turning red. The target automatically hovers over nearby enemies, so once it turns red you are guaranteed of a successful strike.Castlevaniahas 28 different areas to explore and four different special items at your disposal to fight the forces of evil.

Look into it once and you find titles like Mario, the port of Contra, Zelda, Metroid, Mega Mans 1-6, and so on. But who would have thought that there would be one classic whose atmosphere involves Dracula and similarly eerie scenery? That game is Castlevania. Before there were games like, say, Resident Evil, Castlevania was one game to capture a dark feel. And the game blended it in with top-notch gameplay, awesome music, and great graphics alike.The game is simple. It's a platformer in which the main character uses a whip to kill enemies. You eventually obtain certain items that are used in different ways than the whip (EX: A watch that freezes all enemies for a few seconds, and a tomahawk you can throw). The game's divided into 6 somewhat-big levels, and unlike modern Castlevania games, this original is linear throughout. But that's not a bad thing. It's a game that's straightforward and to the point, offering you the fun right away.However, you may as well be warned. If you haven't played this game, let me tell you this: It is HARD. There are lots of things to be aware about as you play the game (Especially how the enemies move). If you aren't careful, you could die pretty easily. Speaking of which, some deaths could occur from falling into bottomless pits, which most likely happen when an enemy knocks you in. Thankfully, there's a Continue option, so hope for beating this game isn't totally lost. Besides, this game is very fun, anyway, difficult or not. You should definitely try this classic out. Just be sure to expect a challenge.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00005YTYJ","description":"WithGrand Theft Auto III, Rockstar proves that not all  developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games.  This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular  predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any  criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the  local population for their money (or weapons), make time with  prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking  more structure can embark on dozens of plot-driven missions or steal  cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and go on vigilante  missions. Grab a cab and play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi.  Take a fire truck and earn money putting out fires. The game just never  gets boring.As in real life, there are consequences for your criminality. As your  random acts of mayhem mount up, the police start hounding you,  eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you  continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily  the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are  packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every  category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump  trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically  when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific  detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic,  pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing.  Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine  different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a  monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages  to get everything right.--T.

No, it's not a game based on my first love, it's Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto 3; now back on the PC where it rightfully belongs...and it's going to rock your world all over again. GTA 3, more than any other game, set the tone for the direction that the gaming industry is headed in.  This review will assume that you have not been living under a rock for the past year, and are somewhat familiar with Grand Theft Auto 3 in all it's goodness.  To sum it up for those not in the know, (i.e., heathens) in GTA 3, you're a thug for hire, and you can do anything you want to.  You can kill, you can maim, you can slaughter, and you can run people down, all at your convenience.  You can pick up and pay prostitutes for \"extra health\", only to beat them down with a baseball bat and take your cash back once the deed is done.  You can make extra money by trying your hand at being an ambulance driver, fireman, taxi driver, or bounty hunter, all of whose segments could easily have been packaged as a separate game on their lonesome.  You can do all of this, and not even touch on the main quests, which requires that you work for various criminal organizations.  But alas, even these can be done at your own pace, or not at all.Fellow editor Sam Dornan did a superb job of explaining what makes GTA 3 so enthralling in his review of the PS2 version, so read that, or the listings of the countless magazines and websites that have named GTA 3 \"Game of the Year\" if you still need convincing.  This review will focus mainly on how the PC version does the impossible: improves on it. The first notable improvement over the PS2 original is one that could not be helped due to the limitations of the console hardware.  Though absolutely stunning on both platforms, it's on the PC that GTA 3 truly shines graphically, provided your system has the muscle for it.  Vehicles and character models are much better detailed with higher poly counts.  Remember the signs scattered around town that you couldn't read due to the blurred textures? Thanks to the increased resources of the PC platform, dedicated players can drive around looking for all the signs scattered around the city such as \"Monica's fine cigars\", and \"24 hour orgy, free buffet\".  While the PS2 was limited in what it could do, the sky's the limit on the PC, with \"sky\" being a synonym for \"your graphics card and CPU\". GTA 3 adds a couple of features that take advantage of the PC's storage capabilities and, while relatively minor, these added bonuses definitely add to the overall experience.  You can now make your own custom radio station by adding any music files you have on your computer to the \"mp3\" folder in the game directory.  Modders can easily create custom skins by editing the main player skin in any commercial paint program.  As of now, at least 100 skins are available on the web, ranging from Eminem to Spiderman.  Sadly, the much-hyped modding tools are nowhere to be seen, at least straight out of the box. While custom soundtracks and skins are all well and good, the greatest improvement over the PS2 game, and what makes the PC version of GTA the definitive one, is the refined targeting system: in essence, you now aim/look with the mouse, and run with the keyboard.  Think Max Payne, or any PC shooter, and you get the idea.  You now have complete control over your character, and can pinpoint an enemy out of a crowd from a good distance away without a sniper rifle or M16, while an onscreen crosshair removes any guesswork as to where your bullets will land...as long as the physics aren't off (Don't expect a pistol shot to land as far as a sniper bullet).  As if to prove this point, Rockstar toggled hit-specific damage on by default: if you hit an arm, the arm will fly off.  Hit the head at the right angle with a high-powered weapon, it too will come off.  Even with the \"gore code\" on, the console version never got this bloody.  This new targeting system makes the game gorier than its console brethren, which provides yet another incentive to pick up the PC version, even if you've played the PS2 original.  Perhaps the only flaw to be found in the game is the fact that it takes a while to get used to driving with a keyboard and mouse.  But even that is relatively easy once you sit down and play for a while.  GTA 3 truly remains \"easy to learn, hard to master\". Politicians, Christian groups, and parents alike have bashed GTA 3.  But Rockstar Games has given them all the finger, and you should too, especially now that what some consider the greatest game ever created is that much closer to perfection.  Just make sure your system's got what it takes, kid.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00CXCCH1I","description":"With its first new major sports league partnership in over a decade, EA SPORTS presentsEA SPORTS UFC. The next-generation of fighting has been built exclusively for the PlayStation 4 and XBOX ONE by the team behind the critically-acclaimed Fight Night franchise.Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology,EA SPORTS UFCbrings the action, emotion and intensity inside the Octagon to life in ways that were never before possible. The next-generation of True Player Motion not only showcases the diverse, powerful and fluid of attacks of elite mixed martial artists through Precision Movement, Dynamic Striking and Strategic Submission Battles, but also brings the combatants to life with Full Body Deformation and Real-Time Exertion. The simulation of Human Intelligence takes leaps forward with the strategic and adaptive MMAi system and is expressed through the most realistic characters ever created in a sports game.Feel the Fight &ndash; Gameplay FeaturesStep into the Octagon with the most realistic take on fighting ever achieved. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology, every fighter, strike, takedown and submission will make you feel the fight.&bull;MMAi&ndash; A mixed martial artist&rsquo;s mind is as important as his heart. Every licensed fighter in the game will have changing goals and fight plans, based on their real-life tendencies and each fight situation. Stop their Plan A, and they will adapt to Plan B or C. Down on the scorecards, look for the AI to end the fight with a knockout or a submission. A smarter opponent equals a more challenging and unpredictable fight.&bull;Full Body Deformation&ndash; Until now, simulation of physical contact between fighters was limited to bodies that barely made contact with each other; as a result, they looked and behaved like action figures made of plastic rather than elite athletes. The team that revolutionized sports by bringing authentic physics to the Fight Night franchise changes the game again with an all-new, full-body deformation system that moves and displaces the fighter&rsquo;s flesh in real time. For the first time, the strength of every submission and power of every strike will truly make an impression.&bull;Real-Time Exertion&ndash; A UFC bout is one of the most physically demanding sports on the planet requiring mixed martial artists to give it their all with every movement. Real-Time Exertion brings each moment of that action to life in your gameplay experience. Through real-time vein popping, skin discoloration, muscle flex, as well as signs of fatigue setting in through the course of each round, you will witness the effort it takes to be one of the best fighters in the world.&bull;Fighter Likeness and Facial Animations&ndash; EA SPORTS UFC will set a new bar for character likeness and emotion in gaming. For the first time in an EA SPORTS game, every single licensed athlete in the game has been created from high resolution 3D head and body scans to deliver revolutionary character likeness and authenticity. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, new facial animation technology delivers more expression, emotion and will communicate greater sense of awareness and intelligence in the Octagon.&bull;Precision Movement&ndash; MMA is a sport of inches, where every step counts and every movement matters.  Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, the Precision Movement locomotion system grounds the fighters, eliminating unrealistic slipping and sliding across the canvas. More realistic physics-driven movement delivers more realistic action as the overall transfer of energy from the ground up delivers more impactful and believable strikes and takedowns.&bull; Dynamic Striking&ndash; A mixed martial artist uses the environment to his advantage and for the first time in a UFC game, you can too. A dynamic environment allows you to pull off jaw-dropping moves using the Octagon, including roundhouse kicks, superman punches and much more. Combine those abilities with the best striking technology in the industry and that one perfect strike could change the fight.&bull;Strategic Submission Battles&ndash; To own the belt, you have to be dominant on your feet and on the mat.  EA SPORTS UFC re-invents the ground game to create a battle for position and control that captures the strategy of a submission battle. Like the real sport, in EA SPORTS UFC fighters will work through multiple stages as they work to advance or escape from a fight-ending submission.&bull;Real Damage&ndash; Every fighter knows that one good shot can ruin your day.  EA SPORTS UFC introduces a non-linear damage system which can result in big damage coming from a single strike. The system produces a greater variety of cuts and contusions that is true-to-life and has never been possible in a simulation fighting game.","reviewerName":"pastapadre","summary":"Unrealistic gameplay and limited content downs EA's first attempt at UFC","reviewText":"Hope for the future of UFC games were high when EA Sports announced the acquisition of the license just over two years ago. There was to be significant development time and investment made prior to release of the first entry in the series, it would launch on the new systems and have an opportunity similar to how Fight Night Round 3 stood out early in the previous generation, and the company was coming off a good first effort in the sport with 2010's EA Sports MMA.It's especially disappointing then that EA Sports UFC's release has been met with a critical reception that places it well behind the efforts of recent years. THQ's Undisputed series and even EA Sports MMA all received much higher review scores. Dedicated fans of the sport have been even harsher in regards to how well it reflects what they love.Designed by the same team behind the Fight Night series it should come as no surprise the company never intended to produce a true simulation. They've said as much publicly that they believe simulations wouldn't have wide enough appeal.The result with EA UFC is something that really won't have a defined target audience. It's naturally too complicated for casuals and not realistic enough for the hardcore crowd.POSITIVES---VisualsBuilt for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One the game shines graphically and in related areas. Most fighters look fantastic - the models and faces are incredibly well done - while aspects like blood and body damage are great. Basic presentation has been executed properly as well to give the game a sufficient broadcast feel. The camera angle and camera work is just about ideal.---Online PlayBecause of the potential for fun online is deserving of some recognition. Lag is almost non-existent and that allows for a level of responsiveness that is necessary (though the sluggishness that resides offline of course remains). Features like the Championships, Tournaments, and Rivalries are valuable inclusions. Not putting in the online Fight Cards that debuted in EA MMA though was an unfortunate decision.Online fights will vary from very entertaining and rewarding to outright frustrating. A lot of that depends on the opponent as many have already found certain aspects to spam as exploits. But even with two people trying to fight the right way they don't turn out at all realistic. Again they can be fun, and winning in certain manners thrilling, but it still may not be satisfying to those who wanted strategic fights that look and feel like the real thing.Issues include wins not being granted when an opponent quits, not seeing what fighter your opponent has chosen, different weight classes being grouped together, and Bruce Lee being available to use in ranked fights.NEGATIVES---Career Mode and Lack of Offline ContentParticipants in the actual Ultimate Fighter don't enter the competition as unskilled novices who can barely move, have no power to their strikes, and are useless on the ground. Instead they've already shown potential and are there to be coached up and have their skills refined as a few of them emerge from the group. So why career modes continue to insist on starting players as though they are worthless remains baffling.It makes for a bad first impression especially here where there isn't much else to do offline. For many people their first fights will be in Career. Points to spend on improving your fighter comes fast through wins - it won't be difficult to max out ratings based on that distribution - but how many will stick it out that long and find that to be rewarding is in question.Despite the poor starting form the mode has some compelling elements particularly the real video that will be recognizable to anyone who has watched the show. Unfortunately fights end up being far too bland, with very little differentiation in opponents, and it begins to feel like a series of exhibition fights rather than an experience that stretches beyond.---Unrealistic GameplayArguments can be made about whether UFC should have been more of a simulation - or at least much more realistic - but not about EA's decision to go the more \"arcade\" direction. This was their vision and they may feel as though they executed it as intended. Would the idea of the game being subjectively more fun outweigh the distress caused by those who understand the sport and feel it is entirely unrealistic?The CPU fights ultra-aggressively with very little variety or strategy in their attacks. Going beyond that are the rare moves which become commonplace and are not penalized for being attempted, and the shared moves which leaves each fighter feeling even more nondescript and unlike themselves. The CPU also has a huge advantage in stamina, damaged areas regenerate far too much, and trying to wear an opponent down with leg kicks is pointless as it seems to have no effect on them over the course of a fight. There is very little indication given to which strikes had an impact and which didn't and the fights tend to devolve into trading big shots until someone goes down.On the ground it becomes a reversal fest, with dominant position often being reversed like its nothing, and always leaving the user just a single button press away from standing the action back up. Submissions will be either too easy or too difficult depending on who you ask. I've yet to see a single one completed offline or online however. Takedowns attempts are bizarre with them sometimes being too easy to stop, other times too difficult to stop, and situationally not making any effect on the outcome with shoots often being ignored due to animation conflicts.One of the biggest problems is not being able to display an urgency in critical situations. When someone is knocked down or hurt, the other fighter can't rush them to try and end it. It is unbelievably frustrating to see those opportunities go by.EA also made the choice not to offer any sliders or a \"simulation\" option. Removing the ability for people to make adjustments to the game to better fit what they're looking for has never proven to be a good idea.---AuthenticityWhile EA did a good job in some areas presenting the fights and on how the fighters look, there is a lot left to be desired in other areas. How awkward is it to see fighters like Jon Jones, Ronda Rousey, and Demetrious Johnson wearing plain t-shirts and trunks? Or Anderson Silva with plain black shorts? Well according to EA the reason is \"complicated\". In the end any excuses don't matter.The MMAi that EA touted during 2013's E3 is non-existent here. Fighters don't display any of their own traits. The special skills available to fighters are great in theory but rarely can be noticed in any discernible way. Then you have things like the knockouts which often look completely awkward. The fights just tend to end, with the ref never jumping in to stop it when situations would warrant doing so.The roster is also relatively thin. It's missing some names that should never have been omitted including the current Bantamweight champion T.J. Dillashaw. Updates providing new current fighters are said to be in the works and will be offered for free. CAFs are limited to only 10, can't be shared, and women can't be created.SUMMARYDespite what EA may have thought with UFC, realism and authenticity were going to be critical to its success and future. Casuals always follow the hardcore crowd whether it is to get on board or jump off the bandwagon.EA Sports decided to design the gameplay (and their marketing campaign) around appealing to a casual crowd that would never widely accept it because of how inherently complicated and difficult a proper representation of MMA is to translate to a video game. Word of mouth from credible fans of the sport could have led to that happening over time. The reverse though will not happen.With a sequel as many as two years away it's discouraging that this is what MMA fans are left with - a game that had the potential to be something special but due to poor design decisions will quickly be discarded. EA will have to seriously reevaluate their approach to the UFC series going forward.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2014"}

I've NEVER had FNV lock up or corrupt data files on autosave. I have not completed the game, but I got about 12 hours into it, decided I had made some bad choices and started over, and I am now to the point where I have completed many of the missions on the Strip and still have experienced no major technical issues.I intended to wait until completing the game before posting a review, but with some people claiming that FNV won't run, locks up, etc., I wanted to post my experience. It's hard to understand how the same game on the same console (Xbox) can behave so differently. (I do have the latest patch(es).)I could post a long review of my likes and dislikes of the game, but what it boils down to is that, IMO, if you have not played Fallout 3, you should get it before FNV. If you have played F3 and didn't like it, you're not going to like FNV, but if you did like F3, you should definitely get FNV despite any glitches.Because FNV is so complex, I recommend referring to a guide, especially if you think the game is too hard (which it isn't if you play it right). On the Internet, you can search for \"Fallout New Vegas\" and \"Wikia\", which is what I usually use as a game guide, but I found myself printing out so many pages that I'm going to orderFallout New Vegas: Prima Official Game Guide.I downgraded FNV from 5 stars to 4 because they could have, but did not, improve what is the absolute worst map display in the industry (interior maps which inexplicably collapse the maps for all floors of a multi-floor building into the same space, making it nearly impossible to use the maps except in the most general way). Another major annoyance is that when someone gives you something to do and you have to check back with them when done, FNV (like F3) often hides that person, requiring you to run around in circles for an hour before they show up so that you can complete the objective. Otherwise, I love the changes made to FNV.==Edit:I have completed the game and stand by the above remarks. I may have had 1 corrupted auto-save -- after going through a door, I could go straight but not turn/look left or right. I saved often, so I just backed up to the last save, went through the door again, and all was well.The only major problem I had was the increasing length of time taken by scene changes -- you Fast Travel somewhere (30-60 seconds), it leaves you outside a door which you click to open (30-60 seconds), you walk for 5 seconds and click on another door (30-60 seconds), etc. It is possible in many places to spend 4.5 minutes out of 5 just waiting for scene changes to load. This nearly ruined the game for me and I'm reducing my rating to 3 (from 4) as a result.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2010"}

If you like open world games, particularly if you are fond of the Grand Theft Auto games, you will likely find a lot to like in Saints Row 2. There is a lot more customization here. It's more like GTA: San Andreas in that you can buy clothes and run around with your crew. Plus if you're the type of gamer that doesn't do the storyline quests but has more fun just running around causing chaos and doing goofy side quests, Saints Row 2 offers way more variety there than all the GTA games combined.Yes the story is lame but you're doing it wrong if you expect an amazing narrative from an open world game.

When I bought a PS3, I was surprised that there are nowhere near as many open world games for the next-gen systems.  Fortunately, THQ did a great job with their contribution to this genre, Saints Row 2.Grand Theft Auto games have comedy in them but don't take themselves as lightly as Saints Row 2 - and that's what makes SR2 so fun.  There are alot of missions that are just about destruction and mayhem, and the game's storyline is over-the-top, but not too much so.The gameplay, once learned, is easy to use, and both the on-foot and driving mechanics are decent (the flying ones are slightly suspect if the chopper happens to clip a building, but that's so miniscule I'm not even going to go into depth on that).  Also, the customization of the character, their outfits, and their crib makes this game alot of fun.The graphics are pretty nice, the sound is of substantial quality, and the originality of the storyline itself makes this game a must-have.  Even when it was first released, this game would avoid the rental category altogether and land firmly in the ok-to-buy category.  Alot of places are selling this game for twenty, so its a must-have for any gamer, whether die-hard or casual gamer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0009S4UOA","reviewerName":"David Foskin \"SneakyGoblin on XBL\"","summary":"Call of Duty 2 (XBox 360)","reviewText":"Let me just begin this review by going on record with the following statement: I'm just as sick of WWII first-person shooters as the next guy. Over the years, I've played so many of them that I feel like I could walk blindfolded from the beaches of Normandy all the way into downtown Berlin. Unfortunately, the bombed-out cities that served as arenas for some of the war's biggest battles have gradually blurred together into an unrecognizable grey mass. It just feels like we've seen the same things over and over again in these titles, yet people keep playing them for some reason.While I'd be happy to see the WWII genre as a whole receive an honorable discharge, the fact of the matter is that some of the most innovative FPSs of all-time were associated with The Big One. The Medal of Honor series was the first to bring the war home, Battlefield 1942 let everyone in on the action, and the Brothers in Arms games made leaders out of players. However, it was Call of Duty that introduced \"cinematic intensity\" to the masses, assaulting their eyes and ears with the most realistic depiction of war ever seen in a video game. Now, Xbox 360 owners are getting a chance to experience the sequel, Call of Duty 2, a riveting and exciting game that already enthralled PC gamers last month.Like the rest of the games in the series, Call of Duty 2 lets you see the war from several different perspectives. In the beginning, you'll play as a Russian soldier, doing battle in the bombed-out city of Stalingrad. Next, it's off to the North African deserts where you and the rest of the British Desert Rats will take on Rommel's famed Afrika Korps in both tank and ground combat. Finally, you'll storm the beaches of Normandy as an American, then battle your way deep into the French countryside. Although we're used to the series' lack of a real narrative, we were hopeful that there would be some sort of common thread running throughout the standalone missions.Thanks to the Xbox 360's excellent controller, it won't take veterans of console first-person shooters very long to feel comfortable with the gameplay in Call of Duty 2. The default control scheme feels perfect right from the start, and there's a good chance that you'll be a genuine killing machine by the time you finish the brief tutorial that kicks off the game. You'll come to rely quite a bit on the triggers (which zoom and fire your weapon) and the two \"bumpers\" that control your smoke and frag grenades. While you'll find yourself using a lot of grenades throughout the game, your enemies will use even more, occasionally throwing littering the ground around you with them. Thankfully, there's a handy on-screen indicator that will show you where they are in relation to your position, allowing you to move a safe distance away.The judicious use of grenades is just one way that your foes will attempt to outsmart you. More than just about any console game before it, the AI in Call of Duty 2 will do virtually anything to gain an advantage. You'll quickly come to realize that when they throw grenades, they aren't always trying to kill you. Instead, they may use them to draw you out into the open, where they can let their bullets do the work. If you're pinned down, you'll often see your foes hanging back for a moment before make some fairly advanced movements. They'll also react realistically to your attacks, moving to cover at the first crack of your rifle.From the moment you begin the game, there's no doubt that Call of Duty 2 was designed to showcase the Xbox 360's power. The visuals are simply stunning, from the highly detailed textures to the smooth animations of the characters around you, and everything runs at a near-constant 60 frames per second. Sure, there are a few slowdowns here and there (especially during the perfectly-spaced autosaves), but you'll be so engrossed that you'll barely notice the blips. The weapons look particularly nice, too, especially when you use the iron sights to blow away your enemies.As was the case with the other games in the franchise, Call of Duty 2 features some truly amazing sound effects. The guns rattle noisily when fired, each of them sounding completely unqiue. The voiceovers, though few and far between, are all very well done, particularly in the case of the Russian soldiers that are doing battle against \"the facists.\" Rounding everything out is the game's score, which is just as sweeping and epic as any war movie.Although the single-player campaign is fairly long, and offers a number of wide-open areas, Call of Duty 2 multiplayer action will be what keeps it alive for years to come. We've been testing the game for a few days now on Xbox Live, and while there are definitely some early problems with games being dropped, you'll have a blast when you're actually playing. In addition to Solo and Team Deathmatches and Capture the Flag, you'll be able to play objective-based games like Headquarters and Search and Destroy. Teams are definitely rewarded (with a win) for working together, something that's missing from many online games.No matter how you feel about the WWII shooter genre as a whole, there's no denying that Call of Duty 2 is one of the finest FPSs ever created. Thanks to a combination of sharp visuals, teeth-rattling sound effects, and tricky enemy AI, you'll be on the edge of your seat from the moment you're dropped into combat until your dying breath. While there are still a few kinks to be ironed out on the online multiplayer side of things, you'll still have a great time playing with your friends.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2006"}

As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

{"product_name":"B000084318","reviewerName":"blackaciddevil","summary":"Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.......","reviewText":"The story of The Wind Waker takes place on a series of islands on the sea somewhere, a first for the series. It tells about Link and his struggle with Ganondorf for control of the Triforce. He spends a good portion of his time trying to find his little sister, who's kidnapped at the beginning of the game. He also spends a portion of his time sailing, traveling through dungeons and temples and the like on his quest to gain power to defeat Ganondorf yet again.Personally, I don't understand what all the hoopla was about. Back before this game came out, Zelda fans cried foul because the game went cel-shaded, claiming it was geared more towards kids. Once you boot this game up and begin to play, you'll find out this game is still pure Zelda. Besides, sometimes a series needs change to stay alive and fresh. I love it myself and I've been a loyal Legend of Zelda gamer for years. It ranks up there with my other favorites(like Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask,The Minish Cap and Twilight Princess).Gameplay in the game goes largely unchanged from the scheme in Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask. There's tons of side-quests to do, besides what you do on the quest, that are (as always) alot of fun. My favorite being when Link obtains what they call the Deluxe Picto Box(camera) that he uses to take pictures of enemies and non-playable characters for a character named Carlov, who uses them to sculpt figurines(134, in all). I think the thing I like most about The Wind Waker is that Link can pick up and use certain enemy's weapons.The cool thing about The Wind Waker is that the story doesn't end here. It continues on in Legend of Zelda:Phantom Hourglass for the Nintendo DS, which follows Link as he journeys to save his friend Tetra from Bellum(the story's antagonist) with the help of Captain Linebeck and his ship, the S.S. Linebeck.I highly recommend Legend of Zelda:The Wind Waker to one and all. It's an adventure that, like Ocarina of Time, shouldn't be missed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2010"}

{"product_name":"B004S5PBM0","description":"","reviewerName":"trashcanman","summary":"A natural progression in music games","reviewText":"So we've all played the hell out of Guitar Hero and Rock Band. Played them into the ground, actually.  The rise and fall of the music game genre was precipitous to say the least.  Insanely fun and addictive in it's blend of great music and the feeling of playing said music, but expensive and tedious once they started getting released several times a year each with only minor tweaks and upgrades to the core game. Now that the smoke from the collapse of the bloated Guitar Hero franchise, with Rock Band crumbling as well, what are gamers who love participating in music through their favorite entertainment medium to do?  Playing with a fake plastic guitar was never going to be a prescription for cool.  Bragging about your high score on Through the Fire and Flames on expert level in Guitar hero 3 was never going to make you the life of the party or get you laid. But what if a video game could teach you the real thing?  Enter Rocksmith.Rocksmith is a guitar game that uses a real guitar.  It's an obvious advancement for the genre, but one that hasn't come through until now.  All of the Guitar Hero braggers now have their chance to put it where their mouth is and actually do something cool and challenging by picking this one up.  The game come packaged with a USB cord used to plug your electric rock machine of choice into your xbox 360 and commence to thrash it up.  It's a great concept: learn to play guitar and get your music game fix at the same time.  That said Rocksmith has some problems, part of which is maybe being too little too late to save a dying game genre, but it is still the best way to get a gamer to learn how to play actual music and is highly recommended to that end.  You can pick up Rocksmith and a cheapelectric guitar starter setright here on Amazon for about what you'd pay for the latestRock Band 3 guitar controllerby itself.Now I haven't so much as touched an instrument for 5 years, and 5 years ago I was inept at best.  But I had a chance to pick this up so I dusted off my old Fernandez Revolver and plugged into Rocksmith as a beginner once again.  I have to say that people who have never played guitar may have a real problem starting out.  GH and RB were both very easy for anyone to pick up and play.  This is not the case with Rocksmith.  5 buttons is easier to manage than the 216 frets on my guitar any way you care to slice it.  Including open strings, that is 222 notes compared to the traditional 5 in other music games.  So suffice to say this will be a challenge even for the hardest core of gamers around.  The game starts out easy enough with only a very few notes actually integrated into your performance of The Stones' rendition of \"Satisfaction\".  Based on how well you manage, the game gauges your ability and adds notes appropriately as you master individual riffs and licks.  Eventually, if you've got the goods, you will be playing these songs note for note, even without looking at the screen for your cues.  That is what we call \"playing a song on the guitar\".  Congrats.  You now have a legitimate ability that will not deter members of the opposite sex from expressing affection towards you and no longer have to brag about your high score on a song.  You can just pick up a guitar and play it like a boss.But what if you already know how to play Nirvana's \"In Bloom\" or could care less about the alterative-heavy playlist?  Well, here's where it gets gooooooood.  You see, as you play and perform in Rocksmith, you unlock new guitars, amps, and pedals.  you can use these to make CUSTOM TONES.  Now, why did I write that in caps?  BECAUSE IT IS AWESOME!  That's why.  I love to noodle around with guitar sounds, as any music fan would, but I really can't justify spending the thousands and thousands of dollars it takes to get the equipment it takes to do that.  Rocksmith has digitized guitar effects of every variety approximating the sounds of classic guitar equipment of every type from classic guitar models to every kind of effects pedal you can think of.  Make your ultimate distorted punk rock tone, or amp up the delay and modulation effects to create the most mind-bending spaced-out sounds you can imagine for starters.  Mix, match, and adjust dozens of amps, guitars, pedals, cabinets, and even choose how the virtual microphones are placed to create an infinite number of possible tones for your instrument.  You can save up to three custom tones mapped to the buttons on your controller and switch to them at any time while you play any song.  Holy wow.  If you already know how to play and just aren't into music games, this feature still makes Rocksmith a must buy for guitar aficionados, especially if you have a sweet sound system on your tv.  I could seriously jam all day on this thing.  I may never use my actual amp again.My only problem with the game itself is that it treats itself more like a traditional music game than a guitar teaching tool.  There are some pretty cool games that will help your fretting skills some, and some lame \"technique challenges\" that give you a very brief sink-or-swim segment to play after a brief tutorial on concepts like double-stops, hammer-ons, or power chords, but really there should be no time limit on these challenges.  They should continue until you get it instead of making you go in and out of the menus every minute or so if you have trouble catching on.  This is very tiresome and defeats the purpose.  The game focuses very much on advancing and unlocking.  I just wanted to unlock more venues, songs, and equipment and really couldn't be bothered to actually master the songs, which is really what playing guitar is about.  Then again, I still really suck so mastering most of these songs isn't happening any time soon.  Also in the lose column, Rocksmith throws a lot of things at you without any tutorial whatsoever, which is ridiculous at times.  A beginner isn't going to know a barre chord when they see it onscreen.  It just looks like a jumbled mess of notes after so many songs of all single notes.  Without somebody showing you the proper way to place your fingers, I could see some players having a lot of frustration with things like this.All in all, Rocksmith is a solid beginning for making the jump from music party games to real music games for aspiring musicians.  It's far from perfect, but a dedicated gamer will absolutely find themselves playing guitar for realsies before they even know it.  I should probably warn new players that you will not be able to play this game all day and night like older music games at first.  It takes time to develop callouses on the fingers on your fretting hand and until then, THEY WILL HURT.  I'd recommend only an hour or two a day for the first week or so.  Honestly, I considered giving this 5 stars for the custom tone feature alone, but I have to keep in mind that this is meant to be a guitar teaching tool, and as far as that goes, the results are more mixed.  Playing music is challenging and requires a lot of practice, and while this game simplifies it for beginners, there is still going to be a level of frustration that will lead to a lot of quitters.  I know I'm getting my butt kicked, and I at least understood most of the mechanics and techniques going in.  I'm just too clumsy to implement them fast enough.  That said, if you want to give guitar a try, this is a good way to start, especially if you are a high level gamer who craves a challenge and learns fast.  If you are more the creative type, the custom tone feature will keep you jamming and experimenting for hours on end, and the game does not penalize you for embellishing the songs a little.  As long as you hit the necessary notes, you can add extra solos, fills, whammy bar dives, and other personal touches at will without hurting your score.  This is your music game, play it however you like.  Guitar beginners and veterans alike will find a lot to love about this game, so even with the problems it's a step that music-loving gamers should definitely take.  Rock Band and Guitar Hero are dead.  Long live Rocksmith.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2011"}

This is an immersive, action-packed world of dark hallways and darker intentions.","reviewerName":"M. S. Hillis","summary":"Less, but also More, than it appears","reviewText":"I bought this game when it first came out, expecting to be able to just jump into dozens of arenas, handle a huge arsenal of the usual weapons, and enjoy some good split-screen deathmatch after tiring of Halo. (I don't have Xbox Live, so shoppers needing details on that should look elsewhere in these reviews).My first reaction was disappointment. It is complicated to set up a character and to figure out how to play splitscreen. Most of this is due to a patchy instruction manual. The action was also very frenetic, almost too chaotic for me after months of playing the more moderately paced Halo. The graphics were pretty good, but I'd heard only glowing things about the characters and maps, and it just didn't look that good to me. Most disappointingly was a seeming lack of cool arenas for deathmatch -- only about eight or so. I wasn't interested in playing the other game styles, like capture the flag, double domination, and bombing run. I would have only given the game about three stars based on that experience.That's where my mistake lay. I recently launched into the single player mode, which takes you through all the various kinds of matches. To my surprise, I discovered they are much more fun than I had imagined. There are seven or eight different arenas for each kind of match, and the outdoor ones really shine. Also, in the full-screen single-player mode, the graphics rock. The textures, detail and colors are great, and easy beat Halo in my estimate. I've also gotten a chance to get used to the weapons, and when you learn the ins and outs of them, it becomes fun to frag opponents in new and inventive ways.A couple complaints still remain. It is hard to tell some of the weapons apart, so sometimes I'm not sure what I'm using until I fire it a couple times. And I still haven't fully masterd the arsenal yet -- it shouldn't be this hard to get a handle on the weapons. Though I may just be dense, I haven't fully figured out the health/shield/adrenaline power ups. I just pick up every power up I see, but don't really have a sense of how they are applied.I wish I could play this on Xbox Live -- the awesome full-screen single player experience really makes me pine for some live opponents and teammates. But as a standalone shooter it actually plays a lot better than I orginally thought.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00006F7S8","description":"It's hard to believe that creator Will Wright had trouble selling his originalSimCityconcept to publishers. That first game went on to fame, notoriety, and great praise--from critics, gamers, and even educators--and spawned countless imitators, not the least of which include Wright's own smaller-scaleThe Sims, which went on to become a phenomenon in its own right. Now on its fourth edition,SimCityreturns to our hard drives, and would-be city planners everywhere will be busy for a long, long time.SimCity 4functions much like its predecessors. You've got the power to zone land as residential (green), commercial (blue), and industrial (yellow). You control the budget. You decide where to place crucial services like police, fire, medical, and even utilities like power and water. You place schools, parks, roads, water towers, and scenery as you accede to the many demands of your Sim citizens. Do a good job and your city will grow and the money will flow into your coffers. Do a bad job and the people will pack up and move away, leaving your city treasury in horrific debt and landing you what the game cheekily considers to be a far easier job: senator. The game requires a balancing act that takes both planning and a persnickety nature. There are charts to read, reports to watch, and, above all, needs to juggle. It's rewarding when it all comes together, and frustrating when you fail, once again, to build anything worthwhile.That's why I wish the game came with a better manual. The included book glosses over most major information and then neglects important aspects, such as the RCI indicator (which explains zoning needs) and parts of the budget. At the very least, the manual should include tips on handling debt. There are two tutorials which cover the basics, but again, they won't help you get out of trouble once you get in too deep. You can find this information in thestrategy guide, which is sold separately, but you really shouldn't have to go that route.The graphics are amazing, showing a vibrant metropolis with scurrying traffic, wandering Sims, smoking chimneys, and sparkling lights when night falls. Fireworks reward each year of service. And wait until you see the cool disasters you can unleash if the mood strikes you--fire, lightning, tornado, volcano, and giant robot. Oddly, there's a significant performance hit even on fast systems. Thankfully, the stuttery scrolling and slow-to-respond zoom don't hurt the game too much since you can pause it at will or fast forward if you need to wait for your cash reserves to build. The most significant flaw is that the game only offers one save slot, which discourages experimentation.Despite minor imperfectionsSimCity 4is an awesome game. You can build several cities next to each other on the map and make them dependant on each other. (You can build the greater L.A. area, in other words.) You can even import your Sims fromThe Simsto live in your city. Such familiar characters can tell you a lot about what your city needs. Put simply, city planning has never been this fun, this challenging, or this deep.--Andrew S. BubPros:Beautiful graphics and animationDeeper and more realistic than ever beforeCons:Runs slowly on most systemsInadequate manual","reviewerName":"Markus Egger \"www.MarkusEgger.com/blog\"","summary":"It's cool.... it  [smells]... it's OK, I guess...","reviewText":"When I first started this game (on an adequate computer), I was blown away! Sound and graphics are great, but they require a very powerful machine. I got a P4, 3GHz, 1GB ram, Radeon 9700 graphics card, and the performance is just OK. I installed it on an older rig (year and a half old), and it was not playable at all.If you have good hardware however, this game is beautiful. The city is full of life, and there are a great number of different things happening. Many different buildings and styles. Awesome!Once you get past that, you are in for a few frustrating hours. I do not care what other people say. This game is very hard! Mainly because of the lack of instructions. The tutorial is very short, and the manual is very thin. I have the strategy guide, but it doesn't explain many of the basic mechanisms. Well, it shouldn't. That's what the manual should be for. But unfortunately, there are many unanswered questions at first. For instance, there are no instructions on how to set up the water supply. Should I use water towers, or a pipe system instead? How many water pumps do I need? And where does the water come from in the first place? You can figure this out on your own, but since the economic model is very tight, you can not afford to build more than you need, or you'll fail terribly.After a whole lot of trial and error however, things get clearer, and then the game isn't all that hard after all. This makes the lack of a good manual even worse!I like that Sim City 4 introduces regions. This way, you can create a large metropolis, which is a combination of a number of interacting cities. Unfortunately, the implementation of this idea is sub-optimal as well. The problem is that each city still exists in it's own universe. When you switch from one city to the next, all but the active one just go to sleep. This means that no matter what you do in the other cities, nothing happens in the others. Example: Build a power plant and a power line to another city. Then, sell all the power to the other city. This will make you a lot of money. Then, just before you switch to the other city, turn off the selling operation. This means that although you collected money from that other city (and the money showed up in your account), the other city didn't actually have to pay at all, since nothing changed since you left and by the time you go back you turned off the power transfer. This means that the overall game doesn't have a consistant economy model, which is very disappointing especially in this game.Oh, and talking about powerlines that are built across cities. Whenever you build something in one city that influences another, that other city will update its terrain the next time you go there. This makes sense to me, but should a simple powerline change the landscape of the other city and therefore wipe out buildings? Seems to me that only one building should be moved out of the way to make room for the power line...There is one issue that truely [stinks]: Save games. You can not specify the name of a save game. Sim City will figure that out for you. Unfortunately, this means that there is only one save game per city. No going back to previous ones! So be very careful with those saves (and of course, you can not switch to another city in the region without saving or losing your information).Another point of criticism is the lack of scenarios or even a campaign. There are several different areas you can play, and that's about it. No goals. Just kinda playing away. While this is a cool mode to have, it is also boring and I really crave some more defined goals. How about solving the traffic problem in L.A.? How about getting Salt Lake City ready for the Olympics? How about keeping New York operational after global warming melts away ice caps on the poles, and half the city is about to sink into the Atlantic? How about turning around the economy of Silicon Valley?The could go as realistic or crazy as they wanted, but just give me some kind of goal!And: You always start from scratch. It will take you a very long time to build a city with anything beyond a 4 or 5 story building, let alone sky scrapers, towers, and stadiums. I find that very frustrating.Beyond that, it is a pretty cool game. Not the great game we were all expecting, but pretty good.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2003"}

I'm sick of hearing the God of War comparisons because although it borrows a few aspects from that game, there are more differences than similarities.

If  you only like open world/free roam types of games; you may not be happy with this game. It's a fixed path game which works great for me because I sometimes find everything a bit overwhelming with open worlds.Do me a favor guys.

{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"Drewz","summary":"Give it time","reviewText":"With so many good reviews on here already, I will be posting a very different kind of review for the Wii U.It's never easy being the new kid on the block. This is especially true in today's video game console world. Every new thing, from companies releasing their first tablet, to Nintendo releasing it's next home console. Each one gets slammed with all the same comments \"there's no apps, no games, it doesn't work right, etc.\"With pressures from both the industry and consumers, how can any company release a new product as they are expected to. If you delay the product to ensure that it works properly, you upset everyone, but if you release it early with the intent to iron out the wrinkles later, you still upset everyone.Nintendo had a lot to work on here. Not only did they release a home console with an entirely new way to experience games, but they also stepped up their online presence. MiiVerse now exists, the Wii U is capable of video chat, the eshop was available at launch, friendcodes are history, TVii is going to be awesome, the console has a much better internet browser than the Wii and 3DS, the list goes on.But, the first thing I listed was probably the most important detail of all. Nintendo has given us not just a more powerful console, but has given us a console capable of delivering a gaming experience that just can't be done on current gen hardware (and possibly not even next gen). It remains to be seen if anyone (other than Nintendo, of course) will take advantage of the game pad, or if, like the Wii, this console's potential just unfortunately goes by the wayside.Speaking of the Wii, I feel as though it was ahead of its time. Nintendo gave us a new way to play games, but no one dared touch the system simply because all that matters is GRAPHICS, GRAPHICS, GRAPHICS. Even awesome quality games like Xenoblade were hated on not because their graphics were bad, but simply because they were \"not HD.\" Never mind that they were fun and obviously had a lot of time and money poured into them.I've been playing video games for over 20 years. I've seen it all. I am bored with just playing prettier and prettier versions of the same games. This was the whole reason behind my purchasing a Wii U. It was Nintendo's next game changer, which will undoubtedly be copied by Sony and Microsoft in one way or another.Somewhere along the line, most of us became spoiled by the industry. We each expect companies to cater to each and every single one of our individual gaming needs. This is just plain unrealistic and is never going to happen. Part of experiencing the Wii U, will be being there as it grows and improves as a home console. Nintendo will undoubtedly patch the long loading times incurred by the OS (UPDATE: they've already released one such patch). They can easily release a newer tablet down the road with a beefier battery life.What a lot of us don't seem to realize is that Nintendo is one of the few video game companies out there that focuses on quality. How many Nintendo games come out that are packed full of bugs and glitches? None. But even when there is an exception, it gets fixed. Look at Skyward Sword. When I found out that the game had a game-breaking bug in it, I knew without a doubt that Nintendo would patch it. Even on a system with limited online capacities (I'm talking about the Wii), Nintendo was able to incorporate a patch into our lives that fixed the game.They will do the same thing with the Wii U. TVii is on its way. I don't doubt that the OS will be patched over time to make it run more efficiently. We just need to be patient and respectful. Trust me, we don't want to force Nintendo to change its ways. Do you really want another system on the market that is plagued with issues for the first 4-5 years of its life? I know I don't.Nintendo has been in the business for a long time. I support their decisions not to add excessive features such as a 500GB HDD or a built-in DVD player. People don't seem to understand that this $350 system would easily become a $500 system. Then people would just complain even more! Do we really need another console with a DVD player? No. Most of us already have 3-4 DVD players in our homes! Plus, you can buy your own HDD for cheaper than Nintendo can include one in the box.Why did I only rate this four stars?It would seem that, although Nintendo learned from the launch of the 3DS, they simply swapped one problem for another with the launch of the Wii U. Here's what I'm talking about:What the 3DS did wrong:-Was overpriced-No eshop at launch-Had to wait months for the first good game to come outThe Wii U fixed all those things, but created new problems:-HUGE day-one update that was required to enjoy core parts of the system-Whereas the eshop was available at launch, there's nothing to buy on it!-It's clear the console's OS could have used some more TLCThese things might not seem like all that big of a deal, but they are enough to alienate some people. Unfortunately, in today's world, it's not what you sell, but how much you sell. So, even though it pains me to admit, Nintendo needs those who don't truly understand their products in order to succeed.On a final note, Nintendo didn't have to give us a built-in Wii with the system. They merely could have said \"just keep your Wii's.\" This was another thing Nintendo did not have to do. They even gave us a way to transfer all our Wii purchases/data to our new console. Both Sony and Microsoft more or less abandoned backwards compatibility long ago.If you're like me, and you've been a fan of Nintendo since the original NES, then you understand that Nintendo is a type of innovation and quality that we do not want to lose. Trust me. While people are busying fighting over whether the Xbox One or PS4 has better graphics, I will be enjoying the experience I can only get from the Wii U.It should always be about the experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2012"}

The graphics are superb. While I'd say maybe not quit as good as heavenly sword in terms of visual quality, overall it's better because the game runs at a rock solid 60fps and feels silky smooth the entire time. The sound is wonderful and you never feel alone because there's always dialogue with Clank or other characters in the background or cut scenes. The story is very funny and uplifting, it really makes you feel like you're watching a Pixar movie.The game is one of the best game I've ever played. My all time favorite game is Super Metroid (SNES). I have loved many Sony, MS, and Nintendo games in the past so I'm no fanboy. If you're wondering if this is enough to buy a PS3 my response is a \"qualified\" yes. I would never spend $399 on a console for one game but, tons of other great games have recently been released or are coming soon.You have:Warhawk, Ratchet, Heavenly Sword, Ghost Recon, Rainbow Vegas Six, Guitar HeroIII, Oblivion and more now... and right around the corner you have Assassin's Creed, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, UTIII and much, much more...For those of you more interested in family gaming my four year old watched and was completely entertained the whole way through. Once the game was finished he responded with only one word: \"Again\". If you like this title for family gaming you'll be happy to hear there's a bunch more family oriented games on the way including what will be the most innovative title in years: Little Big Planet. It's coming around January and has already won several awards.In conclusion, Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction is a incredibly fun, attractive game that will put a smile on your face.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2007"}

Harley","summary":"Larger Screen and more secure WI-Fi (Finally!)","reviewText":"***Update 01/22/11***I have confirmed that the wi-fi issue was definitely the fault of my FiOS router, not the DSi XL.  Since replacing the router with this model: http://www.amazon.com/Netgear-Wireless-Gigabit-Router-WNDR3700/dp/B002HWRJY4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1295721483&sr;=8-1  , I no longer have any connectivity issues.  The DSi connects flawlessly every time.The larger screen of the Nintendo DSi XL not only gives more room for gaming, but also gives you a bigger canvas when drawing in Flipnotes.  Additional DSi perks are dual cameras, improved Wi-Fi (WPA compatibility, FINALLY!  I hate and do not use WEP, so our previous DSi's were useless for Wi-Fi), and download-able content.  Overall, the game is fun and my kids love downloading games and Flipnotes.  They also love creating and uploading their own Flipnotes.About the only gripe I have with the DSi XL is the horrible Wi-Fi performance.  I have two DSi XL devices and both have extremely spotty Wi-Fi connectivity at best.  It usually takes several attempts to connect to the Internet whenever they attempt to go online.  I waited forever for DS WPA compatibility, so I'm happy to finally have any kind of Wi-Fi, but it does get annoying. Now in all fairness, I probably have the world's worst router, the Actiontec used with Verizon FiOS.  Apple device users and early iPad adopters, (including yours truly), are already very familiar with the wretched performance and compatibility of this lemon of a router.  Therefore, I won't pin the Wi-Fi woes completely on Nintendo, not just yet.  However, my iPad and several generations of iPods now all work fine with this router, so I hope Nintendo is as quick at addressing firmware updates as Apple.  I already ran every available update on the DSi, so hopefully, a firmware fix is coming soon.  Just be advised, if you have an Actiontec router, you may have issues as well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2011"}
{"product_name":"B007XVTR5S","description":"","reviewerName":"Grimes","summary":"Black Ops 2 - Back in Black","reviewText":"Treyarch returns with the sequel to the hit title Call of Duty: Black Ops. This time around, Treyarch seeks to revitalize the stale franchise in ways that often actually work. After the reorganizing of Infinity Ward, I wasn't sure if I would ever really love a Call of Duty title again. I really enjoyed Black Ops but it still had that \"sameness\" to it. Looking back, I think a big portion of that was due to the recent modern military settings the franchise had been exploring. It was, in a sense, repeating the same mistakes it had made by constantly utilizing the World War II setting.With Black Ops 2, we are transported to an imagined future filled with high tech gadgets and fast paced warfare. The campaign is short as the previous Call of Duty titles since the popularization of online multiplayer have been. Imagine playing through a triple size action movie. Now imagine playing through a good action movie. That's exactly what the single player experience feels like. The integration of futuristic gadgets and methods of warfare is very refreshing as opposed to the old \"walk down the corridor until all the enemies\" are dead scenario. To be certain, there is still much of that. However, the large set pieces and action moments serve the story well and mix things up. The Strike Force additions are also a nice, innovative touch with the primary drawback being your allies' AI. I commend Treyarch for their well done attempt at moving the series forward.Multiplayer in Black Ops 2 is definitely the best we've seen. There have been many changes to discourage camping such as making Ghost and suppressors harder to unlock (Ghost also only works when you are in motion). The new scorestreaks (previously killstreaks) are very fun to play with and further immerse the player into that futuristic world of war. Scorestreaks, by the way, is perhaps the best system I've seen to reward players. Everything you do in game (assists, caputring objectives, etc) gives you points towards your overall scorestreak. This does well to encourage team play and get those pesky run-and-gunners to provide some level of support. The create-a-class system has been revamped with the all new 10 point system. This allows you to cater to your favored playing style in a way we've not seen before in the franchise. Customization is still there with playercards, weapon attatchments and camo (no face paint this time). The maps are also wonderfully designed and a welcome break from the trainwreck design featured in MW3. There are also a lack of contracts as seen in the first Black Ops. That was a feature I really enjoyed and so it is sad to see that wasn't carried over. Leveling up is somewhat harder and thus unlocking items for use is also more difficult. Most players are thus on a pretty equal footing for the first half of the leveling system.Overall, this is the best entry in the Call of Duty franchise since the initial Modern Warfare. Detractors of the franchise are still not going to find anything to like about the game while fans are going to revel in the very welcome changes. I think it is necessary to point out that Black Ops 2 serves to change and perfect what needs to be done while still preserving the essence that is Call of Duty. Players really don't want the series to change into something that is hardly recognizable as Call of Duty. More like they want the experience to feel fresh. I think Black Ops 2 does that well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2012"}

I thought that if the multiplayer engine was going to run the game,it would run smoothly.  Wow, was I wrong!  There are so many problems with tranzit zombies, that it's laughable.Let me begin by writing that you can't even play a solo, offline game, because the game WILL freeze on you.  After hostmigration occurs, the game WILL freeze on you.  When you time out, the game WILL freeze on you.  For no reason at all,the game WILL freeze on you.  If you're unaware of such harmful effects, console crashes do irreparable damage to your harddrive.  The League MP system is a bad joke.  You don't get paired with similarly skilled players, but rather with peoplewho have been winning or losing as frequently.  You have to play five prerequisite placing matches.  League matches onlymake sense if you have five friends ready to go.  The combination of stat tracking and navigation of a large tranzit mapfreezes your console.  I absolutely DO NOT recommend this cancerous game to anyone.  Please don't be offended by the termcancerous.  If you really need to know about multiplayer and zombies, I'll share some knowledge with you.  During combattraining, you get paired with two other players and three AI per team.  Most matches can be fun, until you run into freakplayers who rack up kill streaks fast, and suck the fun out of the game.  Why do good players need combat training anyway?The maps are smaller, have more color, and have more corridoors.  There are usually more than two ways to access areas,but that doesn't stop campers from imposing their will upon those with less patience.  You still have to play smart.If you have lightning reflexes, you can get away with running and gunning.  There are a wide selection of scopes and gunaccessories.  The 10 point system for classes is straight forward.  You have to use two points for extra perks, an extraprimary weapon, extra lethal or 3 gun attachments.  Zombies has a different feel, which takes time to get used to.You have to stab at closer range, and is much more risky when the zombies are on fire, because they will exlpode in yourface.  If you have galvaknuckles, they don't explode.  There are alot of powerful, unuseful and servicable guns in the ? box.It takes some time to learn how to play tranzit.  You can either ride the bus between the five areas or run with jug anda melee weapon.  In zombies, you always have to learn what not to do in order to stay alive.  The survival maps are prettylackluster.  In the depot level, there are no perks, so it's similar to Nacht Der Toten.  You do have the box and mp5.On the farm, the only thing missing is pack a punch.  This is a particularly mind-numbing level, as you can stay in the safezone, waiting for zombies to round up, as you watch other players run around like aggressive morons.  In the town, you haveto watch out for all the fire cracks, because even with jug, and explosion will kill you.  There's not much room to breathin the town, so to use your ammo effectively, you have to run all over the place.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2012"}

I could go on forever about this game but if you would like to see a long review about this game you can view it under MW2 PC game because I would rate them the exact same except....*The maps are retarded small....I mean really small you can go 3 seconds without seeing anyone at least MW2 had some bigger maps with more strategy involved*It seems there are even more crap that is flying around in the air to kill you...I went a whole round of TDM dying 15 time and only one of those was by a person and every other death was some machine killing me.*The second time a sat down to play this game I had to join 6 different maps to find one that didn't have any obvious aim botting going.  The game is so much like MW2 that they can probably use the same Hack.ON THE PLUS SIDE*They did change up the Kill Streak system so it is better but still ridiculous.  The reward you get for killing so many people should be the points you get for killing so many people...not helicopters, Jets, and Bombers. JESUS!!!*The only other plus I have for this game is that I DID NOT PAY FOR IT!!!!....STEAM had a free weekend for multiplayer and that's how I played it...THANK GOD...because if I payed $60 for this glorification of MW2 I would be pretty upset.BOTTOM LINEAfter all the fuss about non dedicated servers in MW2 and then they go and do the same thing....wow thanks I appreciate that!!! I know they have dedicated servers but they are un-ranked and that's no fun.....sure maybe to just goof off a bit but that is about it.  If you like MW2 then you will like this one no hands down just because its practically the same with new maps and weapons but the gameplay is they same.I honestly don't know why they even tagged this game as MW3....They could have just came out with a few more map packs, then charged everyone $15 a piece for them, then did a expansion pack just like the Spec Ops expansion pack for BF2 and charged $30 for it.  Then you are up to $75 a customer.  They could have gotten more money and it would have been just as disappointing lol....Then while all this was going on they could have been building an actual MW3 game that wasn't a glorification of the last and THEN CHARGED $60 for it, and even if it was crappy people would still buy it.  But not this guy...I have been a huge fan of COD and I still play the crap out of COD4MW.  I also bought MW2 and logged many hours on it but the non dedicated servers is what destroyed this series for me when I was playing MW2.  I haven't bought one since and I don't plan too.All and all this is my opinion, but in the end, COD series lost a customer....

The first is the meteor shooting mission. It comes about 1/3rd of the way through the game, and there are probably people who never get past it. (Some PC players download the completed mission save file from the Web so they can move on, but Xboxers don't have that option.) I almost quit. I had tried it 50 times over several days (using all the tips found online), then finally after 5 tries one day, I made it, though I did not feel that I did anything different from how I played it the other times.After I finished the game, I restarted from scratch. This time I failed 20 times in one day. Came back the next day and got it on the first try. Again, I didn't feel like I played any different when I made it. I think it depends on a huge luck factor. I noticed that when I won, I got only 1 of the big meteors and almost none of the fast ones. What's the point when what it takes to win is not skill but just the whim of the game?I find that replaying a mission even 5 times quickly becomes not-fun, and this is about as boring and as un-fun as any mission can get (shooting at incoming meteors). Failing 50 times, or even 20 times, or even 10 times, is just ricidulous when winning is mainly luck.The other flaw is that the game just isn't very long. When a game developer produces a game, they can make it last a long time by putting in lots of missions and places to explore, like Fallout 3 does, or they can avoid doing all that extra work by just making it so that you have to replay each mission at least several times. In contrast, you can play Bioshock on Hard all the way through without ever dying and the game lasts a lot longer than this one.A relatively minor flaw is that you cannot skip long narrative portions of the game, which is really boring after the first playthrough, especially if you have to replay a scene multiple times. This is yet another \"cheat\" used to make games last longer.Those flaws aside, the game is a lot of fun to play and is very scary. When you die, you usually start over right before the scene in which you died, and with the same health and ammo you had at the start, which is much better than, say, Grand Theft Auto 4.There is a good variety of foes which attack in different ways and which require different types of weapons to defeat efficiently, and the different weapons are fun to use and upgrade, though it is not possible to fully upgrade more than 1 or 2 weapons on the first playthrough, even if you never upgrade your suit or stasis or kinesis features. In fact, it may not be possible to upgrade them all in TWO play-throughs.The only problem, shared by all games of this types, is that on the first play-through, when you don't know how best to proceed, you are constantly running low on health packs, ammo, and cash. Then on subsequent play-throughs, when you understand how to manage these things, you end up with more of them than you can ever use, which makes the game less interesting. In fact, one option after winning the game is to start over with all the weapons and ammo you amassed during the first playthrough, which is no challenge at all, though it is kind of fun just walk around kicking everbody's a**.Before paying even sub-$20 for this game, the buyer should consider if s/he will be okay with possibly having to replay a really boring mission for 20, 50 or more times. If you can live with that, the game is well worth the cost; otherwise, getBioShockorFallout 3or evenCrackdownorHalf-Life (The Orange Box)-- each about the same price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2010"}

But I think that atleast they have disks because since NES-N64 Nintendo has been using cartridges and Sega made cartridges in the beginning but they changed to disks before the Nintendo (and atleast their disks are normal). They have some good games like Sonic which are really good games to own.

{"product_name":"B001CLYL1K","reviewerName":"Old School Gamer \"What the hell's a gigawatt!?!\"","summary":"This isn't the original WolfenStein. It's better.","reviewText":"This game reminds me a lot of Farcry 2 for a couple of reasons.First, the world is open and this game is as much of an adventure like Bioshock was as much as it is a shooter. This game rewards exploration and that is my favirote part of the whole experience.Second, you must search for money and valuables to expand your abilities, weapons, and overall combat effectiveness and this is likewise my favirote addition to this series.Now as for the gameplay, it's not going to blow your mind and it's intention is purelly to entertain, not set the bar for the entire genre. It is a beautifully crafted game with graphics on par with any of the most advanced shooters out there. The world is quite large when compared to some of the more recent shooters that tout exploration and freeroaming as a reason to buy it(I'm looking at you Crysis). It really feels to me like they took the formula Farcry 2 used and revamped it, however. This game is more centered around the story though and it is a fun story to go through. Every \"mission\" is just that, a mission set in a different instanced zone of the main town you explore. You meet the objectives, try to find all of the upgrades before leaving that mission, go purchase some nifty new expansions to your guns and occult powers and you're on your way to kill more nazis. I'm only about 50% through the game myself, but I did that in almost one sitting simply because I loved this game so damn much.I can't say anything about the multiplayer other than this game was not intended to be a multiplayer monster, so I don't know why people are wrecking the score by reviewing it based solelly on the multiplayer experience. Much the same way Doom III or F.E.A.R. II did, they simplified it and made it much more like a console multiplayer experience where it's much more run'n'gun and honestly less of a skilled duel between sides on TDM or something. This isn't a game you buy for multiplayer. Personally, I thought that was quite apparent by the preview info released on this product, but I guess I'm giving people more credit than I should.Overall this game is a great purchase and one I think it worth buying if you love shooters on your pc. The name sells this game more than anything though as it would be a mediocre experience if it wasn't set in the Wolfenstein universe. Bottom line is that it is a fresh direction for a game like this and one that is very fun to play. Farcry 2 ran out of steam towards the end because the \"story\" was lackluster and the whole mission thing started to make the game feel like a sandbox game more than anything. With this game, I'd say they did a much better job of keeping interesting content flowing in the form of puzzles based on your supernatural abilities and just a varied set of missions in many different zones. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun shooter.EDIT: I'm now about 90% through the game and I can whole-heartedly say I'm disappointed, not in the game, but because the experience is almost over. I'm glad though, it shows it wasn't just my initial reaction to the game my first few times playing. This game gets better and better the further along you go and it can easily take you 15-20 hours if you're looking for everything, more if you work slowly like I do.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"David G. Harpstrite","summary":"343 out Bungies Bungie!","reviewText":"Halo has been a major part of my gaming life since I first played it back all those years ago. I got it for my birthday with my first xbox along with a few other games. I didn't initially play it either, I was more interested in some of the others. But when I booted it up a few hours later, it was the game that made me love the xbox. More than that, it was the only game I got that year that I continued to boot up for years. Halo will always hold a special place in my heart, as I'm sure it does for many gamers, as the first truly great shooter for a console. Bungie crafted a masterpiece of a game, and maintained that standard of quality with their subsequent sequels. So, when they finally passed the mantle of Halo off to 343 industries, I was understandably skeptical. In fact, I wrote it off when I first saw the trailer at E3 back in 2011. But in the time between that trailer and November 6th they swayed me. I saw gameplay, heard about the story and novels going with the game. I went from being done with Halo to being completely ready for more. But could 343 match Bungie, maintain the standard set, or even more interesting, could they surpass it? Well, yes, in my opinion anyway. Let me explain why.Presentation ***minor spoilers****I'll start with what is most important to me, the story. This is where Halo 4 truly delivers. Halo 4 begins with the return of Master Chief, awakening from Cryo sleep 4 years after the third game. The covenant are attacking them for some reason and there is an odd forunner planet sucking them in. On top of that Cortana, Chief's AI and companion through all the games, is starting to deteriorate due to rampancy. AI's start to think themselves to death after 7 years, and Cortana has been active for 8. This is where the strength of the plot is. The relationship between Chief and Cortana is put front and center, the space opera plot line, while also good, is secondary to the emotional story of Chief's desperate attempt to save Cortana from her inevitable death. There is a genuine connection between the two characters rarely seen in games. This is all conveyed through the outstanding voice work done by the entire cast, but particularly by Jen Taylor's performance as Cortana, who steals the show. The game is really more her story than Chief's. An interesting byproduct of the story is a role reversal of the two. Chief is now having to think logically and problem solve when Cortana's rampancy gets the better of her. In fact, all through the game she is getting him into as much trouble as the Covenant, or the new villains of the game, the Promethians, are. That brings me to the new villain of the game, The Didact. He is an ancient Forunner who is immensely powerful, worshiped as a God by the more fanatical sects of the Covenant, and somebody who has a great disdain for humanity.  For the first time Master Chief has to face off against a villain who is more than capable of defeating him. The Didact is a threatening presence when he is around and you know defeating him will not be easy. Unlike the former antagonist, Truth, Didact has a clear and rational motive. He is ruthlessly efficient in executing his plans as well. I won't go into any more details, but needless to say the plot of this game is by far the best in the series. The characters grow, and feel real. The story moves at a good pace, never feeling too slow or too fast, and it really opens up so many possibilities for the future of the series.Secondly, the Graphics for Halo 4 are astounding. I know I keep raving about graphics in my reviews, but I am just blown away by what the Xbox can do. Halo 4 is perhaps the best looking xbox game to date. The landscapes are vast and gorgeous, the structures interesting and detailed, the character look, move and feel alive. Facial animations are on the level of LA Noir and motion capture is spot on. Nothing feels stiff or awkard about any of it. To give you an idea, in the cut scenes with Master Chief, I knew exactly what emotions he was conveying despite the fact that I never saw his face. The Body language says it all. The game is colorful, vast and just stunning to behold. It is a great argument for more games that use more colors than brown and grey. *cough*Gearsofwar*cough*As I stated before, the voice work is top notch in this game. On top of that the game's sound is amazing, There was obviously great care put into making sure all the sound effects for explosions, mele attacks, and the guns sounded good. All the weapon sounds were redone and personally I think it is for the better. The music for the game is also quite good, but unfortunately there are only a few memorable tracks as opposed to the past games having several. I was disappointed by a lack of the series' classics, including the main theme with the monks chanting, which is not on the main screen. That is a minor gripe, but I really missed it. Hell, I wouldn't mind if they would have just reused any of the main theme tracks from the first three games, but I digress. The music is still a cut above the competition, it just isn't the great and epic score that would normally accompany a Halo game thanks to Marty O'Donnell.GameplayHalo 4's gameplay is pretty familiar, they didn't change much from Reach, in fact the controls are exactly the same except for a few button swaps. They are also air tight and 100% responsive. This isn't a bad thing. 343 had a lot riding on this game, and playing it safe was the right call. If they were to change too much fans might not be receptive, plus, keeping the feel of Halo mostly the same from Reach makes it familiar enough for fans to transition with ease. If I wasn't told that 343 was doing this game, I'd have thought Bungie made it. Much like Reach, the armor abilities are back, some returning, such as active camouflager or jet packs, and some new like the sentry turret or promethian vision to spice things up. Thankfully the useless or unbalanced armor abilities like the drop shield or armor lock are gone or improved upon. An example of these improvements is the sensible decision to make sprinting something any spartan can do at all times. It is no longer an armor ability. The AI in Halo 4 is top notch as well, especially on Legendary. The enemies are smart, they will try to out think you and often surprised me with how clever they got. The Covenant were familiar though, but what really got me was how smart the Promethians were. These guys go from deviously clever to cruel and ruthlessly unrelenting. This is all good, as despite all this, Legendary is very fun if you like a good challenge. The Arsenal in Halo 4 is as diverse and wonderful as ever. Though not every gun or vehicle returns, all of the best ones do. There are also a wide array of great new weapons to use. Every Promethian weapon is a joy to use, though they are for the most part very similar to the kinds of weapons you'd use from the human or covenant arsenal.  I was let down by the lack of a flying human vehicle though. The Hornet and Hawks were so fun in Halo 3 and Reach respectively. Also weapons like the plasma rifle and sub machine gun were missed. Speaking of those guns, I am yet again disappointing that there is no dual wielding. That said, those are minor gripes, and the lack of some of those guns is perfectly understandable within in the context of the story. Theater is also back so you can take pictures and film events, it is pretty much the same, but this is a mode that didn't need to change, so it is quite alright.The Multiplayer for Halo 4 is perhaps the biggest surprise for me personally. I have always loved Halo multiplayer, but I confess I've never been that good at it. Always been a single player kind of guy, but I love Halo so much that even if I was doing poorly I had fun. Halo 4's Multiplayer, however, is quite different. I found myself actually doing well most of the time. This is likely due to the fact that I can customize my load out. I start with a DMR instead of an assault rifle and can pick off enemies from afar while also being able to handle myself if they get close. I always wanted to be able to start with weapons like that, and with Halo 4's progression system, I can. Halo 4 does in fact borrow a few elements from Call of Duty, but it never feels like anything except Halo. The weapons you can start out with are just your basic automatic or semi-automatic rifles and pistols, as well as two of the 3 different kinds of grenades. It is insanely balanced so that nobody has an unfair advantage. Another addition is the option to call in weapons or power ups after you get so many points. Halo 4 runs on a point system so that everything you do gets rewarded, similar to Battlefield 3. Halo 4 takes what is great about modern day shooters and applies them to Halo to modernize it. These changes are for the better. Also, unlike Reach's leveling system, getting XP is not extremely slow and leveling up is worth it. Few armors feel out of reach and most anything These include things such as armor, emblems or stances. On that topic I actually found that I wasn't overly excited about a lot of the armor. Most if it is great, but I miss my ODST helmet. Sure the recruit helmet is very similar, but I feel like there was no reason why they couldn't bring all the armors back, and not just some of them. But again, that is a minor gripe that doesn't make the game worse. If you want to acquire any of that stuff you can with a bit of time, patience and skill. Speaking of which, like Halo's of old, the game isn't something that anybody can just pick up and be good at. You do need some skill to play, unlike CoD, which is so simplistic that anybody can do it. Usually if you get killed it is because the person got lucky, was better than you, or had better equipment. It isn't because of a lack of balance or over powered guns and perks. Most of the maps in the game are also quite good, my personal favorites are Haven, a map similar to Narrows from Halo 3, and Ragnarok, a remake of Valhalla. Spawn points are fair and wide spread. Unlike in games like MW3, you won't get spawn killed all the time because the maps are too small or spawn points aren't regulated enough. A great deal of care went into each map and it shows. The one potential down side is the mutliplayer requires 8 GB of memory off your hard drive, so just be sure you have enough space for it. Halo 4's mutliplayer is probably the best of the series.On top of that, Forge has returned and is mostly the same, so much that a most of the building blocks and tools are exactly the same from Reach. They have new skins that are specific to the particular map they're on though, so it isn't like it's all the same thing no matter what. This isn't bad, but some variety would have been nice. This is kind of made up for by the addition of map specific items and minor improvements to the mechanics such as magnets, locking items and duplicating. These tweaks are nice, but not overwhelmingly imaginative and this forge is not the complete overhaul that Reach's was. Also, the Forge maps are great, but none of them are as big or as versatile as Forge world was and it is disappointing to see that they did not make an equivalent, or hell, just a remake for this game. So while I can't say Forge is a let down, it also isn't something I'm going to rave about. It is just mostly unchanged. Hopefully Halo 5 will allow 343 to really improve upon it in a significant way.Finally, there is Spartan Ops. This is the replacement for firefight. Spartan Ops is a weekly series of missions that tell an over arching narrative while also giving you lots of things to do. The maps are mostly reused from campaign missions and it all really boils down to killing lots of enemies and pressing buttons, but I can't complain. It is more fun than firefight in a lot of ways. It isn't as monotonous, and the story line that goes with it is interesting enough. I look forward to new episodes every week. I do feel like I'm working towards something and playing with friends or even strangers is a lot of fun. It is a worthy replacement to firefight, though I think having both couldn't hurt.So, all together, Halo 4 is a truly great addition to the Halo series. The story is emotional and well told, the gameplay is as solid as ever, graphically it is amazing and the mutliplayer is top notch. It is a triumph for 343 industries. The fact that they so bravely took the mantle of this universe and managed to delivered something truly wonderful is to be commended. Most developers would botch such an endeavor, but it is clear that Microsoft and 343 truly care about this franchise. The return of Master Chief is not just one of the best Halo games in the series, or even arguably the best, but it is also one of the best games I've played all year. Its problems are all so minor and often just personal preferences rather than legitimate issues. Halo 4 is a front runner for game of the year and if you are a fan of the series, or just a fan of shooters, you owe it to yourself to get this game.10 out of 10Pros-Amazingly well told and emotional story-Great voice work-Fantasic sound-Possibly the best Graphics on the Xbox-Great enemy AI-Vast and diverse array of weapons and equipment-Major improvements on several gameplay mechanics-Modernized Multiplayer that stands out-Unlockables are within reach and easy to obtain-Customization is vast and fun-Spartan Ops is a great additionCons-Forge could have used more improvements and additions-The absence of firefight is disappointing-Spartan Ops maps could use more variety so's to not feel recycled.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2012"}

In those terms, it's the same old Halo combat with vehicles and whatnot which is fine, but some reviews suggest that this game is somewhat refreshing and new with the new development team--I hardly noticed any differences in past games aside from the new enemies.

Kudos to the team who said, 'Boss, we can take that whole Gotta Catch Em All motto and make money for the company.'Skylanders Giants is more of the same. That's both the pro and the con. If you loved the first outing, you're really going to dig the new trip through the floating islands of Skylanders.Of course the Giants have new and improved powers, so you'll have to go and pick up Granite Crusher, Eye Brawl, and the like. But the great part to this game is that all of those Skylanders that you invested in, both money-wise and in terms of gameplay, can still jump in and battle the baddies. Speaking of which, there are new foes to fight in Skylanders Giants, but a certain balded nemesis is also around to stir the pot once again.The Skylanders are fun to collect and play in game. Don't get me started on pondering just how much our collection is worth. Between basic Skylanders, the new Giants, AND the super-duper Lightcore critters, we're helping put somebody's kid through medical school. But I'm drifting off topic.The new Skylanders Giants is a lot of fun, even if it is a spicier helping of more of the same. The old favorites can still play in the new playground, and you can take them to your buddy's place even if you have a Wii and he has an X-Box. Will the folks at Activision remain the 800 pound gorilla once Disney launches their new collectible gameDISNEY INFINITY Starter Pack Wii (including Davy Jones and Power Disc Pack)?

About 35 hours into it I was noticing some serious flaws and was starting to re live my Fallout New Vegas nightmare. There is no excuse for any game to have as many issues as this game has period.  I could write at least a full page on the numerous glitches I have encountered in my time playing.  From quests repeating to npcs not awarding quests or rewards to people sending me to dungeons I already cleared then the games freezes or rampant dragons flying at warp speed so I can't kill them to name a few.  Then instead of fixing the multitude of glitches all Bethesda does is patch the level up glitch...the one glitch most players probably didn't mind.If you haven't bought a copy buy used, that way Bethesda won't make any more money for being so sloppy. It's sad to see them rewarded for such sloppy work. I should have known they wouldn't make a polished game as they never do.Now aside from glitches there is alot of fun to be had.  Skyrim looks beautiful on the screen and until your save file grows the loads aren't so bad.  As you get further along it slow down and starts to lock up sometimes.  The leveling trees are extensive and you can play however you want.  I played once as a warrior/archer and once as a flame throwing zombie raiser and both styles were rewarding.  The combat is improved compared to Oblivion but still not as fun as other games.  You basically get 2-3 moves per weapon and that's it. The story is vaguely interesting but wont wow you and after 50 side quests you'll be tired of the many go fetch this or kill this thing for a person you just met quests.  The real meat of this game is dungeons and loot.  You can spend hours gathering items to craft potions or smith weapons.  The more powerful you get the enemies level with you so you don't get to just own everything.  This keeps things challenging. If you like dungeons and running errands you will be a happy camper and should get over 150hrs of playing time.  Of course you'll find a lot of glitches along the way.  If you are looking for a story or RPG this isn't it.  The stories a bit lacking and there are only 5 actors used for all the main voice over's.  To conclude yes the games fun I give it a 7/10 simply due to the many glitches and poor story telling.  Seriously it was super cheesy to get married simply because I was wearing a particular necklace.  I found most of the people just lacked depth.  I was not unhappy with it as I did get lot of play time for my investment.  I don't feel it was the 9/10 score the professionals reviews sold it to me as.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2012"}

But if you are a casual gamer who just wants to load in a game play and turn it off, this is not your game. Save system is horrible in this game for casual gamers, not to mention it glitches a lot which is frustrating. The colors are bland as well.This review might confuse people because of how much hype and love this game is given. But I have played many RPG's and this game to me is not as great as its cracked up to be. I still play WOW, Starcraft, Diablo II and III, as well as God of War, Zelda's. You know games you can get lost into because you forget to look at the clock and hours upon hours go by.Skyrim is not that game, to me the time went by from exploring but not actually accomplishing anything, which really disappoints. I like a game where story and characters take you to places and not where you go exploring and eventually you'll find side quests which to me are just fillers then contribute to actual gameplay.Everyone praises this game, but if you are a casual gamer, or perhaps someone looking for a long game with a long story. Look elsewhere you'll be much happier I promise. Pick up Mass Effect 3, or even Boarderlands 2. Enough action and story to keep you going and the story keeps you intrigued. If anything rent it first through redbox.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2013"}

It went from relative obscurity to headlines, and why not?  Rockstar has a reputation for making sandbox games that are nothing short of phenominal...but a cowboy game?  I was a bit skeptical at first but after watching a few videos and reading up on the game I decided that I had to give it a try, boy am I glad that I did...Red Dead Redemption takes place in the early 20th century with the traditional ways of the West giving way to a new modernized lifestyle.  Not exactly the setting I am used to for westerns.  But it works well for the game; our antagonist turned protagonist Marston is an old school guy trying to survive in this new environment.Graphically the game is fantastic.  While the textures aren't the sharpest ever they lend well to the gritty feeling of the west.  And the sheer scope of the landscapes ia amazing.  Rockstar had it rough trying to make a mostly empty environment seem interesting, and they did well.The audio is also top notch, with environmental effects fitting the look and weapons having a realistic \"bang.\"  Voice acting has been praised by many people, I don't think it's anything particularly amazing but it's certainly not bad.Alot of people make comparisons of this game with Grand Theft Auto...well...it's true.  They are very similar but they do play quite a bit differently.  In GTA your actions in the world don't really affect how you progress through it.  Mow down 50 people in the street?  That's fine, go to your next mission, no one remembers.  In Red Dead Redemption though with the honor and fame systems what you do in the world lives on with you.  If you are a hero and help the people of the land you will be lauded and side missions will be in abundance.  If you're a stone cold criminal people will fear you, how you play is up to you, something I truly enjoy in the game.The pace of the game is very flixible...you can sprint through everything trying to reach the end objective or you can do what I do, take it at a lazy (dare I say it...cowboyish?) pace, completing side quests and challenges such as killing and skinning certain animals or finding treasure.The game is very stable in Single Player with no frame rate hickups, torn textures, etc.  There are a few times when it needs to load a mission but they are few and far between, load times for an average mission are maybe 20 seconds (note: I have the game installed to my hard drive, without being installed they may be longer).Multiplayer is different.  The first time I tried playing free roam the whole thing was awful, I think it was a server problem though.  Textures dissappeared (I never saw my weapons or my horse...riding an invisible horse is a bit odd), the connections were really bad, and my game crashed.  The second time I couldn't find anyone to free roam with but all the above issues were gone and it ran smooth...hopefully I'll get more time in the saddle (get it?) with multiplayer over the next few days.The controls could be better and more intuitive.  Sprinting, ducking, diving for cover, it's not very crisp.  I've still not gotten used to switching weapons with the wheel (doesn't help that I finished Bioshock 2 last week and the \"weapon wheel\" was on the other bumper).  The horse controls are decent but take this advice: In the Options menu under config change \"Horse Control\" from \"Horse Relative\" to \"Camera Relative.\"  This will save you a ton of headache when trying to look around while riding your horse.  I had a friend almost give up on the game early because he was so frusterated with the horse camera...My one final gripe, there is a TON to do in this game but it doesn't always give you enough time to learn what to do in each situation.  For instance, my first duel...I was trying to shoot the other guy while reading the instructions on how Dead Eye works...I'm still not sure what I did.Overall if you enjoy Grand Theft Auto, sandbox games, or even just a really well made game then you need to give this a try.*I will keep updating this review as I get more play time with the game.****Update*** I put several more hours in the game today.  I noticed a few more bugs.  First, sometimes there are environmental glitches that pretty much leave you dead in the water.  For example, one guy wanted me to talk to his wife so I went and lasso'd her.  When I went to pick her up after hogtying her the animation of putting her on my shoulders was there but she was still lying on the ground.  It would not let me drop her or do anything else, I just walked around town unable to do anything.  My only option was to load a save game.Also, there will be times when running and jumping through the world that you get stuck on various objects.  On a bounty hunter mission I hogtied the bad guy and put him on the back of my horse...then I fell through the earth in a crazy glitch.  Thankfully I didn't die, it was just odd.One final oddity...the shops do not always want to open.  If you go to a town waiting for a shop to open it won't always happen.  I tried sleeping (6 hours pass when you sleep) 5 times in a row, the shops never opened (that's 1 1/4 days...).Still, despite the glitches it's still a good bit of fun, it does need some patching though.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2010"}

Do you want a challange?","reviewText":"If you buy this game expecting Oblivian, put away your credit card now.This game is a HARD 3rd person hack and slash. Okay there's spell casting too. But so far there's not much \"Role Playing\", Just survival or trying to, collecting loot, and having fun doing so.But know this, you're going to die, as a matter of fact, you'll die within in the first 15 minutes of playing!! Guaranteed.It is repetitive, in that monsters are always in the same spot waiting. But it's also rewarding once you learn an area being able to fight your way back through it. If it wasn't a bit repetitive, and there was a lot of randomness added, it would make the game impossible. If you think you're going to just run through and hack and slash your way think again. Take your time, different enemies require different strategies.There's also NO PAUSE. But once an area is cleared, it seems to remain that way until you die, or reload the game.Spend a little time learning about the game on the internet, best suggestion I found for new players is to start with the royalty class.Now the visuals so far a beautiful, and the sounds are excellent as well.

Your mission isn't terribly new (infiltrate a terrorist base and blow everything up), but the gameplay is: your numerous enemies are watching for you, and you are encouraged to sneak rather than simply charge in. Every level brings new challenges. You fight snipers, invisible ninjas, psychic warriors, and even an M-1 tank! As the father of the modern spy game genre, this game is an instant classic.Your allies and superiors speak to you via a cool, implanted radio,  monitoring your progress, offering  tips--but failing to give you the full story.

Campy humor also abounds as you rescue beautiful women, verbally spar with your allies, and blow up enemies in the bathroom. A user-friendly control interface allows for sniping, hiding, crawling, and running, and the graphics leave nothing to be desired.

{"product_name":"B004VQENY8","description":"As a teaser for some more detailed Skylanders Spyro&#x2019;s Adventure news that we will be bringing you next week during E3, Activision has released some character vignettes, which tell us a little more about the characters that are set to feature in the game&#x2019;s starter pack. Skylanders Spyro&#x2019;s adventure involves real life toys, which players will have to place on the Portal of Power to bring them into the game. The three toy characters that come in the starter pack are: Spyro, Gill Grunt and Trigger Happy. We have some information and some short clips where players can see all three characters in action.","reviewerName":"P. Webb \"Trajedi\"","summary":"A cross console success","reviewText":"Spyro and his legacy remain intact with Skylanders Adventures.  What is most heartening about this particular product is that the collectible figures are well made, work across various console formats even 3DS and have a memory of their name and experience points and more.  The portal functions very smoothly recognizing and dropping players(figures) instantly, the colored lights are a nice touch.  The fact that the co-op or single player action built around the figures is a solid smash and grab explorer helps as well.  The gated Gauntlet style worlds you play in become slightly less forgiving as you level your character alone, this game really play best alongside a partner in 2 player co-op mode.  The elements of the game that your toys retain is very cool and taking your figure over to the 3DS for a different game altogether lets you keep your coins and xp.  10 year olds love the figures and as an adult collector I find them well made and some of them to be very well designed artistically.  Activision dumps a game with peripherals on us yearly(GH.THAWK etc.) as sure as a new COD and this game is worth picking up even if you don't have the money that completing the set will take. This game gets expensive quick if you think you need the sets and figures however. There is a lot to do with the 3 starter figures and included game.  Just don't be surprised when you want more. Everyone except the 3 year old has gotten in on the Skylanders fun here and my son cannot get enough. A surefire gift for youngsters and co-op gaming couples with any of the major consoles.  You will sacrifice sharp graphics with the Wii but there are motion controls and shooting games utilizing the Wii-mote.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"Aaron Keating","summary":"One of my all time favorite games","reviewText":"Mass Effect, is one of those once every five year come along games if that pleasantly often.The story is rock solid and very well executed. But what really drives this game home are the side stories, (such as the ones related to your character's background, or the Asari Consort quest) which really help you believe that this is a living breathing universe.It's an interesting contrast between say, Fable II which relies on a more active and direct form of immersion to the game world. But every bit as valid. The characters in the game are all likable except for those two stupid human side kicks. (Kaiden and Ashley I hate you both and wish I could kick you both out an airlock some day). Which is nice, except for the fact that in my opinion the characters I would want my Shepard to hook up with romantically speaking I can't because they limit your choices to either the almost creepily innocent Asari Scientist, Liara or Kaiden and Ashley..Those two... ugh I hate them, Kaiden less than Ashley perhaps they just aren't that enjoyable as characters, and I felt compared to the Xenos in the game they were weak sauce thrown in so you could have a \"pure\" non xeno based love story in the game.Couldn't I have Tali instead? Or heck Garrus or Wrex instead of Kaiden?That is probably the second biggest weakness of the game are two characters whom you don't even have to use in your party ever (until it comes time for those last two achievements). I have noticed very rarely that the game will freeze, but that's only happened to me maybe twice out of over 60 hours of combined play.The game's biggest weakness to me are the planets you go to. I understand most worlds aren't like earth, heck most probably aren't even terrestrial in the galaxy. But do they all have to look nearly identical with different colors slapped on? I mean really. Could ya'll have just thrown us a frickin bone once in a while aside from Virmire? I shouldn't be thinking \"Man the moon is more exciting!\" when I'm on a multiple worlds flung across the galaxy.This leads to the next big drag. The Damned Mako, maybe if the scenery was prettier I'd feel like driving this thing around would actually have a point besides using it to run over Geth and Raiders.This game is every bit as good through multiple play throughs. There's just -that many- choices in this game. (I would like to see more variation on effects these choices have on the area I'm in at large though)Get a 360 get this game.

{"product_name":"B001D7T2VM","reviewerName":"Katalizator","summary":"Great","reviewText":"I originally wrote this review for the PS3 version. So, if the game on 360 has problems with framerate or screen tearing I apologize. I just wrote this review for the game itself, and not the console it's played on. Here's my 2 cents:Alot of the video and/or written reviews from game sites will tell you that this game is like a combination of God of War and Zelda; or a copy of this; or a copy of that. They are completely wrong. I wish people would stop comparing awesome titles such as Darksiders to games that have somewhat similar mechanics.This game is NOT GoW or Zelda, nor does it feel like either. God of War is God of War. Zelda is Zelda. And Darksiders is Darksiders! It's really fun and awesome to look at. Really smooth controls when it comes to fluidity, and HUGE bosses that make you think, \"oh damn, there's no way I can kill this guy!\" I love it. It feels like you're playing an animated comic book. A very BRUTAL comic book.It has a perfect blend of cartooniness vs realism. Not too much of either. A game that is developed to be \"real life like\" in it's entirety is horrible. Because in real life, if you get shot once you're dead(most of the time). And a game that's too cartoony feels like you're playing pokemon. Darksiders has the perfect balance of both.There's plenty of upgrades for weapons, an awesome story, and alot of all around enemy mutilation as well as really satisfying combos that are not too hard to execute. Just because it happens to be a hack n slash does NOT mean that it is a GoW copy. This game is it's own game. (Don't take me wrong, I love GoW to death).I'm actually extremely happy to finally have a game that isn't another FPS. It seems that most games developers want to release these days are FPS games. (can't wait for Dante's Inferno too).If you're a fan of hack n slash games with a perfectly blended amount of intriguing puzzles here and there, & a great story then Darksiders will satisy your needs. It IS NOT a rip off of any other game, and anyone that says so needs to ease up on their analyiticalism and just enjoy a great game for what it is instead of comparing it to everything else. Darksiders is bad@ss and I can't wait to resume my game after writing this review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2010"}

But then again I've always said that about each SOnic Game when it came out. Other than that, this game doesn't necessarily break much new ground from previous games except for a new technique called \"Tag action\" which when using the R (button on the top right corner of the Game Boy Advance) will result in a new move altogether ranging from a superhigh jump to using Cheese the Chao yourself (When you're not playing Cream the Rabbit).The story is almost the same as before. The world is once again in jeopardy when the evil nemesis Dr. Eggman splits the world by separate the chaos emeralds and plans to use them to create Eggmanland as well as work on a new contraption called Germil which was salvaged remains of Emeril from \"Sonic Battle\" and take over Mobius and create Eggmanland.The game's music is awesome and even better than that of most of SA 2. My favorite music would be the Cyber Track zone before you enter the acts as well as the Toy Kingdom zones. A really cool suprise though is the Green Hill zone with revamped music from the original Green Hill Zone from the original 1991 Sonic The Hedgehog game.The graphics are excellent and sharp. The colors of the Toy Kingdom act zones are beautiful and even the sometimes sickly sweet color scheme however is visually stimulating and lots of fun to play. The jack-in-the-box spring though is a major pain in the pullman though so be warned. I actually lost lives with them so be warned.Some things though do cut both ways. This game no longer emphasizes on score anymore and thus how many rings you have is irrelevent here. Instead of collecting special rings in the act zones, you now have to collect all of the Chaos from each Zone Act in order to gain access to the special stages. While it may depende on the individual, I've found it much easier to find them than the Special Rings from the Second Sonic Advance Games.Mind you though, the special stages which might be ridiculously easy at first can become almost impossible towards the end even for expert players but there is a major suprise at hand that you will not believe until you've managed to beat it. The seventh Special Stage is incredibly difficult and leaves no room for error so be warned. Prepared to be exasperated when playing it but you might be in for a major suprise when you manage to beat it.While expert veteran Sonic players might have similar situtations that I did with the last \"Special Stage\" of this game, newcomers will find loads of fun with this game. Mind you, it's enormously difficult with the last special stage so be mindful and collect as many keys for it so you can return a lot more frequently.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2006"}

Hutson","summary":"A Very Fun Musical Experience!","reviewText":"This is a very fun musical game/experience.  I just bought the game and my 12-year old son and I played for almost three hours.  I don't know why two earlier reviewers made comments like \"what a joke\" or \"not for anyone over 5\" unless they were expecting a playing experience similar to Rock Band or Guitar Hero.  This game is very different--and that is why I like it.  You actually have some input into the sounds, rhythm and style. Plus, it's fun using the Wii remote to mimic the playing style of the different instruments.Five-year olds will love it--but so will a lot of other ages.  And, while you can keep things simple (for the five-year olds), you can also make things quite complex if you want.  Plus, my son loves watching the videos we create.

DEHR is all about stealth, hacking, persuasion, and cautious combat. And it does all this very well. There&#8217;s also a fully realised story that has much more depth than most games. It&#8217;s also worth noting the soundtrack, which is very atmospheric throughout (and somewhat redolent of Blade Runner at times). The visuals are a mixed bag, however, with impressive environments but often disappointing character models and animation. And the colour palette is rather muted and bland. The worst aspect of the game, however, is the inventory, which is bafflingly annoying: it rather pointlessly forces you to shuffle things around in order to fit all the items in. I really don&#8217;t see the point of this as it adds nothing to the game. There is also no real variation in the environments visited during the game; it&#8217;s basically one urban landscape after another. These may seem like minor criticisms but when combined they were enough to dampen my enjoyment a little. But having said all that DEHR does what it sets out to do so well that I can forgive it&#8217;s few flaws.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2014"}

Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"Updated X 2:  Blur one of the best racers on PS3","reviewText":"After spending now 6-8 solid gameplay hours both online and offline, here are my impressions of Blur:Graphics:  This game looks awesome.  Damage to the cars is as \"realistic\" as you're going to get for a kart style game.  The real vehicles are used in this game, and look the part.  Powerups are really cool when used, and the color in this game is incredibly vibrant.  The tracks that I raced looked great as well, from the actual track to the scenery.  Everything in the game pops with vibrant color.Music:  Nothing that got on my nerves, but nothing that was incredibly memorable so far either.  It's appropriate, high energy for a racing game.Controls:  If you got frustrated in games like Gran Turismo that you couldn't take a tight turn doing 100 in a Dodge Viper, you'll find more of the same here with some of the cars, as they handle just like their real life counterparts.  For those that can handle the drifting cars, you'll definitely gain a boost in speed.  The controls are mapped logically as are most PS3 games (accelerate with R2, brake with square, etc.).  One of the major keys to the game is matching the car type (drifting, off road, etc.) with the track type.Presentation/Ingenuity:  Each races starts out with a neat take on a countdown (not just a simple 3-2-1).  I found that to be really cool.  You're never really out of a race with the powerups available, though the Shock one that is shot out in front of the leaders is really hard to avoid if you ARE the leader.  You likely won't win too many blowout races in this game.  I found the powerups to be neat takes on other ideas (example:  The \"Shunt\" acts like a Red Turtle Shell in Mario Kart, which homes in on your target).  Your goal in each race is to light up all the \"lights\" to move onto the next race.  However, the secondary goals (getting enough fans, and going through all the gates) do add replay value to each track.Online play is where this game really shines...as you advance in rank you unlock more cars, there are tons of trophies/accomplishments that can only be done online, this game runs butter smooth even with 20 cars racing at the same time, simply put, it's the best online racing experience on the PS3 and Gran Turismo 5 better have this figured out as least as well.Replay Value:  With all the stickers to earn, online leaderboards, challenges you can put to friends, Facebook/Twitter compatibility, as well as all the challenges on each track, this is one racing game you're not going to blow through in 5-10 hours.  Through 8 hours I'm only 16% complete on the single player campaign, and heaven only knows how long it will take to get everything.So overall, since people like those 1-10 scales:Graphics:  9.5/10Cars look great, explosions are awesome, and the tracks are nice and variedSound:  8/10The 8 is on the strength of the sounds, not necessarily the BGM.  Burnout Paradiseis far superior as they had licensed songs in their game.Controls: 9/10Pretty good for a racing game, not so punishing as a Gran Tursimo would be, but not unrealistic like many arcade racers are.  It's a really good fit.Presentation/Ingenuity:  8.5/10Some of the ideas (like the whole powerup thing) you've seen all the way back to games like RC Pro AM for the NES.  However, the layout of the races, the different modes, the linkability with FB/Twitter, etc. shows the developers are paying attention to the changes in techonology.Replay Value:  10/10There is SO MUCH to do in this game and accomplish, and when you add in the online multiplayer/challenges, you will most certainly get your $60 worth out of this game.In closing...Buy this game if:- You've got fond memories of Mario Kart and like the fact you're never out of a race- You want a robust, deep online multiplayer racing experience- You like collecting trophies and a game that takes a while for 100% completion.Don't buy this game if:- You're expecting a simulation style racing experience- You're hoping to hear epic BGM while you are racing- You're going to play split screen (2 player) multiplayer a lot (this is one place the graphics/gameplay take a hit)UPDATE (25 May 2011)As some of you may know, Bizzare Creations ceased to exist in February.  This has had a direct impact on Blur.  As a result...- you can no longer post your updates to Facebook- you can no longer view individual race leaderboards; the only leaderboard remaining are those you access online (Driver's Score/Fans/Power up hit rate/Legend stats)- the official website no longer supports account linkingJust something to be aware of if you have no purchased the game...as it appears Activision is content to let those features go away.UPDATE #2 (6 Oct 2011)This is the only game on the PS3 that I have earned the Platinum trophy for and outside of maybe Gran Turismo or the Dirt series this is the hardest Platinum racing trophy to obtain.I'm also fully maxed out at Legend 10, Rank 50, and at one time I was ranked 39th in the world (PS3) but now I am hovering in the 150's or so.This game is now an incredible value, despite the items I mentioned in Update #1, even if the online community is lagging at around 150-200 players during the nighttime hours (far more are on between 9 AM-3 PM, especially on weekends due to this game still being popular overseas).Call of Duty numbers it ain't, but it still remains the most fun I have ever had playing online of any game, period.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2010"}

As one of five distinct character types, players explore the world ofDiablo II, journey across distant lands, fight new villains, discover new treasures, and uncover ancient mysteries. Since the beginning of time, the forces of order and chaos have been engaged in an eternal struggle to decide the fate of all creation. That struggle has now come to the mortal realm, and neither man, demon, nor angel will be left unscathed. Diablo, lord of terror and youngest of the three prime evils, awakes from his long sleep beneath the dark earth. Setting in motion a grand scheme to free his exiled brothers, Mephisto and Baal, Diablo takes control of the small western kingdom of Khanduras. Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo grips the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia. Ultimately, as even Khanduras's good King Leoric falls under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arises to challenge the darkness that engulfs the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronts the lord of terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit can never be truly destroyed, the hero makes the noblest sacrifice of all--casting his soul and his very sanity aside, he takes the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will can contain the demon within. The hero doesn't realize that his selfless act will not only ensure Diablo's victory, but will also irrevocably damn his soul for all time.","reviewerName":"James Duckett","summary":"Excellent Fun!!!","reviewText":"Diablo 1 was fun and addicting.  However, with duping (the ability to duplicate any item in-game), everything got just way too easy.  You could beat Diablo without much of a thought as everybody had the most powerful of weapons.Diablo II is much more challenging as that bug has been resolved.  The graphics are improved and the ability to learn only a certain number of skills adds a real strategic portion to the game.The best thing is that the game is pretty cheap,and you can go and play with your friends online as much as you want.  That's right, no monthly fees... just all you can eat.I've created and built many high-level characters.  The game doesn't get boring in a hurry and I've found replay to be extremely high.  There are so many challenges and so many routes to go that it forces you to put a lot of thought into your character.After playing for several years, I think I'm going to \"graduate\" to World of Warcraft (also by Blizzard) which I've noticed is quite similar in many ways.

{"product_name":"B002BSC54I","reviewerName":"Enjolras","summary":"Fun Zelda, but not quite Twilight Princess","reviewText":"Here are my thoughts after playing the game for a while. I'll update it once I beat the whole game.STORY/AMBIENCEIt's nice that Nintendo really tried to infuse Skyward Sword with a story. It actually works for the most part. The scenes between Zelda and Link are really touching. And for once Gannondorf isn't the main villain!That said, while the story itself is fine, it just doesn't have the same epic feel Twilight Princess did. First, Skyloft feels a bit silly. I have nothing against riding birds, but it just can't compare with riding a horse as the standard for a fantasy/adventure game. I feel like Nintendo wanted to make this game different but this was a case of throwing out the good with the bad.Also, more fundamentally, the game just has a more lighthearted feel to it. Even after Zelda disappears, Zelda's father doesn't seem particularly scared and tells Link they'll have to start to look for her in the morning. Enemies aren't scary. For the first 2-3 hours, you'll spend most of your time talking to folks in Skyloft and finding cute little animals in a forest. It's just tough comparing this to Twilight Princess, which had beautifully haunting cutscenes, a chilling villain in Zant, and a melancholy ambience.GRAPHICSFirst, I'll address what was probably the most controversial aspect of the game: the graphics. When it was first revealed that the game had a pastel color palette, some fans complained that it looked too lighthearted and the characters too cartoonish. I was actually worried about this since I loved Twilight Princess' realistic style.Fortunately, after getting a good sample of the game's artwork, I have to say I'm quite satisfied with the outcome. I still prefer Twilight Princess' realistic style, but Skyward Sword looks great. The characters look alive and they have a wide range of facial and emotional expressions.The landscapes and stages are at least as detailed as in Twilight Princess. From a distance, the impressionistic style works really well. Sadly, unlike Twilight Princess, there's no Hyrule FIeld, which was always my favorite part. Also, the other landscapes don't quite have that epic feel and almost look like they could have come out of a kid's game. Make no mistake - they look good, but not quite epic.SOUNDBecause Skyward Sword has such a deep story, it's all the more disappointing that Skyward Sword doesn't have voice acting. The on-screen dialogue text worked for past Zelda games because the dialogue was short and often transactional in nature. However, there are cinematic cutscenes in Skyward Sword and the text dialogue just becomes a chore to read and really detracts from the story. Worst of all is when there's dialogue on the screen but the character's lips aren't movie.The soundtrack is good, but not quite at the level of Twilight Princess or Ocarina of Time. Again, as with the rest of the game, it's more lighthearted. It's tough to really judge while playing the game, so I'll have to wait until the full soundtrack is available for download.GAMEPLAYThis is where Skyward Sword really shines. While I don't think the swordplay is necessarily a revolution, it does add a new dimension to the game. You actually have to think about HOW you slash and hack. The Wii MotionPlus or its equivalent will definitely be standard for any future Zelda games.OVERALLSkyward Sword is really hard to rate because it both exceeds expectations and disappoints. The impressionistic art style didn't bother me nearly as much as I'd feared. On the other hand, the game just feels a whole lot less epic than Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, and especially Twilight Princess. I'll write an updated review once I finish the game (it is a long game) but in the meantime I give it 3.5 stars.UPDATE (1/2/2012)Took me longer to finish the game than I'd thought. It is a long game, with at least 50 hours of play, and I didn't even finish all of the side-quests. However, my initial review remains largely unchanged.I think the root of the problem with the game is that it's a bit too much like a Mario game. Don't get me wrong, I love Mario. However, Zelda is supposed to be a different experience. In Zelda, the levels aren't just platforms, but rather supposed to be immersive worlds. Levels and challenges should feel like natural extensions of the story, not just \"fetch-quests.\" By contrast, in Skyward Sword there were way too many \"fetch-quests\" and pointless activities just to vary up the game design. My least favorite was when the Water Dragon simply threw several dozen musical notes around an ocean and forced Link to swim around looking for them. I almost shouted in frustration.Also, I think Nintendo made a huge mistake by not giving each of the dungeons a unique feel. It makes the game less memorable. I feel like I played and beat the game just a few days ago, but remember it less than I do Twilight Princess. Because the dungeons aren't entirely separate from the over world and are much smaller overall, they just don't stick out. I can't think back to the \"Water Dungeon\" or \"Sky Dungeon.\" Separate dungeons also would have widened the variety of locales and the play experiences. As it stands, I felt like I was going back and forth over the same territory, which got tiring.The non-playable characters all felt like add-ons and were fairly superficial. Unlike Twilight Princess, I didn't really find myself caring for any of them. One of the first side-quests is to help a mother find her child. My first though was that any mother dumb enough to let her child wander around on a floating city with no side rails and monsters running around at night deserves to lose her kid. Zelda's dad seems entirely unconcerned that his daughter is missing and possibly kidnapped by an evil demon. None of these characters actually helps you in your quest. Except for Groose. I ended up loving him. He had real character and actually does try to become more than simply a helpless victim.The bosses just didn't meet my expectations. There actually are a lot fewer than in Twilight Princess, especially if you don't count the multiple times you fight Ghirahim or the Imprisoned. Ghirahim actually worked well as a boss and was the only time I felt like the motion controls added anything to the game. I also liked smacking Koloktos with the giant sword. Other than that, the bosses were too easy and not particularly memorable. The designs are certainly nothing like the intimidating beasts from Twilight Princess.Finally, I really have to reemphasize that the lack of voice acting is noticeable. Other Zelda games told the story more through images and narration. Here, so much of the cutscenes and story involve dialogue. It just looks and sounds ridiculous watching these scenes but only hearing odd grunts and sighs.Overall, I stick by my rating of 3.5 stars. It's a good game, but really could have and should have been so much better.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J6KU","description":"","reviewerName":"Dave","summary":"Exciting combat but ultimately a button masher","reviewText":"This game needs one thing to take it to the next level.  More control over your pawns.  While the combat system is fun and engaging, after 10 hours or so you realize there's really very little strategy to it all.  You can only give your allies few commands and they fail to follow even those very often.  There are many times you wish to avoid a combat situation, or sneak up upon an enemy, and your pawns will spaztastically run in and void your entire plan.  The skill system is very well done, the loot is interesting, and the enemies are tough.  It just winds up feeling like you're in the middle of complete chaos during most of the fights, and you're just mashing square or triangle.  If they could somehow find a mixture between the organized combat of Skyrim and the moves/climbing combat system in Dogma, you'd have a 5+ star game.The lack of any real fast travel system is slightly irritating as well.  It wouldn't be such a big deal if there were more varied areas to explore, but you wind up literally retracing your steps fifty times through the same canyon, fighting the same enemies who respawn continuously.  Overall I gave this a good shot, approximately 15-16 hours, but then I found myself wanting to play Skyrim again and just dealing with a more stealthy approach which Dogma severly lacks.  There really is no good way to sneak up on an enemy in Dogma, as your pawns act like excitable children when they see something.  I like the direction they're moving in though, the giant ferocious enemies you can climb on are a welcome addition that Bethesda could surely learn a thing or two from.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2012"}
{"product_name":"B007XVTR3K","description":"","summary":"Great. Not as great as expected, but great.","reviewText":"Black Ops 2 has arrived. Just over two years since one of my favorite Call of Duty titles was released, Treyarch is back at it with the sequel. Rather than taking place in the 1960's though, this game hikes to 2025 and takes you on a ride. Here's my review. Not to worry, there won't be any spoilers... although there will be heavy emphasis on multiplayer.I won't tell you about the story of Black Ops 2, but I will tell you how this Call of Duty is different from those previous. Rather than going from A to B to sometimes C, Treyarch makes this game less linear this time around. You have options of what you want to do/where you want to go, and they even affect the mission in minor ways. Your decisions won't completely change the story, but they're a wise addition that should have been added at least a couple years ago. This inclusion makes you feel like YOU'RE playing the game, rather than making you feel like the game is playing YOU. Without ruining the campaign for all of you, I can tell you that this is a game that's single player you will definitely want to go through ... especially if you played the original Black Ops.Zombies. Well, I have to admit -- don't hurt me -- I wasn't a big fan of Zombies in Black Ops because I felt like the first handful of rounds was a complete waste of time and dragged on needlessly. This time around though, there's actually a STORY to Zombies ... imagine that. While I'm still not high on the game mode, I like it a heck of a lot more than I did in the last game, and I can guarantee that those that loved Zombies before will only enjoy it more. Don't think that's possible? Wait until you play the game. Also, for you stat addicts, Zombie stats will be tracked on Call of Duty ELiTE.And the thing most people buy Call of Duty for ... the multiplayer. There are countless things to say about this. You'll have anti-CoD people tell you that this is the same game as last year. And the year before. And the year before that. Well, that's frankly not true. Black Ops 2 innovates almost as much as Call of Duty 4 originally did. Like the first Modern Warfare, Black Ops 2 may change the series forever. The whole Pick Ten system in this game is an ingenious idea that will seriously make you think when making classes if you want to compete. If you find that you don't ever use your secondary, add a fourth perk. If you don't throw grenades, add another attachment to your gun. The ability to customize your experience in this way will make you hungry for more unlocks and experimentation.Treyarch doesn't stop there, though. Black Ops 2 has now introduced a brand new thing called League Play. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newbie to the series, you'll be able to form a clan and face other clans with a similar skill level, thanks to Treyarch's skill-based matchmaking. If competing in heated clan wars isn't your thing, you can of course still hop into a random public match.Also added to Black Ops 2 is what many people are calling \"CoD Casting\" mode. With this, you can view live streams (or previously recorded versions) of matches. This is going to be a useful feature to many ... especially those that are looking to learn techniques that the more seasoned Call of Duty players use.Treyarch has done with Black Ops 2 what many people have long begged them to do: Change the series up. A lot of fans and critics felt that Call of Duty was releasing nothing but $60 map packs every year... I have to say, Black Ops 2 ought to shut those people up. From the ability to make personal choices in campaign, to the better-than-ever Zombies mode, to the most balanced multiplayer experience Call of Duty has probably ever had, there's something here for anybody to love. Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 may very well be the best game in the series.4.75/5+: \"Personalized\" campaign; Zombies; Pick 10 system in multiplayer; Awesome weapon/perk/grenade/equipment balance online.-: This game is nearly flawless and has added a lot of innovation, but I'm beginning to feel some FPS burnout; Multiplayer maps don't feel as great as I thought the Black Ops 1 maps did.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00BI83EVU","description":"","reviewerName":"Sun Jian \"Tiger of Jiang Dong\"","summary":"A mediocre attempt at something great","reviewText":"After its initial reveal I admit I was hyped, the thought of a modern day Assassin's Creed with next gen graphics was something that was hard to pass up. I wasn't too hung up about graphics downgrades, since it's still very early into the PS4 generation. I was concerned about all the of the ridiculous preorder editions and the real lack of compelling story in the preview trailers, but I was ready for a Next Gen open world game so I kept my preorder despite reservations.The experience so far, about 20+ hours in, has been pretty mediocre. WATCH_DOGS takes all of the things I really dislike about Assassins' Creed, such as bad parkour, tailing, meaningless collectibles and tower progression. It adds a hacking minigame and camera functionality, but it's not good enough to carry the game. What's especially silly is the fact that the game encourages you to use cameras and hacking to get to your objectives while remaining unseen, and then at the end of your mission it will throw in an alarm or a story point that causes you to fight all the guards you just circumvented. The further I get into the game, the more I rely on just shooting everything down and ignoring cameras and hacking, which is a bummer, especially since WATCH_DOGS adds virtually nothing to the already tired cover based shooting gameplay.I'm trying my best to say interested enough to finish the game, but the story isn't doing anything and all the immersion breaking features that they put into the game don't even make it a satisfying escapist experience. It doesn't have the romanticism that Assassins' Creed relies on, which is why it ultimately fails to keep me hooked.Given the success of the game sales wise, I'm sure we'll be seeing new WATCH_DOGS titles every year from now, hopefully they can improve on story and immersion, and add some real car physics and unique gameplay that isn't overpowered by gunplay. The game is a solid 3 out of 5, not so terrible that you won't want to play it, but more of a decent distraction until other PS4 games are released later this year.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2014"}

There's no denying that the original Xbox controller is HUGE compared to other controllers, but if it's comfortable, then size isn't an issue. And I do find it perfectly comfortable. There's big, and there's too big. This controller is not too big for me. And for the record, my hands are not large. In fact they might be a bit smaller than average.Unfortunately, the reason I'm here now is to replace my original pack-in controller because it's already worn out. It isn't even a year old (June 7, 2002) and already the analog sticks are sticky and glitchy.

{"product_name":"B0050SYILE","description":"","reviewerName":"Alex \"47\"","summary":"Masterpiece.","reviewText":"(From my blog: 47Reviews.BlogSpot.com)*Note: This review will contain zero spoilers, so as to be readable for the masses.*The game people have been waiting for since basically the release of GTA IV is finally just about upon us. If you've used the internet at all for the past several months, then you know that the hype level for GTA V is astronomically high... much higher than I remember it ever being for any past Grand Theft Auto game, or even any game the past few years, period. The natural question to ask is: Is this game worth that hype?The chances are that you've seen or read about how big the game is in terms of map size and things to do. The truth is, you don't really get a sense of its size until you sit down and play it first hand. Rockstar said months ago that Grand Theft Auto V would be bigger than Red Dead Redemption, GTA IV, and San Andreas... combined. While you read that and think \"Damn. That's pretty big...\", it's far more impressive when you play it for yourself. What's most mind-blowing about the whole thing is that Grand Theft Auto V is running on hardware that is seven/eight years old. Just leave it to Rockstar to make you drool in awe, I suppose.You'd think that with such a huge game, Rockstar would have to sacrifice graphically... nope. While GTA V doesn't look quite as gorgeous as it does in some of the high-res pictures that are all over the 'net, it still is one of the best looking games of this generation. When putting the sheer size of the game into the equation, then it most definitely is the best looking game this generation of consoles has ever seen. My only qualms with GTA V's visuals are minor... very minor. First off, there are slight frame rate drops when you get to certain points in the middle of a heated firefight. They are pretty uncommon though, and also understandable, given how huge the open world is. Secondly, there seems to be some minor textural issues from a bit of a distance. Again, it's something I can pretty easily forgive. Everything else is just outstanding. The weather, the water, the animations, the cars... it's all, quite frankly, amazing.Once you get past how pretty this game is, you'll realize how fluid and real everything feels. As other publications have said, you really get the impression that this is a living, breathing world. While Grand Theft Auto IV could sometimes feel ghost town-esque (lack of AI interaction at times, few cars on the road, etc.), I have yet to get that impression in V. Rockstar put so much detail into this game that it can't be put into this review... and honestly, why would you want me to spoil that for you? Trust me though, you'll always have something new to do, and you will find plenty of little Easter eggs.As you would have already expected (and has been leaked), GTA V has a soundtrack that is over 20 hours long, and there's some more talk-radio hilarity, as well as a little bit of music for everyone's taste. The voice acting in GTA V is also... care to venture a guess? Phenomenal. As is usually the case in Rockstar's games, you'll believe you're watching a Hollywood blockbuster at times. Add it all up, and you've got an insane package.All of this typing and I've hardly said a peep about how the game plays. Without offering up any significant spoilers, I will tell you that it feels quite a lot different when compared to GTA IV... which I like. It mostly feels different in terms of on-foot gameplay. The cars seem to control quite similarly to GTA IV, but I don't mind that, because I thought the vehicles in that game controlled nicely. On-foot though, the characters seem to be more reactive. Perhaps more importantly, the gun-play and cover system feels unbelievably better than GTA IV did... it's really hugely improved. Rockstar seems to have learned a lot from its recent games, Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3. There's a wide variety of types of missions in GTA V, so you won't find yourself constantly doing menial tasks, like driving people around. But hey, if that's your bag, you can do that -- you can do what you want, when you want in Grand Theft Auto V... play it at your own pace.In the media world, hype ultimately means nothing, even if the franchise is Grand Theft Auto. Rockstar has seemingly pushed out quality game after quality game for over a decade, and they've been long due to hit a speed bump... but they certainly haven't hit one with Grand Theft Auto V. Take your highest expectations for the game... this will most definitely will exceed it in every way. Additionally, it's worthy of every bit of the hype it is receiving, and is clearly the game of this generation, in my opinion. This is the perfect essential send-off before the next generation of consoles are unleashed. There is no reason you should spend your free time for the next few months doing anything else once you get your hands on this game.

The first Castlevania:  LOS game did breath new, fresh air into this series.It is a shame then that, instead of building on the success of this game, that the developers tried to borrow from so many other successful games and turn this game into a middling, inconsistent frustration of a title.Don't get me wrong, when CLOS2 is good, it is GREAT.  Stunning looking vistas and areas.  Diverse combat, whether it's your main weapon (whip) or sub weapons which use magic (ala God of War).  In fact, this game might as well been the 5th GOW title, so much is cribbed from it.So well, where does this game fall apart?- MANDATORY stealth sections.  You're playing as a bad-a** Dracula, so why, exactly, do you need to SNEAK by enemies undetected, when you have all that firepower at your disposal?  Castlevania is NOT Splinter Cell or Thief.  It has ALWAYS been an action game, throughout all its titles.  Not only does it manage to break any flow in the game, but they are poorly executed.  In one section alone, I was stuck for THREE HOURS trying to figure out how to get by it.  That's both poor game design and poor choices.- I might be wrong, but I'm pretty sure in Transylvaina, you are not seeing robots, androids and the like.  What in the world are those things doing in a Castlevaina game?  Ghosts, zombies and other supernatural things, yes.  Data, KOS-MOS, type characters, no.- It's short.  Paying $60 for a game that will last you, on average, 10-15 hours, in this day in age, simply is not a smart investment.So I'm sorry, all the 5 stars reviews in the world should not convince you to spend $60 on this game.  I guess it will be up to you to decide who is right:  All those reviews, or the current 62 score the game has on Metacritic, from people who do video game reviews for a living.This game very much could have been one of the best Castlevaina's, especially with the combat.

Morales","summary":"Unfortunately Outdated Classic, with Some Intrusive Updates","reviewText":"Super Mario Bros 3 is critically acclaimed to be one of the greatest games of all time (if not, THE greatest game of all time). And for good reason. Back in the the NES' heyday, Super Mario 3 offered some of the most impressive graphics the NES had to offer, great music, sharp controls, great gamepley and fantastic game structure involving all new worlds that people NEVER would have even imagined in a Mario game. I mean, a large world where all the enemies are 4X their size as well as other objects? A pipe world filled to capacity with pipes galore? A battle ship world taking Mario onto Bower's floating gunship? It was all amazing. ...for its time. These days, you'd be hard pressed to find a 12 year old who would be as impressed with this game as we were at that age. This of course considering all the newer 3D Mario games that have been released in the last 15 or so years. Not to also mention other Mario takes, such as the Mario Kart games and Olympic and slew of sports games. While it's great that we get to relive this Mario classic, it's the contemporary update that seems to me will hinder it more than help its cause. Not only this, but the controls don't seem to mesh well on the game boy advance smaller control scheme or the Nintendo DS's (depending on which system you're using to play this game).In this game you will find both the classic Super Mario 3 as well as the arcade and NES classic Mario Bros. This old game pits a very (at the time) unknown Mario and his green brother Luigi (who I'm not even sure was even named when this game was originally released in the mid-80's). They play one level after another jumping on platforms and bumping the bottoms of where foes walk on after being emitted from 2 pipes at the top of the screen. If you can rack up as many points as possible without being hit, you advance. The levels were virtually endless, and as levels went on, more enemies came out and more obstacles came in your way. While playing this game again brought back great memories, I was left upset that these weren't the ORIGINAL versions that I played as a kid. There are graphical updates and various sound enhancements which, while cute, had me longing to play the original game in all its glory. The newer version is put there as an attempt to adhere to a newer generation, but unfortunately the gameplay is just too old-school for any young kid to really appreciate, let alone have the patience to play through the entire game. Mario Bros. may keep them entertained but again, the old style I do not believe will be something new kids will really want. On top of this, I believe the updates will also turn off old-school gamers, the ones who will buy this in the hopes of reliving their beloved classic. Too many updates just take you out of the moment, keep you from that nostalgia. I believe there should have either been an option to replay the classic NON-updated version of both games as well as the newer games, or just put these classics on here without ANY updates whatsoever.I personally found myself at first upset that I was not able to relieve the classic games in all their classic glory, but also just found myself a little bored about a few levels in. With all the newer Mario games on the market, I would recommend just picking this one up as a collector's item. And judging from the age, this game now IS collector's item considering its rarity.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000LSJKAM","reviewerName":"B. Deans \"Shadow\"","summary":"Wii wonders","reviewText":"Here it is finally!  A mario party on the new wii platform. This game is sure to not dissapoint.  Its classic mario party with a new theme, controls, and characters.GameplayIts mario party! You hit dice and move along a gameboard like candyland.  There are blue, red, yellow, and green squares along your path.  If you land on a blue square you get 3 coins if you land on a red square you loose 3 coins.  Yellow gives you minigames that allow you to gain or take coins from people.  The game has power ups and downs that allow you to wreck havoc on your opponents.  You can play for a certain set of turns like 10 or more turns.  After each turn there is a minigame to play with a friend or cpu that if you win will reward you coins.  The object of the game is to find and obtain yellow stars.  Each map has different ways to get stars some will require you to simply make it to the star first while others will require you to pay a certain number of coins for a star.  After your turns are up, teh team with the most stars wins.  5/5ControlsIt's very simple and uses the wii to the best of its ability.  To hit the dice you simply move the wii remote up in a tapping motion.  To throw darts you would use the wii remote as if you were throwing a real dart.  All the minigames require you to tilt or move the remote a certain way to move your character or item.  This allows you to bond more with the game and it adds more fun and value to your wins.5/5GraphicsThe graphics are well done for a mario game.  The maps are beautiful especially the beach and monopoly themed maps.  You will have a lot of fun playing through all the maps and themes. 5/5CharactersThere are a lot of different characters to play with.  Some have to be unlocked but they are really fun to play with.  Each character has a personality and talks a bit.  If they loose coins they sigh or say no, if they gain coins they say yes or way to go.  If during gameplay you move the wii remote in any dirrection your characters will make random noise as to try to pep you up.  Its really fun and really well done.  5/5MapsMy only issue so far with the maps are that there arnt enough.  I believe there are only 6 maps maybe 7.  The maps are fun to play yes but i would have expected more maps to play maybe at least 10.  Unfortunatly this is where the game falls flat.  After awhile you just dont want to play the same maps again and again. 2/5All and all this is a great game that i would recommend for adults and children alike.  It is great fun for the family or friends and allows people to just break away and have a good time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2009"}

It's not like I'm addicted to it or anything like that, just it's fun to play some party games once in a while. Mario Party 8 doesn't fail to pick up the path that the previous Mario Party's left for it. This time, you get to use the Wii-Mote! There are really only two down-sides to this game.1) If you don't have people to play with, think about picking this game up. Single player finishes quickly (although the Bowser place is really hard)and if you want to enjoy party games with three computers, then you might want to set them to different difficulties. Hard/Very Hard would be too easy, but Easy/Normal would be too hard. Try setting the opposing team with the same difficulty as your team.2) I love the duel mini-games, but you only get to play them when you use Duelo Candy, and there's a lot of them that I like (Lasso, Card, Construction, etc.). It sort of sucks that I have to use a candy and be near some one just to play those mini-games.That's all of the negatives I have. Try thinking about previous Mario Party's, then think about using the Wii-Mote to interact in most of the mini-games.

The first Parasite Eve is one of my favorite games from the 5th generation of gaming (SS, PSX, N64).  Firstly its been over ten years since we have seen anything Parasite Eve related with the release of Parasite Eve 2 just a year after the first in 1999.  This is unheard of in a gaming industry seemingly so obsessed with pumping out the next sequel just to make a buck.Now the game review itself.  I did find the game play and story were something that took some getting used to, but once I grew accustomed to it I did like it.  By the end I found myself wanting to keep on playing, and went back to try and get some of the better weapons and items.  Some gripes include bosses like \"The Queen\" who basically just sat there while I fired a steady stream of bullets at it.  Another gripe includes the DNA boards which I still haven't quite figured out how to use correctly.  The clothes damage (and other hidden costumes) were a bit too much pandering to the base for me...All things considered, I really liked The 3rd Birthday and I'm glad Square-Enix (say what you will say about them) haven't forgotten about Aya Brea or the Parasite Eve franchise.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2011"}

Game command work better and outsign in is a breeze. What drives me crazy is that my kids walk by the living room and they sign in because of the kinect.  I dont really have a use for it right now but it works better.  Voice commands have impoved like &#34;redeem a code&#34; are made simpler, you are still required to speak slowly so it can hear you.Smartglass is better incorporated than the 360 version.  I used it on my windows 7 phone but the XB1 version is not compatable.  It is however compatable with my wife's ipad and I am able to view my progress of every game like collectables, game scenes, achievements and in game content.  Since looking up and sending are a little weird on the XB1 and their is no chatpad, I use the tablet or WP7 for messages.  So if you have a smart phone, i would recomend downloading it and signing in with it so you can get a better experience.Unfortunatly we are not able to upgrade the HD space so I have no idea how it will work, so far I have installed, Ryse, Battlefield 4, Dead Rising 3, Marvel Super Heroes, Need for Speed Rivals and Call of Duty: Ghost but the next big game wont be until Titanfall in March and Destiny in Sept.  Under the options for the game, I do have the option to delete a game for more space if I do intend on keeping all of my games.On another note of the missing chatpad at the moment, the only headset available is the one that came with the xbox or you can use your kinect for communication wich also works better than the 360 version.  I believe their is a version of turtle beach headsets that work but I cant confirm.  I believe that the next headset that will be released will cost $150 minimum but again, I am uncertain.  I have had no problems with the one that came with the console and its actually made to last.If you do find yourself on the verge of picking the One up, another good thing is that you can snap your screen to do a quick google search for a guide, tv or party invites.  I have had no use for this feature but several of my friends use it while grinding certain achievements.  The XBone console is made for people that want more than just a console but also as entertainment like Skyp, NFL and TV apps.

{"product_name":"B0000503MO","description":"The third title of the Gran Turismo series takes full advantage of the new PlayStation2 game engine, which is capable of rendering about 20 million polygons per second--roughly 10 times the number of total polygons of the series' previous installment,Gran Turismo 2. Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course. They don't drive perfectly, either; some will spin out and make other mistakes over the course of a race.","reviewerName":"Tex \"dionysus_olympus\"","summary":"Hot game, Must-buy!","reviewText":"This game has truly photo-realistic graphics and additionally, the replays of the areas are incredible.  The game even permits one to save replays.  The cars in this game are absolutely incredible, and unlike other games, you are not limited to some specific models with similar designs.  Additionally, the selection of cars is absolutely phenomenol.  My best cars for this game are the Jaguar XJ220, the GT-ONE Road Car, the infamous rally car Suzuki Escudo Pikes Peak Version and the Corvette C-5R.  My favorite car, however, has to be the 2000 Beetle Cup, but the handling is clumsy and sometimes forced, like a Beetle.  The scenery is incredible!  I absolutely love the Tokyo tracks and the Rome track for the views of the city.  I additionally love the rally tracks around Tahiti and the wet tracks of Tokyo.  The last note for this game is the game becomes very difficult on the Professional Level.  For example, on the Red Emblem level, you are forced to drive a ROAD car, and you are forced to compete against six other RACE cars (in other words, much better and faster cars than yours). One of the major disappointments for this game is that there is no crash damage, like NASCAR Thunder, Sprint Cars: World of Outlaws or the incoming Pro Race Driver.  The second and last disappointment is that in mutiplayer, especially two-player, one doesn't face computer cars as well, as in NASCAR Thunder.  However, Codemasters' Pro Race Driver may resolve that issue.  Other than that, buy this game if you are a racing freak or just a freak!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00000DMB3","description":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timemay be the greatest single-player video game ever created in any genre. It's that good. Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide.

Built around much of the first game and simply expanding on it, L4D2 is a solid and fun title.  It also comes with more levels to play (which the original should have as well) and each level has various twist to make the experience different.What is different?  Well there are more special infected as well as some 'comon infected' which have some interesting twists such as riot cops and biohazard suited zombies.  Each are very detailed and even the old zombies are more detailed such as the Boomer and Smoker.There is also the addition of melee weapons and more variety of equipment to use giving the players many choices on how they want to try and play the round.  For example you could take 2 pistols or a frying pan.  The pistols give you some range and rapid fire while the melee weapon takes them out better when you get swarmed.  Or you could get the \"pills' which give you a temp health boost or go for a speed boost which helps you get through crowded areas or make that last little bit of ground to escape when in a tight spot.In addition to that there are more game modes and the maps can change a little with each pass.  Meaning that routes that might be open in one play through might not be in the next.  This keeps players on their toes and sometimes gets the team split up which can result in somebody getting hurt bad or taken out all together.The new game mode is nice too but nothing that is a dramatic change.  Its just a more static vs mode which is a nice change of pace but nothing that's a game changer.  This would have been a great opportunity to put in some mods similar to what Call of Duty WaW had with trying to hold off a zombie horde.  The survival mode kind of does this but that mode is pure chaos and not a very strategic game.  I think this part especially they really missed an opportunity.Overall its a nice update but as many have said this should have been an update to the first game and not a full new game.  While it is a lot of fun there is just not much new content or much of a change from the original.  Nor did they do much with new game modes.  I certainly am enjoying it but I also enjoy the first one still.  If you have not played L4D1 then I highly suggest you give that a try first and then if you like that this would be a great addition if you look at it as more of an expansion pack than a full new game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2009"}

Realistic weapon setup includes over a dozen real-life guns, all fitting the crime-story setting like a bullet in the head. The action is surrounded with more than 80 hand-painted comic-screens that enhance the game's gritty atmosphere and attitude, introduce the game's murderous cast of characters, and carry the plot from one location to the next.","reviewerName":"Jack R. Tallent","summary":"Dissappointing and a little dull","reviewText":"Originally, I felt reluctant to compare Max Payne to Deus Ex, as the latter is such a superlative game as to make the comparison somewhat unfair. ... I offer this observation: Max Payne suffers greatly in comparison to Deus Ex, which is very much the better game.In fact, I'm surprised at the predominance of very positive reviews for Max Payne. I offer here a brief list of the games primary shortcommings.First of all, the interactivity of the game is virtually nonexistant.  Whereas the environments in Deus Ex were absorbing and interesting environments to examine and explore, the environments in Max Payne are just backgrounds, offering little more than wrapping for a simple, fixed game path.  See those boxes over there?  That desk?  Forget about them. There's nothing in them. Keep moving along and stop wasting time.  (Actually sometimes a certain type of wooden crate will have an item in it. Yay.)Where are the choices in Max Payne? The answer is that there simply are none. Deus Ex gives one so many choices that one gets lost playing with the game, seeing what is possible. Exploring the game becomes more important than the game itself. In Max Payne there might as well be a bright yellow line on the floor, because that's where you're going, like it or not.Even within the limited scope of the game, play becomes quickly repetitive. One quickly catches on to how things will go down around this corner, and the next, and the next, and so on.The A.I. sucks even more fun out of the game.  The characters go from completely clueless to completely omniscient the moment you cross the boundary into their space.  One second they are oblivious to your presence, but as soon as that hand grenade leaves your grasp, its \"Hey it's Max Payne! Get him.\"The software itself is fairly flakey, which gave a bad impression almost immediately. Installation became entirely about what *I* had to do to get the game to run correctly.  I don't like jumping through hoops to get a $.. game to run.  Even after I satisfied all the requirements, stopping the game from crashing on exit still requires a \"workaround\" involving turning of the voice modem.I'll stop beating the dead horse and mention some positives now. There are several interesting things about the game, among which is the bullet time feature you have no doubt heard of.  It's a great idea. (Back to negatives: it never feels like you're able to fully integrate it into your game play.)  There are also some very interesting levels involving dream sequences, hullucinations and the like.  The graphic novel aspect was also interesting. Finally, the graphics were very nice, and the slo-mo cut sequences at the end of the battles were pretty cool as well. (Although they added to the predictability of the game.)Overall, the game did NOT live up to my expectations, but it was good enough to keep me punching in to see what the ending was like. (It was like the beginning and the middle.)  In hindsight, I should have played Deus Ex a third time instead of buying Max Payne.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2001"}

I wished that they had kept Sam and Kaede in this game, but I guess the makers wanted a new character in the story.  Jubei was an overall good character to play with, and his background history is pretty sad and interesting too.  This time your main enemy is Nobunaga instead of the demon lord Fortinabas.Graphics: The graphics are dated, but when it came out it was top of the line back then, so no complaining about that. I didn't experience no lag or buges so were good.  The cutscenes in this game were pretty cool, so I had a good experience with the graphics. 2/2.****************Spoiler Alert************Story: The story is basically a revenge drama in the making.  The main character is out for revenge because his village was destroyed by Nobunaga.  Jubei learns that he is half oni from his mother who is an oni.  Jubei learns he is the only one that can take on Nobunaga, and save the world from his wickedness.  Your introduced to a couple new minions of Nobunaga, but the most difficult one of them is the annoying swordsman Gogandantess.  Trust me you will find out later why he is so difficult.  2/2.Characters: The characters Jubei, Oichi, Ekei, Kotaro, and Magoichi are your main protagonists in the game.  You can have multiple endings with each of these characters.  The game allows you to explore each of these characters stories, and you can replay it multiple times to get the endings of each them.  Guildenstern was not in this game, and that royally pissed me off since I wanted to kill him so bad from the last game, but I guess I will have to wait. 1/2.Sound: I believe the sound in the game made the game feel more exciting, but also gave me goosebumps at times. The music and sound were pretty good in my IMHO. 2/2.Controls: The camera angles and handling of the controls work perfectly. The third person view of this game really help control the character better in my opinion, thus letting you know where to go, and to see enemies coming around the corner. 2/2.Overall, this was a great game to play and I enjoyed it. The story was eventful, and extremely fun.  The way the game allowed you to experience multiple endings with the different side characters was cool.  I also really like Gogandantess because of code of honor. 9/10.Game on.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2012"}

Unique doesn't always mean 'good' or 'bad'. I think it's a combination of both, you walk around this vast open-world game that isn't fully entire explorable (some buildings you cannot go into). For the 360, I have not come across any glitches that make it incapable to play the main quest or any of the side quest. Hand to hand combat is simply amazing, your weapons degrade on every attempt of hitting or throwing. You will eventually find out of which weapons to use with certain enemies or certain situations for the game. Again it is an RPG, so mauling everyone is a no go, you will simply just die and die and return the game because you aren't 'good' at it. I won't lie, this game is very fustrating at times, but it grows on you because it's actually a challenge unlike most games.Story: 9.5/10 (This game is fully 4 player co-op online, somewhat like Borderlands)- Simply enough, has amazing side quest, some challenging and some not. You can get all kinds of rewards from weapons, health, and of course money. The side quest is the best way to get money, which you WILL need to upgrade and repair weapons. The main quest is on-going, you technically never finish it until the end of the game but you still get cash/weapons/experience when you finish each 'request'. The story is very put together, theres never a point where you think, why am I doing this or this is boring. There are 3 acts, each with it's own very unique touch, gameplay, and graphics. Since this is a no spoiler review, I cannot go into any more detail.Graphics: 9/10- I don't believe some of the reviews that say 'This game looks like PS2' or 'It's unpolished' well I think they play on a tube TV. This game looks great on my HDTV, everything is detailed, the water is simply amazing. There is constant lighting and fog effects that glow around you. When you run or turn really fast your vision is somewhat blurred. When you get hit by an enemy your screen turns red depending on your health and has very nice effects. The weapons degrade and show signs of ware as time goes on (scratches, chips, etc). I think they did a fine A+ job on polishing and detailing this game (for a RPG).That's about all I will go into because I really don't want to give anything else about the game because it is simply remarkable if you like to play RPG games with some action involved. I really wouldn't call it a FPS (first person shooter) because you simply cannot just shoot or hit mass zombies because the game doesn't allow it (because you will die everytime). The zombies aren't weak and can be hard to kill, so that's why you have to do it correctly and be patient with everything. Buy this game, it is worth every penny. P.s., it is a quite lengthy game. At 30 hours, I was at 75% with the game, and I didn't take my time like I wanted.Enjoy and happy gaming!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2011"}

To get them back, SOra will go on a series of unique card duel -- where she'll summon characters from the popular Final Fantasy games!","reviewerName":"The Duck of Indeed","summary":"Good Story, Tedious, Boring Game","reviewText":"\"Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories\" is a really boring game.  Its only redeeming quality is the story, which is pretty good, but other than that, I just don't like it.  The story goes into what happens between \"Kingdom Hearts\" and \"Kingdom Hearts 2\" and involves the members of Organization XIII not seen in \"KH2\" (plus Axel).  Throughout the whole game, Sora journeys up the floors of the mysterious Castle Oblivion, losing his memories along the way while gaining memories of a girl he had apparently once known but forgotten about....  At each floor, he visits worlds from the first game plus a couple not in the original.But, these worlds are just not fun like they were in the other games.  For one thing, each world is just made up of a bunch of boring rooms that all look pretty much the same.  You can choose what each room will be, like a room to save or a room with a lot of enemies or a room with sleeping enemies, for example.  But, it's just monotonous.And then there's the way you fight in the game.  With cards.  Each card is associated with a certain attack, item, magic, or summon.  The higher the number, the stronger it is.  You can only have so many in your deck, and you can stop enemy attacks by using a card of a higher number than them, plus they can stop your attacks, as well.  You can also use sleights, where you combine three cards for a stronger attack or a special combo, but then you lose the first card for the rest of the battle.  If you're not careful, you can end up with only a couple cards left.  So you then can only attack once or twice, wait a few seconds to reload, attack once or twice, wait a few seconds to reload again.  The battle could go on for eternity.It's just extremely frustrating having enemies stop your attacks constantly, but then if you make stronger attacks with sleights, you end up with almost nothing left.  Battles are just hopeless sometimes because you just can't attack the enemy, especially when you fight Organization XIII.  Then, they stop every single attack, and you can do nothing.  You're low on health and desperately need to heal, but then they stop you from using Cure, and you die.  I just really disliked constantly dying because I'm being stopped from doing anything.  I thought the battles were extremely hard sometimes, and I think it's really unfair that I lose not because of my skill level, but because the enemies block my every move.Anyway, after you beat Sora's story, you can play Riku's story, which had a few changes, like Riku could change into Dark Riku and do special attacks, and the game chooses your deck for you.  Riku's story is shorter, I believe, but still a decent length.So I would suggest not buying this game.  If anything, get the PS2 version if you can, which is a bit more fun, plus you fight Zexion in that version (which is the main reason I bought the other version).  Really the only thing about this game I like is the story, not the gameplay, so you'd be better off watching the cut scenes on Youtube or reading the story on a \"Kingdom Hearts\" Wikipedia.  Or just get the \"Chain of Memories\" manga and read the story there.  That's much more interesting.  But, don't get the game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2012"}

That should tell you how much time they spent on this one.  In the Storm, you go through the base and blow up stuff.  Then in Floodgate, you go back through the same level and kill the Flood.  Frickin' Lazy Bungie.  Frickin' Lazy.  Metroid does backtracing right.  Give me a new power to change the situation.  Nope, it's just all right trigger madness like all Halo games.I just reviewed Reach so I figured why not put my two cents in on this one.If by some chance you have been stuck in a bomb shelter for the past few years and missed this one and you're in the market for a 360 Halo game, get Reach instead - it ain't perfect either, but it's the best of the bunch.  At the very least, wait it out and get the HD remake of the original game - you'll get the security of having a brand new multi-player.Halo 3 is a half baked game.

It was a great game back then and it is still fun to play with friends to this day. In my opinion, it was the transitional Halo due to its wonderful innovations. One these major innovations that continued to other Halo games was the Forge Mode. There really wasn't anything like it before and it was just a fun community feature to add. All sorts of custom content was made and it was just wonderful.The campaign is not too long and not too short. It is still pretty fun to play with friends or even by yourself if you'd like to understand the story a bit more.The Multiplayer is also something I liked about this game and is a little bit different from Halo 2. With the additions of power-ups and cool weaponry, the game only gets better and better! I usually love to screw around with the Forge mode with friends and then have a battle on that map.This game is definitely worth a look even after 7 years. The player base for online is fairly low due it being a fairly old game, but in my eyes, it will always be one of the best in the series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2014"}

I have a 2Ghz P4, 768 Mb of RAM, and an ATI Radeon 9800 (not Pro or XT) with 128 Mb of RAM. I'm pleased to report that the game still looks fantastic, with textures and lighting better than anything I've yet seen.Doom 3 automatically scans your hardware and optimizes itself to run on what you have. On my setup, the graphics settings were dialed to \"medium\", but with resolution of just 640x400. I cranked the resolution up to 800x640 and the game still plays reasonably well, though there is a bit of stutter when the action gets really furious.As for the gameplay, I've played the first couple levels, but so far have been pretty satisfied. As noted elsewhere, this is a straightforward shooter. There is no enemy AI to speak of. The only tactic you will face is a head-on charge. This might be tiresome if there were waves of enemies or if you were in an expansive outdoor setting. But it works because you will face small numbers of enemies at once, and you battle them in fairly confined quarters. Battles are fast, furious and short. The game relies heavily on spookiness, which is readily achieved by the copious shadows created by the combination of the dynamic lighting technology and the cramped quarters of the Mars base.The major drawback to running Doom 3 on an older machine is that it will make you want to run out and buy a new system just so you can see how much better the experience can get.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2004"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXGU8","description":"","reviewerName":"That Review Guy","summary":"Crysis 3 is a Blast!","reviewText":"I really enjoy good FPS games and this is definately one of them.the single player is only about 5-7 hours depending what difficulty you choose(difficulty doesn't add more time it just takes longer due to limited ammo)the higher the difficulty you play on, the less ammo you can Carry.overall the single player wraps up the story well enougheven though it does leave a few loose ends. overall the SPwas quite fun and I'd recommend it to any FPS fan. Crysis 3 is well made.my only gripe about the Single Player is only Seven Chapters.Crysis 2 had twelve.The Multiplayer is the real Meat of Crysis 3 and offers a slew of new game modes:Hunter mode:this mode pits players in nanosuits against trooper enemies using the formidable bow weapon. Each of the troopers the Hunter team kills respawns as a Hunter - acting to slowly tip the scales in the Hunter's favor which is veryfun and quite a cool game mode.Crash Site:a multiplayer mode returning from previous Crysis titles. In CS, teams face-off against each other on a map where an alien pod is dropped in a random location. The goal of the game? For each of the teams to capture the pod with points awarded to anyone standing in the pod's zone. this is my Favorite game mode so far. it's basicly Capture the Flag.the longer you stay in the pods area, the more points you earn!After a certain amount of time, the pod eventually detonates, shortly after, a new pod will be dropped in a different area of the map. Interestingly, for the first time, this mode will also feature the ability to comandeer the Pinger walker(I love the Pinger Walker it's a super fun vehicle I just wish there were more)Extraction:Teams of Nanosuit-equipped operatives are dropped off by a VTOL. They must extract as many devices from separate locations on the map as possible in the five minutes available to them in each round?. The teams switch after 5 minutes, so attackers will become defenders and vice versa. pretty fun mode.Assault:A Team of Nanosuit-equipped operative players must sneak between different consoles to download data. Their opponents, a player-team of CELL soldiers must work together to stop them. This is a single-life Game Mode in which defeated players cannot respawn until the current round has ended. (didn't like this one)Capture the Relay:Capture the enemy's relay and return it to your base to score. Theteam with the highest number of captures wins. Matches are split into two rounds, with the teams swapping sides at half-time. (another awesome game mode)Spears:Capture three Alien Spears while preventing the enemy from doing the same.A captured spear emits a shield, providing some cover to nearby players. Once captured a team does not need to stay in the radius of the spear to acquire points. First team to earn 100 points wins. (kinda quick but Very Fun!)Deathmatch and Team Deathmatchkill enemies and reach score limit to win. (standard DM)The current Level Cap for Multiplayer is Level 50. At the point where you usually would reach Level 51 your Nanosuit will reboot, setting you back to Level 1 but with the added ability of using CELL weapons and granting you an exclusive dog tag. You can repeat this cycle multiple times and you'll get dog tag rewards each time.The usual Experience system is in place and as you play you unlocknew weapon attachments and also new weapons, mods, grenades, pistols etc.there are also killstreaks that vary from mode to mode.The alien weapons are a blast to use and really up the fun factorof the multiplayer as the new vehicles do (the VTOL and Pinger)The Maps with Game Release are:*Skyline*Chinatown*Williamsburg*Airport*Brooklyn Bridge*Financial District*Central Cavern*East River*Hydro Dam*Penn Depot*Museum*Hell's Kitchenoverall:if you're a big FPS fan and enjoy stealth options you definatelywant to try this game it's got a really good (though disjointed) storyin the SP and the MP adds loads of replay value. the new mapsare a blast as well with really nice environments and loads moreVerticality.Graphics: (PS3) Excellent with no lag or framerate drops 5 stars!Sound: excellent ambient noises as well as the nanosuit all sound excellent 5 starsGameplay: Superb Gameplay love the stealth options as well as Armor! 5 stars!Fun: the SP really didn't float my boat like the Multiplayer didand still does. the enemy A.I. has it's good and bad moments so I prefer MP.it's just so fantastic to sneak up on a real playerand break their neck without them ever seeing you. ahh good times. 5 Stars!Overall: if the singleplayer had been a 8-12 hour campaignI would have easily givin this game five stars all across the boardbut with the SP being so short and easy to plow through I had to take offone star since I wanted MORE!! the Multiplayer is truly what youare buying here and is worth every penny. it's a blast to playespecally now with the predator bow and salvagable alien weaponsreally add loads more fun and I'd recommend this to any FPS fan4 stars overall (so close to five it's more like 4.5 stars!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2013"}

I see some great write ups here so just some of my experiences with the game.  I think the graphics are great, much more than the first but not the best ive seen on the 360 but good.  The kill cam is fun for the first few times and after that the thrill is gone, lol....The sound and voice acting are nicely done, although some different voices would be nice but not a big deal.I like the mechanics of how to aim and shoot, zoom, switch weapons, grenades, mines, etc and to see guys walking into traps placed by me is nice to watch.  What can be frustrating is when moving there are areas one would think you can enter but cannot, also when in buildings sneaking along and see a good shot it cant be taken from windows with cross supports still intact or glass forcing moving to an open location and thus possible exposure to the enemy.Also, the enemy has the best vision/hearing of anyone on earth period...i can be crawling very slowly using binos scoping out my path only to be seen somehow by a guy just sitting there smoking a cigarette 200 yards away, amazing, thus forcing a showdown rambo style.  It would be nice had there been more than one way to enter and exit a mission.  I would like to be able to go in sneak and take out the main target and steathly extract myself, but the way its played its more like rambo where you have to fight everyone no matter how stealthy you are in the game. The first SE played were stealth meant something, but SEv2 stealth may get you into to a target area but be ready to fight your way out against everyone in ear shot of the alarm.  I still give it 4 stars as its fun but just not the sniper elite I remember that I enjoyed so much, its more like sniper elite meets rambo......","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000VJRU44","reviewerName":"Suzanne Amara","summary":"The first time I've ever been eager to work out!","reviewText":"I was at a local video game store yesterday morning when it opened, hoping to score a Wii Fit---I felt foolish, at 42, doing something like that, but I was very eager to get this devise!  I did get one (the last one available, about 2 minutes after they opened) and it's seeming so far to be worth it!!I was surprised how heavy the box was---this is a solid piece of equipment.  It seems a lot like a big scale.  It's fairly easy to set up, and once you start, it talks you through what to do---basically entering your height and age, and getting weighed.  That part wasn't fun, but that's not the fault of the Wii!  Then you can set a fitness goal, and get going with the many options for exercise.I am mostly concentrating on the aerobic options so far.  The first was a hula hoop game---stand on the Fit, rotate your hips, and watch your little Mii do the same.  Then you get hoops thrown at you and try to catch them with your body.  I ended up ignoring the thrown hoops as I just couldn't get them, but the rotating itself is a workout!  Next I tried the stepping routine---it's sort of like Dance Dance Revolution, in that it tells you where to step and when.  I had a little trouble keeping up, but I think that would be easy to learn.  My favorite activity so far is the running in place.  You don't actually run on the Fit, you hold your Wii controller and run on the floor, but the controller senses your running.  Your Mii runs around an outdoor track as you do, and you see all kinds of your Mii friends waving to you or trying to beat you!  I love that---it's fun to see a Mii you created running past!I tried the yoga next, and just have done a few poses so far, but I really liked it.  It was very calming and well taught.  You are judged with that mostly on your balance, and it made me happy saying my balance was good!  You are guided by either a man or woman, both of which are encouraging but sort of weird talking and looking!My son tried the push-up activity, and was VERY challenged by it!  He is 10, and I think he's a little young for the Fit---it really is aimed at adults.The balance activities were fun!  One was a soccer heading game, which was quite hard but cool, one was like Marble Madness but using your own balance and movements to put balls in holes...things like that.There are still many activities I can unlock by time of use.  I can't say yet whether the Fit will help me lose weight, but it can't hurt, I am sure!  So far I really couldn't be happier with this devise.  I hope Nintendo keeps the supply coming so anyone who wants one can get one---I think a lot of people could benefit from this great idea for getting more fit.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2008"}

The PS3 is the way to go if you're looking for a new game console.Many of the game titles are now available at $20 Greatest Hits prices, including the most recent Ratchet & Clank game, the racer Burnout Paradise, and the action-adventure hit Uncharted, which are all spectacular.Then there's Red Dead Redemption, which looks just like a Western movie and plays like real life.  I've seen video of Uncharted 2 also, and I've never seen such an amazing-looking video game.Otherwise the slim PS3 is sleek, compact, and quiet, and the wireless controller charges quickly.$299 ain't cheap, but considering all the functionality of the PS3, it has become worth the money IMO.Highly recommended!UPDATE: the Microsoft Kinect sensor device has been winning rave reviews.  So I will amend my console recommendation to say the following: IF you like simple-to-play games you can control without a controller -- and IF the horrendously high failure rate of the Xbox360 is no longer an issue -- you may want to consider the Xbox360, which has better graphics (at a higher price) than the wii.  IF, however, you are content with a more traditional and very reliable game console -- and you don't want to bother your downstairs neighbors with your footfalls -- then the PS3 is for you.  Personally I find the PS3 wireless dual-shock controller a tour de force as well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2010"}

{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"Fantastic game...trumps the original in every way","reviewText":"If you've played it, I'm sure you'd agree...Uncharted: Drake's Fortune was a really good game.  While not entirely original (not many games are nowadays), Uncharted was an expertly-crafted fusion of the worlds of Lara Croft and Indiana Jones together with exciting gunplay, platforming and puzzle solving.  Combined with gorgeous graphics, a charismatic lead character in Nathan Drake, and a fast paced, enjoyable story, Uncharted felt fresh and exciting; it felt like a step forward for the possibilities of modern action video games.  Fast forward a couple of years, and the developers released Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, a game that basically takes the first game, and ups the ante in every way possible.  A remarkable feat.Without a doubt, the first thing you'll notice is the game's presentation.  Where Uncharted was a stunningly beautiful game to look at, Uncharted 2 looks even better.  The varied backgrounds look almost photorealistic, especially the levels that take place inside dusty, colorful temples.  The level of detail is even greater than it was the first time around, and you'll find yourself in awe at how much the developers have packed into the environments.  Not only are the stagnant backgrounds mesmerizing, but the interactivity you have with them during the big action sequences is even more incredible.  The game is a masterful technical achievement.  This is quite simply the best looking game I've played on the PS3.The gameplay, as well as the game's structure, is also vastly improved.  Right away, the game's battlefields are open and dynamic, offering endless ways of taking out the swarms of enemies that are attacking you.  The gunning feels tighter and more responsive, and the larger weapons arsenal is very welcome.  Melee combat has been improved and is much more fun.  It's now easier to aim your grenades, making them much more useful.  The ability to run and gun has been added as well.  And best of all, the game introduces a very nice stealth mechanic that lets you sneak up on enemies for a silent kill, or even haul them off of a tall building while hanging from the ledge ala Assassin's Creed.  A sequence on a moving train allows the player to utilize the stealth mechanic brilliantly and really brings to light the added dimension that stealth brings to the Uncharted series.  All of these additions to the gameplay improve the core of the series and enrich the entire experience.The story is once again something of a multilayered hunt after an ancient treasure, and while it can be debated whether the story is better or worse than the first, there is no question that Uncharted 2 is much better written.  The dialogue (voiced by an incredibly talented cast of actors) feels much more natural, flows easier, and is much wittier and funnier than the first game.  The improved facial animations definitely help in making the experience seem much more genuine.Lastly, the developers have even included multiplayer and online co-op modes.  I haven't spent too much time with the multiplayer, but from what I tried, it was actually a lot of fun and fully formed.  It didn't feel tacked on, like so many other games' multiplayer modes.All in all, Uncharted 2 is just an excellent game...a stunning document on how far video games have come.  The level of improvement from the excellent first game in the series is significant and is extremely impressive.  I'm excited to see what they come up with for the third game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"Nona","summary":"Awesome game, must own for PS3","reviewText":"It's time to add my voice to the chorus of reviewers talking about how spectacular Uncharted 2 is.  This game does everything right.  The gameplay is fantastic, the story and cut scenes are superbly well integrated into the combat sections of the game, the multiplayer is fun, and the unlockable features are actually interesting.  The level of polish in this game is exceptionally high, and undoubtedly has set a new benchmark for other game developers to aspire to.Many people have said that this game is like being in an Indiana Jones movie, and they'd be right.  There's more gunplay in Uncharted than Indiana Jones, but just like in Indiana Jones movies, you travel to far flung exotic locales in search of archaeological mysteries, all the while trying to outsmart, outrun, and sometimes even outgun a villain who's after those same mysteries for some nefarious purpose.  Some of the scripted events in this game are so ridiculously amazing that you'll just be staring at the screen in awe as they unfold.  It's pretty remarkable that the game is as long as it is, considering how much effort the designers must have put in to make everything work just right.The graphics in the game are superb - certainly among the very best on the PS3 so far, and probably only surpassed by very high end gaming rigs.  But it's not just the technical quality of the graphics which standout: it's actually the fantastic design and animation.  The places you visit are all visually stunning, and the acting (motion capture + voice acting) makes the characters believable (well, minus their uncanny ability to jump and climb) and interesting.I have to also commend the designers for the great job they did with the unlockables system.  You get access to all sorts of interesting bonuses as you play (and re-play) the game.  Some of them directly affect gameplay, some are cosmetic, while others are art galleries and behind the scenes movies.  It's wonderfully integrated with the PS3 trophy system as well as the multiplayer system, and other designers should really pay attention to Uncharted 2's reward system.This game is awesome.  It's one of the highest rated games on Amazon, and after playing it, I've gotta agree with the 90% of the reviewers who gave this game 5 stars.  I'm eagerly waiting for Uncharted 3, and you'll probably be as well after playing this game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2010"}

Wii, like all the previous releases in theSuper Mario Bros.franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros.

The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"MasterReviewer05","summary":"Mario has done it again!","reviewText":"Mario has never disappointed me in any way shape or form!

Why change something that worked so well?  I bought the PS3 and the 360 version of this game because im a Die-Hard souls fan boy.  I have 4 characters in Demons Souls and DK-1.Let me say i do not use any Glitch's or cheats, i play the game the way it was made to be played.There are 3 factors in this game that could make or break it.Stun-LockingParryingCharacter movements/animationsStun-Locking....In DK-1 if you were stun-locked all you had to do was toggle your weapons/d-pad and you rolled out of it.  In DK-2 if you get stun-locked you are stun-locked, no more toggle.  With my best shield in DK-2 i can get stun-locked and the animation of the stun-locked seem to last forever.  i tried to toggle to no avail.  The stun-lock animation last too long to come out of it and thats If you are lucky enough to break out of it.Parrying.....Oh boy, what have they done.  im the type of player who will stay in the opponents face because i love to parry.  In DK-1 you can time the parry perfectly, with practice.  In DK-2 no way.  I have tried and tested on many enemies and its broken.  In DK-2 say you are in the enemies face, you see him about to swing, i know some enemies animation of swinging are different, but its about timing.  The timing of your characters parry is soooo  slow its useless.  Either the timing or window to parry is broken.  I practiced all day on some enemies trying to parry.  I could not parry not one, not even the slow moving zombies.Character movements.....i made a comment about this in my 360 review.  The best way to test a characters movement is by standing still and using the stick to see how they respond.  My character standing still i move my stick L/R and my character moves so erratic as if they are on ice.  I compared this to my Demon Souls and DK-1 character movements and its like night and day.  What im saying the controls are much tighter in the previous games.  Tighter control, better outcome of character actions.They tweaked the Back-Stab window...Thank God.  Also, they should patch the availability of Human Effigy or at least give Human Effigy after the defeat of each Boss.  Overall, i still like Dark Souls 2 im just not as excited as i thought i would be.  If they patch these issues it could easily be game of the year but right now i can only give it an average rating.Addition:  Getting invaded as a hollow is very cheap.  its bad enough you lose HP and with each additional death you lose even more HP.  I do have the Binding Ring but you still lose HP with it on if you die again.  So, getting invaded as a Hollow is a cheap tactic that should be changed back to the way it has always been.  I been invaded 3 times as a hollow and only once in human form, go figure.  Whats cheap about it is the invader could have full HP and you 3/4 HP.  They MUST change it.Edit: 3/21/14What is the purpose of wearing the Binding ring when hollow? If you die again with Binding Ring on you still lose HP.  I don't get that logic.  i know in Demons Souls when you go hollow you put on the Cling Ring and your HP stays at 75% and it does not matter if you die 10 more times your HP stays at 75%.  Not in DK-2, if you die again with the Binding Ring on you still lose HP down to 50%, smh.  Getting invaded as a hollow even after beating the boss is very cheap.  If they do not change this aspect back to the way it worked either in Demons Souls or DK-1, then i won't play for NG+.EDIT...7/3/14Read my updated review for the 360.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2014"}

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization.

Outside of Lego and Rock Band-type games, there aren't many good games with on-couch co-op. &lt;Feel free to toss me some suggestions!>I finally picked up Borderlands. The premise is simple enough; fight through a post-apocolyptic wasteland, wasting critters and bandits, to get to some mythical \"vault\".The art/graphics are comic-booky, but not distracting. There are some downright gory kills, body parts flying, and headshots tend to detonate the cranium. You've been warned.The game play is hectic and fun. Run and shoot and loot. Equip the latest and greatest weapon or mod. Drive a car and shoot rockets. Kill mutant dogs, bandits, giant crabs and more. There are a few fetch quests, which mostly exist to introduce you to a new area. There are also \"scavenger\" quests, which lead to a rare weapon- I've found these weapons aren't that special, especially if you get them later in the game.The biggest problem, at least in split screen, is that the HUD can be a little cluttered sometimes,especially when you go into your customizing screen. You can't see the entire page on half the screen, so you have to move left and right to read the quests, equip or sell, etc. Also, there are occasional landscape glitches.

{"product_name":"B001NJ28SO","reviewerName":"Ian","summary":"Come with me if you want to save your money","reviewText":"Who knew that a 1980's movie about a killer robot sent back through time to kill a waitress would become a pop culture phenomenon, spawning three sequals, numerous catchphrases, action figures, novels, and of course, video games.  However, the terminator universe has never really fared well in video game format, so how does the latest game hold up?  Having a lot to live up to, it also has to deal with the ever present curse of being a game based on a film, which gives two strikes against it.  However, despite the odds, Terminator Salvation manages to pull through, and while it is not a perfect game, it is surprisingly satisfying...depending on your tastes.Taking place two years before the events of the film of the same name, Terminator Salvation follows John Conner, famed leader of the resistance...or at least, that's what he's supposed to be.  At this point in time, Conner is still a common foot soldier who has yet to embrace his destiny, and is content to run around the wasteland that was Los Angeles, blasting away at killer robots.  But one day, he gets a radio call from a few soldiers trapped behind Skynet lines, cut off and begging for help.  Defying his superiors (and maybe common sense), Conner takes off through the Los Angeles wasteland to save his fellow Resistance fighters, and along the way, learning about the value of friendship, love, and peppering killer robots with high powered rockets.Terminator Salvation is your standard third person shooter.  You run around levels as John, armed with a variety of death dealing weaponry, while shooting at a multitude of homicidal robots who have nothing better to do in life then rip you to shreds (or punch you to death).  Things get interesting though, thanks to Salvation's most innovative gameplay mechanic...cover.  Though John is one tough cookie, even he can't take much damage from Skynet firepower, so standing out in the open while shooting at the opposition will end up with him lying on the ground with numerous bloody holes in his body.  Thankfully, there's a simple way to avoid taking all that damage, and that's through the use of cover.  As you travel through the post apocalyptic landscape, you'll find countless waist high obstacles to duck behind, whether it be cars, concrete pillars, oil drums, etc.  While hidden behind these obstacles, you'll be safe from attack, as well as being able to move about to other forms of cover.  Thankfully, this mechanic works very well.  Want to move to another barrier?  Simply creep to the edge of your current one, press the analog stick left or right, click a button when the semi-circle appears on screen, and you'll leap, slide, and otherwise slickly move from barrier to barrier.  This system is well designed, easy to use, and is very easy to master.  In no time at all you'll be flanking enemies, sliding around and firing off rounds, at times feeling like a real soldier, and feeling the flush of victory when you sucessfully defeat an enemy group.Though you'll be spending most of your time fighting on foot, Salvation mixes things up a bit with the occasional on rail sequence, during which you'll be in a moving vehicle armed with a very big gun, tasked with blasting away at your robotic pursuers.  While you never drive a vehicle during these sequences, it does offer a nice chance of pace and easily manages a great sense of speed.  But whether on foot or on vehicle, Salvation never lacks in the action department, offering dozens of spectacular set pieces that rival, and even surpass, the action scenes from the film.  In fact, we've never seen this much action in any of the films, and if you love action, shooting things, running, and riding in vehicles, then you'll have a blast with Salvation.You'll be doing a lot of fighting and cover leaping throughout the game, but while it may be simple, you'll be doing it in some really slick environments.  Easily Salvation's best aspect, the game is a graphical powerhouse, packing in huge, lavishly detailed post apocalyptic landscapes, ranging from plant infested suburbs, to crumbling skyscraper canyons, to wreckage lined freeways.  Each aspect of the game is gorgeous and beautiful to look at, especially if you're a fan of the post apocalyptic look of crumbling buildings and general destruction.  In fact, at some points, the graphics are so good that they match the level of photorealistic.  The opening cinematic, for example, at times looks as though it was live action.  The audio, while not quite matching the quality of the visuals, still does a good job.  The voice acting of the cast is good all around, including a few actors from the film reprising their roles (Christian Bale not included), though the music occasionaly gets very repetitive, due to the same, short pieces repeated over and over.But while Salvation works on the basic levels of fun, great graphics and an immersive world, it has a few things going against it.  Primarily it's length.  Salvation is a short game.  A VERY short game.  From start to finish, on medium difficulty, Salvation should take you no more then four to five hours to finish.  That's an astonishingly short amount of time for a big budget game...heck, any game in general.  Before you know it, the game is over and you're watching the credits roll by, wondering if that's really it.  Sadly, it is, and unfortunatly, there's not really any rewards for your efforts.  You do get some Playstation trophies and the ability to go back and play any level you want, but there are no cheat codes, no unlockable costumes or skins (I want to play as AHNOLD!) for you to earn.  You get the main game, and that's it.While the main game is fun, and I do like to go back and play it again, it will not be to everyone's taste, due to the game being, at heart, very simplistic.  There's really no depth here...you spend the game running around, taking cover, flanking robots and shooting said robots until the game is finished.  There are no items for you to pick up (except new guns and ammo), no interacting with the environment, and there are only four enemy types, hovering bots, spider bots, T-600's, Flying Hunter Killers, and the motorcycle bots seen in the film.  Those are the only enemies you'll fight during the game, blasting them over and over again and again.  Each bot is weak against a specific type of ammo, but that's it as far as gameplay depth goes.Storywise, there isn't all that much to go on.  The story is straightforward, with no twists or turns, and while it does show Conner slowly growing into a leader, most people will likely be disapointed at how thin the story is, especially when characters die and you don't feel anything for them.  There are a few glitches to be found, such as robots occasionally getting stuck inside walls, the game occasionaly freezing, textures vanishing and replaced by textureless black surfaces, and at one point my teammates, who are supposed to be invincible (commonly standing point blank in front of a T-600 and getting blasted with mini gun rounds for minutes on end), were killed, which led me to run around a level all by my lonesome, while still hearing the characters talk, even though they were dead, and they respawned at the end of the level!  Even more bizzare, at one point you're fighting two semi-disguised T-600's who have the ability to punch you to death through concrete barriers, making it impossible to take cover from them.  I was also very disapointed in the lack of a final boss fight, which would have been awesome, especially had it been the giant harvester bot.There is also another factor that must be taken into account, and that is the game's price.  As of this writing, Salvation goes for an asking price of almost sixty dollars, which is far too high for a game this short and simplistic.  With five hours of gameplay, you'd be paying about twelve dollars for each hour of gameplay, and that's far too much.  Because of that, I cannot, in good faith, recommend this game for a purchuse.  I would recommend waiting until the price drops to within the ten to twenty dollar range, as twenty is the maximum I would personally spend.In the end, is Salvation worth a play? Some will no doubt find the very simple gameplay to be dull and repetitive, but I personally had no problem with it due to how challenging Salvation is.  For while you do fight the same robots over and over again, it's never easy.  You're often bombarded by multiple robots, and trying to take them all out can be a seriously challenging endevour, considering how easy it is to die.  So while the basic gameplay mechanics never change, the game is never dull, nor is it a walk in the park.  It has simple, yet effective gameplay that takes place in gorgeous environments, and allows you to shoot a nearly endless stream of killer robots with lots of guns.  Like the B-movie franchise that spawned it, Salvation is essentially a B game at heart.  It's flashy, action packed, and doesn't require a whole lot of brain power.  Some will like that, and some won't.While Salvation is not worth a buy until its price goes down, people who love the film franchise, enjoy the post apocalyptic genre and like simple, yet challenging gameplay will most likely enjoy Terminator Salvation.  I easily recommend it is a rental, and as a buy...eventually.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2009"}

Having just come off great games like Call of Duty 4, Assassin's creed, Bioshock, Mass Effect (you get the idea..) ... I was fairly disappointed by how unintuitive the controls of this game are. They aren't the worst, by far, but certainly felt sloppy in light of other better games I have recently played. The control sensitivity is too low on \"medium\" and felt much better on \"high\" except when I went to aim with \"Iron Sights\" then medium was better, constantly changing got annoying though, so I decided to melee exclusively (see below) Moreover, the graphics are cartoony, the checkpoints are few and far between, and the weapons... this takes me into a second paragraph.Combat: Explain this to me: Nazi bad guy with sub machine gun is perfectly accurate at 1000ft. I manage to take him down with the only good weapon in the game (bolt action rifle) and when I get his machine gun, I can't hit a guy 30ft away. I don't get that.  Regardless other than rifles, the weapons aren't even worth it. I found myself running up to guys for melee combat instead of wasting my time shooting them. Of course, I have to wait for the enemy to finish whatever animation he is in before the melee prompt appears, but it was far more effective than shooting. I found myself quite irritated by the combat.Other things that annoy me are the dumbing down of vehicles battles. Enemy tank, no problem there is a rocket launcher conveniently stowed around the corner. Boat? Ohh... another rocket launcher... blimp? Same. I did not come across one combat encounter with an enemy vehicle that didn't either drive off in a hurry, or didn't blow up with a couple well aimed rockets. It was all very formulaic. To wrap it up, the game sacrificed game play for story, and is overall at best a 3 star game.Edit 3/2/08: There weren't many multi-player games going on, but I managed to play a few. What I found was, the levels were boring. You get to pick your weapon each time you spawn, but they are as bad in multi-player as they are in the single player campaign. Except that the other players can't use them effectively either. Stick with Call of Duty Multi-player which is a lot of fun.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-29-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0010EI6T2","reviewerName":"Mr. H. C. Orr","summary":"Offers nothing new","reviewText":"The problem that \"Rainbow Six: Vegas 2\" faces is that it is faced again with reinventing the wheel. First person shooters are the staple of the current generation of consoles in much the same way as driving games were for the last generation.  Moreover, last year's hugely successful \"Call Of Duty\" iteration raised the bar for what gamers should expect from the conventional FPS.  \"RS:V2\" delivers polished shooting action, throwing in the requisite online modes, but without really blowing the hinges off what we would expect from a FPS in 2008.The new \"Rainbow Six\" generally sticks to the formula established by Ubisoft Montreal in the first outing.  The squad-based Special Ops action will feel very familiar to anyone that has played that game or its stablemate \"Ghost Recon\" games.  Graphically and sonically the sequel matches the first game, although additions such as a cover system and experience levelling set-up (where you gain points for different aspects of fighting) are welcome additions.Although based in Sin City, the game often accents on the mundane warehouses and leisure complexes of Las Vegas, rather than vulgar casinos and the like.  This is my first complaint about the game: it seems rather samey, and at least in the PlayStation 3 version, the backgrounds can seem a little sparse: grey abandoned warehouse segues to nondescript hotel complex, and so on, without there being anything really to capture the eye or the imagination.  The game does not feel as cinematic, as much of an \"event\" as \"CoD4\".  Similarly, the mundanity often stretches to your direction of the AI squad members: move to the closed door, open it, clear the room and then repeat.  There is no real incentive to lead the charge from the front, especially as you often earn experience points from the squad's action.The squad AI can often be irritating, too.  For instance, it is not uncommon for one of your \"buddies\" to block your line of fire, or stand in the middle of the war zone just waiting to be shot: often the squad will not respond to orders very quickly, either.  I have also noticed that there is quite marked slowdown in some sections of the PS3 version of the game, which is pretty unforgivable in a current generation game and from a top developer such as Ubisoft, to boot.On the plus side, \"RS:V2\" does provide plentiful reasons for immersion in the later stages of the game thanks to the experience levelling system: there seems to be some form of progression from playing through the game at point when you would otherwise feel ready to hang up your MP5 for the night.  The online \"Terrorist Hunt\" mode, where you co-operate with other players online is a good idea, although I have often encountered connection problems trying to access this.An overall assessment of the new \"Rainbow Six\" would be that it is a good enough game, which offers plenty of challenge.  However, judged by the impressive yardstick of \"CoD4\" and the deluge of up-and-coming releases for the PlayStation 3 and XBOX 360, the game is not really individual or exceptional enough to warrant more than an extended rental play.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00009MVJ7","description":"Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliancetook co-operative action role-playing to new heights on the Playstation 2 console. Alone, or with a friend, you could tackle giant rats, undead monsters, dark elves, and even a white dragon, as you uncovered a plot against the good city of Baldur's Gate. But the ending indicated there was more adventure to come. Fans were worried that the sequel wouldn't live up to original's promise when the original design team jumped ship to work on Sony'sChampions of Norrath: Realms of EverQuest. They need not have worried;Dark Alliance 2is a worthy successor, retaining the weapons, monsters, Dungeons and Dragons action and rules, sharp graphics, responsive controls, and high adventure of its predecessor.The plot is a bit darker this time, but you're given a wider range of character classes to help face the elevated threats. There's the mighty barbarian, a dwarf rogue, a cleric, the monk (a martial artist), and a necromancer. The quest is huge and there are character-class specific side quests you can embark on--an extra incentive to play again as a different character. The level design tends to be a little too maze-like, and there's lots of boring backtracking, but the annoying jumping puzzles from the first game are gone.The biggest problem withDark Alliance 2is that it doesn't measure up to the competition. It's a 2-player game, whileDungeons & Dragons Heroes(on the Xbox) andChampions of Norrath(on the PS2 and Xbox) allow four-player play. Then again if you plan to play solo, or with a single friend, that shouldn't keep you from coming to the city ofBaldur's Gate'said once again.--Andrew Bub","reviewerName":"\"thereaper104@yahoo.com\"","summary":"WOULD be 5 stars...","reviewText":"A good friend of mine brought this game to a sleep over (3 ppl total) and we played the game all night. Great game. It really gave a good D2 feel (Diablo 2). I only have two complaints: my tv is a 23 Inch and I couldn't focus on my character. If the view was more of a &quot;FF: Crystal Chronicles feel&quot;, it would of been better. The second is that it should have a &quot;multi-tap compatable&quot; so there could be at LEAST 4 players, not online. Otherwise, get this game, you will be playing it for a while!*E-mail is powerslave6041@yahoo.com now","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2004"}

{"product_name":"B002I0F5I2","reviewerName":"Laura","summary":"OK","reviewText":"I was disapointed in this game. I guess the reason I didn't like it as much is b/c Im getting older and games are just not as fun as they used to be when I was younger. I played the first Uncharted like 3 years ago and it was awesomeness!!!The only reason I gave Five stars for over all is b/c it had wonderful graphics, story line and it was fun when I was bored. I couldn't wait to play this game but it just wasn't as fun as I thought it would be. So my fun meter was a 3. Games just are not as fun as they used too be. :( Also most games now are automatic when you play certain parts and you have to push buttons when a button icon pops up on your screen when your playing. Nintendo64 still rocks!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2011"}

As it loaded, I kept thinking, \"There's no way this game is as great as everyone saysohmygosh this is awesome!\" The single player campaign completely arrested me until I finished it (good thing it was short, or I would have been sitting there awhile) and the multiplayer was such a breath of fresh air after living in HALO's repetitive shadow for so long.A year later: we have BLACK OPS, from a different studio with the aim of giving us a CoD experience from a yet-to-be-endlessly-exploited era. The Cold War. I kept my expectations pretty low, considering I wasn't the biggest fan of Treyarch's last CoD entry, WORLD AT WAR. Good thing I did; low expectations are easy to meet, especially if you tread on familiar ground.The campaign follows operative Alex Mason, a man who wakes up in an interrogation room just in time to be tortured and drugged into recalling certain memories involving his military service. The purpose of the interrogation isn't entirely clear, though anyone with an interest in Cold War conspiracy theories can probably figure it out sooner rather than later. Mason relives his contributions to the Bay of Pigs, Vietnam, and some rather interesting black ops missions that take place in the background of all of these conflicts.The story itself isn't revolutionary by any means, but it's much easier to follow and much deeper than its predecessor, MODERN WARFARE 2. Let's face it, Treyarch had a win on their hands no matter what they did, but they saw fit to provide a campaign that's exciting and competently channels that Cold War anxiety. Not to mention the enjoyable and expertly-voiced characters (many props to Gary Oldman for making Viktor Reznov so memorable) and beautiful level design.That's not to say it was perfect. I can't really explain it, but as I was playing through the campaign, I just didn't attain that sense of involvement that I felt with MW2. The AI was pretty stupid and there were levels that just felt like your standard \"shoot everyone to complete mission\" stage. And little things like not being able to control the camera during certain \"cutscenes\" gave me a sense of disconnect. That said, I can't say that I enjoyed this campaign MORE than MW2's, but I could tell that a lot of effort went into it, bringing it up to a close second place in my book.Basically, if you're buying this game for the campaign just as much as the multiplayer, I don't think you'll be disappointed. I certainly wasn't, though a few of the choices kept it from reaching the level of immersion MW2's campaign provided. But how can you beat personally receiving a mission from President Kennedy?Now, the multiplayer. There's not much I can say that hasn't been said. From my own experience, it's just as addicting and just as fun as MW2's multiplayer. Honestly, not much has been changed up with the formula, save for the changes that come with the Cold War era. But a BIG change that I absolutely adore is the ability to watch, save, and edit replays of any multiplayer match you've played in the last seven days (limited to 100 matches, I think). You can make little montages, take screenshots, and then upload them to the CoD website so you can share them with people. I've had a lot of fun messing around with it so far.In the end, this is another CALL OF DUTY game that doesn't drop the ball. The campaign is entertaining and well-written, and the multiplayer is more of the same (albeit with a different theme), but \"the same\" is still pretty dang fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2010"}
