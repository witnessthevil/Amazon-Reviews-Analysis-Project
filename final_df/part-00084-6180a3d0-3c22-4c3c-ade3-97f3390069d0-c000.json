I gave up on this game after I kept dying during the sky diving mini-game, the mechanics didn't work and the game wasn't worth grinding over. Basically every move you learn in the tutorial will be your entire game experience, there is absolutely no depth in the gameplay. While it's fun at first, it quickly becomes dull and repetitive. Every time you're fighting someone, you have to either jump or slide to start the bullet-time, and each jump/slide is exactly the same. I wish there were some sort of modifiers to add different movements to break up the monotony. Related to this, if you try to shoot when you aren't jumping or sliding, the gun fire-rate is about a 1/4 of the speed, making it useless.So don't buy this game, if you want to experience it, just download the demo.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00000I1BJ","description":"Raccoon City has been overrun by the living dead, and you are one of only a dwindling handful of survivors. You must escape the doomed city or become part of a ghastly new food chain: one with you at the bottom.You play as either Leon Kennedy, a rookie cop who's having areallybad first day on the job, or Claire Redfield, sister of one of the stars of the originalResident Evil. Leon and Claire's meeting is depicted in a visually stunning, B-movie cutscene. They're quickly separated, but occasionally meet up throughout the game.Right after the gruesome intro, you're dumped into the thick of things and have to dash through the devastated city streets, fleeing from one horde of zombies after another. As you make your way to a supposed refuge--the city police station--you find evidence that the citizenry fought bravely against the undead menace--and lost. Smashed barricades, abandoned police cars, boarded-up stores, dismembered bodies, and hundreds of expended bullet shell casings are all-too-common sights. Once you reach the station, you discover the remains of a siege. The defenders' desperate final hours are recorded in a fragmented journal. Its pages detail a possible escape route through an underground passage. Did the cops make it out? The alarming number of zombies wearing tattered police uniforms may be a clue.Resident Evil 2keeps the terrific puzzles and action of the original while vastly improving cinematic qualities such as dialogue, camera angles, cutscenes, atmosphere, and location design.

Here's why:GRAPHICS: All the aircraft in this game look photorealistic. From high altitudes, the backgrounds look photorealistic as well. However, when you drop to lower altitudes, the ground starts to get real pixal-like and blurry. At times it looks as if there's another thousand or two-thousand feet below you, when there's really not. The cutscenes are done in the manner of a children's book with painted or cartoon-like backgrounds.SOUND: If you think that the sound of your engines sounds dreadfully real, well, it's because it is. They actually recorded the engine sounds for various aircraft at different stages of flight. During combat, you'll hear lots of radio chatter. In one mission, you'll even get to listen to a local radio station telling its listeners what's happening while you're wreaking havoc in the skies above.MUSIC: After you beat the game once (make sure you save afterwards, though), you can listen to all the music tracks in the game (among other things). By themselves, though, the tracks aren't all that great, but with the tremendous exception of \"Rex Tremendae\" and the song immediately following it. Those two are the songs you listen to while playing the final mission. Personally, I'm a big fan of the Final Fantasy series. Ace Combat was the last place I'd have thought to find some ending level/boss music of Nobuo Uematsu's quality. \"Rex Tremendae\" and the following track are choir pieces, but they sound as good as FF7's \"One-Winged Angel\".GAMEPLAY: There are 18 different missions (not including the training missions) and each one of them has a different background, objective, background music, etc. You'll fly through canyons, over oceans, cities, snow-capped mountains (reminded me of Hoth in The Empire Strikes Back), deserts and supporting ground troops storming beaches Normandy-style. Most of the time, your objective will be to shoot down all targets, get a certain amount of points, or protect a certain target. There are lots of dogfights, but there are also lots of ground targets to be destroyed as well. Sometimes you'll be torn between fighting what's above you and what's below you, but there are aircraft that can handle both situations nicely.AIRCRAFT: There are 19. F4 Phantom, A10 Thunderbolt, F14 Tomcat, F16 Falcon, F18 Hornet, F117 Stealth fighter, F22 Raptor, lots of European aircraft, a nice variety of Mig's (go after the SU-37 or SU-37A). And although the Mig's are nice, because America has to have the best plane, we get the X-02 (excellent in about all categories, but still not as fast as the SU-37). You acquire these planes by shooting them down, then purchasing them. Be careful what you buy, though, because it sometimes takes two or three missions to accumulate enough money to purchase a single aircraft--not including extra armament.CAMERA: One of Ace Combat's MAJOR strong points is the ability to complete your mission in third person/external view. This is due to the fact that the external view has a gunsight for all aircraft. Games like X-Wing and Tachyon had external view, but they were only for show purposes as there was no targeting system--unless you wanted to shoot around blindly. On the downside, however, the Replay camera is not as good as the replay camera in X-Wing. Ace Combat's replay camera has several angles to choose from, but the camera doesn't seem to like close-ups too well. And, unlike X-Wing, you can't see the battle from your opponents POV.STORY: The story may seem a little childish--due to the cartoonish backgrounds--but believe me, it really is a pretty good story for a game of this type.DIFFICULTY: There are several difficulty levels, but either way, you can easily beat this game twice in three days, and probably without getting shot down by the enemy, either. By and large, most often you'll crash because you're flying too close to the ground--which you often have to do to hit ground targets(but this is where the A10 comes in handy).OVERALL: There's a lot more I could say about this game, but I think I touched on all the major points. And just because you can beat it in a day doesn't mean that it's just worth a rental. There is a two-player mode with various dogfighting options, multiple aircraft colors, special options after you do certain things (like beat the game or get S rank on all missions). And hey, sometimes, you just find yourself in that mood to fly fast against a beautiful background. I've beaten this game several times, but even now I still find myself playing it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2002"}

{"product_name":"B0044TD9HY","description":"","reviewerName":"Stephen M. Lerch","summary":"Great set, weigh your options before buying","reviewText":"This does NOT CONTAIN Red Dead Redemption's single player campaign. Undead Nightmare is its own single player campaign (along with the multiplayer bits outlined below when you buy the disc version of Undead Nightmare)For those wondering, if you already have any or all of theRed Dead RedemptionDLC, this probably isn't the most cost effective way to collect the rest (assuming you pay MSRP; currently Amazon is running it for $20 (Nov 29, 2010)).Here's what you receive in this set, including current price on Xbox Live:Undead Nightmare $10 (800 points)Liars and Cheats $10 (800 points)Legends and Killers $10 (800 points)Outlaws to the End FREE and NOT INCLUDED in this set; I'm not sure if you can download this and use it w/ UN, though I don't believe you canXbox Live Total price: $30 (2400 points)One option that is ALSO available on Xbox Live is the Undead Nightmare Pack for $20 (1600 points). The only reason this isn't the best option is under 2 circumstances: you've already bought ANY of the DLC ($10 each) OR if the MSRP of this stand alone edition is $20 (which, as of Nov 29, 2010, it is on the 360). Except for those circumstances, $20 is always cheaper than $30.Another reason to buy this set is if you don't own the original RDR and JUST want to play multiplayer RDR, as this game contains the same multiplayer community as the original RDR and can be played with those that have just UN OR those that have RDR only. DLC restrictions not withstanding of course. This being said, however, I don't feel the multiplayer tight enough to justify buying this just to play multiplayer. And given the UN piece is single player (with exception to the horde style mode), and you won't necessarily know the characters (there is little to no character development as Rockstar assumes you already know the RDR cast), buying UN as anything but DLC doesn't make a ton of sense to me personally; this review is for those that decide to go this route anyway.The final reason you should pick this up as a standalone release is if you don't have the hard drive space for the DLC. That makes perfect sense. Of course, the other option is to buy the DLC and buy a USB hard drive or USB memory device fast enough to install content to, which would allow you to use UN AND other DLC you may wish to own and your hard drive is full.Now for the review of the content proper.Undead Nightmare. In an interview with a Rockstar employee, the statement was made that Undead Nightmare (UN) should be taken like this:The cast of Red Dead Redemption (RDR) has evenings off but has access to the set, makeup and cameras. Being bored and having nothing else to do, they get together in the evenings and create a new production with the same characters and a twist on the RDR story and that is what UN is all about.This description seems to make you think it isn't RDR canon then. It is. And that's the cool part. It plays right into the whole RDR game perfectly; well almost. RDR, for the most part, is believable. UN, well, we know zombies or the walking dead don't exist (plausible deniability here on my part!), but with the way it starts, and ends, it fits in the world almost seamlessly. If you take out the fact that zombies don't exist (plausible deniability again).You take over John Marston's character once again. Without giving away too much of the plot, John feels tasked to finding a cure for the undead walking because of an issue that, once again, hits VERY close to home.They've almost nailed this DLC to perfection. They bring back many of the characters you know and love from RDR and give you extra quests with them. Some \"return\" if you know what I mean, which is cool too. The music takes the RDR music and turns it on its head. Given the sickness present in the world, which infects people and animal alike, it is only right that the music is also infected!What I don't like is the repetitive nature of the DLC. The quests are all well and good, but having to save towns constantly from zombie hordes is a bit tiring. Ammo is supposed to be kind of scarce, but given killing zombies isn't all that difficult, ammo tends to be quite plentiful, especially if you free all the towns whenever they are being over run. The other part I despise is the challenges. You think some of the challenges on the RDR are repetitive, mindless and don't fit well within the world? These are about the same. Sure, one can argue that the challenges help you and fit in the world by granting you more ammo and weapons, but really, it just feels like something added to be able to put the \"20-30 hours more content!\" bullet point on the box. If you ignore the challenges and only do the quests, you're probably looking at about 10-15 hours total, max, for UN.Legends and Killers Pack- adds areas to the multiplayer map, characters and the tomahawk weapon. The tomahawk adds challenges to the single player game, but nothing more for single player. My comment above on the challenges not really adding much stands for this content. IMO this one isn't worth $10 on its own.Liars and Cheats Pack- Adds new multiplayer mode (stronghold) where you defend a place or attack it on teams/posses, horse races in multiplayer, multiplayer Liars Dice and Poker (no Blackjack loving here), more characters, new map locations in multiplayer (plus hunting grounds) and the Explosive Rifle weapon (along with corresponding multiplayer and single player challenges; My comment above on the challenges not really adding much stands for this content.)  Of all of the multiplayer focused DLC, this is the best of the set IMO given how much it adds.Over all UN is a fun game that continues in the spirit of RDR. I'm just not sure it's worth the price of standalone admission given how much you miss out on having not played RDR.Why 4 stars? The single player and multiplayer games are FUN. Even without playing RDR you can have fun w/ either, though I believe having played RDR gives you a better appreciation of the UN game, which is why I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5. As far as buying UN on its own, it really only makes sense if you meet any of the criteria outlined above. If you own RDR and have the drive space for DLC, buy the UN collection pack and get all of this without needing to wait for the disc. For those that own RDR, this is probably a 3 star release.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2010"}

All of these abilities and how you use them can affect your karma affecting not only you game but your character.As you progress through the game, you unlock more powers catered toward your good/evil inclination.The gameplay if fun as you can climb structures, shoot projectiles from your hands, and perform other cool tricks.  Sometimes the gameplay is buggy as you can get stuck in a wall or in the ground sometimes necessitating a reboot of the system.  It is a blast slinging cars, hurling lightning bolts, climbing buildings, and battling  boss characters.  The graphics are good and well detailed although I wish there was a bit more interaction with the environment and some of the missions can be repetitive and annoying.One note as I have seen the other reviews about expired vouchers for the extra stuff and sure enough mine was expired by more than 6 months and I was a bit peeved but I inputted the code and all the downloadable content downloaded just fine with no hiccups.  It will take a while though as there are 13 downloads that will take quite a bit of time to get done.

What I like about Bad Company 2, it sets apart from the other shooter games I experienced, such as the destructive environments and the vehicle usage. The destructive environments is a nice touch, because when you want to shoot a member from the opposing team and he's hiding behind a tree, house or a brick wall you can throw a grenade, rocket launcher, or any other explosive to expose him to your teammates or take him out yourself. As for the vehicles, there are 15 different types of vehicles in total to choose from and it feels great when you can hop into one and drive it around. For example, you can drive a M3A3 Bradley tank or fly AN-64 Apache helicopter to take out the opposing team members.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2010"}

You aren't going to find anything truly groundbreaking about this game's control, outside of the ability to erase set pieces with thinner or reconstruct them with paint. Not only is the platforming a bit too familiar, but this game also has the burden of being one of those titles where you can truly say that the toughest enemy you'll face is the camera. I really didn't believe it would be as frustrating as some reviewers have already attested to, but it is.Now, I'm sure you're thinking to yourself, \"These are big complaints. How did this guy still end up giving this game 4 stars?\" Well, the easy answer is to say that there is a level of charm and nostalgia present around every turn of Epic Mickey that is unmatched in most games. The art and the story line really put you back in touch with the roots of the Disney franchise. And the game never ceased to negate my frustrations with something amazing and wondrous to look at or watch. Sometimes I'd find myself wishing that this had been released on a system with a stronger graphics processor, but it is still a thing of beauty to behold.The 2d platforming parts were something I found to be extremely enjoyable; not only because they offered a break from the 3d camera issues, but also because they made you feel like you were actually toying around in a Walt Disney cartoon more than most other parts of the game. They provided the game with a mesmerizing factor that reminded me that I wasn't playing the game in hopes of finding airtight controls; I was playing it because of the characters found in the game.All in all, this game could be better. Fixing the camera would likely have made this a 5 star game for the majority of people who will end up playing it. If I could, I would give this title 3.5 stars. If you're looking for a phenomenal experience with regard to control mechanics, then turn to Toy Story 3. But if the idea of early Disney cartoons and characters gives you even the smallest of warm fuzzies, then I highly recommend experiencing this game. Just don't go into it expecting a groundbreaking platformer and you should enjoy the experience. For if you stripped the Disney charm from this game, it would only be a 3 star experience. But believe me when I tell you that the fact that there IS so much Disney in this game, made it next to impossible to put down.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2011"}

After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?), it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well-crafted sound effects succeeded at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth... ethereal Revenants fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy... a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll often find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might easily be solved by duct-taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.Looking GoodDoom 3looks incredible. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. The eye candy does come at a price, though, and we were forced to play at fairly low resolution even on a Pentium IV 2.8 GHz and an ATI Radeon 9500. Even so, gameplay was smooth as silk. For higher resolutions (1024 x 768 and above) the latest generation of ATI or Nvidia cards is suggested.--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessRich variety of enemiesPlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineStiff system requirementsNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multiplayer options","reviewerName":"Ryan H.","summary":"One of the greatest Horror FPS's out there","reviewText":"Your are a marine sent to Mars to investigate the strange occurances in the labs as well as in Mars City.  Lights have been going out for no reason, people have heard whispers when nobody's been around, more cases of insanity have occured, and people are leaving more often for unusual reasons.  From the beginning, you know something is not right, but you're trained for this.  After you delve deeper into the truth though, you soon find that this might be bigger than just disappearances.  Once you find one of the people the base shakes and a portal to Hell is opened up.  While in this chaos a strange fiery skull jumps into the scientist you have been sent to secure and he becomes a strange monster similar to a zombie.This is when your comfort zone sinks to the bottom of the scale.  You are thrown into a dark world that seems to have no end.  Most of the hallways are barely lit forcing you to pull out your trusty flashlight.  But this isn't Halo, so you must either hold out your weapon or keep your flashlight out.  You can attack with your flashlight, I just don't recommend it unless you are low on ammo.  Speaking of which, ammo can run out quickly in this entry but you can always score some more if you pick up other people's PDA's.  Finding them can be kind of hard sometimes though, because of the poor lighting in some of the rooms.The gameplay is pretty solid though, most of your mission are just move from point A to point B while trying to survive.  Sometimes, doors will be locked and you wil have to find a key or somebody's PDA to access the lock.  The enemies are extremely creepy.  The zombies hide very well but the demons in this game can be warped to your location.Some of the eerie effects of this game are not B-grade either (well maybe once but that wasn't a huge one).  Sometimes a well lit room will lose the lights (including your flashlight) and then reapper will monsters around.  Others include creepy visions where things are not right with the inclusion of voices in the background, quiet voices.  But the absolute creepy one has to be the living landscapes similar to those seen in the Silent Hill games.  You'll enter a room and things seem to be alive, add to the fact you can sometimes see corpses of men talking to you with ripped out insides.You will love this game if you love FPS or are fans of the series in general.  Keep in mind though that this is not the same game as the first two in the fact that enemies do not swarm you or respawn constantly.Pros- Great Storyline, a first real in-depth storyline- Creepy lighting effects- The eerie things that can happen to you such as the lights going out and hearing voices- The enemies are done wonderfully- The survival horror aspect where you must conserve ammo- Awesome graphics- The ability to play online co-op, which is exclusive to the Xbox gameCons- The graphics are not as good as those on the PC- Its easy to get lost in the complex due to identical rooms","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2005"}
{"product_name":"B0001XMA6I","reviewerName":"JD","summary":"Lots of fun but not enough finishing touches","reviewText":"Overall, this game is a lot of fun (for a First-person-shooter) and I found myself playing it a lot, but it is not without its flaws.  Some are simple graphics glitches (missing shots, paper walls, etc) but some of the others are more frustrating, primarily the horrible, horrible AI and the fact that the Install is the worst I have ever seen.  The pro's do make up for the con's if you can actually get the game to install, but I would't spend $50 on this title - not in its current state.The GOOD:- There is a good assortment of player types to play (sniper, assault, demolitions [rocket launcher], jet-pack, etc) on many different teams (Droids, Rebellion, Imperial, Gungan, Ewok and Wookie, although they are not always available to the player.- Each player type has its own unique weapons with their own charachteristics, sounds, model and functionality.- Each map is large enough to be accomadating, but the spawn locations aren't always the best, and they aren't large enough to make good use of air units.- The maps are unique, some with rain, some with wind, some desert, some ice, some day and some night, each one exciting.- The maps are semi-detailed, enough so to add to the flavor, but simple enough to be easy on graphics cards and to avoid any confusion (you won't find yourself getting lost).- You have active radar constantly that shows your controlled points, and some enemy/allies movements, but not all.The BAD:- The game lacks that polished feeling we've come to expect, simply put, there are too many inconsitencies and glitches for a final product, especially given its price.- As others have mentioned, the weapons seem to lack accuracy at times, as well as lacking substance (but then again, we are talking lasers here, not chunks of lead propelled by explosions of gunfire).- The Sniper rifle is not powerful enough, especially the fact that a headshot doesn't do more damage than a torso shot - or a toe shot for that matter.  The splash damage from a rocket launcher is also non-existant.  On the same note, there is no loss of accuracy over range which is a good thing in game terms but hurts realism.- The game is practically a commerical mod for BF1942 so shouldn't be so expensive.- Felt dated as soon as it hit the shelves - not up to par.- There are some moments when the pull on your system resources (primarily video) isn't justified by what you are seeing on the screen - the graphics aren't as good as they should be.The UGLY:- Installing this game is a nightmare.  I'm still having problems and several other reviewers as well.  If you read the online forums you will note that a lot of professional reviewers have also experienced installation hang ups.  Honestly, if the headline reviewers aren't getting working copies it doesn't say much for the software.  In my case, one machine installed flawlessly, but the install was horribly slow - longer than Doom 3 and longer even than UT2004.  On a second machine (similiar in design to the first) the CD's aren't recognizeable (in either drive, one a burner, one a basic CD) and I either get read/write errors or fatal errors that terminate setup and ultimately crash the drive and the computer.  However, if I install from the same disks on other computers I can get them to install 4 out of 5 times.- The AI is absolutely some of the worst I have seen.  The enemy AI isn't good, but that of your allies is lousy and works to your detriment.  In fact, if you could keep your allies from spawning, you would find the game that much easier going it alone.  Your allies will blow themselves up with grenades and will blow you up with grenades - a lot! They will shoot you in the back and also jump out in front of you when you are firing - a lot! They will assault Droidekas with their shields up and die by the scores.  It never seems to dawn on them that blasters won't penetrate the shields of the droideka or the armor of the vehicles, but they keep trying until they have run you out of spawns.  Your allies will assault vehicles and turrets with their blasters and give no thought to cover, retreat, flanking or anything save frontal assaults.  They will stand under your own vehicles, forcing you to crush them if you want to move, and they will not man the extra guns in the vehilces if you are the pilot.  When I took over command of a drop ship for example, I even had two gunners on the sides but they never opened fire that I could see...why not?  They employee no strategy whatsover - rush and die, spawn, rush and die again.  Occasionally, they will wait to form a group of 6 or 8, but then they simply run in front of a turret or the enemy throws a grenade in the middle and they ALL die and you are down that many spawns.In closing, if you can get the game to install (and that is a scary \"if\") you will find it frustrating, less than fulfilling, but ultimately fun in its simplicity.  The game is especially recommended to Star Wars enthusiats (though they may inevitably question some of the finer details of the game, such as the sound of the blasters).  However, I would NOT pay retail for this product, and I feel it should not have retailed for as much in the first place.  I hear the Xbox version is better, so if you have a choice, I might recommend you go that route instead.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2004"}

I think this should answer your question unless what you wanted to know was ... never mind. It's not appropriate for this website.Sure, I like pinball, and yes, I like at Super Metroid and Metroid ZERO Misson. I also like red salsa and ice cream, but I wouldn't pour salsa over my ice cream. Do you see what I'm getting at?Granted, this game is fun. Why else would I give it four stars? It's got the look and feel of a pinball game, it rumbles with the black GBA-looking cart that comes with it, and you can even tilt the table by touching the screen.One of the main problems I have with this game is a problem that cannot be helped. Well, it could be helped, but it would reduce the realism of a pinball board. Since Nintendo wanted a long board without having to scroll, the top screen shows the upper half of the board, while the bottom screen shows the lower half. That leaves a small invisible space between the two screens that is there but is never seen. It's not a big problem, but it can sometimes leave you with blind spots when you're trying to aim in shoot mode.There is another problem with the game that also can't be helped unless you have big hands. Otherwise, learn the value of your pinky fingers for now is when you need them the most. They'll support the bottom of the DS while your index fingers press the shoulder buttons. Or you could just press two of the face buttons, but what fun is that?My third problem with the game is that I don't like having to deal with attacking enemies while I try to stay on the board. That's what I meant by two good things not really being great together.This is still a Metroid game, however, and most people wouldn't bother with it if it didn't have the extra spice. I wouldn't change a thing. On the other hand, I wouldn't develope a pinball game with a theme from an action game either.If TetrisPhere didn't turn you off, neither should this.Like I said, this is not a bad game. I did buy this game ... sort of. I chose it as the free game at an offer from a store. It's not perfect, but it's good enough to buy, especially with the included rumble pak.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2006"}

I was really looking forward to playing this modernized edition, but it has unfortunately fallen well short of my hopes. This is a game that requires VERY precise platforming skills. Normally, I would embrace this challenge, but Nintendo decided they wanted to implement some goofy motion controls into the schematics, thereby ruining the experience. Even while playing with classic controller setup, a brief movement of the wiimote will accidentally send DK into a roll... right off the edge of that platform. Even in the 90s, I never experienced such poor platforming controls.Please note that this an Amazon Verified Purchase... I tried my best to enjoy this game, but I just can't do it. Playing it only makes me want to return to the super tight controls of Rayman Origins, which has this game whipped in every conceivable category. You can't expect every game to be as good as Rayman Origins (especially since it came out one year later), but the difference in quality is downright staggering.On the plus side, this game has very good art design.

{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"steve","summary":"Playstation 4 - a great console without great games","reviewText":"Ever since the Playstation 4 was unveiled at E3 2013, I had been anticipating it to bring about a new era of gaming that promised to display amazing graphics and truly-engrossing games that would be cherished as treasures by the gaming community.  I myself did not really know, though, what to expect when I finally purchased a Playstation 4 in April of this year.  So, for all of you that are undecided, contemplating trading your Playstation 3 for the next-generation system or, jumping from camp xbox to camp sony, I will do my best to give a comprehensive review of the system and everything it offers.The outside of the system is nice to look at but not really a game changer.  It is solid and sturdy, and decent in construction.  A couple of times I have had to unplug and re-plug in my hdmi cord in back due to lack of sound while my system is on - not sure if this is an internal or external issue.  Also, the power-on and eject buttons are recessed and do not always respond when pressed - again, not sure if this is an internal (connection) issue or an external (design) issue.When you power up the system, the background music that plays is ambience (I think) and is peaceful and calming.  However, much to my dismay, it cannot be changed, just turned off.  In fact, there is much you cannot do on your PS4 that you can on your PS3.  For example, you can't change your avatar from the PS4 - you have to do it on your PS3.  Also, you cannot listen to external music or watch movies off an external hard drive on your PS4 (no way that I have discovered yet, anyway), and you cannot change the background/desktop, so to speak, as you could on the PS4.The controller is unique and is, IMO, a better controller than the PS3 controller for size and comfort.  Word of advice though, buy protectors for the joysticks, as several friends of mine have complained about the rubber coming off of the joysticks after heated sessions of Battlefield 4 mp.It also has a slew of apps, from crunchroll for anime fans to netflix, wwe tv (whatever its called), IGN, etc.  They are all easy to download and access.  Also, the setup of the main menu is side-scroll just as before, and is pretty easy to navigate.  Another plus, for those who like independent games, is that there are many of them already released that are quite good, like Dead Nation 2 (whatever the official name for it is) and Resogun, among others.  However, if you're not all that impressed by independent games that, quite honestly, are good for passing half an hour, at most, then you may not care about the plethora of indies offered (and proudly touted) by Playstation on the PS4.  Now for the bad news.With the Sony Playstation 3, third party developers were quite vocal with the plethora of titles available shortly after release for the latest entry in the gaming market.  Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, God of War III, Little Big Planet, Motor Storm, Resistance: Fall of Man, Infamous and Killzone 2 were all big titles that helped the Playstation 3 to survive and to thrive.  The Playstation 4 has not excelled in this department, thus far.  Killzone: Shadow Fall and Infamous: Second Son were both released to much fanfare and were good, but by no means capable of holding people's attention for more than a couple of play-throughs.  Driveclub was delayed almost a year, while The Order:1886 is in development and grows less impressive with time.While the console itself is capable of bringing greatness to this next generation of gaming, the lack of high-quality first-party games is disheartening, to say the least.So, here  are my ratings for a few separate categories:Design: 5 out of 5Functionality: 5 out of 5User Interface and Ease of Use: 4 out of 5 (because of the Avatar and background issues mentioned above)Sound during use and games: 5 out of 5 - clean, crisp, and perfectDisplay during use and games: 5 out of 5 - the best you can get right nowLibrary of games: 4 out of 5 - props for the tons of indies, but the lack of first-party games in troublingSummary: While the Sony Playstation 4 is a technical marvel of modern gaming, its limited library is a reason for pause.  Unless you have played all the great games that your PS3/Xbox 360 have available at this time and need a new system to alleviate your boredom, just hold off until more substantial titles arrive (like next year).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2014"}

This was one of those early games that actually made multiplayer worth playing over and over again. It was very addictive and I continued to play it on and off until Starcraft 2 came out. Just to let you understand how valuable Starcraft 2 is, I was a late beta tester, a few months before release, now fast forward four years later, I am still playing it almost on a daily basis! Obviously my computer can now support this game at maximum settings with fast FPS. Over the years, I have seen Blizzard fine tune this game like no other games out there, ever getting so close to complete perfection. That's no surprise, this game has the highest standards out there, people are playing it professionally as a career and even casting the game professionally as a career. Although the game does have story-mode, Battle.net is the REAL focus of this game. All the units are carefully selected, tuned, and balanced by Blizzard. The units are all useful when making strategically decisions. I have seen Blizzard adding and removing units and abilities many times. All units have special characteristics that the players should master. This game is not about building up or earning something, you get good at this game from developing your own ability to play it. Players compete by their ability to control the game, make clever decisions, and outsmart each other. The graphics and animations are top-notice even for today's standards. Not only are the animations and visuals pleasing to look at, but they are artistically thought out with many attentions to small details. The artistic appeal will make SC2's visuals outlast all games that will come after it. Watch a flock of winged-zergling running across the map, or a fleet of carriers and tempest and you'll feel that swarm of bugs, or the endgame army. Honestly, I think the story-mode is a very small part SC2, but there is something for everyone. If you don't like to compete, you can play coop by vs. computer with other players or play custom maps. The gameplay is what keeps this game going so long. Every match I ever played feels different from the next. If you don't own this game, you can watch the casting videos, and there are thousands on Youtube, granted, you'll be more entertain if you play competitively, but it's always fun to watch the pros, and use their strategy against your next opponent. Obviously, I highly recommend this game + the expansions. It's a very VERY small price to pay for so many years of entertainment.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2014"}

The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

It's a fun game featuring Luigi who rarely gets the credit he deserves but it's just not hard enough.  If it took longer to beat or if it were as fun and innovative as the Zelda or Mario series, I might want to play this more.  The main reason I got sick of this game is that the whole thing takes place in the manshion, there really is no worlds or temples.  Really, it's not as good because it doesn't take that long to explore the whole place.  In all, this game is more worth renting once or twice until you beat it then buying it.

This in many ways is better than killing humans, or killing monsters. There isn't really much blood, but instead sparks. The Japanese don't seem to have the bloodlust that Americans do.The weapons aren't realistic. They aren't modeled after real weapons, probably because it is hard to actually get your hands on a real gun in Japan. But whatever. They work well enough in the context.What makes this shooter game unique are the characters. They are very personable characters. They are not stupid-serious or stupid-masculine. There is none of the absurd worship of military rank you see in so many games. They also talk to you, and expect responses. This is new. It is fun, even if the voice recognition leaves a lot to be desired. You can yell commands to them and you can respond to their jokes. Yes, they tell jokes. They ask your opinion. These are real conversations that matter. They get annoyed at you if they perceive your answer and condescending! This actually has one of the most realistic simulations of human group dynamics that I've ever seen in a game. I'd actually like to play a game that had these characters, minus the shooting part.because the shooting part isn't that good. It feels bouncy. The graphics look at times like dreamcast graphics. Technically, it's not entirely up there.Additionally, the game setting is Japan. This is a unique setting not seen in many shooters, which are in some post-apocalyptic futuristic somewhere. The game is futuristic, but all the same the setting feels noticably different than most western games.I have no idea what the story is. It is probably stupid.Overall, the simulation of group dynamics and the realism of conversation is what makes this game noteworthy and worth checking out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2012"}

Well, I don't know if I've ever played a stand-alone game (i.e. not an MMORPG) that made me want to explore such a vast beautifully rendered fantasy world.  Morrowind is one of those games that you'll never fully appreciate if you don't have a top of the line video card, a large monitor and some nice speakers or headphones.  It truly does capture your imagination and throw you head first into the world you're exploring.  It's also one of the least linear RPG's I've ever played.  There were hundreds of quests and I didn't have to do anything in a specific order.  I could become a dastardly criminal, a chivalrous knight, and then suddenly change my occupation to a mysterious mage.  Except for a few game essential characters, I could kill anyone and steal anything.  Not that I wanted to, but that's just to give you an idea of how much is possible in this game. If I could compare Morrowind to anything it would be an offline version of Everquest because the vast amounts of land and people in this game almost feel like an MMORPG.  Morrowind has it's own system of rules and leveling and that would be one of my few complaints, leveling is too darn easy in this game.  It's very easy to obtain a &quot;god level&quot; in no time at all. Also, while there are hundreds and hundreds of quests and NPC's, sometimes there isn't enough variety to keep your interest.  But the Game of the Year edition comes with both expansions so that should help ease some of the problems that inflicted gamers who only played the original game.  The first expansion, Tribunal, takes place in a large city and is heavy on NPC interaction while the other expansion, Bloodmoon, gives you another world to explore that focuses on werewolves.  Morrowind is one of those love-hate games.  Gamers either love it to the end or end up hating it for some of the reasons I mentioned above.  Whatever your final opinion of the game is, you will definitely be hooked for at least two or three weeks.  Morrowind is a truly ambitious RPG and brings new life to this once popular but declining genre.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2004"}

But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away.

{"product_name":"B00D41GCVS","description":"Sonic moves like never before. Vault over obstacles, free run up and along walls and sky dive between islands at lightning speed. Plus the Spin Dash is back.","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Blue Blurred","reviewText":"By all accounts, I'm what could be considered a \"Sonic fanboy.\" Even some of the character's worst outings have managed to keep my interest, and I still faithfully buy the new entries in the venerable series within a week of their launch, if not the very same day. Sure, it's made for some terrible purchases, such as the abysmal \"Secret Rings\", \"The Black Knight\" and (dare I speak its name) \"Shadow The Hedgehog.\" But it's also resulted in some of my favorite games of the last few generations, such as \"Colors\", \"Generations\", and \"Adventure\" 1&2, not to mention the plethora of wonderful handheld games. But it often feels that I'm in a minority, given that a lot of mainstream critics constantly ask for Sega to reinvent its mascot, which results each new game attempting some dramatic shift that either works or falls flat.As a result, the Sonic franchise comes across as having a bit of an identity crisis, trying very hard to remain relevant in the ever-shifting landscape of electronic entertainment. And while most games fall on one side of the spectrum or the other, the blue blur's latest escapade lays bare every single problem his series has, while at the same time offering glimpses of a solution that are woefully underutilized. \"Sonic Lost World\" is a game that tries on several pairs of shoes, but only about half of them fit. But when they fit, they do so perfectly.So, in the obligatory narrative, we see Sonic and Tails, along with welcome additions Knuckles and Amy, discovering a lost world consisting of floating landmasses. They're chasing Robotn-... erm, Eggman, as he has once again captured fuzzy little animals and shoved them in capsules. This time, however, the arch-villain has a race of mysterious demons on his side known only as \"The Deadly Six.\" And once Sonic eliminates the method he's using to control these enemies, they turn on both of them and attempt to suck the life out of this mysterious world. So, begrudgingly, the two old rivals team up (sort of) and try to stop these menacing foes before everything around them becomes, to quote Amy, \"cold and dead.\"Now, the fact that Amy, the cutesy heroine of the series, would use such a phrase in this game should indicate the type of dialogue Sonic Team has opted for this time around. While the story is not particularly complex or nuanced, the character interactions holding it together are truly something special... albeit a bit darker than what we expect from Sega's flagship series. There are sharp, funny exchanges that would not be out of place in a PG-13 movie, delivered by some excellent voice actors that show full commitment to their roles. Extra props should go to the voicework and writing of The Deadly Six, who often deliver very menacing threats. The first enemy you face says such charming things as \"I'll skin you alive\" or \"you're going home in a box\", and while it rarely gets more violent than that, this tone of pure villainy is something new for the franchise, and a welcome change of pace. The story isn't great, but with dialogue this entertaining, one almost doesn't care. Unfortunately, the plot is the least of this game's worries.In Sega's attempts to address every concern ever brought up about the franchise, the gameplay in \"Lost World\" is an often disappointing hodge-podge of different genres. When it works, it does so swimmingly. There are some levels in \"Lost World\" that are truly some of my favorite in the franchise, such as an exhilarating grind-rail roller coaster through a water vortex, a vertical descent through a floating forest and a blistering run through coastal scenery that ends with Sonic bounding from clouds hundreds of feet above ground. However, these stand in stark contrast to levels that are, quite frankly, derivative and unbearable. Guiding giant pieces of fruit into a blender to make surfable juice paths, trudging poorly-designed and out-of-place level themed around candy, and slogging down a tunnel that frustrating has patches of molasses-like goop that you can't speed through or jump over are insufferable experiences that threaten to completely undo whatever fun you might have been having.This inconsistency carries over to the styles of gameplay Sonic team tried to tackle, and more often than not, failed pretty terribly. Aside from the 3D speeding and 2D platforming, you'll be awkward pacing through isometric levels, jumping slowly from floating platform to floating platform, and other things that feel brutally out of place in a Sonic game. What's worse is that these horrible segments are often in the middle of levels that are otherwise great, jerking you out of one gameplay style right into one that is tedious and frustratingly controlled. The final nail in the coffin of these segments is that they unabashedly steal from other, better games, ironically ones that are made by Nintendo. Running on spherical surfaces a la \"Super Mario Galaxy\", dodging mine carts and shooting from hidden barrels like \"Donkey Kong Country\", and other parts are sprinkled liberally into this game. It's disappointing, really, because it feels like Sonic Team didn't have enough confidence in the character to allow him to do his own thing. The end result is a 3D platforming game that feels as if Sonic just happens to be the star, as opposed to being a genuine Sonic experience.The fact that this is the case is especially upsetting considering that Sonic actually controls better than he ever has in 3D. No more floating and no more steering like car; the hedgehog moves with the utmost precision as far as moving the analogue stick goes. However, the same cannot be said for his speed and \"parkour.\" Sonic will confusingly slow down and speed up, to the point where it often felt like it was totally out of my control when I was jumping or trying to run through levels. Again, it comes across as the developer taking too much criticism from too many sources into consideration, and meeting in a very uncomfortable middling zone. As much as some levels bring back good memories of the \"Adventure\" franchise, others bring back nightmarish flashbacks to the tawdry \"Labyrinth\" and \"3D Blast\" days, which is some of the worst criticism that could be stooped upon a game. Not only that, but the much-hyped \"parkour\" is nothing special, instead allowing Sonic moves and abilities that should come standard with pretty much every 3D platforming character, albeit a bit sloppier. Sonic Team should not be touting the fact that Sonic controls properly when trying to come up with marketable bullet points, because honestly, when I buy a game, I expect it to control properly.Finally, two parts of the game are some of the worst mechanics in any Sonic game ever created. Firstly, the boss fights are simply terrible. In concept, many of them are very interesting, but they are marred by a slow pace and unclear hit boxes on the enemies. Not only that, but there seems to be no rhyme nor reason to how much damage any given boss can take, and coupled with their sluggish timing, they become thoroughly terrible experiences. Secondly, in a throwback to \"Sonic Unleashed\" that nobody asked for, players are forced to collect a certain amount of trinkets to progress. In this case, they're animals, and you get them by finding capsules, killing enemies, and beating levels. The only problem? Well, the levels that have the most animals in them are usually the least fun to play, and thus, you'll find yourself slogging through bad levels in order to play more of the game. \"Colors\" and \"Generations\" managed to make trinket-collecting more or less optional, and its return here is a complete buzzkill. Also, as an aside, the Wisp powers from \"Colors\" return here, and they feel awkward and out of place as all get-out. Most of them control with the elegance and grace of an ice-skating rhinoceros, and also manage to derail the fun.At least the game looks pretty good. Well,for the most part. Most levels are bright and vibrant, and certainly make the most out of the WiiU's capabilities. Character models are beautiful, as is most of the scenery. That being said, a lot of the darker levels feel dull and uninspired, filled with the grey-and-brown color scheme that haunts far too many modern games. It's even worse when these poorly-designed parts are in the same level that houses some excellent scenery, once again adding to a brutally inconsistent tone to the whole experience. However, it's really not all bad, and mostly, the variety of levels and fluidity of the motion make for a fairly nice-looking package. Also, the pre-rendered cutscenes are pretty fantastic.As usual with the lesser Sonic entries, though, the real star of the show is the exceptional soundtrack. From coastal grooves to fast synths, from sitars to electric guitars, the musical variety here is simply wonderful. Oftentimes, a boring level would lead to me doing poorly because I was paying more attention to the soundtrack than actually playing the game. That being said, many levels suffer from BGM that is unoriginal (desert levels sound like desert levels, etc), which brings it down somewhat. However, the voice work is undoubtedly the best in any Sonic game. Sometimes, interactions between Sonic and his pals can be frustrating and grating on the ears, but here, it's fast, furious and witty. That's partially thanks to the aforementioned writing, but also due to the fantastic cast that's been with us since \"Colors.\" If this game were being judged solely on audio merits, it would receive high marks. It's not, of course, but if it was, it would.And maybe that's what Sonic Team was hoping for: that players would focus on the technical prowess on display here, and not the fundamentally broken center at the very core of the game. Unfortunately, I can't be that kind. While some of what's on display here reminds us why we still give these games a chance, a lot of the chaff is absolutely inexcusable. By listening too much to the suggestions of others, the developers have marred what could have been an absolutely superb game. And while it's still worth playing if you want to see some of the best this series can offer, you have to be prepared to work for your fun.\"Sonic Lost World\" is an indictment of the franchise as a whole. It's fantastic at points, but ultimately, it has no real idea what it wants to be, which results in a game that is almost as equally frustrating as it is fun. That being said, if you can forgive its flaws (which are many), it can be a truly fun and lovable game that offers some insight into where Sonic Team should go with future entries.Plot: 7Gameplay: 5Graphics: 7Sound: 8Overall:  6UPDATE (11/4/13): After much thought, and much continuing into the game, and reflection, I felt it necessary to drop my score a point. It simply does not get better as it goes on, and becomes a deeply frustrating experience that I cannot, in all fairness, wholeheartedly recommend. More downvotes are inevitable, as people seem to not respect opinions that differ from their own, despite how well-defended they might be. So be it, though. This is not a very good game to me, and that is a stance I will staunchly defend.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0002CHJ3M","reviewerName":"sporkdude \"sporkdude\"","summary":"Good, but pales in comparison to Sands of Time.","reviewText":"Prince of Persia, the Sands of Time was a unique and revolutionary game that relied on intuitive and slow paced gameplay with increased emphasis on thoughts and visuals as opposed to button twitching action.  This game, the sequel, moves the game more towards the ordinary action, cliched video game, with increased annoyances from large fights, backtracking, and bosses.  Original games shouldn't move back towards the standard, formulaic game, but unfortunately, this does.The first thing everyone is probably wondering is how different is this from the Sands of Time?  Well, the puzzles, the intuitive and graceful controls and the fun movements are all there.  Many of the same elements of gameplay still exist.  Just getting from point A to point B in a large room with pillars, ledges, running on walls, swing on ropes, sliding down drapes, it's all there.  Still the same reliance on thinking, visuals.  In fact, there is actual improvement.  The last game had jumps that were questionable and jumps were made blindly.  This game has eliminated much of that.  Other improvements include the fact that you traverse the same palace within two different time periods, meaning that the same rooms will have different traps or different lighting.  A very interesting and unique concept.The other changes are more dramatic.  The videos and styles are a little darker, they've added chase scenes, and most drastic of all, they changed the fighting system and added a lot more fighting.First off, the videos, audio, and visuals of the enemies are of a slightly darker nature, which is pretty much the only reason why it's a mature rating.  It's worth noting that they fixed the sound problems from SOT and added subtitles.  They changed some of the music.  While still ambient, fighting scenes switch to guitar riffs from Godsmack (I think).  While I like Godsmack and I own a few albums of theirs, the guitar music is annoying and does not fit well in this game.  The story is decent, and CGI is pretty good though.  Unfortunately, I have no idea why they made it rated mature.  Just removing a few lines, and removing the blood, and making small changes would make this rated T or E.  It's pretty pathetic when a video game feels it needs to add sexual connotations and needless blood just to increase sales.  All it does is embarrass anyone who sees the game (polygon half-naked woman are just lame) and alienates a large group of players.Secondly, they added more time-based schemes, most notably, chase scenes.  Basically, a monster comes in and chases you and you have a limited amount of time to move from one room to another.  Now, unfortunately, this does not work.  The main reason is that the camera angles switch so often that orienting yourself takes a second, a second you cannot spare.  What's worse is that sometimes the cutscenes themselves ruin the momentum and cause you to lose you life.  The chase scenes are basically just a sequence of run to room, get caught, start the scene over, run to the next room, get caught, repeat.  Just boring, iterative, and badly designed.  What's worse is that some controls, noticeably swinging on ropes are poles, are not intuitive when timing is concerned.Thirdly, there are also other cliched things that just annoyed me.  Backtracking is slightly annoying, but the lack of balance is huge.  The backtracking means that you'll actually go through many of the same rooms a few times.  One time I got really lost and had to refer to a walkthrough in order to get my bearings straight.  It didn't help that the map is absolutely useless, and it's one big picture with two markers.  Not too fun, and a large step backwards in gaming in my opinion.  When I say lack of balance, I talk about the distribution of save points and life regeneration points.  To reach one point will be dirt easy, then next would require tons of enemies, tons of timed jumps, and a chase scene, which would sometimes takes forever.  Also of note is the fact that life upgrades are harder to find.  If you want the \"good\" ending, you've got to get all the life upgrades.  This either requires you to get lucky (good luck with that), follow a walkthrough, which isn't fun, or backtrack a lot and do a lot of random searching.  Either way, it's boring and I didn't even bother.Fourthly, and most obvious is the \"free form fighting system\".  This is another name for superfluous and unneeded combos.  While the first game had enemies that were easy to kill with a few moves, this game is a bit more complicated.  It'll take some time to figure out the way to kill an enemy, but once you do, it's pretty much the same repetitive motions over and over again, just more buttons.  Unlike the first game, the enemies are not a minor annoyance, but a huge annoyance.  There are so many that just to traverse between save points requires you to kill tons of the same enemies for no reason.  Many times you can pass by them, but a flaw in the system means that the prince will be in combat mode when an enemy is close by.  This means that many of the Prince's moves are not available until you kill the enemies, even though there is no need to kill them in order to move on.  Sometimes, especially near the end, enemies just keep coming up.  They are relatively easy to kill, but you might mess up once in a while.  This is fine, except when there are about twenty enemies to kill, and all it takes is a few snafus ups to die, meaning that killing the enemies is very meticulous, but very, very monotonous.  It's just the height of tedium and time wasting.  The bosses are also an unneeded clich&eacute;.  For example, the last enemy takes almost a half an hour to kill.  I encountered a bug when I was about twenty minutes into the last boss, which required me to restart the fight.  Talk about boring.Finally, there are some huge glitches.  One caused me to lose about twenty minutes or work, and another would have forced me to restart if I didn't keep multiple save games on my memory cards.  Two huge bugs discovered in my first try.  Talk about a rushed game.All in all, it's a pretty good game, but a little too much like every other game out there.  A bad direction for the series, but it still has a bit of the Sands of Time magic to make it very enjoyable.Pros:Incredible atmosphereControls are still pretty intuitive for the puzzlesGreat concept of travelling the same Palace in two different timesGood VideosNo walkthrough or guide needed for most of the gameCons:Repetitive, dull, and an unnecessary large amount of fightingCameras angles still lacking, especially during timed actionUnbalanced gameNeedless backtrackingNeedless Mature rating.Useless MapHuge glitchesGuitar Riffs don't work wellTime to complete: 20 hoursDifficulty level: Medium/Low (on Easy)Frustration level: Medium","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2004"}

You have to slog through a lot of worlds, and then a second time, but the end finally gets more pertinent story elements in. I believe Kingdom Hearts 1 is a 5, and this one is a 4 (with a 3 star in fun factor), simple as that.I've played Kingdom Hearts 1, wrote a review, and I just don't feel the same way about this game as I do KH1. The combat is even more auto-pilot than the first where you use the triangle button a lot and just spam X. In the first 25 hours of the game I don't think I used one item or Cure spell. I've used magic in maybe a handful of situations,as it isn't that useful for regular enemies. Limits and Drives were alright, although confusing at first of how to properly use them, but further make combat way too easy. Also I never once used Summons. The story is really hard to follow because you go around to a bunch of different places that feel like side missions. I wouldn't expect someone to follow the story if they didn't play large chunks of the game at a time. Chain of memories helped make some sense of things at times. I have a full time job and a wife so I play maybe 1-3 hours every other day and its hard to remember what the heck is going on. \"Going to another world to close a Keyhole I guess?\" While fun at first, it gets old pretty fast. I'm pretty much just playing it to see what happens in the story and then I'm going to move onto the handheld games (358/2 days, Birth by Sleep, and Re:Coded) and never look back at this one.

I've completed a vareity of missions and I have to say that they're exciting aswell as fun however some tend to be quite short. Nevetheless, Driver3 doesn't lose it's charm. Secondly, the soundtrack is great with nice beats which change from scenario to scenario, for example where there is a car chase in progress expect the music to be loud and vice versa. Cineamtics add to the deep storyline and occur after every mission, so expect many!Concerning the graphics, Driver3 loses a star. The graphics don't fully utilise the Playstation2's capabilities and sometimes it may feel that you're playing Driver3 on the Playstation instead of the PS2. Nevertheless, the cinematics are very realistic and car damage is as real as you can expect; tire's bursting, debris flying around(I actually took a sedan underneath a parked truck and made it into a convertable!)and real world physics.In conlusion Driver3 may feel like Dejavu; been there, done that.

You go forward, you kill the same handful of enemies (sometimes with a different color) and you move on.  Most 2x4's have a more stimulating plotline than this game.It's pretty obvious that the multiplayer is (supposed to be) where it's at in this game.  Unfortunately, it's fairly unrobust.

The maps are shoddy and poorly designed and with little variety between them.Now, all of that might be forgiveable if the game was at least fun to play.  Unfortunately, this game has what could possibly be thought of as the worst control scheme ever invented by a man.  You use the stylus similar to how you might use a mouse in a traditional PC FPS.

I have yet to discover a way of handling this game that doesn't result in wrist or finger pain after about 30 minutes of use, but fortunately I rarely play that long before I turn it off in disgust.I can't really think of very many merits this game has.  Its boring, poorly designed, unbalanced for multiplayer (and has a number of level design glitches as well).  It's unfun to downright painful to play.  I guess it has fairly good graphics for the DS, but that's really about it.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2007"}

But that happiness didn't last long, the PS4 HDMI port was no good. If you know Kotaku gaming news group had HDMI problems as well but my PS4 problem want beyond that to were the system didn't want to enter safe mode at all. I try everything you could do but nothing work. Console had blinking blue light as well when trying to enter safe mode and that safe mode sound never beep twice only turn off the console.I wanted to have blast with the PS4 like anyone else who want out to pre-order the PS4, there is no reason why console shouldn't work at all. Every console should have been tested before shipping start and made sure nothing was wrong with them. So Amazon can only offer me refund and return of the shipment using UPS ground to send the console back. It's not Sony or Amazon fault but the manufacture who puts the console together for overlooking bad parts to the hardware and its back ports not working. I'm not the only person who got bad unit but it would be good to make sure to have back-up's in case some unit turn out not working at all like my PS4.From now on i'm never going to buy console on its first day unless i know for 100% that it has been test before shipping to me. I'm buying from store i see in person not online anymore and i'll be sharing video about this unit not working as well once i get my hands on working PS4 later on my YouTube.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2013"}

Stathoulopoulos \"nick9155\"","summary":"Rock solid, fun game","reviewText":"This is a pretty solid shoot-em-up from EA, not known for their prowess in this type of game.  Basically, if you love Bond, you'll be into this game.  It's not your traditional modern FPS.  Why?  Well, since Bond movies are traditionally PG or PG-13, the game stays in that mode.  That's one of the few major complaints really.  The movement, the shooting, and the action are all great, but there's not a drop of blood here.  Strictly Bond shoot-em-up style.  Don't expect Red Faction or Half Life-type carnage.  Nevertheless, this game has a very impressive gun selection as well as an extra feature in your other hand: the various Q devices.  These make the game fun and challenging.  Like the films, the game features Bond's amazing cel phone which has a laser, a decoder, an awesome grappling hook called the \"Q-Claw\", etc.At first I thought this game was a bit easy, but you can adjust the difficulty level, and as you make your way through the 12 missions they certainly get harder but not frustrating.A big, big bonus is a great 2-player mode.  Fans of Perfect Dark (made by the same folks that made the incredible Goldeneye) will love it.  There are 3 modes: your basic deathmatch, protect the flag, and anti-terrorist training.  Deathmatch is simple--hunt the other guy down.  In protect the flag one player has to hold on to a flag for a fixed amount of time (say, 2 minutes) in total before the other player does.  But the best has to be anti-terrorist training.  It's deathmatch with a great twist: there are bombs on the board which must be defused.  Get to them before your opponent!  1 point for a player kill, 3 points for a bomb defusal, meaning you're constantly moving and hunting.  For all multi-player modes you get to choose what guns appear on the board, and there are plenty to choose from.  You also determine what power-ups appear, and you can even play with things like gravity, self-inflicted damage, etc.  It's one of the most versatile 2-player modes I've seen yet on PS2.All in all, this is a great game.  Especially if you love Bond.  All of the characters are here, and even though the real actors and actresses don't play them, they're close enough.  (The Bond in the cinema screens here looks enough like Brosnan.)  It's a lot of fun, period.  Even if you don't like Bond, the options alone are worthwhile.  The 1-player missions have you running around as well as driving Bond's BMW Z8, an Aston Martin, and even has you standing out of a sunroof shooting while someone else drives.Major complaint, again, the lack of blood.  It's unfortunate, but it honestly doesn't take away from solid game play control, action, graphics, and sound.  Oh, and on each board, there are certain \"Bond moves\" that you can pull.  (Opening a door with a gadget, blowing something up, etc.)  When you do them, the Bond theme plays just like the movies.  Again, a lot of fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2002"}

In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead.

As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability.

Better than most.","reviewText":"Infamous is a great game.  Just how great it is depends on your taste in games.  This is not a run and gun shooter like Killzone 2 or Resistance.  This game is more a mix of a shooter with platform game elements.  You play Cole who through some mysterious manner (explosion) has developed electrical \"super powers\".  You are basically locked on an island ala \"Escape from New York\" style. You can scale buildings, poles, train tracks, almost any structure you can get your hands on.  Scaling up the side of a building or up the beams supporting the train tracks is a lot more fun than I thought it would be.  The best part of your super powers are your electrical abilities.  You can zap enemies with lighting similar to Star Wars Jedi, you can throw \"energy grenades\" which are lethal and you can develop other powers.  The powers you develop depend on whether you choose to be \"good\" or \"evil\".  You get certain special powers down each path you take.  If you help civilians and do other good deeds/missions you are basically taking the \"good\" path.  If you decide to crisp the good old civilians like bacon and do \"evil\" missions then you go down the \"evil\" path.This \"good vs. evil\" choice is actually implemented very well, much better than I thought it would be.  I will be playing this game through a second time in order to see how the other path develops and ends.  Overall the graphics are very good and the controls are pretty much spot on.  I never had problems with targeting, etc.  This is a great exclusive for the PS3.  I waffled between giving this game 4 stars or 5 stars and ultimately decided on giving it 5 stars.  I gave the game 5 stars because I felt the originality, story and gameplay were some of the best for a PS3 game.  That's ultimately how I judged this, compared to other PS3 games since this is a PS3 exclusive.  This is definitely one of the top titles on the PS3 and for me personally is one of my top 5 PS3 games.  If you are unsure about this game I recommend downloading the demo from the Playstation Store as it is a good representation of the game's feel.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2009"}

Travel is very similar to Assassin's Creed 2 or Brotherhood, and it's a joy just exploring the city and hurtling off rooftops.Combat can be occasionally frustrating due to your limited range, enemies with effectively endless range, and AI that always knows you're near (sneaking up on enemies is often impossible for no apparent reason).

I just want to temper expectations and say it is not the greatest game of all time--it is definitely game of the year material.  For all the fans of God of War, you know exactly what you're getting but at a level of polish, detail and scope that has never been seen before.  However, the gameplay is basically the same as the previous 2 iterations, not that that is a bad thing, just that you've been there before, except this time they're throwing more moving parts in there and increasing the resolution.  Now, for all those who are new to the franchise, you will definitely be impressed by the game, but if hack and slash games are not your deal, then you will soon move on once the credits roll.  Expect combos, quick time events, puzzles, massive amounts of blood and gore, and jaw dropping graphics.  Just don't expect a revolution in gaming, because the bottom line is it's GOW 1 and 2 on a new canvas.  With all that said, it is definitely staying in my collection as the showcase piece for the PS3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2010"}

You're in for a challenge!","reviewText":"Updated: April 6, 2012 - see bottomMy Xbox is two years old - not one of the newer \"slim\" models. Why is this important? The headphones rely on an optical out from the Xbox for digital audio.  Optionally you can use an analog 1/8\" plug. Neither of these are on the older Xboxes.You can purchase an optional HDMI to optical adapter - expensive. The instructions also suggest using the optical out on your TV (few have them.) I use a audio/video amp with soundbar. This has no optical out.  So my options as the headset sits is to to purchase an optical adapter that works (cheaper ones don't) and does not block the HDMI port. Check the reviews and problems - good luck with that. MS makes one - for around 50 bucks!Since I don't use the audio/video cable that came with the Xbox. I had to snap off the cover and tape it up so it did not block the HDMI port. I was then able to add a couple of RCA adapters and stereo 1/8\" cable (same you use from an iPod, etc.) - see photo. It's that or spend another fifty!Newer (slim) Xboxes have an optical out and can avoid this.  So after I fixed the audio problem, I had to pair the headset to the transmitter. The instructions state it can take 1-5 tries. That was conservative. It took almost 20 tries. It did eventually pair.One issue - there are four lights on the transmitter. These blink in various codes, with no index for what they mean. Fading vs fast blink vs slow blink vs off vs solid vs patterns. Have to go through the book and find out what they indicate - and the explanation is sometimes not very helpful.Pairing the controller - pretty straightforward. Only took three tries.Strange behavior: I'll shut off the Xbox and it will turn on again. This has happened a few times since adding the transmitter.  If I turn off the headset transmitter then the Xbox, this does not happen. It's also random.Sound quality: Great and plenty loud. Unless you have the optical cable though, you're not going to get the Dolby Digital audio. The surround sound is also decent, with six different settings.Mic: I like that you can unplug the mic and stalk, so only the swivel remains. If I'm not team playing, it's less weight. You can also use it with other devices - works on my Gopro Hero2 camera as well.Pretty cool that you can pair two devices - cell phone and game console, but I don't see me ever using it.Update: I found a decent quality adapter, so can now appreciate the digital quality. I use the headset daily playing Mass Effect3 (game and Multi-player) - the digital quality is amazing. The analog was great - but - wow - what a difference.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2012"}

To provide larger storage capacity and faster access rates--PlayStation2 cards transfer data 200 times faster than cards for the original PlayStation--PlayStation2 developers have upgraded the technology for the new memory card. The 8 MB Memory Card uses Flash Memory, the storage technology that's revolutionizing handheld computers, digital cameras, and MP3 players. In contrast, the 128 KB memory cards that were designed for the original PlayStation use memory blocks.

For example, pushing up on your controller makes you sidestep your opponent&#x92;s attacks, yet also allows you to jump in the air by tapping up plus a direction. A revamped fighting system offers up three different styles for each fighter (one includes a weapon technique). The multiple styles provide countless varieties of attacks for any given fighter. Different combinations of punches and kicks can be combined for very lengthy and powerful chain attacks similar to those in theMortal Kombatof old. Fatalities are also back and rich in graphic representation.New fighters join the cast of old favorites such as Sonya, Kano, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Kung Lao, Kitana, Quan Chi, Reptile, and Shang Tsung. The lavish environments surround your fighters with animated backgrounds and rich skylines. On some levels there are even breakable objects and hazards that you can interact with, such as pools of acid--the perfect landing place for a thrown opponent.In addition to regular modes of gameplay (arcade, versus, etc.), there is an option called Konquest mode. This mode allows you to learn more about fighting styles, read up on each character&#x92;s personal history, and gain Koins.

{"product_name":"B0009WPZOA","reviewerName":"F0X H0UND","summary":"very frustrating, but fun","reviewText":"Most Wanted places you in the shoes of the racer you controlled in NFS: Underground 2, who has left Bayview and moved to Rockport. This time around you are trying to be the most notorious and revered racer in the city and on the city police's \"Blacklist\". This blacklist shows who the top 15 street racers are in terms of won races and police chases. Basically, you choose a car to start with (and naturally it isnt going to be the best car in the world), do a few races & earn money from them, then go and upgrade your car. From there you proceed in police chases to raise your bounty. While in these police chases you must pass \"milestones\" - these milestones can be anything from hitting into a car to having a 20 minute police chase. Eventually you can challenge a member on the blacklist if you meet their criteria (they usually require you to win a certain number of races, have a certain bounty price, You can upgrade almost everything on your car from visuals to performance. I mean you can buy several types of body kits, spoilers, rims, paint jobs, vinyls, etc. In addition, you can buy better motors, nitros, superchargers, etc. On top of that, you can \"performance tweak\" your car. This means you can lower your ride height, raise your torque poundage, aerodynamics, and much more to give you the upperhand in a race.The police chases are pretty cool, but get almost impossible later on. You start off at level 1 with just police cruisers following you, as you gfo on you will get police copters and police corvettes chasing after you using tactics like making you fishtail or boxing you in. They will even lay down spike strips and road blocks to slow you down.The graphics in this game are beautiful. The cars look amazing, the environments look top notch, the weather effects are brilliant. The only downside to the grpahics is the sun. Sometimes they will place the sun directly in your eyes and you can't see your car or the road.The AI in this game is a bit frustrating. It starts off real easy, but then gets REALLY hard as you progress. When you reach something like the 3rd guy on the Blacklist (Ronnie I think his name is) the races become almost unbeatable and you really have to use tactics, strategy, and proper driving mechanics to get ahead of the game.The music in this game was off the chain, and in a good way. They had great artists like Static-X, MC Hush, Celldweller, Disturbed and many more to help you get pumped for the race or police chase. Obviously there were some bad songs, but whatever. The cars sounded great as well as the explosions and crashes. Downside to the soudn was for some reason when driving in 1st person on a standard audio TV you can't hear your engine making it hard to judge when shifting while driving manual.. but when on surround sound you can hear it just fine, but can't hear the car when in 3rd person. Meh. The cutscenes were ridiculous, but definitley welcomed. It was done with real people acting as characters in the game and helping you through the story. When you got arrested by the cops they showed your character getting roughed up by the police in interesting ways like slamming you onto the floor and pushing your face into the black top.X-Box live races are pretty intense but lags alot... I mean, you'll be driving neck-to-neck with someone when their car will disappear for a few seconds and re-appear ontop of your car for no reason.Oh and another thing, you can create your own cars for fun. By this I mean you can choose any car you unlocked in the career (not just the cars you drive, but any car you have unlocked) and give them your own customization for free and race them on X-Box Live. It was fun making a nasty Subaru WRX STi and racing it against a Lamborghini Gallardo online.Overall, Most Wanted was a pretty fun and challenging game but it's AI was hard to overcome later on in the races and some small glitches (like hitting into a road block of police cruisers in a Ford GT doing 200mph and stopping dead after hitting one car) kept the game from being higher. I do suggest you at least give the game a try since it is easily accessable to beginners and advanced gear heads.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2008"}

Raillard","summary":"Great fun, if a bit short...","reviewText":"I was very pleasantly surprised by Medal of Honor Airborne, as the series had been going downhill as of late.  This game recaptures this intense action of the original, and pairs it with a novel gameplay approach.PROS: This game borrows a page from Grand Theft Auto, in that it attempts to give you an \"open-ended\" feel.  It's still relatively linear and scripted, but when you parachute into a mission, you are the one who decides which objective you tackle first.  This is a much welcome change in WWII shooters, the majority of which are very, very scripted and allow no deviation (looking at you, Brothers in Arms).  This game also features nice graphics, and while they are not cutting edge, the atmosphere in this game is terrific and really conveys the chaos of each mission.  The missions are also fun and varied, and make strategic sense.  The weapon upgrade system is nice, as it rewards using--and getting better--with a particular weapon.  A little hint of an RPG game goes a long way to make this a better experience.  The game is also pretty realistic, and shooting is marked by recoil, or aiming with iron sights.  It's hard to run and shoot, so this means to hit anything accurately, you need to stop, kneel and aim.CONS: This game is incredibly short.  There are only 6 missions, and depending on the difficulty level, you could finish this game in under 6 hours, easy.  This is a shame, because the content is quite good, but the ending is abrupt and leaves you wanting more.  For all the realism, the last mission is too reminiscent of Return to Wolfenstein, with its Nazi super-soldiers that walk around carrying and shooting an MG-42 from the hip!  There is some enemy re-spawning, but it's usually only limited to situations where you die and have to work your way through an area again.Bottom line, this is a very fun game, a breath of fresh air for a stale franchise, but one that is over way too quickly, especially for a full priced game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2007"}

{"product_name":"B002I096AA","description":"","reviewerName":"Theresa Winfrey","summary":"Bold but flawed technical marvel","reviewText":"Let's give Nintendo credit for being bold and doing what no one else in the commercial electronic world has done before: glasses-free 3D. We all know the positives of 3D video. But what are the negatives of the 3DS?1. Watching movies in 3D in the theater is one thing. You have glasses so that the 3D image you're seeing is the 3D image you're supposed to get. With the 3DS, you must first fidget around to find that perfect 3D angle or you will see a hazy double-image. Then, you must maintain that angle, and play the game (which involve moving your fingers, shaking the screen and getting you out of that perfect viewing angle) at the same time. Your arms will get tired and your eyes might feel kind of funny - the same way they feel when you watch a 3D movie in a theater.2. Battery life is very bad. The Nyko battery park is a solution for this, but I do not want to buy something extra to have decent battery life (plus it makes it bulkier and heavier; no thanks!). I know you can turn 3D off and adjust brightness and all that. But with 3D off, what's the point of it being the 3DS? It might as well be called the PSP.3. It is not very light. It's lighter than my nook color, but it is heavier than a DS lite or PSP.4. Weak software library at the moment, but this is excusable.5. Limited features. There's no video playback (like your custom MP4s, AVIs). The browser is very bad (no Flash or video download function).But the 3DS isn't all bad.1. The e-shop is now available. I was able to buy Cave Story from the DSIware store and play it for the first time (It's not as good as I thought it would be, but that's for another review). After I beat it, I will buy my first copy of Link's Awakening DX ever. On a bad note however, I hope that one day all of the Wii's Virtual Console library will be available to the 3DS (legal, portable SNES titles; how cool would that be?).2. 3D game trailers are probably the coolest thing on the 3DS so far. For me, it has breathed new life into the system. I have watched the one for Star Fox 64 3D multiple times now; it looks so good! Ocarina 3D comes a close second. I hope that full 3D movies become available for the 3DS, either through download, retail-purchase or both.3. The future software library is very strong (Ocarina 3D, Star Fox 64 3D, Kid Icarus, Smash Bros.).4. Great potential. It is still early, so 3DS gets the benefit of the doubt.This thing isn't flying off store shelves, so there's no need to buy one now. Maybe wait for a price drop, or the first great game to come out (Ocarina 3D). Thank you for reading this review, and have a great day.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2011"}

The more you play, the more orginization techniques satisfy you.You can extract to discovered locations, so it pays to find them all.  Destruction's very gratifying,but getting shot at can get old.  The missle launcher's awesome, and you can buy one at any time.The only things I really don't care about in Just Cause 2 (except getting shot at) is the racesor exploring big cities.  There are gov't. missions and faction missions.  There are three separate factions.There are missions in which you take over Panaun bases, which are intense, and ultimately end up withyou shooting everything with a gattling gun.  There are road and flight races just for fun.  Flying a chopper with misslesis great fun, as you rein destruction on military bases.  Hijacking heli's is cool.  The only technical hiccups I experiencein JC2 occur during looking at the map (white pixelation), quiting the game (my system usually shuts down) and one instancein which I got stuck in a rafter.  Once you complete all of the missions, you can find all of the power ups and destroy govt.property in order to gain more completion percentage.  Driving high speed boats is also fun.

Ever since I first laid eyes on Gray Fox, the first Cyborg Ninja in the original Meta Gear Solid, I've always wished for the opportunity to play as him. Then, when Cyborg Ninja Raiden made his debut in Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots and left our mouths agape with his impressive sword skills and insane acrobatics, my desire to play as a Cyborg Ninja rose even higher. I wanted to wield the blade of a Cyborg Ninja myself and take part in all the slicing and the dicing, not just watch all the action unfold in cutscenes (as cool as they were). Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance finally gave me that chance. Looking at it from a purely objective standpoint, this game does have a few niggling little flaws here and there, but they weren't nearly bad enough to take away my admiration for what is a truly fun game with intense action and satisfying combat. Picking up four years after MGS 4, this game starts with Raiden back in active cybernetic duty and working for the PMC (Private Military Company) known as Maverick Security. While escorting an important Prime Minister through the streets of Africa, their caravan is attacked by cyborgs working with Desperado Enforcement, another PMC that has absolutely no qualms about using excessive violence to complete their missions.As Raiden cuts his way through a bunch of enemy cyborgs and even a beefed-up Metal Gear RAY, he gets his bionic rear handed to him by Jetstream Sam, a cyborg samurai (and Raiden's token main rival) working for Desperado. Afterwards, Raiden gets a new and improved cybernetic body and goes on a new mission to stop Desperado's evil schemes and exact his \"revengeance\" (whatever that means). Let me come right out and say that as a fan of MGS's superb story, I wasn't expecting the story for Revengeance to even compare to the ones in the previous games, but I was still hoping for some more background info on Raiden and his past, like more specifics on how he first became a cyborg or his life as a child soldier. Aside from multiple references to the Patriots and Solidus Snake, as well as a certain character from MGS 4 making a short appearance in this game, there actually aren't that many story elements connecting Revengeance to the previous games (I'm well aware that this game is more of a spin-off than a direct sequel, but I still would have liked a couple of flashbacks showing more of Raiden's past). As it is, the story we get is still decent, despite the fact that Raiden is pretty much the only guy in the game to go through any form of worthwhile character development.So, how's the combat in this game? Well, it's actually quite fun and entertaining. Some of its execution though does take some getting used to. As one would expect from a game developed by Platinum Games, Revengeance has the same kind of high-speed and adrenaline rushed action as Vanquish (another hit title developed by Platinum Games). The biggest difference here is that you're slicing up enemies with a sword instead of shooting them with a bunch of guns. Raiden chiefly makes use of his high frequency blade to cut down wave after wave of enemies. He has quite the laundry list of moves and combos available to him, and more can be purchased with experience points you get from defeating enemies and completing objectives, along with upgrades towards health, energy, and weapon damage. A lot of the combos involve a fair bit of button mashing, but some more useful, specialized combos require more precise button and joystick inputs. Too much use of button mashing will actually get you killed since you will have to make frequent use of parrying to defend yourself from enemy attacks.Raiden can parry almost every kind of attack thrown at him from enemies, no matter how small or big they are (and in some cases, no matter how HUGE they are). The parrying itself could have used a bit of work though. You have to press the attack (square) button and push the joystick towards the enemy attacking you in order to parry/block the attack, and you have to parry each individual attack to boot (holding down the square button and keeping the joystick angled towards the enemy won't work). The parrying functions well enough, but it takes a lot of time to master. If your timing is off by too much, then you'll end up swinging your sword towards your enemy instead of parrying their attack, which could lead to disastrous results in certain boss battles. I for one would have preferred to be able to parry with the joystick and the R1 button instead of the square button. Raiden has a dodge move that can be upgraded to a slicing dodge, but the game kind of goes out of its way to not let you know that you even possess a dodge move; either way, the dodge move is rather slow. Despite the fact that Raiden can parry almost any attack, there are a small number of specialized attacks that he cannot defend himself against, and they leave him with little time to run away from his enemies before the attacks connect.Still, if you can do an especially well-timed parry, an icon will appear telling you to enter Blade Mode, where everything around Raiden will slow down greatly and you can use the right stick to set up the angle of Raiden's sword with pinpoint precision. Releasing the right stick will have Raiden swing his sword and cut through his enemy (he can remove their limbs, slice them in half, or just cut them up into confetti). You can also enter Blade Mode manually with the L1 button instead of waiting for the icon to pop up on the screen, but it's normally better to do so when there are only one or two enemies around since others can attack you from off-screen when you're busy focusing on your current target. Plus, once Raiden's energy meter goes down to 75%, then Blade Mode loses its slow motion effect, which will leave him incredibly vulnerable to all manner of beatings from surrounding enemies. One very useful application for Blade Mode is to cut into specific points on vulnerable enemies; after hitting the right spot, Raiden can yank out his targets' synthetic spinal columns and crush them in his hand to absorb their essences, which lets him regain massive amounts of health and energy (but he can also make use of health items if he's in a jam). Much like with parrying, mastering Blade Mode also takes a lot of practice, but it still works quite well.Raiden's Ninja Run ability lets him run around at extremely high speeds and do things like trip up smaller enemies with a sliding dash (opening them up to a Blade Mode attack), automatically deflect bullets, and traverse uneven terrain and small walls without breaking his stride. Later in the game, when he has a full energy meter, Raiden will be able to temporarily enter Ripper Mode, where his basic attacks and combos will do the same amount of damage as Blade Mode attacks. Furthermore, he will gain access to other melee weapons as you progress through the game: an unusual polearm that can damage multiple enemies at once, a magnetic sai that can hit distant enemies, and a pair of high frequency \"machete-shears\" that are incredibly slow, yet powerful. Raiden can also make use of sub-weapons such as missile launchers, grenades, EMP grenades, etc. These weapons all work well and can prove useful at times, but switching to them is rather cumbersome. There's no way to do any quick switching between different weapons, instead you have to access a separate item screen to select the weapons and other items. This normally wouldn't have been a problem for me, but unfortunately Raiden has to be standing still in order to open up the item screen (if he's running, parrying, or attacking, you can't access the screen).While you chiefly will be fighting against several enemies at once in this game, it is possible to use stealth to take out some enemies from behind or above. The stealth in this game is not nearly as in-depth or involved as in the previous Metal Gear games (though that's to be expected by now, don't you think?). Still, you can use the classic cardboard boxes and oil drums to hide from enemies, and even use hologram projectors to distract enemies for a few seconds (they work just like the girly magazines in the previous Metal Gear games). To further aid you in the stealth department, Raiden's visor gives him access to Augment Mode, which lets him see through walls and obstacles and highlights enemies in red (it basically works just like Detective Mode from the Batman games). At best, you'll be able to use stealth to take out 1 to 3 enemies before the rest notice you and attack you en masse, and since some enemies can follow you wherever you go, even on rooftops, trying to lose them until the alert mode expires is usually an exercise in futility. Basically, it's better to use stealth simply to whittle away a certain number of enemies so you don't have to fight as many when the chaos eventually begins.One thing I should mention here is the game's not so good camera. It's definitely not the worst camera I've ever seen (I'm looking at you Ninja Gaiden), but it tends to look away from enemies during combat, although it's much worse during moments of stealth. More specifically, when Raiden is hiding under a cardboard box or oil drum and an enemy starts coming close, the camera insists on looking away from the enemy and towards Raiden's hiding spot unless you move it back towards the approaching enemy again. Either way, most of you won't want to focus so much on the stealth anyway when the combat is so much more gratifying. One specific moment where stealth is pretty much required is when Raiden hijacks a Dwarf Gekko and uses it to sneak into some research facility. The Dwarf Gekko will quickly get demolished in a direct confrontation against even one cyborg, but luckily it can knock cyborgs unconscious from behind with an electric shock.Many quick time events are included in this game's combat, normally after stunning regular enemies or during boss battles. There are also certain high speed and over-the-top set pieces where Raiden will be doing such things as running up or down the sides of skyscrapers at high speeds while avoiding projectiles and falling debris which are truly incredible to witness (though some do require a fair bit of trial and error). The different number of enemies Raiden encounters put up decent fights. He'll face other cyborgs, Gekko (from MGS 4), robotic wolves armed with chainsaw tails or back mounted rail guns, gorilla-like robots with arm mounted machine guns, robotic raptors with bladed feet, and other mechanical freaks. Even the basic cyborg enemies offer a decent challenge in large numbers. The boss fights take things even further and become progressively more challenging as you go further in the game. In true Platinum Games form, the final boss will provide the toughest challenge.Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is the slightest bit short in length (about 7 or 8 hours), but also like it's older brother Vanquish, its shortness and fantastic gameplay combine to give the game high replay value. There are some extra VR missions that increase the playtime somewhat, but they're mostly just momentary distractions. If you're like me and you've always wanted to play as a Cyborg Ninja from Metal Gear Solid, or if you just like hack and slash games with a little something extra thrown in, then this is the game for you. Those of you who only enjoyed the stealth aspect from the other MGS games most likely won't enjoy this game (apparently some people are still unaware that this isn't a stealth-based Metal Gear game). Personally, I like both action and stealth, hence my high praise for this game. If you go into this game expecting less classic Metal Gear Solid gameplay and prepare yourself for what can be considered as \"Ninja Raiden\", then chances are you'll love it, despite its minor issues. At the very least, this game is worth a quick weekend rental.**Update**This next part will cover the two DLCs for Revengeance: Jetstream and Blade Wolf. The first one, Jetstream, puts you in control of Raiden's rival from the main game, Jetstream Sam. Taking place before the main game and before Sam joined Desperado Enforcement, this DLC opens with Sam challenging Desperado's mother company, World Marshal, and infiltrating its headquarters to put an end to their war profiteering. Storywise, there's nothing all that surprising or attention grabbing in this game until you reach the end. Even so, we're never shown any real reason as to why Sam ends up joining World Marshal in the first place, it kind of just \"happens\". But, just like the combat in the main game, the combat in this DLC is just as fast paced and unforgiving as you'd expect. Sam controls much the same way as Raiden and can use his Muramasa sword to slice up many enemies with relative ease, and he can also make use of Blade Mode and the Zandatsu move, slicing open enemies and yanking out their synthetic spinal columns to regain precious health and energy. Parrying once again plays a major role in staying alive. While you can surprise enemies from behind, Sam is unable to perform stealth kills. Some of you may not appreciate this, while most probably won't care.Sam has his own Ninja Run that lets him run at high speeds, although it doesn't let him automatically leap over small walls and obstacles. Fortunately, he has a double jump that makes up for his slightly inferior Ninja Run. Sam also has an improved dodge move which is faster and more fluid than Raiden's (this dodge move is actually crucial to surviving the final boss). One big improvement in this DLC is that you can access the item menu to use sub-weapons and recovery items while Sam is fighting or jumping around, unlike in the main game where Raiden had to stand perfectly still to access the menu. Sam even has a taunt that makes enemies momentarily more aggressive, but also makes them more susceptible to his blade attacks. The enemies in the DLC are the exact same ones that appear in the main game. Even the three boss battles in this DLC are the same as three particular bosses that Raiden fought in the main game. That's not all so bad though, since all the enemies are at the very least just as tough as they've ever been, some even more so. The final boss once again proves to be the most challenging (and cheap) enemy by far. Even though Jetstream is only about 1 to 2 hours long, it's worth it if you were a big fan of the high speed action in the main game.The second DLC puts you in control of the titular Blade Wolf. This one takes place just before Blade Wolf's encounter with Raiden in the main game, back when he was known as LQ-84i. Seeing what befell the mechanical canine before his fateful encounter with Raiden was actually rather interesting and helps provide a more insightful look into Blade Wolf's character. His tail...excuse me, his tale begins with him undergoing intense VR training under the watchful eye of Mistral (whom gamers will remember as one of the bosses from the main game), and from the very beginning you get to see how Blade Wolf actually controls somewhat differently from both Raiden and Sam, or to be more precise, how he feels different from them. Blade Wolf can dash around at high speeds and slice up opponents with his high frequency chainsaw, with which he can do the classic Blade Mode and Zandatsu moves to cut open his enemies and absorb their essences through their synthetic spinal columns. He can even do stealth kills on enemies and see their locations through walls with Augment Mode just like Raiden (Sam couldn't do either of these things).While Blade Wolf does have a lot of the same moves the other two characters have, he also feels heavier and less \"floaty\"; to put it differently, his attacks are slower, but they appear to be somewhat stronger (even his Blade Mode attacks are slower). Blade Wolf can use recovery items and different grenade sub-weapons like the other characters, however he can also use his own heat knife sub-weapons to attack enemies from a distance. Parrying and dodging are again crucial to survival when fighting enemies, most of which are again the same types of enemies encountered in the main game and in Jetstream. The only different enemy is the one boss that you fight at the end, and while it is a somewhat challenging battle, it's certainly not one of the more difficult ones either. Blade Wolf was a fun DLC, unfortunately it was also far too short. It's actually only about half as long as Jetstream, so most gamers should be able to beat it in no more than an hour and fifteen minutes. I liked this DLC, but its short length makes it a bit of a disappointment. At the very least, this DLC is cheaper than Jetstream, so Revengeance purists may find it to be worth playing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2013"}

The game looks stellar, the game play is frantic and intense, and the frame rate with everything going on is amazing, at least on my computer. I thought this would be just another COD, it doesnt really even feel like it, it actually feels like a new game all together. With all the Cubian Castro stuff, and following your men around, going through caves etc, it feels like a movie more so than a game. Its a lot darker, and even more violent, which i love. I bought it mainly because i don't listen to people say because half of what comes out of there mouths is false propaganda anyway. I have a really nice gaming rig with a Intel Core 2 Quad(2.67ghz), 8 gigs of DDR3 RAM, 750gbHD, with an additional 1TB HD. Also i've had an ATI 4850 1gigDDR3 card for about a year and there isn't anything i can't run at full 1080p, other than Crysis, which i don't play anyways. So i'm not sure if everyone playing this on PC is using Nvidia Cards, they installed it and play using a disc or what, but all these 1 star reviews make no sense to me.I have not had one bit of lag, even with everything going on, explosions everywhere, planes flying, grenades, debri, whatever, has not slowed down the game or been hard on my PC at all.

{"product_name":"B0050SWUTQ","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"More action this time","reviewText":"Dead Space 3 does move in a different direction to the first few games. It is more open, including space walks and short planet hops, lots of outside exploration and lots of shooting. At first I thought this was diluting the experience, and in terms of being atmospheric and frightening, Dead Space 3 does NOT compare to the first two. However it does have it's own features that make up for this...more on that later.So basically, things go like this: Isaac is still the protagonist, and in this installment he is helping another team of survivors to track down a key object that will help with a 3rd attempt to save the human race. So not much different there. What is different is the locations, as mentioned before, there is a big element of outdoor exploration of the frozen planet that makes up much of the game. So the action is not limited to one claustrophobic interior of an infected spaceship any more, so the \"haunted house\" analogy of DS1 has all but disappeared. The outdoor elements are fun, and well implemented (the snow looks great), but the sense of dread caused by creeping along corridors is pretty much missing.There are other differences which I want to list here. Firstly, all ammo is now the same for every gun. This is great, it means you never have to hoard supplies for your favourite weapon. Next, the weapon upgrade system has been changed. It's no longer a path of adding \"nodes\", instead you now build your own weapons from parts. This is a total overhaul and takes some getting used to. I found it off putting at first, but had to learn it out of necessity to make my weapons grow in strength as the enemies got tougher. And of course after I had learned it I found it fun after all. The ways to change your weapon features are very varied and dozens of combinations can be tried out. But here's the drawback to this exciting mini-game: you can now only carry TWO weapons around with you! I found this very disappointing, as nearly all my bizarre inventions had to be left in the safe, as only two could be carried to play with, and those workbenches/safes are often very far apart. A bit mean, that aspect, especially as you used to be able to carry four weapons! However another good aspect is that you can create some really boffo weapons even on your first playthrough, so if you want a shotgun that shoots nails coated in acid, or an exploding javelin rifle, there is a a way to do it.Now here's a really big change - ammo and healing supplies are now almost embarrassingly abundant. I've played all the games on the normal setting and I was never this swamped with ammo and medkits before. Even if you run out, you can make more of them yourself out of \"spare parts\" that enemies drop when you kill them. Interestingly, there is no money in this game, so no \"shops\" to buy things in. But I think the glut of free stuff has overcompensated for this. It makes the game too easy, and for several hours of playing, that was my main concern, as it was very difficult to be in too much danger of dying.So my thoughts on Dead Space 3 were that the gameplay is rather one dimensional, as you just blast everything indiscriminately and move from one simple task to another. A lot of the tasks just seem to be invented as obstacles to impede your progress. A disabled launch needs mending, so you have to search for three components. An important alien specimen is found, but three parts of the body have been hidden so they need to be found. Some floating debris in space has to be collected to fix something else. It's all very contrived, and very convenient that it's Isaac who does all the donkey work in this story and it's Isaac who ALWAYS gets separated from the team by a collapsing rope bridge or lift and has to \"find another way around\". Doesn't really give the player a lot of motivation.All right, I've said enough about the story, because now I want to point out what I have decided is the best part of the game. Much to my surprise, this is...Co-Op mode. I hardly ever play online, but this time I wanted to try it because there are story-related co-op missions in the game that can only be unlocked when you play with another person. There are only three, but the main reason why they are so good is that the game creators play a trick on you, which at first had me and my partner player totally confused (we were talking on the phone as we played), but then as we got deeper into the co-op game, we realised that it was all part of the plan and once we were on the third and final co-op chapter, I thought the whole concept was a masterstroke and my overall impression of the game almost doubled as a result of this. Therefore I urge all prospective buyers to get a friends to buy Dead Space 3 at the same time and join each other in the co-op missions and just see how clever they are. Oh and make sure you play them in order! Amazing fun, and great pure gaming at it's best.Eventually though I did complete the whole game, and it does feel very satisfying to reach the conclusion. For the very addicted, there are percentage completion scores for each chapter, and you can replay these at anytime to try and obtain the full 100% - there are rewards for doing this that make it worthwhile, but brace yourself for some of the items that require you to explore OPEN SPACE and look for tiny collectibles among miles of floating debris. That part was nearly not fun. But to finish off, I decided in the end that Dead Space 3 is a success and great fun to play. It is definitely more action oriented than the previous games in the series, but how can making a rocket launcher with a stasis coated, rivet firing chaingun, and just being badass, not be fun?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2013"}

Siddiqui","summary":"Every choice you make manifests in a different way.","reviewText":"How would seek your revenge, would you kill anyone in your path or make them suffer using nonlethal methods? Dishonored gives you these choices and more as you transverse the wonderfully crafted world of Dunwall as you seek retribution for those who orchestrated your downfall and took someone dear to you. The immense routes and ways you can use to murder or evade your enemies and complete your missions makes Dishonored an incredibly flexible and engaging title.You play as Corvo Attano, the former head bodyguard of the empress and her daughter Emily who ruled the port city of Dunwall. The disease infested port has suffered severe death tolls due to the rat-born plague and now the industrial city, grown wealthy through whale oil, faces another threat with the death of an empress and disappearance of it's heir. Corvo is framed for the death of the empress and blamed for the disappearance of her daughter, solidifying his fate at the hands of the executioner. Now he seeks revenge on the hive of corrupted and power grabbing culprits responsible. However it's up to you whether to walk the path of violence or take the high road and rise above the violence that has saturated the city.Exploring Dunwall is one of Dishonored's greatest feats. The fishing city has grown through an industrial revolution and the whaling trade, but now suffers due to the influx of rats carrying a deadly plague. Cobblestone streets and rain soaked buildings carry numerous amounts of rats in the lower income areas, while those living in wealthier neighborhoods appear unaffected. However some texture details and occasional graphic hiccups happen at certain periods, but it doesn't make Dunwall any less but beautiful.Exploring also benefits you with more than just visual candy. Hidden pathways within apartments, sewers, alleys, and within walls contain potions, blueprints, and unearthly items. The large areas that you travel through to get to your targets have an array of hidden areas, away from your targeted path. Venturing outside that path can lead you to unexpected possessions and sometimes and unexpected passage.A select few of conspirators assist in your escape and begin plotting to destroy the people who framed you. As you begin your journey more characters will aid you but at a price. Each of these people are wonderfully voiced, written, and animated. Listening to characters speak, converse, read out loud, and eavesdrop you'll remain silent and wait for every word to be spoken to either gather information or simply the joy of listening. Some of the best dialogue comes from a supernatural heart that aids you in the search of other arcane items.  You'll always be eager to listen to the next piece of dialogue whether it is dark and hopeless or desperate and drunk.You won't defeat your enemies using the skills and abilities of ordinary men. Instead you are granted supernatural abilities by a mysterious figure called The Outsider. Probably the most used ability is going to be blink; this allows you to silently teleport a short distance. This ability is consistent enough that you can easily travel throughout Dishonored's multiple passageways but can lead to certain difficulties when trying to go to a restricted area. This quick jolt from one location to another, showing that despite the industrial feel of the game magic still exist.Beside blink you will have an array of mythical abilities such as summoning hordes of rats or seeing through walls. To upgrade these powers you have to obtain special items called runes, but you cannot unlock everything so choose wisely. You can also equip a limited amount of bones charms that are littered throughout Dishonored's campaign and each grant you perks that can be changed, unlike runes which are permanent. Clearly certain choices tailor to different styles such as using the summoning rat ability to quickly eliminate targets or stopping time to avoid the carnage.Don't expect to be duel-wielding powers or weapons. Your left hand is reserved for everything except your sword, which always appears on the right hand. The radical menu contains all the weapons and powers available such as a crossbow and pistol, each with special types of munitions. Unfortunately for those seeking to complete the game without killing anyone they must rely on the only nonlethal ammunition available, sleep darts. Unlike your arcane abilities you must spend coin in order to purchase other upgrades such as stronger armor, ammunition storage, and other things from Piero, the loyalist you constructed your mask. Everything else from exploding rounds to razor exploding proximity mines are those seeking to paint the wall with the blood of their enemies.In order to truly test these armaments and powers you will need some challenging opponents. Enemies are generally alert and formidable opponents, but sometimes do some moronic things. However once you are fluent with your equipment Dishonored's flexibility begins to show. You can take control of a guard to walk past a wall of light or slow time when a guard spots you then shoot him and then hide before the spell wears off. If your mana is depleted you can depend on blocking and counterattacks to defend yourself.As you complete objectives and decide the fate of your targets the environment changes. When you complete a mission you're given a statistic chart of your actions and those result in changes in the environment. For example if you kill a large amount of enemies you can cause an increase in weepers, which are people who suffer from the plague and attack on sight. Other times you can choose to save an ally's uncle which can lead to her trust and a reward. In the end your choices with be noted and determine what ending you will be get.Dishonored entices you to replay the 15 hour adventure from beginning to end. Although you can choose to replay missions from the menu the consequences of your actions make it even more delightful. Finding new routes and methods for tackling each mission is an exciting. While I did notice some graphic issues in the cutscenes these were rare and never detracted from the overall experience. Unlocking different powers and using them to be a lethal solider or political assassin offers appealing incentives to replay missions in multiple ways. It's a rare game that combines such as great story within this amount of freedom but Dishonored succeeds and is worthy of every award it received and will get.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2013"}

Personally, I experienced a bit of both, hence the 4 star rating. While the story is relatively linear, there are dozens of different ways to go about each mission, though when you get down to it, it's mainly either killing everyone or sneaking around. I tended to start out sneaking, but after I kept having to replay missions in the beginning, I later just switched my methods when things didn't go exactly as planned. Consequentially, even though I was in the middle of pack in regards to the morality system, I got the worst ending. It was just so frustrating, and I felt like I was being punished for playing the game the way I wanted. I almost wish that they would release a sequel with the same gameplay but a completely different story. This is definitely a game everyone should try, but it is far from a perfect gaming experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2013"}

The game has such a great arcade shooter feeling to it, you will have fun with this game. The 3D is excellent in this game, I enjoyed the pop out effects with the bosses and creatures. This game is really so much fun, it has a ton of replay value because of unlockables.

With SC when I did vs me and a friend used 2 move controllers a piece and that caused all types of motion tracking problems and with The Fight: Lights Out it just wouldnt track properly regardless of room lighting and everything else.

{"product_name":"B00503E9FY","description":"","reviewerName":"Matthew Siebert \"~Author and Critic\"","summary":"Review From a Casual FPS Gamer","reviewText":"Modern Warfare 2 was the first game of the Call of Duty series that I actually took time to play in depth. My girlfriend at the time bought it for me when I said I wanted Dragon Age Origins; she didnt know the difference. But none the less, I was grateful for the present and took time embarking on the campaign. To my surprise, I had so much fun playing it on easy that I replayed it on veteran. Also, I spent several hours on the special ops. I never took online too seriously though, I'm a sore loser and my pathetic KD ratio turned my calm temperament into ground shaking rage.When Black Ops Came out, I bought it for Nazi Zombie. Oh how I love Nazi Zombie, teaming up with others to survive wave after wave of attacks. I'm not sure why, but that caveat was enough for me to warrant a purchase of the game plus some of the downloadable content. Yet, I still did not indulge in online play.When MW3 was released, I tried to hold out until I could find it cheap on Amazon or some other site used. But when I played survival mode at my friends, temptation gave in. Thus far I've played a considerable amount of time doing missions, survival, and online. Overall, its satisfying, but I wish I held out.Missions: The missions are fun. I think its a huge improvement that you can play with a person online to do the missions and complete them. However, there are two major flaws. First, you cannot earn 3 stars if your partner has their difficulty set to 1 star; and vice versa. Match making is frustrating at best. Second, when you have the difficulty set to 3 stars (hard) the difficulty curve is ridiculous; luck seems to play a role just as much as skill.Survival: Survival mode on this game is surprisingly fun and flexible. There are 16 different stages; many more than Nazi Zombies offer. Additionally, there is much more flexibility in character development. Do I want to buy flash grenades and armor? Maybe a new gun and air strike. You can even buy squads to help you out. This gives a high re-playability and lets one improve with experimentation. The first thing I consider a flaw, and I do find it rather inexcusable, is that you can only do two player on survival. Why not four players? Heck, why not 16 players? If they had a massive survival co-op mode, I wouldn't be able to set the game down! Oh, the chaos that would ensue.... Instead I'm stuck with someone who is usually (surprisingly) worse than me and I keep having to run over to save them. This brings me to my second gripe, why is it if my partner dies, I lose too? Cant my partner be revived the next round if I survive? Again, matchmaking is frustrating at best. One thing I would like to see evolve in any survival mode is the ability to re-do a stage after you lose instead of having to start over. I'm surprised that this option hasn't been implemented in either Black Ops or MW3. Not only would the game be more addictive, but it would greatly increase the speed for those playing.Online: I gave this game a serious try online, no joke. But its infuriating for a beginner no matter how you look at it. I can deal with the level 70's who play 6 hours a day pwning my new ass. I can deal with not knowing how to navigate the maps. But the two things I cant deal with are; the differences in power between high level / low level characters and the inconsistencies in what I do and what the kill cam shows.First lets talk about the kill cam. I cant count the number of time I stab someone who walks around the corner but instead of them dying, they shoot me and kill me. When I watch the kill cam, I'm not even stabbing them. WTF? Likewise, I die in a gun battle with another player. Why is it that sometimes it shows me firing my gun and other times it doesn't? I can admit I suck, but at least give me the kills I freaking earned!Next lets talk about some of the high level / low level inconsistencies. Another interesting imbalance, I often blast away someone with a machine gun, hitting them several times, but they live. Then some veteran has a gun that kills me with 2 shots to the arm. Seriously? The veterans also have all of their perks / guns unlocked so they can create much more adaptable customizable classes.In essence, for me to get to where I enjoy the game, I have to be continually unfairly raped. Its ridiculous.All in all, this is another modern warfare. The survival mode is flexible, but limited. The missions are fun, but absurdly unfair at higher difficulty. Matchmaking is inconsistent at best in either the survival or missions. And if your new to the serious, don't even consider online play unless your a glutton for frustration.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2011"}

Although I wouldn't give it 5 stars because it's lacking what FF7 and FF8 have. The story is mediocre, nothing mind blowing. Typical bad guy trying to destroy the world, good guy beats him, good guy gets the girl.... etc.. The main villain \"Kuja\" lacks personality, power, he's just a metrosexual monkey who's all emo. The story fails to build him up as the main villain really. Not intimidating and can be confused as a girl. What makes this game any fun is the side quests, like chocobo's forest, where you can dig up treasure and earn points. That's pretty much why I even play Final Fantasy 9. Other than that the battle system is a fail, the characters are somewhat interesting, but then again lack any real purpose in combat. Skill points are useless and don't work. I'll explain.Ok, 80% of Final Fantasy 9 is random battles. Why? Because some genius at Squareso... ooopps it's Enix now.. decided to get rid of the \"No Encounter\" feature that was introduced in Final Fantasy 8.  I'm glad they brought it back in Final Fantasy 10. You can't go 5 steps in this game without encountering some huge house with a canon trying to kill you..............Yep, you heard me right. Monsters are ridiculous. Now there are some cool things they added to the battle system for instance: 4 characters in combat. Great idea. Also having friendly enemy encounters on the field that reward you for doing something other than mashing X until they die. Another good idea. But it eventually falls apart until you end rage quitting. Limit breaks are cool at first, they do 9,999 damage, but when you're at level 100 there's no point any more. The same genius decided to get rid of limit breaks that do multiple hits. So a limit break does 9,999 and a regular attack does 9,999. Know what I'm saying, pointless. Also learning abilities is nice, but again.. Pointless. Example: You can learn an ability called \" Magic Null\" which like the name says nullifies any magical attack that hits you. WRONG. Magic attacks still hit you and do just as much damage. FAIL.  There's a few more, but I can't remember off the top of my head abilities that don't work. How could Square-enix miss such simple things like this? Tents don't heal fallen characters, remedies don't work on some status effects, if an opponent cast's \"Stop\" on you it's game over, no mega-elixirs, card game offers no reward, The turn base is broken: enemies take way more turns than you do. That last one get's very annoying especially later on in the game when you're fighting bosses, it's like for every 1 turn you take with a character they take 2 turns. FAIL. That completely ruins the point of turn base! I can go on an on, but I'll just sum it up with this.Final Fantasy 9 is an ok game, but to be honest if I was working for Square-enix at the time. I would have stood up at a meeting for this game and smacked everyone at the table. Except Nobou, the soundtrack for 9 is fantastic, he did a great job as usual! But the rest of them would have got smacked, then I would say \"We are not making another Final Fantasy unless it includes everything that made Final Fantasy 6, 7, and 8 great!\" I mean isn't this the logical thing to do. If you have something great don't start subtracting from it: ADD to it! Otherwise you end up with Final Fantasy 13....... EPIC FAIL....... Anywho this game is ok and I'm pretty forgiving because 10 was awesome except it was too linear, they must have had a wake up call after 9. then again it was FAIL city after FF10. They should just start calling Final Fantasy \"Final Fail\" from now on. More appropriate in 2012.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2013"}

New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"Joseph Izzo","summary":"Awesome!!!","reviewText":"What is with these reviews?

There is quite of bit of tearing, but no texture pop in. The textures are all kind of washed out, I'm not sure if it's supposed to be the style, or not. They're pretty, but nothing that will knock your socks off. The level design is unimaginative and very linear, often literally so and very repetitive. Boss designs aren't very imaginative and there is little to no variety in enemies. The controls get the job done for the most part, though feel a little clunky sometimes.There are 4 different play styles, listed in order from least to most suckey:(1)Main Character: I don't remember her name, she's the hack and slash character (and frankly the only one that should have been playable.) her animations aren't great, but she's fun enough to use to hack through hordes of bad guys, three different sword style you can switch quickly between and blocking is usually automatic as long as you have the same style selected as your enemy. This alone would make the game about worth, at most, about 10 bucks, but sadly, when it deviates from it's hack/slash course it just sucks.(2)Motion Controls: Sometimes you'll need to pick items, or aim cannon balls at targets, when you shoot/throw you take on the first person perspective of these objects, and control them with the motion control in the controller. If used a little sparingly these sequences could break the game up nicely. I found my motion controls worked fine and these parts were sometimes kind of fun. Unfortunately, these sequences can over stay their welcome and seem to be there to pad out an already short game(3)QuickTime Events: If you're a fan annoying, random, QuickTime events that go on for too long, and flash too quickly, and when you mess up you start from scratch, then this game has to top your list(4)Kai:...sigh...Kai, this is the main character's younger sister and takes the game from OK to tedious instantly. She's a playable character who has a wacky...childlike personality. She shoots arrows (so buckle up for awkward Sixaxis encounters with enemies.) Her segments RIP you right out of the action and any enjoyment you may be having. She can't really defend herself, and when you shoot it takes on a first person perspective (during which you can't move) then you have to shoot the approaching or distant enemies. These parts get tedious really quickly, and at times you'll be overwhelmed and die, then have to play the sequence again, which wouldn't be bad if it were fun. These sequences make the game feel like a slog you want to get over with, not a game...OH and this part just adds insult to injury, often you'll be running around with this annoying twerp and you'll go to shoot BAM first person perspective AIMED in the opposite direction, it takes forever for this bitch to slowly rotate to the target, so you're screwed - this happens ALL THE TIME, after five minutes with her you'll hate her more and more every time she say's something child-like. (sometimes as a added bonus treat she gets coupled with QuickTime events which take the game into suck overdrive) These should have been stealth/puzzle missions which could have been fun; controlling arrows to activate switched behind guards, instead it's the wrong play mechanic in an action environment.Overall, it's cheap, if your curious, I won't change you mind, but I've been bargain slumming lately, and this was one I was hoping would be a forgotten gem, instead it turned out to be...well read the title of this post. This game makes the much superior yet greatly flawed Genshi: Spirit of the Blade feel like Ninja Gaiden.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"B.

{"product_name":"B000M17AVO","description":"Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc Remote","reviewerName":"Ron Sullivan","summary":"Way more complicated then it had to be","reviewText":"I'd bought my PS3 about four or five months ago.  I have a pretty nice HDTV and really wanted a Blu-Ray player to compliment it.  It also didn't hurt that I had a bunch of PS2 games I still wanted to play.After everything was all set up and I started watching a couple of movies, it became apparent extremely quickly that I was going to need a remote for the Blu-Ray features.  Using the controller was just overly complex to make it a real option.When I finally grabbed a remote, there were a few things I noticed immediately.  Namely, the simple fact that it was a Bluetooth device meant that there was no chance that I was going to be able to use this with any of my other devices like my TV or my surround-sound receiver.  Some people don't really care, but I hate having a thousand remotes lying around.  I'd rather just have one and forget about it.Considering that the PS3 is the only device that the remote is able to control, I fail to see why it's covered with buttons.  Outside the obvious 'Play/ Pause/ Stop' buttons, I don't understand the decision to make this look so much more complex then it has to be.  I would have tried to make the button layout as simple as possible.  If it's not going to be able to be used for another device, it (at least) could be easy to use.  I would say that two-thirds of the remote's face, you'll never use.Another reviewer mentioned it, but it bears repeating.  If you touch any button on the device, it'll automatically cue-up your system.  The PS3 is a wonderful piece of equiptment and I like it a lot, but man that sucker kicks out a TON of heat.  Having said that, I do try to make a deliberate effort not to keep it on longer then I have to.  When I'm sitting and watching TV, however, I tend to have both my remotes next to me.  I can't even tell you the number of times I've accidentally leaned a little too much to one side and booted-up the system.  This is complicated by the fact that there's not just a 'power' button anywhere.  I actually have to toss my receiver over to the PS3 device and manually shut the system off.  It sounds like a small deal, but it's REALLY annoying after you do it a few times.I'm sure this was mentioned several times before, but I sincerely wish that the device was back-lit.  I, like many others, usually watch TV in low-light.  Between the (unnecessarily) complex button configuration and the simple fact that you can't read the thing, it makes simply watching a movie more of a chore then it needs to be.Not an outright \"bad\" piece and certainly a better option then the controller.  It's also better then any of the third-party devices that I was able to find.  All that having been said, however, I'd still say that Sony's remote wasn't very well thought out either.  There's a lot of issues that the smallest amount of consideration should have been able to change.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2008"}

I've logged maybe 20 hours so far and there has been no Crash to Desktop (CTD) errors or any glitches I have encountered.Like many people, I was a huge fan of the Original Fallout 1 and 2 and was fairly skeptical about a new group of people making the 3rd sequel.  It is different than the first two, let me just state that up front.  There is no isometric top-down perspective and the \"feel\" of the game plays similarily to Oblivion.  That is to say, when you move around it feels very much like moving around in the Oblivion landscape except the landscape is much different, of course.As far as similarities to Oblivion, that is where it ended for me.  It very much plays like its own game and not \"Oblivion with Mutants and Guns\".  From the PIPBOY on your arm where you access all your vital information and well as you inventory to the combat system it is substantially different.  However, I noticed that the melee fighting plays remarkably the same as in Oblivion.  You can block, you can hold down the LMB for a power attack and you can do some serious damage with some wild swinging.  Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (VATS), the new targeting system for Fallout, is mostly for ranged fighting I have found and works pretty well.  However, If you don't kill your opponent with the action points (AP) you have in VATS you have to wildly jump around and fight until your AP are recharged. It somewhat reminded me of Oblivion with a bow when you could backpedal while shooting an opponent to take him out.  This strategy works pretty well until you run out of bullets.The combat in the game is fairly easy, the typical gamer won't find him or herself dying very often.  The hardest thing about combat is having ammunition, supplies of healing agents and the condition of your weapons.  If you miss anyone of those three things or worse yet, all of them then the game can become pretty unpleasant. You can also ratchet up the difficulty as I would recommend because the default setting is a little tame for my tastes.The stories, quests and graphics are wonderful.  Wandering around the Wasteland FEELS like wandering around in the wasteland. The game is really really big.  Even after logging almost 20 hours, (I'm no speed gamer either), I feel like there is a lot I have left to see, as i've only run around about 25 percent of the map and barely scratched the surface of D.C., where the game takes place.Bottomline, there are some similarities to Oblivion, but the stories and landscape are Fallout, the weapons are Fallout and the universe you play in is Fallout.  I loved the first two, and I don't think anyone will be disappointed in the third.As far as Securom thingie, I've seen that pop up in reference to other games and honestly I've never had a problem with it. I guess because I just install it on my computer and be done with it. I suppose if you wanted to copy it or install it on four computers or something, it would be a problem, but that doesn't really affect me.Overall, a 5-star game for me simply because it is extremly fun to play and there are LOTS of things to do.  This will last me quite awhile, because then I have to play it through again being a bad guy!Pros:- Great Graphics combined into the landscape- Voice acting! More than 10 people doing the voices! (One of the worst things about Oblivion). I think I heard Nicole Sullivan's voice in there at Megaton.- Sound is great and music too.- FUN! VERY FUN!Cons:- Tutorial/Game Info sparse probably because the strategy guide is bigger than the Guttenberg Bible (which I didn't buy).- Wish I could drive the cars or ride a motorcycle.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2008"}

The removal of the staple elements of the GTA franchise was not good; the side service missions such as paramedic/fire/taxi, the wee remote control vehicles, the crazy cars along with the mini tracks for go karting, triple stunt points gone, and so on... and of course the loss of the planes. Heck even give me back the dodo R*! It was a big surprise to see all that gone and not a pleasant one. But when playing GTA IV you kind of felt that they had more planned for Liberty City in the future. Maybe that golfing range might be able to be used, that skateboard park might come into play and perhaps we'll get to ride on the ferris wheel too at some point.So with the release of TLOD and TBOGT we're getting somewhere. Now for full disclosure I played The Ballad of Gay Tony through first even though it's episode two, primarily because I wanted to base jump! And in TBOGT I can see Rockstar finally giving us back some of what they took away. You can indeed now play golf in that floating driving range, you can base jump off specific buildings as a challenge or indeed just buy a parachute and jump off anything you want. Tanks are back too! Rockstar are slowly making LC a more fun sandbox and I hope that continues with the release of more episodes. With regards to these two episodes, well you can't go wrong. Both are typical GTA fare with varied missions and great story lines. I won't go into the plots of each - do I need to? There's some nice cross-over moments in the stories though that will make you smile!With TBOGT you have specific optional targets to do in each mission such as a time limit or how much damage you take. The nice thing about the way this works are the new very extensive mission checkpoints, something massively lacking from GTA IV. But there's a penalty for using a checkpoint - if you use a reload then your mission objectives aren't saved. You can still complete the mission and continue with the story but there's an actual incentive to replay each one and do better each time. It's a great game mechanic that satisfies both players who prefer to blast through the game and those who wish to fine tune each play-through. Nice.It also seems that LC's code and graphics were fine-tuned somewhat because there's considerably less little glitches and popups in TBOGT over TLOD and the original. But do install the game to the HD if you buy the disc version regardless of which episode you play.All in all very satisfied that I got my money's worth here. I'm now playing through TLOD although I still have some side mission (drug wars) to complete in TBOGT. It took me 18 hours to complete the second episode and I expect about the same for TLOD. So for about a dollar an hour entertainment this hits the mark. If you felt, as I did, that GTA IV was a step in the wrong direction for GTA then I recommend this compilation; GTA is heading back to its roots.R* should also be commended for not allowing folks to play the episodes without the need for the original GTA disc if you buy the disc version (you'll need the original if you DL the episodes from XBL). Helpful for those of us who put GTA IV on ebay shortly after completing it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00004U5VF","description":"The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start.

Once I got into Tekken 3, after a while it just wasn't enough.  Over spring break 2001, I rented this game and a PS2, and I was blown away.  Despite a migraine headache, this game was THE best looking thing I have ever seen.  I just about wet myself when I saw 128-bit graphics like this up close for the first time.  Gameplay is different, but sooo much fun.  The possibilities are endless!!  30+ characters (8 of which I have mastered) make the replay value endless.  I will buy this to master ALL the characters, and to view all the different styles.  Buy this game (even if you have the original Tekkens) and you won't be disappointed.

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Brennon Lewis","summary":"Kingdom Hearts","reviewText":"Postive1.The game has a great story2.Fantasy fantasy characters cloud,leon,yuffie,aerith,and sephiroth3.Tons of fun and creative worlds4.you can travel to diffent world based on the disney filmsNegative1.NoneA must buy for final fantasy and disney fanKingdom Hearts begins on Destiny Islands, where Sora, Riku, and Kairi live.

{"product_name":"B003O6E800","description":"","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Zelda 3DS Style","reviewText":"There is no honest question about it, The Legend Of Zelda has been one of the most definitive video game franchises of all time. Nintendo has shown that they have no signs of slowing Link and company down whatsoever. This year is a massive one for Link, he is celebrating the 25th anniversary of his first quest against the hateful Ganon. Along the way, he has made so many encounters with a great cast of friends from Zelda, to Midna from Twilight Princess, and so many others all in his quest for the tri-force. With all the hype surrounding the upcoming Skyward Sword for the Nintendo Wii, Nintendo said they weren't going to do much to celebrate the silver celebration of Zelda. What they have donw is brought out the classics. Not just for the Wii, but a revamped Ocarina for the new Nintendo 3DS, and honestly it is worth the tri-force.The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time 3D brings back the excitement and thrills of what made the Nintendo 64 classic, into a new generation of fans. The gameplay is just as amazing, as Link does what he needs to to reconnect the pieces of time, and search for the idol medallions through amazing quests from Hyrule, all the way to the Forest Temple, to Hyrule Castle. The graphics do look absolutely amazing, and the music has all been restored brilliant in shine from top to bottom. The challenge that Nintendo had by bringing the N64 classic stands absolutely tall. The control though is a bit more complex if you've never played the Nintendo 64 version, or don't have the Wii to download it through the Wii's virtual console. The control really puts you to the test as you fire weapons like the light arrow and slingshot with the 3DS motion sensor. It can be rough to get used to at first (unless you've played The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess for the Wii,) but after a bit of practice you'll get the swing of things. The music though has been brilliantly redesigned to fulfill the 3DS platform, but the gameplay is absolutely challenging.All in all, there have been few games right now that have been worth buying for the Nintendo 3DS, and honestly The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time 3D is one that is absolutely worth the price to play. I never did play it when it was made for the Nintendo 64, but honestly I am glad that I got the chance to for the Nintendo 3DS. It absolutely is worth the effort, and follows through with why games love the Nintendo 3DS. What Super Mario 64 was to the Nintendo DS when it came out in 2004, The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D is that game to the 3DS. With other great Nintendo 64 games coming to the 3DS like Starfox 64 3D soon, it is going to be rough to equal the fun, but this is truly a must buy for the Nintendo 3DS, and Link and Zelda are so proud.Graphics: A-Sound: BControl: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B+Overall: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2011"}

The greatest 3-D weapons-based fighter will provide non-stop action, excitement and surprises as you go one-on-one against your favorite challengers.","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"Best one yet","reviewText":"It's the usual fighting game set-up: mano-e-mano, toe-to-toe, eyeball-to-eyeball. Except in Soul Calibur II  the majority of characters have weapons, ranging from swords to nunchucks. You. Know. The. Drill. At least you would if you'd caught one of Soul Calibur II's predecessor's, Soul Blade on the PSOne and Soul Calibur on the Dreamcast, 1997 and 1998 respectively. That's a long time ago, let alone in the frenetic world of the gaming industry (although these slow summers can be excluded perhaps) - and PSOne, Dreamcast, I hear you cry? It's true; some of the younger members of our audience won't be able to offer up any more than a baffled shake of their unwrinkled brows at the mention of those consoles. I remember though bro, Soul Calibur was a \"console mover\" as they say in the business, and that console was the Dreamcast. This incarnation will look very familiar to fans of that particular outing. The same glossy sheen over sumptuous backdrops remains, as do the bulk of the characters. It's less of a reinvention, built from the ground up, more of a slight tune-up to allow what was, and still is, an awesomely slick fighting game to make its debut on a new generation of consoles, the Xbox, PS2 and GameCube. We begin our journey to warrior superiority with the main gaming modes, of which there are two to choose from, Original and Weapon Master. Original contains seven different variations on your basic pigstick fight, including standard arcade beat-through, team battle, survival and, of course, the modern measure of manhood: Vs Mode. Each mode has a basic twist, like trying to set a record time, or using a team of fighters, but it still comes down to two characters putting the smack down on each other. Weapon Master mode is a single-player mission-based option. It's just an update of the Edgemaster and mission mode seen in previous incarnations of the series and will see you trawling through a succession of one-on-ones to unlock new characters and extras. Each platform has its own exclusive character, all the better to hook in your gaming money my dear... The Xbox will be the playground of Todd McFarlane's Spawn character, the moody superhero he went off to create at the height of his Spider-Man success. 'Cube will see Legend of Zelda's Link testing his skills, while the PS2 has grizzled and generally unpleasant fighter Heihachi from Tekken, who kicks it - and you - without the aid of a weapon. Out of all the characters in Tekken, I feel a little short-changed that charisma-dampener Heihachi got the call up for the PS2 version. Returning characters include fan favorites like Mitsurugi, pole-boy (but not in the dancing sense) Kilik, nimble ninja Taki and the ultimate fighting gimp, Voldo, he of the mask, knives for hands and John Wayne walk, who somehow Namco has made even freakier looking. Of the new fighters, standouts include the feisty, sprightly newcomer Talim and supreme fencer Raphael, who might become a first pick for Soul Calibur fans. His slick poise and moves are testament to the great motion capture work that Namco has produced throughout the game. Other new characters, such as Yunsung and Cassandra, are less striking though, while the McFarlane-designed original Necrid is just another over-muscled weirdo. The bigger they are, the harder they fall... especially with a katana shoved in their gut. Calibur is a brutally fast fighting game played out in rapid-fire bouts that fly by without any discernible frame-rate slowdown. Even though there are sharp objects slicing around everywhere, this is not a gory game, and fighters will just look hacked off if they lose a match rather than hacked up. Moves include horizontal, vertical and kicking attacks, as well as defensive poses, power-ups and signature destructive combos. Fighting styles are tailored well to the individual character and factors like size and choice of weapon have a real bearing on the combat. Some characters, like Kilik and Mitsurugi, are easier to get to grips with while others like Ivy and Voldo need more time to master but are just as devastating. All the human characters have been given an Americanized sheen, and now look more like soap opera actors than noble warriors, while the costumes are camper than a convention of tents. The cast of hulking monsters meanwhile, like Necrid and Astaroth, look as if they've stumbled out from a casting call for Plan 9 From Outer Space - The Remake with their sci-fi-stylings and wild colorings.Working your way through Weapon Master mode is essential if you want to unlock extra characters, features and weapons. It also has an RPG element mixed in, which is pretty superficial and the only benefit appears to be earning some dough to buy extra killing tools. However, being essential doesn't make Weapon Master much fun to play through. Missions are often one-round battles made tedious because they're too easy - you don't get much action in return for the load-times. Namco makes attempts to liven missions up with fiendish fighting conditions (poison, booby-trapped floor, etc...) but it doesn't really take away from the feeling that it's just a forced march through a succession of usually hapless stooges in order to get the extras.Yet, this is still a brilliantly addictive fighting game. Fans might feel a little short-changed at how, well, familiar most of the gameplay is to the Dreamcast version, but that doesn't take away too much from the fact that you can now play one of the best fighting games ever put out there without having to resort to digging out Sega's defunct games platform on eBay. Those new to the series, however, are going to be thrilled, as this is some of the fastest and most stylish fighting gameplay you can find.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00009WAUK","description":"You can almost hear the collective drooling of RPG and Game Boy fans worldwide. As the inaugural Nintendo/Square reunion title,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancehas a lot to live up to--and it does, spectacularly!The long heralded Final Fantasy series has enjoyed a number of spin-offs and sequels. Using the familiar character types and classes of the Final Fantasy series, but with a wholly original storyline,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancecreates an immersive world of strategic combat and conquest.Snow JobWhile most fantasy games favor romantic landscapes,Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceslyly starts out in a plain-vanilla suburb. Players assume the role of young Marche Radiuju in the humble burg of St. Ivalice.A snowball fight introduces the characters and sets the groundwork for future battles. After a brief (but chilly) skirmish, Marche heads home to visit his younger brother.Marche MadnessSoon after, Marche's friends drop by to show him an ancient book of mysterious origins. After failing to translate the text properly, Marche's friends leave for the evening. After a wistful slumber, Marche awakens and realizes he isn't in Ivalice anymore... or is he?Alone in a foreign land, Marche quickly comes under the care of a helpful creature known as a Moogle. It doesn't take much to convince Marche to adopt a lucrative career as a mercenary.Gangs of IvaliceA quick stop at the town inn introduces Marche to his new gang. A motley crew at best, your associates include low-level monks, mages, archers, and soldiers. The only hope you have of finding your way home is to turn your ragtag group of misfits into a finely tuned fighting force.Begin your tour of duty by chatting up the local barkeep. He'll clue you in to interesting news bits, rumors, and job opportunities. Due to your severe lack of experience, early quests are little more than errands.As you gain experience and reputation, your job options grow as well as the rewards. You can also send one of your crew members on side missions for extra swag. You cannot use these members in your regular quests until they return from their mission.Rules of EngagementWhether your quest is to fetch rare herbs or escort the local nobleman, you can always expect bad company. The battlefield is set up from an isometric 3D viewpoint, allowing clear view of every character in play.At the start of a match, you must choose which members of your gang you wish to take into battle with you. You have a clear view of the enemies before choosing, so try to match your lineup to your opposition.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceintroduces an innovative law system to the series. During every battle, an impartial judge decrees specific rules, such as banning poison attacks or physical attacks. The judges' unpredictability requires players to keep a well-rounded group of characters at all times.Technically, you can break the combat laws, but it is generally not recommended. Even if you win the battle, any of your characters who breaks a law is whisked away to prison. They can only be released after paying a hefty fine.Fantasy FightingThe battlefield is set up like a 3D chessboard, with elevations and terrain types. In each turn, a character can move a specific number of spaces and perform a single action, such as attack or using an item.Most strategy games employ either real-time or turn-based action.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceemploys a speed-based system that is somewhere in-between.Characters still take turns to move and perform actions, but these are based on each character's individual speed ratings. Nimble characters like rogues and ninjas are usually the first characters to go and can usually move farther than other characters. The downside is that faster characters typically lack strong armor and health stats.Subtle details such as terrain type and attack proximity can have a direct affect on your ability to hit an enemy. Attacking an enemy from behind or the side will yield much higher hit percentages than head-on attacks.Job FairWhat you do off the battlefield is arguably more important than what you do on it. Thanks to a stable economy, your characters can usually change job classes once they gain enough experience.Need a little more magic in your life? Try turning one of your grunts into a mage. There are more than 30 different job classes available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.Even in far-off fantasy lands, commercialism is a way of life. You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll end up spending your hard-earned greenbacks on shiny new stuff. Weapons and armor serve not only to boost your stats, but also grant special abilities to specific character types and species.While one sword might grant tremendous attack points, a seemingly lesser sword may give its wielder access to a special attack that can tip the scales in your favor. Thanks to the law system, one should never get too attached to a single piece of equipment.Face ValueGorgeous character illustrations and 2D sprites harken back to Square's 16-bit glory days. Each of the shops, inns, towns, and fields is superbly detailed, with subtle background animations.Final Fantasy Tactics Advancemaintains the series' stellar rep for technically and visually brilliant summon attacks.Uniquely,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancefeatures three separate display settings, depending on whether you're playing on the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, or the Game Boy Player. Each setting offers different levels of brightness, contrast, and saturation to appease even the most fickle of gamers.The only thing that can rival the on-screen wonders is the audio candy. It is no surprise why Square Enix's soundtracks are the most sought-after in the video game community.Lasting PowerNeedless to say, there are hours upon hours of gameplay packed into this tiny little cartridge. Square Enix has done a tremendous job in creating an easily accessible yet incredibly deep gameplay experience. Plug into one of the finest strategy RPG experiences ever created withFinal Fantasy Tactics Advance.","reviewerName":"J.

I love Bungie's masterpiece and will count the days until Halo3 comes out- but Gears of War destroyed my expectations of what a FPS could be like.

The high resolution screenshots on the web do NOT do this game justice. And the music is AMAZING to hear in the heat of combat.And the combat- nothing touches this. Your teeth will be clinched TIGHT the entire time- every bullet is a potential killer and you feel TERRIFIED as the cover you're behind begins to fall apart while Horde forces are flanking your position!!

Basically, you get the black Vita and Black Op:Declassified plus a 4gb memory card and a USB cord/power supply. All in all, this is a nice bundle. Reviews on the game itself vary. Personally, I think its okay, but I think that the value of the bundle as a whole is good, and the Vita itself is magnificent. The graphics and design are fairly unbelievable. While it saddens me to have waited to buy one, I'm glad to have done so as a bundle. I probably would have bought the game at some point, and the Vita without the bundle is the same price, so by my mind, that makes this an exceptional value. Plus, even though its the smallest memory card and you'll definitely need to upgrade, the inclusion of the 4 gb proprietary card gets you in the game. This will probably drop even further in price closer to Christmas, but even at the current $249, I have no regrets whatsoever in having purchased this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0007PLKZM","description":"Scarface: The World Is Yours takes you into a complicated world of excess and greed. You'll become Tony Montana, one of the most ruthless gangsters ever depicted on film. The original screenwriter has created an all-new storyline that authentically recreates the historical time period of the film, and gives you the chance to live out the events of the film -- or change them and create a new life story for the famous gangster.","reviewerName":"Marvin Powell","summary":"Um, this game is just not very good","reviewText":"Ever since the Mario and Sonic era, my favorite video games have been Sandbox games. Outside of the Smackdown vs Raw series, sandbox games are all that I play. Saint's Row and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (but not Grand Theft Auto IV, at all!) are some of my favorites. It's the closest thing video games have come to to virtual reality. Living in another world, doing things you could never get away with in real life. So, it has been my personal hunt to track down and play the very best sandboox games game developers have had to offer. Scarface isn't one of them.Where do I begin with this piece of junk game? Okay, on it's basic core level, it's not a bad game. It starts off real nice with an alternate reality version on Tony Montana escaping certain death towards the end of the movie. And then, it just goes downhill from there. On it's basic level, it's pretty similar to Grand Theft Auto III. However, there are a ton of minute things that just KILL any fun you otherwise would have with this title. I've clocked in about 12 hours or so in this game before writing this review. At this point, I've taken over all of Little Havana, and have accumulated close to a $1 million. But, I doubt things will pick up from this point. Let's break it down.The Story:It's okay, but very slow-paced, however. It takes forever to get things moving along. The story is good, considering it's a post-movie tale, and I think I'd prefer this over than just playing through the events of the movie up until the end. The one thing that sucks is the fact that Tony, in this game, is trying to kill Sosa, mainly to get his empire back and for revenge for him trying to kill him in his mansion. But anyone who's seen the movie already knows that Tony was sick of his empire towards the movie's end and that Sosa's hitmen got his sister killed. Now, I'd think, being that this is a game and sequel to the movie at the same time, Tony's main motive would be to build up his empire back so that he can avenge his sister, Gina. But, no, she isn't mentioned at all in this whole storyline! Tony just wants Sosa dead because he tried to kill him(and did, in the real thing.) Also, the particular hitman with the glasses who did him in, in the movie, doesn't show up at all, in the game, either. He seemed like he'd be a major threat.Graphics:I can't tell whether they are better or worse than GTA: San Andreas, but they're not that good. Personally, graphics are the least important thing I find in a video game and San Andreas' graphics are horrible, but that game is the pinnacle of sandbox gaming, so that proves my point. However, the colors in this game just hurt my eyes. I don't know if Little Havana is really that much of an eyesore, but it hurts to watch. Note to anyone playing this game: adjust the settings on your TV to dark. You don't want bright contrast for this game.Music and Voices:I GUESS it's an alright soundtrack considering Sierra's budget for this game and how the 80's weren't exactly the GREATEST era for music, but that's just my opinion. I guess it's good for an 80's soundtrack that isn't Vice City's. Most of  the songs are obsure 80's pop and Latin sounds, along with the Scarface Original Soundtrack, which let's be honest, isn't nearly as cool as the movie, itself. At least LL Cool J makes a stop for the game's soundtrack. There are some new and original songs in this as well, but they all have to be unlocked. From what I've heard, they try to emulate the 80's sound, but they rap and/or sing very modern, so it comes off sounding like modern day artists impersonating 80's tunes. And that's exactly what it is.The voice of Tony is alright, for what it's worth, but you can honestly tell it's not Pacino. For any of the time's he's not actually swearing, that is. There are a TON of celebrity cameos in this game. I'm guessing any famous person who loved the movie Scarface probably volunteered on their own to do a voice in this game, even if it's for some tiny bit part like one of Tony's mistresses or a street coke head. Ironically enough, many people, like Michael Rappaport and Lost's Daniel Dae Kim later on went to do voice acting in the far superior Saint's Row. Bam Margera, Vida Guerra, Diora Baird, Meagan Good, Cheech Marin, and Richard Roundtree are just a few minor celebrities who make a cameo voice in this game. Oh, and Mike Toreno from GTA himself, James Woods!Firing Controls:Pointing and shooting a gun at enemies is sort of a unique mix of auto-aiming and manual firing that I've never seen in another game before. Each weapon you use has it's own type of aiming radius for it that locks onto the body of an enemy. And you get a circle inside that radius to fine tune your shots for limb-specific damage. On paper, this sounds really innovative and cool, but not so much when you actually try it out. Now, if you shoot someone and don't move, it's not bad. But, the problem is, often times, you'll have to be shooting while ducking for cover and trying to avoid getting shot. Meaning, you'll have to shoot while moving. And this is where the aiming messes up. Because you fine-tune aiming and walk around the same way. So, often times, the game won't know whether you mean to walk or dodge shots, or if you're trying to blow someone's head off in the shot radius. It's problematic, but one of the least troublesome things in this game.Character Controls:By far, the WORST problem in this game. And specifially, it's the (non-)ability to run. Tony Montana can't run whatsoever in this game! When you try to run with him, you have, literally, only two seconds of sprint time with the guy. After that, you won't be able to run with him, AT ALL! Which will lead to death after death after death with him. Oh, and you also lose ALL your money and drugs when you die, so, that's fun, as well.The fact that running is pretty much impossible. And when you're about to die, it becomes even more impossible, as Tony limps in pain when he's hurt, so even if you did have maximum stamina, you STILL can't run when your health is low. So, even if you're literally just inches away from your armor-providing car, the fact that the dummy can't run will leave you dead against your window. And not only is effective running incapable, but you can only run in ONE direction! That direction, specifically being up on the control stick. Trying to go in any other direction will make Tony go back to his extremely slow, standard walking animation. So, you can only run in a straight line, and you can only run for less than four seconds. The inability to actually run will end up being your biggest handicap in this game, bar none. In fact, the game might actually be \"Good\" if they had just allowed you to run and just threw out the idea of 'stamina,' altogether.Oh, yeah. You also can't jump in this game, either. And if you can't jump, you also can't climb. So, yeah, there's a two-foot wall in front of me, but guess what? I'm going to have to walk 300 FEET down the street to get around it. Sounds exciting, doesn't it? Fist fighting in this game is far better than GTA IV's slapfest, but it's still extremely limited. Basically, all you can do is shove someone and punch. There are counter moves and grab-em-by-the-collar combos, but basically it's either shove someone or punch them in a fight. Luckly, you won't have to fist fight very often. It's mostly only used to get information out of guys without killing them.Now, while it's technically not supposed to be used for running, there IS a way to actually have Tony be able to actually run. And that is if you have a weapon out and hold down L1 and the usual run button of X. This will put Tony in \"duck and cover\" mode, which is normally used to shield yourself, however, it is the only way you can get Tony to run for longer than three seconds, so if you decide to play this game, you better get used to this in times of heated shootouts.Driving:While the driving in this game may suck, it's nowhere nearly as bad as the driving controls in that utter-bomb called GTA IV. Most of the cars have poor handling and move very, very slowly, with only the \"super cars\" that you can buy in your garage (like the \"Shark\") being the exceptions to this rule. I don't hold the game makers, Sierra, against this, though. While Saint's Row may be the second best sandbox game out there, even their driving controls are bad. No non-racing game outside the PS2 Grand Theft Auto trilogy has really had decent car controls, in my opinion. And this game ain't no San Andreas.Game Layout:They way they have things set up in this game are horrible, crazy, and bad, all at the same time. For one thing, you can only save the game at banks, where Tony is to deposit his \"dirty\" money that he's gained. You'd think you'd be able to save at your actual mansion, right? But, no. Nothing happening, there. In fact, the mansion's only purpose is to \"pimp it out\" with gawdy and tacky furnishure, Scarface style. You can't even use the \"Femme Fatale\" mistresses you gain in the game for anything. They just stand around in your mansion, literally doing nothing. (They often complain about how they have nothing to do). No Hot Coffee or anything. You can't even use them on missions. Other than boosting your stats by a small amount and standing around, looking pretty, they are completely useless. Thay ARE pretty, though.Before you're allowed to save though, you must play the minigame to see how much of your hard-earned cash the bank will take a cut of. This minigame will be used all throughout the game and it never changes. It's the \"stop in the closest to 12 in the edge of the clock without going over\" minigame that they use in Baseball all the time to determine the power of a pitch. While it's incredibly easy to always land inbetween 11 and 12 every time, it does become a bit annoying in that this mingame is used in virtually everything that involves making deals with people. It's a lot harder to actually lose the minigame and stop somewhere low than it is to make a great deal by stopping at 11 o'clock. But like I said, EVERY time you need to make a game save, you'll be put through this interest cut minigame at the bank. And you'll need to save often if you want to keep your money.Saving:Everytime you die, you lose all the money you have on you, which is usually tens of thousands of dollars. The money you have on you, usually made through some illegal activity is called \"dirty\" money and the money you have tucked away safe at the bank is called \"clean\" money. If you die or get beat up or get arrested or make a bad deal, all the money you have on you is lost and gone forever. And often times, mostly through selling coke, it's easy to get a lot of money very very quickly. The only way to keep it safe is to spend it right away or put it in the bank (where you'll lose some of it by them). Not doing this will make all those missions and deals you've done pointless. Now, while I get the \"realism\" of bank interest percentages and being robbed after getting beat up or arrested, do any of these things really make a game more fun? No. Now, while I understand there having to be some consequences for losing, I just don't get why there are SO many ways you could lose your cash? And why there are so many ways you could easily die. Tony Montana does easily die in this game, by the way, with your health bar being a little penny and all.Heat:This brings me to Heat. Now, the way you escape the cops is to escape their multi-block radius of pursuit until you've gotten away. Now, if this sounds familiar, that's because Grand Theft Auto IV *blatantly* and shamefully ripped off this exact idea from this game. So much so that the graphics on the map are EXACTLY the same! There are two differences, though. In this game, you've got a time limit to your escape, which is really only like, 60 seconds. If you can't escape then, then you automatically lose and are arrested. Now, the time limit is annoying, but this wouldn't be so bad if the Miami in this game didn't have the most obtruse streets ever made! Very rarely will you come across any roads that just go straight up and down or left and right. The street design layout is even worse and harder to drive around than Las Venturas was in San Andreas. There will be many times when you come to a dead-end street or a street where you go \"why can't I just drive through that?\" or \"climb over that?\" This makes a simple thing like escaping the cops ten times harder.When it comes to doing illegal activities that the police haven't caught you for yet, Scarface: The World Is Yours has a more subtle way of making you a felon. Instead of a one-to-five or one-to-six Wanted Level, you have a Heat meter that climbs as you do more and more illegal activities in the open, that stays that way. I'm getting that this was done as Sierra's way to not copy GTA's Wanted Star format. The higher the Heat meter is, the more likely the cops are to try to arrest you. While there are a few other ways to lower your Heat, the main way will be bribing off Vice to lower your meter down. That's right, you have to once again PAY for something in this game! A small amount of Heat reduction will cost you around 5 grand, while a full bar will be upwards of around $20,000. So, needless to say, it's best you don't have a lot of Heat on you before you go into a highly illegal mission or side quest. _ Because the more Heat on you, the more likely you'll have to escape the cops' perimeter before sixty seconds are up._ Heat also goes for rival gangs, as well, and the more Gang Heat you have, the faster and harder they'll try to kill you once they see you. Of course, if you're like me, you're not going to want to spend your hard-earned money paying off your enemies to not kill you! That's the p--sy's way out. With cops, you almost have no choice, but with gangs, why would you want to give them your money? You can also lower heat by Fast Talking cops or by selling coke to gang members who want to buy. Once again, that clock meter minigame will be involved. And if you fail with them, they'll try to kill you.Missions and Side Quests:The missions are standard GTA fare. However, the execution of how they're laid out is a bit frustrating. For example, in one of the delivery missions, you'll have to drive to a rendevous point, where someone will tell you to drive off to an arbitary point, where you'll get your delivery van, drop off deliveries at certain points, and then, will have to drive the delivery van back to a certain point, and meet the guy who set you up with the mission in order to fully complete it. And yes, you can fail the WHOLE thing if you don't go back and let the guy know you're finished doing the deliveries. Isn't that annoying and extremely redundant? What about you just meet the guy and get the truck at the same spot, and do the deliveries? Once you're finished, you COULD just call the guy on your 80's Satellite phone to let him know you're finished, but why is that so important to begin with? If you're done, you're done. Is a confirmation of finishing up really so important?There are three different menu screens in this game. One for when you pause that has options and all that, one you access by hitting L2, which is how you see the map, do missions, lower your Heat, or check on your Fronts, and a third screen for when you want to buy Exotics, which are henchmen, vechiles, or mansion furnishure. All these menus can be very confusing, especially when trying to remember what menu has what and all. Other than your main missions, there aren't too many \"side quests.\" There are \"Felix leads\" which will help you find drug suppliers to buy coke from and a few other easy quick cash missions. But really, your main missions and drug supply are all you'll have to concern yourself with. There are three unlockable characters which will serve as your right-hand men, but only two of them actually help you. And if you consider the glitch of the Assassin missions NOT lowering your Cop Heat like they're supposed to, you really only have One useful employee, the Enforcer, who you can play as to take care of enemy gangs.Weapons:The different targeting for each weapon is kind of cool, but other than that, there's nothing special to be said. What sucks is you only get three weapons to carry, at a time. That's right, only three! And until you unlock the Arms Dealer, firearms are hard to come by. What's even worse is how very confusing it is to have seperate gun menus from ammo menus. I mean, why can't you just buy more of the same gun to get more ammo, like in any OTHER sandbox shooter? Buying ammo completely seperate from buying your guns is not only needlessly frustrating, but it's also very annoying. It's not like buying the ammo seperate actually helps you save money or anything. In fact, the ammo is probably a lot MORE expensive than the actual gun, itself! Once again, it's all about the mun-ay. To illustrate how annoying this is, you can have three Micro SMG's in your Weapon Locker, but all of them can be ammoless (and more than likely, are) thus, defeating their purpose cause you didn't buy the ammo for them, as well, which is sold seperately! Also, having a Weapon Locker usually means having spare guns and ammo, all the time. But in this game, that doesn't really apply as it's main existence is only because you can only hold three guns at at time. And no, there's no option or unlockable of always having spare ammo or guns in your locker when you need it, like in Saint's Row's weapon stash. If you want spare ammo, you're gonna have to spend thousands of dollars getting it yourself, putting them in your Weapons Locker, and then, getting NEW guns because you just put the ones you had away! At least, though, they give you the option of getting your weapons out the back of the trunk of any car you currently own. This and being able to call for your car are probably the ONLY good ideas in this entire game that should be standard in other sandbox shooters. Weapons available to you in your car trunk. Being able to have your car delivered to you. Those all better be in Saint's Row 2!Cool Features:You can talk to people or have Tony curse at anytime in the game. Now, while I think a vital button like Circle could've had more important uses, (like, for RUNNING, for example!) the ability to talk to anyone in the game and have Tony say things relevant and specific to that person (instead of generic, reusable lines) is pretty cool. He can mack on any of the hot women of Miami, intimidate gang members, curse at bad drivers, or just give \"advice\" to any men passing by. You can also \"pimp out\" your mansion, if you're into that sort of thing. Maybe it's just me, but interior decorating doesn't exactly seem like the type of thing the people who would want to play this game would want to do. It's not like you exactly get \"Sims 2\" type of customization, either. The choices are pretty slim, and uninspired.The biggest thing about this game is Tony's Blind Rage ability. Throughout the game, every time Tony does something, uh... let's put it \"manly\" or \"cool,\" it adds to his Balls meter. This comes from the \"I only have my Balls and my Word\" quote from the movie. Most of the time, this will come from Tony shouting or taunting someone as he kills them via the infamous \"say hello to my little friend\" scene from the movie. When you fill up your Balls meter, which is usually about 500 to 1,000 points or so (I haven't checked how much), he will have the ability to go into Blind Rage. When in Blind Rage, the player will go into first-person view, everything will slow down, Tony will be invincible, and every successful kill will gain Tony health. It's just too bad that this is one of the ONLY ways he can heal himself. And as cool as Blind Rage is, it's way too short. Maybe about ten seconds or less. I know it can be increased as you progress through the game, but no one really cares that far in. The problem is, often times, it'll be full and you won't need it. And the time it's most useful, during gang fights, it won't be as effective as it should be, and as you'd think it would be. It's main benefit is the gained health. Other than that, it's nothing an AK-47 can't just as easily achieve.I should also mention the \"executions\" you can do in the game, which are cool one-shot kills you can do on anyone if you happen to be within grabbing range. Of course, how often will you be able to get within a few feet of someone in a gun fight, though?Annoyances:The fact that you can't jump, at all. Which also means you can't climb ledges or anything. It's also actually illegal to have your weapon out in any times other than a gunfight or mission that requires it. The police will hunt you down to death if they see you with it, and bad guys will hold their weapons out at you, ready to fire, if you go into any deals with it out. Come on! That is so realistically lame!Speaking of weapons, Tony can't use his weapon on anyone or anything that isn't recognized as a potential \"threat\" by the game. Even if it's some jerk who runs you over in his car. If he or she is not a \"bad guy shooting at you\" you can't do a thing to them.It's also just a bit annoying how everyone in sandbox games, particularly in those that take place before the mid 90's, have cell phones, including Scarface: The World Is Yours! I mean, I get it and all, but not even the filthy rich had cell phones back in the 80's! They were practally unheard of and barely even existed. It was so annoying that CJ had a cell phone in GTA: San Andreas. And yet, here they do the same thing in this game. It's like, can people REALLY not believe in a world that existed before mobile phones? It's so absurd and unrealistic that Tony Montana has a cell phone in this game! A car phone, maybe. Pay phones on every street corner would've made more sense. But a cell phone, honestly? That's modern-day bull crap, and everyone knows it!__ And I can't forget to mention the mandatory tutorials they force you to do in this game. They're so frustrating! It's like, \"I know how to press start and use a menu. WHY are you making me go through this long tutorial that I can't avoid or skip over in any way?\" And of course, all of the tutorials are done in \"practice\" mode meaning that they don't count, so after being forced to do it by the game, you'll then have to do it AGAIN, for real in order for it to count! This comes up a LOT as there are a lot of things they want to teach you how to use in this game. And you can't skip any of them. It's also incredibly easy to get hit by a car. I mean, even at low speeds, they can really mess you up. And when you die, they have the subtle and classy \"You F--ked Up\" screen. This is while all your money is being subtracted from you, and more than likely you died due to a gaming flaw, NOT because you simply \"F--ked Up\" in the mission. How infuriating that screen is I cannot describe to you in words. It's like the game spitting in your face for you playing it.Conclusion:They almost KILL the legacy of Tony Montana with this game. Seeing him do things like waiting in line at the bank or calling someone to pick him up make him look weak and as normal as anyone else. Having him have to do certain things in this title make him look pretty tame, compared to the legacy Al Pacino portrayed him as in the original movie. After a while, you start to learn how to seperate the original Bad-A-- to this cheap, watered-down duplicate of him. This game had a LOT of potential and some proper game testing, and a little bit of tweaking could've made this game work. The game almost holds it's own better than other GTA clones out there, and is almost as good as the non-GTA sandbox games that are proven successes, such as Saint's Row. However, almost isn't good enough and this game just simply fails to entertain. There are too many glitches, problems, mistakes, or just stupid decisions to make this worthwhile. Not to mention how other than the every-other-word-being-a-curse-word vocabulary, this is a watered down version of Tony Montana. Rent it if you're a Scarface mega fan, but avoid at all costs, if you only slightly seemed curious. There are much better titles out there.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-02-2008"}

I waited to buy one. I finally did and I'm pretty happy with it. It's nice to get Nintendo in HD. But I've also had a few issues. Here's the rundown:THE GOODI didn't get the appeal of the Gamepad at first. But having played it, I admit it's pretty neat. Playing a game on the Gamepad while somebody else is watching TV or while you're in bed is actually pretty fun. Not necessary, but neat.The graphics are amazing. I'm sure PS4 and XOne will have higher graphics processing power, but I can't imagine I'd never have a need for more.The eShop is very user friendly, easy to navigate, and downloads pretty fast. Also, Amazon and Netflix offer HD and plays well.THE BADThe operating system is a bit slow. Nothing fatal, but load times are sometimes considerable. Also, unlike the Wii's motion controls, the Wii U doesn't revolutionize gaming and there is a very big risk that games will try to force the Gamepad in gimmicky ways. The best uses of the Gamepad I've experiences thus far are simply having a map on the screen, which begs the question of whether the Gamepad is really worth it (Nintendo claims the system is so expensive because of the Gamepad).THE VERDICTIf you have the money to spare, I definitely recommend the Wii U. There still aren't many games on it, but I'm sure more will come out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000HCL5QO","reviewerName":"Zeph Greenwell","summary":"Similar to The Sims but a lot better!","reviewText":"Viva Pi&ntilde;ata is a mix of elements from The Sims, a little bit of Pokemon, and some new elements unique to this game. Like The Sims, you start with a small lot and your objective is to build it into your dream home, or in this case dream garden. You start with a small lot that expands as you progress in the game and you can fill that space with plants, such as flowers or crop, or structures. Depending on which type of items you have in your garden you will attract certain types of pi&ntilde;atas. For example, by planting flowers you can attract butterflies and bumblebees. If you meet certain requirements the pi&ntilde;atas will become residents in your garden. Also by having certain types of pi&ntilde;atas as residents you can attract even more pi&ntilde;atas (i.e. snakes will come if you have mice in your garden, more on this later). Using your chocolate coins, you can work and rework your garden to build it to your specific tastes and to attract the types of pi&ntilde;atas you like. As the game goes on the pi&ntilde;atas get more interesting. You can have lion and elephant pi&ntilde;atas become residents in your garden, but also the requirements to do so get much more difficult.Like Pokemon you can make your objective to collect all of the different types of pi&ntilde;atas on Viva Pi&ntilde;ata, but this would not be easy because many pi&ntilde;atas have requirements that contradict other pi&ntilde;atas. For example one pi&ntilde;ata might require you to have more the 60% of your garden covered with water, while another pi&ntilde;ata might require you to have 60% of your garden covered with tall grass. Also, some pi&ntilde;atas do not get along and will fight each other if left in the same garden. This requires that you develop your garden to attract only the pi&ntilde;atas you want and, possibly, to exclude the pi&ntilde;atas you don't want. Typically in a single game you will not be trying to get all the pi&ntilde;atas to become residents but building a garden around certain specific pi&ntilde;atas. Since you can have multiple gardens, or just continually redesign a single garden, you can create gardens catered to your different favorite pi&ntilde;atas.The game has in inbuilt pi&ntilde;ata food chain. You will probably be required to feed some of your resident pi&ntilde;atas to the visiting pi&ntilde;atas to get them to become residents. For example, to get the snake pi&ntilde;ata to join it must eat a mouse pi&ntilde;ata (the mouse only has to eat a turnip to join). You can imagine this only gets much more complicated for pi&ntilde;atas like the lion. This is done very tastefully. The attacking pi&ntilde;ata will throw objects at its prey until it breaks the pi&ntilde;ata open and then proceeds to eat the candy that spills out. This pi&ntilde;ata food chain is one of the innovative features that make this game unique and add to the complexity of the game.Another feature that makes the game is the ability to breed your pi&ntilde;atas. Once you have a pi&ntilde;ata as a resident there is a second set of requirements you must meet before breeding, and of course you'll have to meet them with at least two pi&ntilde;atas. In Viva Pi&ntilde;ata the pi&ntilde;atas have no gender so you can breed any two pi&ntilde;atas of the same species. One you've met the requirements you can tell the two pi&ntilde;atas to \"romance\" and after playing a short maze style mini-game you will get to see a short video of that pi&ntilde;atas \"Romance Dance\". Neither the game nor the dances are suggestive and would be deemed acceptable by any conservative homeshool mom. The breeding is essentially the way to make money as you can sell your pi&ntilde;atas for a pretty large amount of chocolate coins.Viva Pi&ntilde;ata is a great looking game, but the big seller is the game play. If you like The Sims then you will love Viva Pi&ntilde;ata. This game however isn't limited to a specific demographic. You might feel like a little kid putting this brightly colored game into your Xbox 360, but you will have nothing but fun building your garden and breeding your pi&ntilde;atas. This game is truly a can not miss title for anyone with a 360.As an added note you can trade items with other players over Xbox Live. That is the only online feature of this game, but you can trade even if you only have an Xbox Live silver membership. Parents with younger kids will be happy to know that this game is appropriate online as well as offline and the game comes with instructions on how to set up your child's Xbox Live account.

Where the nunchuck has motion sensing, the PS3 Move Navigation Controller is solely for button pushing.This small, easy to hold device lets you use your left hand for button related tasks - using the joystick for moving around a landscape, using the standard X and O buttons for performing actions. So for example if you are in a sword game you can have the motion-sensitive wand in your right hand, swinging your sword, while using your navigator in your left hand to walk across the field of battle and seek out your next opponent.You might ask, if all this controller does is let you use a joystick and a few buttons, why even buy it? Why not just use a normal controller in the left hand? Certainly you can do that - but the normal controller is set up for two handed use. Many people find it challenging to hold that controller just with the left hand in a way that easily gets them access to the joystick and the two buttons. With this navigation controller setup, it clearly is all arranged for one handed use.If you want to play a game that requires both hands to be motion sensitive - for example a boxing game where you punch with your left hand and also punch with your right hand - this is NOT the controller you want. For that type of activity you'll want two wand controllers, one for each hand.That means that for a typical player on a PS3 move system you need two wand controllers PLUS one navigation controller. You wouldn't use all three at the same time, but some games will have you using the two wand controllers and other games will have you use the wand in one hand and the navigation controller in the other.You can see where this is going. If you have two gamers in the household who want to play head to head games, you now need FOUR wand controllers plus two navigation controllers to have them covered. It's time to give your PS3 system its own shelf, to handle all these accessories!In any case the nav controller works well, is very useful for games, and I highly recommend it for any Move gamers.We purchased our controller from Amazon with our own funds.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2010"}

You land and start fighting off infantry, tanks, other mechs, and more.There are a bunch of single player missions that you go through on your quest to rid the planet of the enemy. The graphics are quite nice, with rolling fields, rocky mountains, bases full of bridges and vehicles. You can blow up boats, take out bridges, demolish large buildings. You can stomp on infantry and shoot down helicopters. It's very destructive, but all in the name of saving the planet.The mech takes a little getting used to, because of the combinations of flying, twisting torso, movement, and weapon selections you have. But really, for any gamer that's played games for more than a year, this shouldn't be a problem. The controls are rather intuitive and we were up and running with the mech in no time flat. Your ability to pretty much go anywhere and demolish anything means that you can take a number of different approaches to any problem. Add in the fact that you can often choose from a variety of mechs to take on the mission, each with its own configuration, and you can really get involved.Still, the missions are single player and your multiplayer gameplay on your own system is two player only. The single player missions can probably be won in a weekend if you go for the easy settings. But all of these things are merely TRAINING for the true on line experience, with XBox Live!!No AI is ever going to match the true cunning of a human (at least not any time soon) and when you play on XBox Live, you get to play against entire teams of mechs! You can play Capture the Flag, deathmatch, team deathmatch, and MANY other types of games. It is amazingly fun! And you really do need that single player or two-player local mode to practice in, so you can hold your own against the Mech players from around the world.Highly, highly recommended if you have XBox Live.

As a teenage girl named Heather, players must explore and unravel the mysterious connection between the god-forsaken town and her inner fears. The game features enhanced graphical detail, a more complex storyline, and even more grotesque monsters than the previous games.","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"An excellent game but a flawed development in the series.","reviewText":"First of all Silent Hill 3 boasts probably the best SOUND and GRAPHICS for any PS2 game. Those of you that have surround sound will be shaken to the core of your soul in this survival horror amusement. The cut scenes are hyper-realistic and the Silent Hill 3 maps and worlds are well above standard for a game of its type.I am now on my third round playing this game and so I have enough experience with it to be able to conduct a realistic review. The first thing you should know is that you do not have to play part 1 or 2 in order to enjoy this sequel but it would help if you did. Fans of this series will note that the game is largely a follow up to the 1st game, revisiting many of the places that where in the original.The premise in this game is that you play a teenager, Heather, who must discover her past in order to reveal her true identity and save the world from an apocalypse. Sadly this is one of reasons why the game looses a star. It will not please fans of the series to discover that the plot is vastly different from the other two as it is no longer psychologically creepy and instead aims for more scares and blood and guts as Heather tries to prevent the day of reckoning. Although the game gets top marks for the horror and scares it is certainly devoid of the psychological impact that the other two games in the series had. The plot is also marred by an incoherent storyline that really does not make you care that much for the main character or the pending doom that the game is laying down. There are other reasons why this great game looses a star. There are not enough variations in the monsters which can be broken down into two-header zombie dogs, giant walking pillow cases, fat blobs, hammer head type creatures of large and small sizes, three types of stabbing insects, deranged nurses and floor crawlers that look like crocodiles. There needs to be more deviation in the monsters! Many of them are just repeated in size, however their locations are perfectly timed in the game. The other downside is that the game is vastly shorter than Silent Hill 2, being only on one DVD and can be completed in less than 6 hours on the first try (however you will spend a few days at it.) On my second attempt I complete the game in 2 hours. I believe the game can be completed in about 1 hour if you drive at it. The other downside is that the game takes places in two different locations (1) A shopping mall (2) Silent Hill. There was certainly hardly any Silent Hill and only two place to visit in that area! - The Hospital and the Amusement park. The final location takes place in an old church. It is also too linear - the game really only has one direction that is controlled by locked doors and items that you must gather in order to proceed to the next level. Overall the game does not feel like part of the Silent Hill series. I hope that the premise for the next one is located only in Silent Hill with more areas to visit, more monsters to kill and a similar psychological premise like the 2nd one in the series. There also needs to be more outdoor daytime scenes like Silent Hill 2. Too much of this game is fogged or takes place in the dark. The weapons and puzzles in this game are adequate although many of the cooler ones must be unlocked after you play the game at least once.The upside is that the game, as a stand alone survival horror, delivers in aces. There is lots of action, blood and scares. The locations are unbelievable and the game IS frightening. Some of the rooms will have your jaw dropping to the ground and your eyes popping out of your head. The sound effects are soooo creepy and the shocks do come thick and fast. It is certainly one the best games you can own for the PS2 and is streaks and bounds ahead of most other survival horror games.Overall it is an excellent game that should have been produced under a different title without the Silent Hill locations. I feel that the second game is still the definitive of the three although the graphics and the sound are not nearly as good. A thumb up for Silent Hill 3 though but both thumbs up for Silent Hill 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2003"}

However, I cannot recommend Mafia to anyone who has already played a truly great driving/gangster game such as Grand Theft Auto 3, or who doesn't like attempting a single mission 30+ times. Overall, the idea of letting you play a Mafia don in the 1930s is a good one; however, it's just poorly implemented in this game.Gameplay: Your character is a taxi driver who is forced into a career of crime.  By completing missions (driving, killings, vandalism, more driving, etc.), you rise in the ranks of the Salieri crime family.  Much of the gameplay, from the controls (mouse, keyboard, and optionally a gamepad) to mission design, is easy to pick up and much like GTA3.  Nonetheless, the big problem with Mafia is that the gameplay is tedious and at some points down right boring.  While the city you do your dirt in is very beautifully rendered, it's rather dead and does not have the bustle and liveliness of GTA3's Liberty City or Vice City.  There's no reason to ever get out of your car as you are driving between missions, since there are no ammo shops to visit, mini-missions to unlock, or other things to do. You can literally spend 20 minutes driving from Salieri's bar to the next mission site, and there is absolutely no feeling of accomplishment once you finally arrive.On the good side, the developers of the game have tried to make it realistic, which is both the strength but also many of the weaknesses of the game.  The cars look fantastic, though they handle poorly. Also, unlike GTA3, you can't commit outrageous traffic violations without drawing the police, and you can't just jump in and steal any parked car.  The animation of the character models look realistic and scenary feels authentic.  Also, though it has the automatic save system that GTA3 has, Mafia saves the game at more points, so that you don't have to do too much backtracking if (I mean when) you fail a mission.Now, for the bad side. The cars are just a chore to drive. Bad handling, low horsepower, slippery tires, you name it. And given that there is so much driving required by the game, the developers should have allowed you to skip some of the non-eventful driving scenes. To make matters worse, many of the missions are timed and the in-game map is useless.  You'll lose a number of missions just searching for the bridges that connect the city together (no roads or bridges appear on the in-game map). It is hard to imagine why the developers of this game thought that beginning and ending missions with such annoyingly long and tedious driving sequences would be fun to players.And now, for the ugly. Yes, the racing mission (#6) is as awful as many people have said. Even though I have the patched version of the game that includes a difficulty slider for the race, it was still too hard on the \"very easy\" setting. The race is way too long, the track has way too many sharp turns, the race car is way to prone to spin-outs and roll-overs, and the controls (gamepad or keyboard) just don't cut it for what is required.  I tried this mission over 30 times and never won the race and thus never finished the game (which is rare for me).  The race was the worst instance of the frustrations of gameplay, but there were plenty more.Graphics: The real shame is that Mafia, as tedious and poorly designed as it is, is a beautiful game. The cutscenes, though a bit too long sometimes, are well done and even the lip-syncing is better than most games I've played. The cars are shiny and sleek and show damage when they are abused. The city itself is well rendered and driving in the countryside is just heavenly.  It's just too bad that some of the energy that was expended on creating such realistic graphics was not used to make a truly exciting game.Sound: Everything is cool in this department.  The voice acting is well done; cars, weapons, and other things sound as they should; and the music is fine.Replay/value: Since I only paid $10 for this game, it's hard to feel cheated, even though I was able to complete only 5 of the 20 missions.  My disappointment is largely about what this game could have been with just a bit more effort and testing.  If you are a very patient player and don't mind long stretches of repetitive gameplay (such as all of the dull driving that you'll be doing) and can find a way to beat the racing mission, then this might be worth your while.  However, if you are expecting a game with a lot of exciting car action, very original missions, and anything approaching GTA3's funny, openended mayhem, definitely look elsewhere.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2004"}

While there's bound to be some that consider it to be classic(it is), I'm betting there are more who will try the second one and never look back.

Of course, you can probably tell that from the fact that it's three discs long. From the great music to the excellent battle system to the plot with a depth rarely seen in video games to the wonderful graphics... okay, so the graphics aren't wonderful. In fact, they suck. The exception to the graphics comes in the fairly cool looking occasional movie scenes. Not being a huge RPG fan, I took the fairly direct route through the game. RPG extremists have a ton more to do, from raising chocobos to fighting that (expletive deleted) Ruby Weapon. Also, the special attacks are really cool. They range from fancy swordfighting techniques like cross-slash to a guy who turns into popular horror movie characters (a Jason imitation, complete with chainsaw, helped me defeat Safer Sephiroth) . Anyway, this is a great game that is worth more than twenty bucks, so get it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2004"}

This is not your tpyical first person shooter of \"Blow stuff up\".  Stratagy plays a large part and most of the missions are quite challenging.  The enemy is smarter and more ruthless and smarter then in the previous games.  Although they sometimes still manage to do dumb stuff that baffles the mind. There was one incident where I only had 20 helth left and the 6 guys behind this one door came at me 1 at a time.  Now only a computer would ever think that was clever.  You ca preety much have a lot of fun with this game The force powers are wonderful and the movements precise (this was not the case in DF 2) you have force speed, force jump, force heal Force Lightning and epic lightsaber Duels(in fact this is pretty mucha ll you do in the multiplayer modes because if you go after 16 other guys armed with lightsabers with a blaster rifle you will die.)  I mean you just wouldn't die the other players will mop the floor with you.My impression - I liked this game a whole lot but it seemed to me that that the game was really scripted at some points too focused on a linear completion of the mission.The most striking example of this is the first mission where (with the learning curve) I wandered around for almost 2 hours looking for the stupid code keys.  Then having found the code keys a door was opened.  Even though the mission technicallly ended at that point you were still only halfway through.Conclusion-Don't let peety compliants such as this keep you from buying the game it was stil very fun","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00BGA9YZK","description":"","reviewerName":"D. L. Rivera \"someone\"","summary":"I've tried..for so long","reviewText":"I have tried for so long to defend this series. I have always wanted it to break out of its slump and become more than a niche shooter. But alas, after so long trying to defend it, I can sadly say this is a disappointment. I have had the game for a few months now, and can honestly say I have seen the community diminish greatly. Its a decent shooter at best that relies to heavily on its gorgeous graphics, but sadly that's all it is. The factions are comical and it just makes it hard to be believed as a serious struggle or war between 2 factions. The after match taunts are humorous but ultimately feel misplaced and disconnected from the world.There is little to no customization in multiplayer, the sound effects of the guns are some how worse than the previous installments, and it just doesnt feel right. The killzone mercenary vita game has much better gameplay than this, and that is a sad thing. For instance, in the vita game, you can shoot while ziplining, but in Shadowfall, you cant, explain how this is acceptable?! It moves far to slow, even for its own good, and it just doesnt feel like a killzone game. The helghast are nothing to be feared, the VSA are nothing but tools with no personalities, and the guns are just so few and generic. For some reason, even with an excellent connection, it takes forever to load a game, and I often get kicked out with a message saying server error?I tried so hard to defend this game, and I fought to like it, but alas, it is time to end the fight and just accept that Killzone seriously needs a reboot with a better developer. Killzone vita was a much better game in terms of core gameplay, whereas this one seems to struggle with its identity. It doesnt know if it wants to be serious, or comical, and sadly it fails miserably at both. This is one those games that I want to root for, but cringe every time I think of playing it. This game feels more like a spin off than anything. As a fan of the idea of Killzone and the PS4, I can say, save your money till this drops in price, it is sadly not worth it. Great graphics, just bland and annoying game play, nothing more.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2014"}

If you want thrills and absolute extreme speed, destruction and absurdity (like inBurnout Paradise), it isn't. It's a very good looking racing simulator, with emphasis on owning, styling, tuning and racing as in real life. The amount of detail is striking (cars look to be modeled down to the nuts and bolts), but it isn't the greatest \"party\" game, when (locally) only two players race around in a lifelike environment. It's very simply about creating a dream garage of nice cars, taking good care of them and putting them on the track. The cars are all yours just as you made them, but if you aren't a car or racing aficionado, it does become a rather dull experience. The strongest side of the game is playing it on a big high definition television, and watching the sun shine off the chassi of your very own Ferrari, not any overtly thrilling racing matches.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000G7PMX2","reviewerName":"Pikminfan \"bobsworld3\"","summary":"Sure, its got issues but don't be a hater","reviewText":"Of the four launch games I purchased for my Nintendo Wii (Zelda, Call of Duty 3, Red Steel & Rayman Raving Rabbids)-it seems puzzling that R.S. is the one I have logged the most hours on.  (Due in part-I'm sure, to the fact that Zelda T.P. seems a little intimidating to me at the moment).  Red Steel seems like a fairly shallow game at first-average in every way that it is possible to be average.  You would think given the fact that it's steeped in Japanese culture and set in the underground world of the Yakuza that it would be bristling with style and flair.  Surprisingly this is not the case.  As a matter of fact-at first glance Red Steel seems like a generic first person shooter you might find in a bargain bin.  Stylistically it's just about as \"meh\" as they come.  However-that being said, the game's graphics are still very pleasing and can be very colorful and bold at times.  (By the way-don't judge the character models on amazon's supplied images.  These must be from an earlier build of the game because the in-game models look five hundred times better)  As I played a little farther into the game though,Red Steel began to dig it's claws into me and what I found was a fun, entertaining fps with good gun play, a nice variety of weapons and a unique targeting system.  In short, Red Steel's style short comings have nothing to do with it's ability to entertain on multiple levels.  But sadly there is a problem with Red Steel, and that my friends is the busted sword fighting.  The ability to fight enemies with a Japanese blade is one of the initial things that was supposed to set Red Steel apart from other first person shooters.  Now that I've had the unfortunate pleasure of playing these bits, I honestly wished they hadn't been included.  Sadly, these segements unfairly puts a damper on the whole game.  In short, the sword fighting bits are terribly unresponsive.  Swing your heart out with the Wii-mote ladies and gents, you MIGHT get the on screen action to follow suit.  But more than likely, the game won't register your moves-or the on screen follow-up will be so delayed as to throw off your timing completely.  Try getting some of the special moves you earn to work on an enemy in the heat of battle.  I've had rocket science exams that were easier.  In an otherwise fun game, these sword fighting bits feel broken & ill conceived in every way.  In fact, you be cruising right along having a blast gunning down enemies with various weapons-then suddenly you reach a sword fighting segment and the game comes to an earth shattering halt.  Why, oh why couldn't they have fixed this before the game shipped!?  Another gripe I have is the fact that even though you are given new sword techniques and tips for fighting-they mean precious little little in the end.  Just to check on a suspicion I had-I fought several enemies in a row by merely dodging their attacks and countering with the most basic slash possible, no technique, nothing fancy what-so-ever.  Guess what?  I had more luck doing this than if actually trying to use a skill!  How pathetic is that?  Honestly.  I've heard rumors that a Red Steel 2 is already in development and I hope that this is true.  I'd love to see another one.  But Ubi Soft had better fix the completely broken sword controls before they even think about releasing a sequel.  If they can do that, then maybe we'll have a truly worthy game to play.  It's disheartening to see an otherwise fun game get overshadowed by its worthless sword fighting segments.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2006"}

{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Marvin Powell","summary":"A quick and dirty Mass Effect 3 review","reviewText":"MASS EFFECT 3 Review(Originally posted March 19, 2012. Re-posted August 19, 2012.)Okay, so there are more than enough reviews on here that complain about the ending. I won't do that (much), and will just give you the nitty-gritty.Millions-year-old machine gods called the Reapers wipe out advanced life in the galaxy every fifty millennia and our time is due. It's up to Commander Shepard and his team of space-faring soldiers to put an end to a millions-year-old cycle of death and destruction, once and for all. This will mean uniting entire civilizations and putting to end hundreds-year-long wars in order to bring about the intergalactic unity needed to take out such an unimaginable threat. Can Shepard pull it off?PROS:- Fantastic story (up until the ending).- Emotion provoking characters.- Characters move around the Normandy and interact and engage with other teammates more often.- Excellent dialogue, along with many funny characters and jokes.- Engaging gameplay.- Expanded RPG elements.- Expanded weapons and customization.- Expanded military class elements.- More detailed side missions.- Money/Credits is abundant enough where you can get everything you need without ever feeling like you're always poor.- Planet Scanning was cut back to be less boring and not slow down the story as much.- Explore many alien homeworlds.- New character models, like female Krogan and Salarians.CONS:- Grenades.Grenades are the biggest hinderance in this game! Your own do absolutely nothing, while enemies' will cause the most deaths of you! And unlike EVERY other shooter game, you CANNOT pick up grenades and throw them back! You MUST move out the way or die. And moving out the blast radius will likely put you in the crossfire of enemies, allowing you to die just as easily. Essentially, it's either Death by Grenade or Death by Gunfire. The Grenade Spam is SO annoying!- The cover system is obtrusive.Whenever you're trying to dodge out of a grenade's way, you'll either take cover on something (while still being in the blast radius, causing you to die) or be unable to free yourself from cover at all until it's too late. When you NEED cover, it rarely works efficently. The 'Not Being Able To Throw Back Grenades' problem would make this an otherwise minor issue.- Terrain issues.Bumpy terrain is constantly getting in the way, causing you to die needlessly or not hop over obstacles. ESPECIALLY when you need to dodge out the way or avoid a grenade blast. This is especially noticible on the London missions towards the end because the battlefield is damaged.- You can't configure your squad's powers unless you begin a mission.It'd be nice to just be able to do this on the Normandy, instead of having to wait until the next mission just to upgrade EDI or Garrus or give them new weapon mods.- Graphical glitches.Especially noticable with characters on the \"Ex-Cerberus Scientists\" mission. Jacob will usually be talking to an invisible squadmate.- Character importer is defective. Your imported Shepard won't look the way they used to, before, at all.- No more Neutral options in dialogues. Only Paragon (friendly) and Renegade (aggressive) choices.- The game is kind of short. It'll take about 48 hours total to complete, as oppossed to the usual 72 hours it'd take to beat a game this size. There's also less side missions involving actual locations and battlefields.- The in-game Journal, which keeps track of your mission progress, is muddled, and confusing. Also, why couldn't the War Assets just be in your pause menu?- No more stations to explore besides the Citadel. They give you six floors on it, which is a plus, but it's still lame.- Some side objectives are glitched or just executed badly.This makes it very possible to not be able to complete the goals needed for them. Such as talking to someone on the Citadel who needs you to get something from a planet you just came from and will no longer be able to access again.- Jessica Chobot's bad voice acting of Diana Allers.I personally don't think she's THAT bad, but it is pretty nails-on-a-chalkboard compared to everyone else's superior voicework.- None of the character or major story choices from the past games matter much.They just result to a number on the War Assets screen. Many characters from the past you never even get to see again. So much for them literally fighting by your side against the Reapers! They just made it all feel so pointless.- (Somewhat subjective) The game, pretty much, has little replay value. Maybe this is because it's the final installment, or maybe it's because of the ending, but there just is hardly any reason to replay it after beating it.- (Somewhat subjective) The Soldier class has been signifcantly downgraded, making them the weakest class because they no longer have any advantages over anyone else. Actually more like, every other class has been upgraded to the point where the Soldier no longer has any actual advantages, at all.- The requirement to do multiplayer online in order to get 100% game completion. This is just BS!- The ending, of course.The one major thing, which in many's eyes, has completely destroyed not only the game, but the entire franchise. I didn't hate the ending(s) as much as everyone else and just kind of assumed DLC would explain the rest of it, since that's the unfortunate path it seems greedy game companies are going nowadays, anyway. (Though now that the DLC is out, the endings are somehow now worse because they really didn't add much onto the end.) And if you don't have an online account, you're stuck with the original endings. And they (\"it\", more like it) REALLY suck.* (Indoctrination Theory would've been SO much better. They wouldn't have even had to change that much, in my view. Just made some elements, like the final characters you see at the end, Reaper hallucinations, and the rest could've still been real. But I digress.) *NEITHER PRO OR CON:- Difficulity has been significantly weakened. It's gone down a peg for each one. \"Insanity\" is now as hard as the old \"Hardcore\". If not for the annoying enemy grenades, \"Insanity\" wouldn't be hard, at all.- The Reapers kind of ruin galaxy exploration. They're pretty annoying, but I guess it makes sense. They also hardly feel threatening at all, as all that happens if they catch you is you restart. I almost feel like there should've been something you'd have to do to escape their pursuit, like a laser-dodging spacefight in order to avoid being killed or getting the Normandy damaged or something.- Health has been seriously weakened, making it a lot easier to die than in ME2. I guess some will take that as a challenge, but on Insanity difficulity, it's pretty hindering.- There's now Multiplayer in the game, which has you playing as other soldiers and races in the galaxy, trying to defeat the Reapers in their own stories. Though I like the idea of showing how Shepard isn't the only heroic soldier in a galaxy of a trillion lives, the whole concept is a bit \"too little, too late\" and felt really unnecessary. Mass Effect would've been just as good of a series had multiplayer never existed. (Probably better, considering they try to make you do Multiplayer to get the best possible ending.)Overall:Worth renting. Beyond a doubt worth playing. But after the second London mission (and last part of the game), it should probably be stopped, to save yourself from dissapointment. It's a fun game. Kinda short. Still 99% perfect. If only not for that ending... I give the game overall 3 stars and 4 in gameplay. The ending, along with ALL the other faults I mentioned, definitely bring it down from what truly could've been a Perfect Game and unforgettable wrap-up to the greatest Sci-Fi series since Star Wars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2012"}

This is the worst rush job done on a game I think I have ever seen.  It is clear that they took the Madden '13 shell, slapped some new textures over it and called it a new game because they were working on the 'next gen' Madden for PS4/XBONE.  Consistent freezes, game lag both on and off-line, inconsistencies in the game settings (set your settings up and then go in, whoops nope they changed back, we're sorry), horrible camera angle (switch back to LEGACY to fix this - oh but you'll have to do that EVERY game), stale recycled commentary from the past couple editions (have not heard ONE single new comment), horrible graphics IMHO to call this 'breath-taking new graphics', clunky player movements, need I go on?Look, I love Madden or I wouldn't have every edition dating back to the beginning ... and I love football, but this is just a bad copy.  If you are wondering if you should buy this or save your money and buy the Next Gen edition, save your money and buy the next gen version, HOPEFULLY it won't be as bad as this.

I bought this bundle from a local store that is closing so I got it at a minor 10% discount(saved $30)...The initial setup was time consuming but as long as you have a reliable ISP connection it all goes smoothly. The game pad takes about 3 hours to fully charge and it's all fairly easy to sync up.I need to force myself to play a lengthy session of Mario to see if i encounter any overheating issues which some have experienced. I had purchased a couple of Wii games, RE remake and RE0 and tried that out, it's ok but sad that the Wii U doesn't upscale older games like the PS3 does. I haven't changed my dissappointment in Nintendo for forcing users to buy older Wii controllers to play Wii game...i had to at least buy a Wiimote to play RE remake and it's awkard so there you have it...I'll probably buy a classic controller just to enjoy those games=Nintendo's money pit in action, oh well :)I'd give this 5/5 stars if Nintendo had allowed playing Wii games or any games with the new gamepad controller or any new Wii U controllers. To me that makes no sense to not be able to use the new controller for everything including older games. I know that's a cheap way for Nintendo to get additional sales and I'll never like that aspect of their business model.EDIT: well I changed my rating to 5 instead of 4 because of the confusion over using the gamepad and swapping out for various controller types... I guess it's better to be able to use older controller to suit one's taste. But when you boot up the Wii U you can change directly to the Wii menu by holding down the B button, it still seems as though you need to use the Wii remote to get things started lol... I still don't know. I get my copy of RE4 Wii version soon so I'll experiment more.The Wii U is a great system that's getting a lot of unjust negative press.

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"E.

{"product_name":"B0022TNO7I","description":"","reviewerName":"1Dub79","summary":"Payne Is Love","reviewText":"Since Max Payne 2 came out in 2003, many of us have been waiting for another Max Payne game. Meanwhile, there has been a lot of hype, which surrounds this game. Does it live up to the hype?CAMPAIGN/STORY: Well, since Max's hiatus, he is still the same, alcoholic, pill-popping we have grown to love. The story surrounds over-the-hill ex-cop, Max Payne being a bodyguard for a group of rich youngsters in Sao Paulo Brazil, and things go awry. After that, the story grows deeper and deeper, as if watching an action drama/thriller. Keep in mind, it is 11 to 12 hours long.GAMEPLAY: Warning! This game is NOT for kids. The shooting scenes are VERY graphic and gore. Also, keep in mind, Max Payne 3 is a very hard game. Many deaths WILL come. The game play of Max Payne 3 is very immersive, responsive, and VERY addictive. In fact, in many ways, the game is very realistic. For example, some enemies react, based on where they are shot. For example, I shot an enemy in the crotch, and he immediately held his mid-section with two hands, while he was going down. That was surprisingly funny to see on a video game. Also, some enemies don't go down as quickly as others, depending on what they are wearing. I played one chapter, which many enemies had vest on. Of course, I typically shot them in the chest, so realistically; it took a while to take them down. Also, players will know that an enemy has been killed, once he sees a quick, white \"X\" mark pop up over the enemy's head. That means, stop shooting!!!Max Payne's movements during gun-fights are very fluid. He can look and move with his weapon at a 360 degree angle. Of course, with the amount of enemies that he will face, positioned at different angles, that's vital. Shooting an enemy on a game never felt so good. I can never get enough of the slow-mo cut scenes of shooting down the last enemy. Just seeing that bullet going into an enemy on those cut scenes is a thing of beauty. Also, during this scene, Max can pump additional bullets into the enemy, until he falls. There are sometimes and overwhelming amount of enemies, but once you get used to the controls, it becomes easier to take down enemies, no matter the quantity. Speaking of controls, there are several varieties. Therefore, don't freak out if you don't like the default controls.The enemy AI varies. Some enemies act differently than others. Therefore, encounter each enemy, differently and carefully! Some are just stupid and play kamikaze and will run right towards Max. Others will shoot, wait, and find the right time to flank you. Therefore, do not get too comfortable, when Max gets to cover in certain circumstances. By the way, getting access to cover is a new edition to the game.The aiming sensitivity can be changed. There are three targeting options. Of course, there is the free-aim. This allows the Max to just freely aim with the white dot reticle in which the color does not change, when sighting an enemy. The next is the soft-lock. This shows the dot white dot reticle. When depressing the button, it automatically locks onto an enemy and turns red. However, the reticle can also be moved, freely ala Grand Theft Auto. The last is hard lock. This targeting option locks onto players, until the player switches to another. Keep in mind, when selecting hard lock, many trophies CANNOT be obtained. The shootdodge and bullet time is the same as the other Max Payne games. There are certain gunfights, which this is going to need to be used, very tactfully.GRAPHICS/VISUALS: The graphics are PHENOMENAL in this game. I can also say that they are probably the best of any Rockstar game, as well as some other PS3 games known for great graphics, such as Uncharted. The graphics really showed their beauty during the cut scenes. The character models look very good. Their facial details are very L.A. Noire-ish. On many cut scenes, the player will see some of the words during conversations just flash up on the screen, similar to Denzel Washington's movie, \"Man on Fire\". In addition, the dual screens will pop up. In addition, the color of the screens may change, and words will flicker, just like on the movie. It is really cool. Don't get too caught up in the cut scenes because some can lead you right into the action.The maps on the game are very lush and vivid, especially on the Favela in Rio De Janeiro. Keep in mind to look around on the maps for extra painkillers, as well as parts to gold guns! The blood and gore on a game couldn't be much more realistic. In fact, on some slo-mo killings, I found myself just staring at the blood, as it splatters out of an enemy's head. Also, it is very cool to see various structures be destroyed by gunfire and explosive devices. The animations rival EA's infamous Frostbite Engine.MULTIPLAYER: I haven't played multiplayer much, but it is wild and has many modes. This is NOT the reason I purchased this game, though.SOUND/VOICE: The sound is awesome. Players will just love the sounds of the weapons, while being fired. The man (James McCaffrey), who does Max Payne's character makes a player have a true feeling of Max's mood, rather during a cutscene or some one-liners during gameplay.VERDICT: If you are a fan of Max Payne, this installment is DEFINITELY for you. The graphics and the gameplay are just great. The player will have the feeling of playing in their favorite action thriller/drama. This is why this game gets a definite five-star rating.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2012"}

You have guns, like the SOCOM pistol or the FAMAS machine gun, but in all reality those are supposed to be used as a last resort. Anyway, when you approach a guard you can grab him and snap his neck, when he falls you can grab his body and hide it in a locker or other various areas. If you wish, you can go into first person mode, aim with your weapon and shoot out a camera or a guard in his head.. its really up to you. You get grenades too - chaff (which jams electric devises) and stun (which knocks out enemies for a short period of time). Also, you can do a small melee combo, which at first, doesn't look like much - but I guarentee you will use it almost constantly when in tight spots.From the original, pixalated Playstation version, Metal Gear Solid: Twin Snakes looks almost life like with fluid motions both in-game and in FMV sequences, realistic (for the most part) physics, and some of the best graphics I have ever seen thanks to Silicon Knight's hardwork and Nintendo's awesome Gamecube system. Everything looks magnificent, and at the same time, dark, lonley, and terrifying. The character models look so real its hard to tell if its simply a video game, and that goes double time for Snake & all the bosses he fights. The codec sequences seem a little corny, that same as it was back in the original, so that sorta sucks.. but oh well.Musically speaking, this game has one of the best scores I have heard in a video game. It is just very catchy, and always adds elements to the atmosphere. Ontop of that, the sound effects are awesome as well. Each guard lets out a satisfying scream when he is either shot or beaten up, and the guns sound virtually like their real life counter parts. The voice acting is superb; David Hayter did an excellent job on Snake.. the same goes for the rest of the cast.You can unlock things too, depending on what you do during the torture scene with Ocelot. If you give in and let Meryl die, then at the end of the game, Otacon will give you a stealth suit. If you insisted on enduring the torture to let Meryl live, then you are rewarded with a special bandana that gives you unlimited ammo. Also, if you take certain pictures with your camera you are given the chance to see the \"ghosts\" of the creators of the game in the pictures. There are other unlockables, but I will let you find them yourself.But no game comes without some sort of flaw. Two major problems I have with MGS: TW is the excessive amount of talking (but thats found in EVERY Metal Gear game.. so we can't blame Silicon Knights) and in the movie sequences, Snake does almost impossible moves. For instance, when he first meets up with Meryl, she shoots at him with a FAMAS - Snake quickly does a flip in matrix mode and the bullets miss him.. sort of lame.To wrap it up, you need to buy & play Twin Snakes. It is, by far, the best Metal Gear game in the series. It is even better than the original.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2006"}

(Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...","summary":"And so the quality dips a bit more","reviewText":"Having played the first Rayman Raving Rabbids, I was disappointed to see that it didn't utilize the potential that well. It could have been so much more than a minigame collection, but in the end, it's exactly that. And I can say right away that this sequel is more of the same apparently.The plot begins with an amusing cutscene in which Rayman goes to the Rabbids' \"secret HQ\" (a mall), disguises himself as a Rabbid (helium and all), and goes onboard the Rabbids' mission to invade the world. However, that's all you are given, as there's, believe it or not, no ending whatsoever. So much for clearing all five regions of the game.Anyway, Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 is still good fun. After all, the bunches of minigames it has to offer still have their qualities and humorous touches. Even the on-rails FPS-style minigames make a return as their own unlockable pack. The minigames are also less frustrating than certain ones in the original.However, the minigames are also not as compelling as certain ones that clearly had a bunch of polish in the first game.Speaking of polish, there's not quite that much of it. Sure, some of the minigames show it, but the menus and such are particularly BLAND. You don't control Rayman to reach a door that leads to a minigame. Instead, once you pick a region (6 minigames per region), they are automatically lined up in order for you to blaze through.By \"blaze through\", I mean BLAZE THROUGH. It doesn't seem to be necessary to gain a high score to be able to have beaten the minigames/regions. I could screw up as much as I please in at least one minigame, and I'd still conquer it all. This not only eliminates challenge, but also allows you to beat the game in a snap.That's a problem considering the game is a mere hour and 23 minutes long, in comparison to my having beaten the first RRR in 4 hours. Rabbids 2 is only worth buying if you want more minigames pretty much. Fortunately, the most important aspect in a game is gameplay, and the minigames get the job done, which is why I can only end this review by saying....Rabbids 2 could've been worse. It's fun, but not executed well.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00064MUIA","reviewerName":"Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"","summary":"First impressions - advanced but big","reviewText":"Just got my Nintendo DS a few hours ago and have been playing the included demo game Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt.  Let me just give a few quick first impressions.1. The thing is BIG!  If you are old enough to remember the first-generation clamshell electronic organizers, the DS looks just like one of them.  It feels big even in my big, adult hands.  I was originally thinking of buying another one for my 10-year-old nephew, but now I'm not sure he'll like it.  The DS was definitely designed for the adult gamer.  It's also thick.  Also, the lid doesn't flush with the bottom unit, so it looks weird when closed.  I definitely miss the better styling on the GBA SP.  The DS looks and feels cheap.  (Like the GBA SP, this is manufactured in China.)2. The two LCD screens are identical in size (3\" each), the only difference being the bottom screen is touch-sensitive.  The screens are bright and in full colors and look better than the screen on the GBA SP.  I wish they were bigger, though; at this size, screen real estate is still too tight.  You can input on the bottom screen by using either the stylus (two are included in the package), or the plastic thumb pad on the wrist strap.  Backlighting can be turned off if desired.3. The stereo speakers are awesome.  Well, this is when compared to past Game Boy speakers.  This time around they are in stereo and that makes a big difference in the gaming experience.  The DS also has a built-in microphone, and you can hook up regular earphones via the regular 1/8\" jack on the front to get even better audio.4. Obviously at this point we don't have many games to use for testing the DS.  But judging from screenshots of some of the planned DS-only games, if done correctly, the dual-screen setup can be advantageous.  For one thing, using a secondary screen relieves the main screen of too much clutter.  In a driving game, for example, stats and course map can be displayed at the bottom.5. The 4-way pad and the 4 control buttons (yes, 4 of them, labeled A, B, X, Y) feel shallow, but easier on the thumbs than the GBA SP buttons.  I wish the DS buttons would give more feedback.  The L and R triggers feel rather loose.  I'm rather disappointed in the overall build quality of the DS.6. But the demo game shows off the processing power of the DS, but is otherwise quite boring -- not a real game by any measure.  The DS apparently has lots of processing power, and playing Nintendo handheld games will no longer by kiddie stuff.  We are talking a serious game console here, capable of 3D gaming.  I haven't bothered looking into the processing specs, but the demo game is pure 3D and features smooth graphics.  Hopefully, producing great, engaging games is what Nintendo will continue to be best at.All in all, the Nintendo DS is a nice gaming platform that looks promising, assuming the third-party deveopers will properly take advantage of the dual-screen and wireless features.  I wish the DS were physically smaller and more refined, but I look forward to playing full-version DS games soon.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2004"}

The sequel to Batman Arkham Asylum is just as enjoyable on this new platform.  As with the Game of the Year edition, Armored Edition features all of the previously-released DLC right on disc and ready to go.While only playable on the Wii U GamePad, I couldn't see it being played any other way on here, even if you could just as easily use a Pro Controller if it were compatible.  The new touch-screen features are amazing.  Instead of having to suffle through menu screen after menu screen, at the tap of an icon you gain access to WayneTech upgrades, stats, current objectives, your gear and of course your map.  Tools such as the Cryptographic Sequencer involve GamePad input, and it's very cool how it's utilized.Also, in this new version there's an all-new B.A.T. mode which turns Batman into a juggernaut for a brief period of time. While it does make some encounters too easy, it really does help the player gain an advantage in some of the game's more grueling boss battles.My only complaints rise from the fact that it's a game we've already played.  However, with the new features it's easy to argue that they make the game worth playing all over again, even if you've beat it countless times.  But I did notice the cursed frame-rate issues.  During cutscenes in particularly, the framerate can be sporadic at times.  However as soon as the action returns, so does the acceptable framerate.In spite of those, Arkham City Armored Edition is one of the games that helped sell me on the Wii U, and I have yet to be let-down.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2013"}

{"product_name":"B007XVTR3K","description":"","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Flashing Forward","reviewText":"For the most part I have really been enjoying Black Ops II, but it should be said that I'm not currently doing the Multiplayer portion, and if you're someone who's buying this game solely for that you should probably read the many Multiplayer-centric reviews here because there have been some serious issues with the game.  For me I'm enjoying the Single Player Campaign and looking forward to seeing how far I can climb in the now-ubiquitous Zombies portion.  I've played every game in the Call of Duty series and with luck will continue to enjoy them.The original Call of Duty:  Black Ops took place during the Vietnam War. Black Ops II takes the story from the original Black Ops and carries it forward in more ways than one:  the story is told through flashbacks that carry you through missions at the tail end of the Vietnam War, then into the late '80s as the Cold War started to end, and also in our near future, a 2025 that is very real and believable because technology we have or are about to have is integrated into the gameplay.  While you don't have to know much about the events of the first game to understand the story, it does help to do so and I enjoy the way they take the storyline forward.Graphically, Black Ops II is only a bit cleaner than Black Ops, but that's not much of a criticism given that the first Black Ops game looks really good on the XBox 360.  There is a smoothness to the play that seems to make it easier to move through, though at times the way the camera takes over to create a more 'cinematic' moment can be off-putting--such as when you tumble down a hillside or get caught by surprise to forward the storyline.  Fewer of these moments actually require you to do anything, so they're more spectacle than they are quicktime event.Gameplay of Black Ops II is fun and intricate because of some additions.  You can customize the loadout you take into a level.  There are 'Strike Force' missions that put you in more of a tactical position:  you play the objective flipping between a map-level view where you give orders to your allies, and diving directly into a soldier or device.  The interesting part is that Strike Force missions give you a certain number of 'teams' to try the mission and your success or failure drives the Single-Player Campaign.  This means that you story can go different ways with different playthroughs.Unfortunately, there are some problems that leave me feeling the same way I did in World at War, when I seemed to perpetually die pointlessly at random choke-points and have to do something stupid to get out of it.  Some of the markers you need to go past to progress the mission actually require you to physically tag them for no reason.  I had a level where I was doing a great job helping my team advance by flanking up one side and going around, but the hotspot was in the dead center of a clearing covered in enemy crossfire.  There was no reason for me to go there, such as an object to pick up or a switch to flip, etc.; but until I ran out in that clearing and tagged that dot, we couldn't go forward and enemies just kept spawning.  There is a mission where I'm supposed to avoid a drone and nothing I did seemed to work until I ignored my squad leader's orders, hid in a corner, and waited for him to get to the checkpoint before me.  I'm smart enough to move quietly and hide in shadows by now--this was one of those moments when I wondered how they could possibly have playtested that piece.  Shortly after that, I'm instructed to go prone...and the 'go prone' button simplly doesn't work...unless I stand in a specific spot.  Despite there being no obstacles or 'can't go prone here' warning, it doesn't fit the perfect happy path of the designers.These combined with some AI stupidity in the Strike Force missions are the drawbacks to the game.  Since I've seen that other players do well with Strike Force, the issue may just be that practice makes perfect.  In the meantime I plan on enjoying Black Ops II again and again:  the fact that it flashes forward through time makes it a lot more fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00BI83EVU","description":"","reviewerName":"Jeffrey Owens","summary":"Great Intentions, But Is Rough Around The Edges (7 of 10 on point system)","reviewText":"To me, this is a perfect example of what the last generation saw with the rise of Assassins Creed. Assassins Creed started out the exact same way; the game was fun, was new, exciting, and different, yet quite flawed, but you couldn't be all that made when it messed up, for it nails the main aspects it strove for to be different from all else quite well. Assassins Creed pushed free running, an interesting storyline, and a time period and location that had not been explored previously. However, Assassins Creed also failed in many ways, such as many times getting stuck when free running, poor mission designs, not much beyond the main mission structure, and a lead that isn't entirely likable (Ezio was a much more likable character, as well as more interesting, leading to his string of three games).Watch Dogs has the same general trend that Assassins Creed endured; the first had great ideas, but needed a sequel to take the mistakes that were made prior to make a game that was even greater than before, and one that is up there with my games of the generation (made me love the series). Watch Dogs has great intentions, and excels extremely well as what it promised most. However, Watch Dogs made mistakes along the way, neglecting major aspects to any open world game, as well as following AC's mistakes in some ways as well.Lets get the bad out of the way now so I can leave this review on a good note. The graphics in this game, to me, were not as great as I had expected. True, the game looks nice, but there is a large difference between how this game was suppose to look when E3 occured a couple years ago in the first demo and how the game looks now. I usually am not that bugged by the graphics, however, so this was not a huge issue to me, but it was something that I had noticed when I started playing. The character models look great for the most part, and the details are there when they want to be, but when in open-roaming and not in cut scenes there is not much detail like the demo had (AC 4, to me, looked a little bit better).On to my main gripes (the former being very minor, and really it is a wash because the night time is actually great looking versus the day, which is interesting). Lets start with vehicles and driving. Each vehicle behaves, essentially, the same way. Almost every car, from a super car to a sedan to a van to a SUV, all behave, sound, and are almost all the same save for different building models to make each car at least look a little different. Each car almost peals out immediately when trying to use the gas, almost acting as if the car can go 0-60 in a second and a half no matter what the car is. This can be annoying, for it is not really that realistic. And like much of what the internet has said, the driving itself is not good, to be blunt. Now, I am a fan of many racing franchises and I enjoy many different kind of open worlds games, so to be an open world game needs to make an enjoyable transport system. Watch Dogs did that with on-foot movement, however the driving can be irritating and takes quite a lot of time to get use to. I hate to make the comparison, but GTA is the marque series for open world games like this, and they each have (mostly) nailed the driving experience. GTA 5's driving was not perfect, sure, but the driving was not terrible (took time to adjust to, just like GTA 4's). But both of these made enjoyable experiences from driving; car chases, races, ect., and the driving was fun to do. It was much like how Red Dead Redemption nailed the horse back riding experience, and thus made the transport system much better for it and made riding around fun (even though the world was empty in many areas. Another example would be how AC 4 nailed ships and sailing. With all that said, Watch Dogs failed at the driving experience. I tend to avoid it if I can personally. The cars are cumbersome, the handling is extremely awful, the brakes act almost like the handbrake, all the cars feel and behave the same, the physics are subpar, with all this leading to a maddening situation since driving is such a major means for transport in any open world sandbox in the present or during the period of mass produced cars.The AI in this game beyond the enemies are also a sour note. The AI in the NPCs, people who just wander and walk around, are just empty shells that are just there, for the player to do with as they please. The problem is, what if you are trying to be a good person? Trying to avoid hitting pedestrians when driving around a corner during a chase? Good luck with that. With the driving being terrible, things were not looking up. But the AI in the NPCs are pretty bad, with their reactions not being what you would expect nor would want to expect. I have had many pedestrians jump out in front of my car in fear because of a car chase, instead of trying to avoid the cars and get out of the way like normal people. I have had pedestrians walk in my line of fire during an assault of a convoy instead of running for the hills. This point might be nit picky, sure, but it is something I noticed, and something that did take away from my experience a bit.Lastly, the characters. Personally, I found Aiden unlikable, meanwhile enjoying the story, character development, and what have you of the secondary characters and minor characters versus the lead. Aiden is just a blank slate, much like Altair from AC 1. Thankfully, the characters beyond Aiden are actually fun, interesting, and really push the story versus Aiden.Now, onto the positives!Sure, the driving sucks, but beyond that the game actually plays pretty smooth once the controls get mastered. Each gun feels unique, different, and realistic (almost feels like the designers put more time into the guns and clothes versus the cars). Firefights are interesting, fun, and can be chaotic when trying to get an advantage in the fight. The hacking works extremely well, and is both fun to play around with and steal money from people, and is also a tool to cause death and mayhem upon foes, and is something that I am looking forward to evolving and becoming even better.The side missions in the game are also quite awesome, varied, fun, and can be quite challenging, which really makes the player need to make good decisions for fear of death in a few bullets. And the online is very fun, chaotic, and terrifying at times as well, but there were many problems I ran into in terms of matchmaking and playing online at times (not very frequent, but I did run into it at times).But really, what is most important in a game is the fun factor, and the fun is there. Sure, the game has problems, and sure they can sometimes cause irritation and anger and frustration. However, the game is still fun; the story is interesting, the characters are mostly fun, the gameplay is quite solid mostly, and the online components are very fun if not problematic at times. I enjoy this game mostly, but this is also a game that is not a must have in my opinion.I do recommend playing this game to experience it yourself, however, and to make your own opinion like I did. Hope the read was helpful and leave comments if you have questions, qualms, or just want to talk about any sort of topic!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2014"}

There are no dynamic quests or terrain altering effects.  There's no global strategy.What WOW did was take existing technology and implement it better.  You get quests, just like other games of this type, but WOW quests are bigger, better and much, much more plentiful.  I have leveled from 1 to 60 and always had multiple quests waiting to be done.  I had to skip a number of them -- by the time you've done most of the quests, you're ready to move to a higher level area, meaning some quests will still be new to you if you level a second character.  There are combat skills and spells, just like other games of this type, but WOW has more of them with more tactical options that really gives you something to think about as you fight your way to the top.  There are dungeons, just like other games of this type, but WOW dungeons range from \"medium\" to \"superhuge\".  Other games have loot, WOW has more loot, with more variety, meaning less of a huge gap between the \"haves\" and \"have nots\".Etc.  WOW doesn't do anything really new, it just took what the genre already had and made it all better.2) PvPPlayer versus player action is optional but I recommend giving it a shot.  Normal servers have 100% consensual PvP.  You must do something specific before you can attack or be attacked.  PvP servers have it opened up by dividing the world into three types of areas: Horde, Alliance and Contested.In a Horde zone, Alliance can be attacked at will but they cannot fire until fired upon.  Vice versa for Alliance zones.  These are basically the lowest level zones, from around level 1-20 or so.  You can get your feet planted and learn your class and get some abilities before you have to worry about being attacked.Contested zones are \"team PvP\".  Horde and Alliance can attack each other on sight.  You cannot attack your own team (except in special Arenas).  There are no level limits -- a level 60 can squish a level 30 if they are both in a contested zone.However, unlike many other PvP games, level differences are diluted.  The level 30 will not be completely helpless.  Though his weapons and spells will do much less damage and he will be physically weaker, he can at least fight enough that a level 60 facing a group of level 30's will be facing a likely death -- death by pinpricks, but they can definately impact him.  My secondary character is a Warlock, and at level 26 my \"Fear\" spell works pretty well even against level 60's.  They show up to murder me for a free win because I'm so small and feeble, they think again as I cast Fear on them, which sends them running away uncontrollably as I high-tail it in the other direction and hide behind a tree.3) Blizzard's \"no tollerance\" policy.Sony Online Entertainment is notorius for allowing hackers and cheaters and troublemakers to continue to play the game.  Blizzard is notorius for banning them from the field.  This is excellent.  As with any game, hacks and cheats get made and discovered, but Blizzard is quick to find these people and suspend their accounts.Like a good referee, Blizzard keeps the game fair for honost players and I appreciate that as much as any technical aspect of the game.I can't say enough good about it, this game rocks, it's by far the best MMORPG yet.We can quibble over the graphical style, class balance or \"lag\", but issues like that are almost immaterial.  MMORPG's all update, graphics change, class balance changes, lag issues come and go, it's the same from UO to EQ2.  The important thing is that the design is solid, the content is solid, the mechanics are solid, WOW is going to be the game to play for the forseeable future.  I honostly pity other MMORPG developers because unless they invent something totally new, I don't see how they can draw the fantasy RPG crowd away from World of Warcraft.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2005"}

Honestly, I must have sat there playing in bed for atleast 3 hours and pretty much \"jeweled\" myself out.  Now here is the important part... I would once again turn this game on and play.  At the end of the day all that matters is the replayability factor; and this game certaintly has it.One negative factor is that \"Zen\" mode is just that... very \"zenlike\" to the point of me playing like a Zombie for those 3 hours.  The mode with the bombs is a feverish attempt at not allowing them to detonate and is very challenging.

{"product_name":"B0022TNO7S","description":"","reviewerName":"G. Denick","summary":"A fitting homage to director Tony Scott","reviewText":"Dark, gritty, and incredibly violent, \"Max Payne 3\" was clearly inspired by the works of the late, great Tony Scott. Spoken words of dialogue sporadically popping up on the screen as white text... color distortions and filters... multiple frames split with bold lines... a muted color palette... all of these elements of style summoned Scott's films to mind, while playing MP3. More than anything else, however, it was the gritty storytelling and the darkness of character that reminded me of Scott. The first thing that popped into my mind when I began playing MP3 was \"Man on Fire\", the great Denzel Washington revenge movie. And at its core, that's exactly what MP3 is: an interactive revenge movie.I can't think of another game I've played that's as atmospheric as MP3. You can feel the suffering of this man, and all his many follies. The other characters are also richly drawn, and the settings of Brazil (both the impoverished areas and the wealthy ones) are created effectively and convincingly. The various chapters are oftentimes brilliant, with some of the standouts being an enormous soccer stadium, a river traversed by speedboat, and a siege upon a luxury yacht in the Panama Canal. The story, voice acting, and cut scenes are all surprisingly good, and they paint a story that at first seems generic, but slowly becomes a riveting force that propels you forward through the campaign, eager to see the next chapter. I feel like Rockstar Studios would have been better served by creating a new IP for this game, because it's so much more advanced and sophisticated than the other two titles in the series... but that's far more of a compliment than a complaint.I took off one star for some issues: Foremost, the violence. I understand this is a violent story, and a mature title designed for adults, just like an R rated film. But some of the violence is simply gratuitous, particularly the slow motion, close up kills that signify the clearing of enemies in a room- and to make matters worse, this is hardly a new \"trick\". \"Stranglehold\" was doing this way back in 2006.Second, the mechanics are a tad dated, and not quite as smooth as the best of the competition. Rockstar insists on mapping their aim and trigger inputs to the bumper buttons for some reason (just like in \"Red Dead Redemption\"), as opposed to the trigger buttons. This is fundamentally inconvenient for a couple of reasons... it defies the industry standards, and makes it difficult for gamers who are hardwired for conventional controls (alternate button mapping is possible, but you can't use the triggers for triggers, no matter what you choose). There is a very good reason why the trigger buttons on your controller are called trigger buttons... it's because they replicate triggers!The slow motion trick (otherwise known as \"bullet time\") has not aged particularly well. The combat of this game is at its best when it relies upon the stop and pop, cover based shooting. Diving around in slow motion feels forced, and is not very fun. I only used slow motion when I was absolutely forced to, because there was no cover around.These shortcomings, however, cannot undo what is a fantastic game, a credit to Rockstar Studios, and a fitting homage to Tony Scott. I played this game on PS3, but my review is based on the content of the campaign, which should be the same across both consoles.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2012"}

I was debating whether I would give it a 8.5 or 9 (out of 10). I thought it was going to be as good as Uncharted 2. By the third level, I began thinking maybe a 6 or 7. I quit playing the game on the 13th chapter (of 14 I believe). At this point, I give the game a 3 out of 10.The game has the visuals and sound of a Rockstar game. They are fantastic. I wish I could recommend playing the game just to see the world-building which, with the tighter focus of linear game-play really shines as maybe the best Rockstar has done. This is why the game gets 3 points instead of 0.The game-play, level design, and developer decisions (most important parts) ruin this game to the point that I found it unplayable, even after switching to easy in the 13th chapter.The combat is horrible. Rockstar games have always had poorly implemented combat, but for a game focused much more tightly on fighting, it is just awful. It would maybe be OK but you have a health bar and way too few medicines to replenish it. (Note: I deleted 4 more paragraphs about how bad combat is for brevities sake. It is a combination of bad controls, bad level design and bad opponent AI (the enemy always know when I am aiming at them, can always see me even if line-of-sight is occluded, etc.).What made me so angry at the game were the STUPID decisions by Rockstar. They switch what guns you are using during cut-scenes. They make your guns disappear for NO reason leaving you with no ammo to fight. Bosses (basically a juggernaut) will appear with a cut scene. During the cut-scene the game MOVES YOU OUT OF COVER. Or a juggernaut will appear the second after you kill 8 guys, so that you don't have time to get enough ammo to fight him.There are many (many) bafflingly bad design decisions that just show that Rockstar has no skill or talent for 3rd person shooters. If they make a sequel, they should try playing gears of war first (or hiring someone from Epic games).","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2012"}

Though it seemed like this day would never come, XSEED once again saved the day like they did with The Last Story, so now everyone can enjoy this excellent action RPG. Similar to a game like Nier, Pandora's Tower may not be without its faults, though it is a stellar game that overcomes any minor fault it may have, because much like Nier, this is a pretty original experience, sprinkled with some Zelda and Castlevania influence, but its greatest feature is its story and characters.The gameplay is very much what you'd expect from an action RPG, but it combines the sword combat with the chain, which allows you to interact with the environments, enemies, etc. You can also use the chain to platform through the towers, adding verticality to a genre that usually doesn't have any. In addition, there are many puzzles, which are pretty well done. The boss battles are another fantastic part of Pandora's Tower, which use the chain to add puzzle-like elements, bringing in some Zelda comparisons. The gameplay is really solid throughout.The story is by far one of my favorites I've experienced on the Wii. It's an emotional journey about a guy trying to save the life of the woman he loves. It shows the lengths that one will go to if it's the only way to protect the person they care the most about. This is a test of love and devotion. The story plays out beautifully. Adding to the story, the protagonist must reach the end of each tower and get the flesh back to his love before the timer runs out (about 30 minutes per tower or so), freeing her from the curse for just a little longer, or else she'll turn into a monster. It adds an urgency to the situation at hand.One flaw, for example, may be the graphics, which some may take issue with, though I didn't. While there's no doubt that this is a Wii game, I think the cutscenes look really good and the gameplay looks pretty nice, though perhaps not on par with The Last Story's great presentation.Pandora's Tower needs to be played. Show your support for XSEED bringing out a Wii game in 2013 by buying this ASAP.

Can't wait for the sequel.","reviewText":"I played Anniversary and Underworld before.  They never piqued my interest and I gave up after few hours.I knew I would get the game when I saw some promotional videos and read an article about the storyline.  I could easily relate to the story because I am personally stuck in a certain country which I desperately want to leave.The new TR is absolutely amazing.  Lara Croft is very relatable and I could not put down my controller.  The graphics are on par with Crysis 3.  The battle system is a bit too simplified but holds much promise.  With future evolutions of the game, TR could become a top brand in 3rd person shooting games.My only complaint is that there is not enough problem-solving in the main story.  There are optional tombs that have simple puzzles, but the lack of puzzles in the main story made the game a little too linear.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00005ME7X","description":"Originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System,Dragon  Warrior IIIis a Game Boy Color port of one of the all-time classic  role-playing games. The game reunites two of Japan's greatest RPG talents in Yuji  Horii (story and game) and Akira Toriyama (character design). Toriyama is also  known as the creator of the immensely popular Dragon Ball cartoons and comics. A  prequel to the first two games in the series,DWIIIcasts you as the  child of a great hero who must defeat an evil demon. New additions to the port  include improved graphics, new minigames, new items, and a better translation of  the original Japanese dialogue.The game starts off with a personality test that loosely determines how other  characters will react to you. Gameplay is standard RPG fare: exploring, building  experience levels, acquiring allies, gaining weapons, and ultimately going after  a large monster. There are some interesting minigames to mix things up. The  Monster Medals feature adds a collectible aspect to the game. Monsters may leave  medals behind after you defeat them. Some monsters only appear during certain  times of the day. Getting all the medals unlocks a secret dungeon. You can trade  medals via link cable to make things easier. Most RPG fans will love this game,  but those raised on modern RPGs might find its combat a bit tedious. This game  is compatible with Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance only.--Raymond M.

The characters can be customized in numerous areas, and even retrained if they aren't working out - you can take your Lvl 40 fighter and make him a wizard, or let your cleric train as a merchant.  The number of sidequests and the evolution of certain areas is impressive, and will give you 60+ hours of things to do.  Best of all, the fighting system is so simple that even a novice can start playing and get hooked immediately.This game gets my highest possible recommendation.  For a fraction of the cost of a Final Fantasy game, you can get a game that will give you more enjoyment for a longer period of time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2003"}

I also got all the post cards.  17 hours isn't bad value in my opinion.  My biggest disappointment was that there were only a handful of levels that were truly challenging and it was only because I wanted to get the 3 medallions in them.  The difficulty is way off of the normal mario games.  Don't get me wrong, I like that it's accessible enough for all ages to complete...it's just that I think that completing all the side goals should be more challenging.One nice thing that adds replay-ability is that every level keeps track of the fastest time it was finished.  Even if you have beaten everything like I did, you can always go back and try to beat the level in record time.  I might do this some, but I'm more of the type of player that likes to explore and find everything (like the medallions).  Although, if my son gets into it and beats my score, I may have to go back and try to beat his :)If you are getting this game for a 7-12 year old, it is more than worth the price and will keep them occupied for awhile.  If you are a Mario fan like me, you will have fun and hold onto the game to make another run through it maybe a year later.  I did enjoyed this game, but New Super Mario Bros on the DS was better overall in my opinion.  I still haven't completed everything in that game after 2 years.Now that the designers have experience designing levels for the new game, I think they'll make a much superior Super Mario 3D Land 2 that won't disappoint at all.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2011"}

The guitar is too small and too light. The whole thing is too short to hold it comfortably. It feels like a toy. (Which I guess it is, but you get my point...).The game also is very hard. I have played all other GH games on \"Expert\" (the same is true for Rock Band) and I was always able to pick up the majority of songs and play them through the first time. With GH3, I already had to play the 5th song 4 or 5 times to get through. Then, I got stuck on the first boss-battle, which is the 10th song. Yikes!Talking about boss-battles: I really do not like them. The game throws a very solo-heavy piece of noise at you that you have to play against a boss who seems to hit pretty much every note. I do not enjoy this at all. Some people may like this, but the problem is that if you don't, you are completely stuck with this nonsense. I am not sure who came up with this idea, but it def. takes a lot of the fun away. It has always been a weakness of the GH games that one ends up playing songs one doesn't like/can't do so well more than any of the other songs. With this silly boss-battle machanic, they now push this problem to the extreme.The problem is not just that I am stuck on the boss battle, but also that I dislike it so much that I may not bother trying again. I also downloaded a few songs, but I really do not want to spend money on additional songs when I only got to play 9 songs that came with the game so far. (I do not mind the idea of buying more songs in general... I have bought a ton for Rock Band, but this is just a rip-off, if you ask me...)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2008"}

While it can be a bit bland, I think it's far from bad and it does open some nice potential for a solid sequel.The graphics on the PS4 are great, but you can tell this is just the tip of the iceberg. I can't wait until we see a COD game that's specifically made for next gen. Finally, and this is my biggest complaint, the guns and weapons seemed really underwhelming.

Johnson","summary":"Great racing title, Bizzare finally got the picture.","reviewText":"If you read my review about PGR on the regular XBOX, you would see that I was VERY dissatisfied with the game, mainly due to the fact that the game focused too much on Kudos, and not actual racing, in addition, there was only one difficulty level on the game, PMI (Pretty Much Impossible). Don't get me wrong I like difficult games, but not difficult to the point were it becomes tedious due to cheesy AI and having to start all over again if you make ONE mistake.  Not my idea of fun in the least.  Add to that that the Kudos aspect which made it more important to do stupid tricks rather than race.  PGR1 was only for super hardcore racers that have tons of hours each day to master, I like most people I suspect, don't have the time to spend THAT much time on one game, or on video games period.  I hated PGR1, so much that I didn't even raise an eyebrow when PGR2 came out.  I didn't even raise an eyebrow when PGR3 came out, but after downloading the free demo from XBOX Live, I saw the game was actually kind of fun, and playable.  I decided to rent it a few days later and the very next day I was convinced and went out and bought it.As usual the graphics in PGR3 are downright spectacular.  The attention to detail was done so well that the cars and the entire racing experience look pretty much lifelike.  The reflections coming off the cars react to the actual environment, instead of some generic reflection effect.  The actual race environments look real as well and it seems you are actually racing through the street of NYC or Vegas.  The crowds are the only downside, but going 100+ MPH most of the time, you won't have time to sit there any really analyze them.  One cool thing the crowd does is that if you happen to crash into a wall, the people standing right behind the barrier will back up and give you a funny look.  Another cool thing about PGR3 is that they have AUTHENTIC cockpit view, in which you can switch the camera to inside of the car and you will see the actual steering wheel, dashboard, center console of the real life counterparts.  You can even look around in the interior while you are driving using the right thumb stick.  If you are about to get passed by the Ferrari on your right (or left), using the right thumb stick you can literally turn your head to the driver or passenger windows to see as they pass by.  VERY COOL!  If you choose the Manual transmission option (which I always do) you can actually see the driver's hands leave the steering wheel to shift to the next gear in cars that have the gear box in the floor.  Cars that have the F1 paddle shift you will see the driver's finger flick the appropriate paddle.  For cars that only come in Automatic, the drivers hands will be on the steering wheel at all times. I have had the opportunity to drive 6 of these cars in this game in real life on open mountain roads in North Georgia (Ferrari F430, Ford GT, Lamborghini Gallardo, Masserati Grandsport, Bentley GT, Corvette Z06, and I can tell you that this game has the interiors down to the smallest detail.  One thing I wish the game had was being able to do turn completely around while you are driving (or watching a replay) so you would be able to see the engine behind you in cars like the Ferrari and Lambo.  There is some damage done to your cars during racing, but nothing too extreme.  Very frequently your mirrors, tail lights and headlights will get smashed, and if you ram into a wall or get rammed too many times, your hood and trunk become bent and will pop open slightly during the course of the race.  Some may want more damage, but it doesn't bother me too much.The sound is also topnotch.  Each car's engine sounds pretty much like the real thing as well as screeching tires.  Cranking the volume up on your surround sound system and hearing the engines roar gives me an adrenalin boost every single time, it makes me want to push the car harder just so I can continue to hear that lovely sound.  I love spinning the tires when I am just playing around and was even expecting to smell the burning rubber on the asphalt.  The game also comes with a wide range of music choices to listen to while you are driving, you can also use your music on your 360's hard drive, an IPOD, or stream music directly from your Media Center PC.  The only thing about custom music though is that its not really integrated into the game like the built in sound track are.  So if you have one of your own songs playing while you are racing, that song will continue to play even if the race is over and you are back on the main screen.  Whereas the built-in soundtracks will be stopped once you stop racing, just you can no longer hear your car's radio if you are no longer in the car.To me, the most important part of any game is the actual game play.  PGR1 excelled in graphics and sound, but the actual game play made it one of my most hated games.  Luckily PGR3 has great game play as well.One of my main issues with PGR1 was the over emphasis on Kudos, it focused on that way more than it should and it made the game tedious and not fun.  Kudos is back in PGR3, but it has taken sort of a backseat to actual racing, which is the way it should be.  Yes there are still Kudos challenges, but most of the races involve you having to place in the top 3 to advance rather than placing in the top 3 AND getting the specified number of Kudos.  Kudos can still be earned, and are a must to unlock certain cars, but the fun factor of the game keeps you coming back for more even though you raced that same track 10 times already.  Kudos are a lot more forgiving this time around as well, no longer will a slight tap on a wall cause you to lose all the Kudos you were racking up, now you really have to hit it for you to lose them.  This was definitely needed as well.  Honestly, because this game is so fun and not so darn tedious, I find myself actually wanting to rack up Kudos, strange how that works huh?Another issue with the original was the ridiculous difficulty and cheap AI that would make it a point to wreck you on purpose, making the game pretty much impossible after you unlocked a certain car.  But that is no longer the case, now PGR has 5 difficulty levels that should satisfy every racing fan (Novice, Easy, Medium, Hard, Hardcore).  I suspect Hardcore was the default level from the original.  Medium is no cakewalk however, and you still have to be on your toes to advance, if you are new to this game, then try some races in Easy to get the hang of it.  Novice is pretty much a waste of time, as it is way too easy.  A good thing about the difficulty levels as that you can choose them before each race in your career, so you are not locked in to one the whole time.Handling of the cars in this game has also improved greatly.  I remember in PGR1, when I got the Vette, it would spin around for no apparent reason, while CPU controlled cars were like tanks.  No more, there is no an even playing field when it comes to handling. Some cars of course are harder to handle than others, but no more phantom spinning while taking a turn at 20 MPH.  Computer controlled cars still try to wreck you, but not nearly as blatant as PGR1, and if you think that they are going too far, you can wreck them too.Another good thing about this game is that you can by any car at any time and not have to depend on the game to decide which car you can use.  So if you gain enough credits (not the same as Kudos), you can buy an Enzo Ferrari right off the bat.  Of course the better cars cost more money, the Mclaren F1 if I remember correctly costs a whopping 1.7 million credits! You earn credits by completing race objective.  There are some cars that you still have to earn the right to buy by accumulating enough Kudos, but there are TONS and TONS of cars that are playable right out of the box so that is not an issue.  In addition to this, you can race with any car outside of your career mode, so if you just want a quick race with a car you haven't bought in Career mode yet, no problem.  (The locked cars rule still applies though).  Back to the Career mode, every car you buy will appear in your virtual garage, and when you are not racing you can walk around your garage looking at each car you have bought.  Heck they even added coin operated video game machines that you can play in your garage.  No I'm serious, really!  When you garage gets full, you will get a bigger garage that can hold even more cars.All of this stuff is in the SINGLE player portion of the game, and I didn't even mention that you can take/save photos and videos of your races, race against your own ghosts, test drive cars you haven't bought in career mode etc.Online is almost another game in itself.  Even when a free Silver membership you can race against ghosts from the best drivers around the world and see how you stack up.  Get ranked based on your track times, and even watch real time races of ridiculously good racers on XBOX Live.  And wait, you can download even more cars from XBOX Live!  Some are even free!!  Of course if you have Gold you can actually race against other people online.If you like racing games, then what are you waiting for?  At basically HALF the cost compared to other XBOX360 games, this game packs quite a punch.  Definitely worth the money for every thing that is in the game and what you can do right out of the box.  PGR3 is much improved from the original, and I am highly satisfied.  Some people are saying its not as good as PGR2, but for someone that has never played PGR2, PGR3 is light years ahead of PGR1 in EVERY aspect.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2007"}

Nintendo was forced to cancel many Super Nintendo games (Doom FX, Star Fox 2, Mario FX) and release the Nintendo 64. Many popular 2D games failed in full 3D. Castlevania, Mega Man... they failed and have not been revived. Did Mario succeed? YES! This game is a legend. I heard about it in 2009 (not 1996) in a Nintendo Power magazine simply titled \"Mario\". I did not own a Nintendo 64 (this was 2009). The only system I had was an original Wii that we used for Mario Kart. I was somehow able to persaude my parents to buy me a Wii Point Card with 2000 points on it (enough for Mario 64 and Super Mario Bros 3). I downloaded it and was greeted with a happy Mario face that said \"HELLO!\". Soon I was distorting him to where he had no moustache and had big ears. Then I started the game and got a message from Peach. In her girly princess voice she read the letter, which told Mario she had baked a cake for him. The plumber could not resist and jumped out of a warp pipe onto the castle grounds. I had never played a 3D Mario Game. I stuck to Animal Crossing, Mario Kart, My Sims, and Wii Sports (I was 8 years old). After a little bit of exploring I entered the castle. Instead of a cake Mario got a scary message from Bowser (Who ate cake, I guess). Soon I was hiking up a hill to meet a giant king bomb complete with a moustache and crown. He told me (using fancy king words) that in order to get the bomb I had to defeat him. I defeated him and moved on to the next level, a giant fortress ran by slabs of concrete with faces. Then I started level 3, a snow level. What a level that was! Finding baby penguins, building snowmen, sliding down a slide. Then my parents walked in. My mom said \"YUCK! What are those dots supposed to be?\". Those dots were snow flakes. My dad said \"Are those graphics... 64 bit?\" I had not even realized the graphics were bad because I was lost in the creative levels. Each level had an original design with interesting puzzles and obstacles put in the way of the star. Each boss was different and interesting. The graphics are outdate, so what? This, along with Mario 3, really changed my view of video games. Now (in 2012) I have almost no respect for high-powered consoles like the Xbox 360. Kids should play these old games. How hard is it to get kids a $20 card so that they can enjoy a unique classic like this? The challenge is not too much. If you get stuck on one level you can try another. This is a beautiful game that put the Nintendo 64 to its limits.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2012"}

AC:B boasts the best skies i've ever seen in a game. they're virtually photo-realistic.  compare AC:B skies with COD:BO skies.  no contest.2 - the open world gives you tremendous feeling of discovery and excitment.  the missions are nicely varied [the races from AC:2 are gone, thankfully]; the quests largely entertaining and some are very challenging; the characters memorable and likeable.  the platforming exceeds AC:B in almost every respect. destroying leonardo's four war machines was thrilling, and in my opinion, the most engaging part of the game.  the in-game economy, renovations, treasures, borgia flags, feathers, christina memories will provide hours of entertainment, for sure. the 'romulus' missions are great, too.3 - AC:B introduced a few new things - i almost jumped out my chair the first time i called in one of my assassin recruits who performed an air assassination. i felt sad the one and only time one of them died in battle. horses can now be ridden through cities and you even get to parachute from the top of a castle.  the best new weapon, in my opinion, is the crossbow - as if Ezio weren't already a big enough bad-a$$, the crossbow makes it doubly so.4 - AC:B nicely sets up AC:3, although with more than a touch of sadness.  whether or not Ezio de Auditore will be part of future installments remains to be seen [one can only hope], but AC will live on.there were only a few minor quibbles - horses tend not to jump off two inch ledges, shaun and rebecca continue be as annoying as ever, and some of the music, which is by and large fantastic, feels a bit hokey and melodramatic in places [particularly when destroying borgia towers].  but those are just minor issues in an otherwise beautiful and amazing game.ubisoft recently hinted that we may see yearly installments of Assassin's Creed through the year 2020. if so, i'll buy each and every one.if you're on the fence, take the \"leap of faith\" and join the brotherhood.  you'll be glad you did.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2010"}

Both games have been remade for the GameCube, and I own both the original N64 version and the GameCube version. The gameCube versions were released if you bought a GameCube at a certain time and if you pre-ordered the Wind Waker.THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: OCARINA OF TIMEThis game started out as you as the \"Hero of Time\". You were the only forest child without a fairy, and the Great Deku Tree sent the annoying little fairy to you. When you go to the Deku Tree, he says you must get these Spiritual Stones to open the Door of Time, and a bunch of other crap like that.Sound and Music: 9.5/10.0 This game has one of the best scores in the video game world, and the ocarina songs are very good. 100% credit to the music makers of all the Zelda Games, these are some great songs. The only problem is you can't shut it off. Sometimes it gets annoying, and it doesn't help if you are stuck on a level for hours.Graphics: 2004: 4.0/10.0 1998: 9.0/10.0 In this day in age the graphics are so good these look like horrible. If this game was released today, everyone would laugh. Back in 1998, these graphics were the best out there. But the good thing about them is you can see the faces unlike some of those games fromt hat time it made you go blind.Difficulty: 10.0/10.0 This game is HARD! I beat it barely without a strategy guide, and you can be stuck on levels like the Forest Temple and the freaking Water Temple for MONTHS. If you beat the game with a strategy guide, you take the challenge and fun out of it. You also won't have many broken items, like controllers or TV's.Gameplay: 1,000,000.0/ 10.0 It is considered the best game ever, and was the 1998 Game Of The Year. You could do EVERYTHING in this game, and it is very fun doing all those side quests and other crap. This game is like no other. No other game can match this, none of that Final Fantasy or any other RPG match it, it is the best Nintendo game ever made.THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: MAJORA'S MASKThe game takes a huge turn in Majoras Mask as young Link goes out with Epona from Hyrule. No Ganondorf's in this game, because it revolves around Majora's Mask, a mask stolen by this little imp from the Happy Mask Shop guy from OOT. You have three days to get the mask back, but you must keep going back using the Ocarina and the Song of Time.Sound and Music: 9.5/ 10.0 It is like a carbon copy of Ocarina of Time, and the suspensful music is very catchy. The game has great music, ALL ZELDA GAMES HAVE GREAT MUSIC.Graphics: Same As Ocarina of TimeDifficulty: 9.5/10.0 Not as bad as Ocarina of Time, but that doesn't mean it is not frustrating and challenging. You can't be scared away by the challenge of these games because they are just too great.Gameplay: 10.0/10.0 The whole mask collecting concept is very fun and it a change from beating Ganondorf like in all the other games. You will feel deja vu of Ocarina of Time because the characters are the same, just different. The game is fun and a great challenge.

Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game.

I want all Mario Party fans to know that this game is NOT like Mario Party. There is only one board that vaguely resembles a Mario Party board and it is a cheap imitation. The goal of this board is to make it up to the mountain. It's pretty much straight forward with no alternate routes. At certain points you have to roll a certain number in order to progress. When you reach the top of the mountain, you must roll a 6 or higher to win the game. Too much is left up to chance in this game. There is another board that looks like a globe. You have to travel to a specific country and purchase a souvenir photo. The first person to obtain 3 photos wins. This board is better than the other but not worth the price tag of this game. There are other party modes like two player mix and match and 4 party house mode that involves things like hiding the wii remote and locating it based on sound. I like the two player mode best. This mode requires two people to work together on a mini game. You also have to answer questions based on how you think your partner will answer. It's fun but again, not worth the price. This is the first video game I have ever purchased that I have not been satisfied with. I am currently in the process of trading it in via the amazon.com trade-in program.  I do not recommend this game to Mario Party fans. I think this game is best enjoyed by small children and as a party game with a large group of people.

It's story driven, you care about what happens, and you feel a desire to bring some order to a disorderly world. The story seems a little too familiar though. I am not sure how you change the story to make it feel fresh and new but a little more work here would have been made it more intoxicating.  The idea of setting up traps to give yourself a chance while she's collecting ADAM is a lot of fun, the protect element is a great new component for this game.  They have created an extension of an old world that does do justice to the original Bioshock series and I feel that this game will certainly allow for a continuation of the series.Where they could improve:  Towards the end of the game collecting ADAM seems redundant, they must find a way for collecting Adam to be as rewarding as it is in the beginning, never really felt any of my non-splicing weapons did very much damage. I also felt that playing as the big daddy that I was actually more susceptible to dying than in the first game when I didn't have a suit of Iron around me, very puzzled on this one???Final Summation:  If you liked the first one you will like this one, but I would recommend you pick up the first Bioshock game and play it first because it makes better sense story wise to do so, while not necessary, it sure would bring clarity to a lot of the comments made through out the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2010"}

And i have played Uncharted 2 it was an excellent game for last year, but Heavy Rain in 2010 looks to be a sleeper hit blockbuster for Sony this year.Start:For me i play tons of video games, including FPS,RPG,MMORPGS, even Sports games, and at times ive been looking for a fresh air, or some HEAVY RAIN. Let me get straight to the point, i have been anticipaiting this game and pre-ordered in full thanks to a full demonstration of Heavy Rain and was sold plus playingIndigo Prophecy(which sold over a 100 million units combined on all systems). Heavy Rain takes you into a virtual world, almost as though as when you play it, you are not apart of the action YOU ARE THE ACTION, each thing you do has an influence on the storyline later. Like for example(no huge spoiler in the storyline) is when i decided to not shoot Nathineal(a suspect) for at the moment seemed like a weapon, and LT Blake was mad at me later, but another playthrough Jayden then has a different attitude about the situation when i DID kill nathineal and LT Blake then asked if it was my first time killing someone. Essentially this game is based on Choices and there is plenty to satisfy anyone.Overall Theme:After awhile in the game you start to have a real feel for the characters, and the scenery seems so realistic, and the characters voices are so real, you would believe that this was a true story on all aspects. Plus during some moments you feel like you have to save your son. Also there are points where you can lean on a wall or go outside and check out the scenery and after a moment it shows the gorgeous rain, artwork texture, and detail that Video Games should follow, instead of rushing the player from point A to B.Controls: the controls very on what difficulty you set it on, for Hard i believe it is the shoulder pads, and for easy it is the four pads(Triangle,X,O,Square) and the shoulder pads(few times). It can be frustrating at first especially when you do not know what to do, but the good news is there is a tutorial for each thing in the loading scenes and it's not to hard if you examine the controls, it almost has the WII-Style to it.Conclusion: Heavy Rain is a must buy for anyone looking for a new game of Fresh Air and worthy of purchasing a PS3, and is tired of the usual FPS,Sports etc etc and wants to have a new type of game, a feel for unique characters, and their problems, their strengths and weaknesses, and likes a good Psychological Thriller and a cleverly written story Mystery on Heavy Rain of who the Orgami Killer is. The Storyline might be confusing in the end but you will understand it later on. Everyone should give this game a buy if you have the money, and those who do not should still rent it, it is something not to be passed on, it is a one in a trillion type of game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2010"}

There are a couple of things you should know if you are considering this console, though...The PS One is simply a Playstation, it plays all the same games, and offers no improvements in speed or graphics.  If you look at the picture, the system actually is about the same size as the controller!  It's very small, and yes, very &quot;cute&quot;, but all Sony did was take the old Playstation and put it in a new case.The PS One is not really a portable system.  The LCD screens I've seen for it are the size of a CD - hardly big enough for most PS games, especially RPGs.  Also, you will still need a power outlet, and the controller will always be seperate, so playing a few rounds of Tony Hawk between classes is hardly convenient.  It is easier to move from TV to TV, though.The Playstation 2 plays 99.9% of the games that the PS One does. Also, the PS2 improves the graphics and loads the games slightly faster.  If you are absolutely certain that you are getting a PS2 in the next 12 months, you might want to wait.  Better yet, spend your money on the outstanding Dreamcast.So why get a PS One?  Well, if you are in the same position as I am - you have a broken Playstation and a large library of games that you miss.  I play RPGs on a small TV in my bedroom before I go to sleep, whereas I want to keep my PS2 in the living room for the DVD playback.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2000"}

BioShock immerses players into a war-torn underwater utopia, where mankind has abandoned their humanity in their quest for perfection.","reviewerName":"S.Papstein","summary":"The Deep Sea Will Keep You In High Spirits","reviewText":"The FPS genre today is missing something: originality. Most two-bit shooters feature a gunslinging commando fighting off hordes of bug mutants of the 5th dimension (in other games, it's Nazis), all tied together with a goofy, testosterone-soaked story. So once Bioshock appeared the radar screen, everyone kept a curious eye on it's heavy 50's nostalgic enviroment.Originality is what was key for seperating Bioshock from all others, showing the player a variety that no other has done. Origonality, as in creating a Atlantis-esque city as the setting. Originality, as in keeping the tone straight 50's, from music, to buildings, to language to dress code. Imagine a gargatuan Divign Suit man, wandering around with little girls with hyperdermic needles, that's very original.But the real question is, \"Can Bioshock keep it's originality, and still be fun\"? 2K made Bioshock into an outstanding game. The controls feel fluid and very user-friendly, and graphics where slick (I encountered only one frame-rate issue.) The setting and Big Daddy battles where the two features that sold me; fighting a goon, who's in a Diving Suit, with a 100lb drill that KO's you into neon lights fixtures, while Billy Holiday sings in the backround is an experience that I've seen from no other. Bioshock will be a cult classic, because it is so unique from anything else. Is it original to have powers such as incineration, swarms of bugs and electricity at your finger tips, and give them an equal role as guns and gernades and an FPS? You bet.Bioshock is a must play game, there is nothing queit like it anywhere. The problem I had that kept it from achieving a perfect score is not the story, but it's presentation. The plot holds it's own, telling of a utopia gone wrong, and you are (what seems to be) a man in the wrong-place wrong-time scenario, witnessing the aftermath of a civil war of the civilians. It is all told through audio logs, which I can appriciate, but all of them where turned down so low, I could bearly hear what was going on. Subtitles where microscopic (I'm playing on a SD, 19inch, so it's partialy my fault), and I'd constantly have to pause the game and listen in complete silence to find out what was happening. It took me out of the experiance on many occasions. Other than that, Bioshock is a must play for any fan of any genre, period. It would recieve a 9/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2008"}

I like how it is higher up on the controller now so you won't ever accidentally hit it when going for the start/back buttons.Speaking of which, I guess that's my only very minor complaint. They should have stuck with \"Start\" and \"Back\" as the names for those two center buttons.

Gameplay is broken down into missions,  each with objectives that must be unerringly completed before  progressing to the next mission. This is not your typical kill-anything-that-moves  game: putting a bullet in the wrong person, not keeping the  right one alive, or perforating a seemingly unimportant inanimate object  can often result in mission failure.WhilePerfect Dark's solo missions play out much like those inGoldenEye 007, the game's fantastic multiplayer options are  another matter entirely. Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy.

More often than not, it's common to hear people sing the praises of the caped crusader based solely on The Dark Knight Trilogy and the events within it. But when you take a look back at the character's history, Gotham's stoic protector is not a superhero with consistently high-octane events occurring all around him. Instead, he is a detective with an arsenal of fanciful gadgets, who pushes himself physically and mentally to solve crimes and clean the streets. He is more \"Man\" than \"Bat\", really, and people often seem to forget that.Luckily, Warner Brothers Games Montreal have not, and despite their questionable handling of the gameplay at times, they have managed to craft a truly engaging experience that manages to delve deeper into the tortured protagonist in the mixed, but ultimately recommended \"Batman: Arkham Origins.\"We're spared the origin story we've been told umpteen times by now (little rich boy sees parents get killed, stumbles upon cave, grows up, trains, fights criminals), and instead, \"Origins\" delves into the beginnings of Batman's early crime-fighting escapades. Only, not all of Gotham sees him as a hero, as the police doggedly pursue him, and people he protects from thugs cower in fear at his very presence. Even Gordon (pre-Commissioner days) doesn't like the guy. That doesn't make it any easier for our lovable anti-hero when he already has a city full of assassins sent to kill him for a ridiculously high bounty. But all is not as it seems, and as the plot thickens, we see power dynamics among villains shift, we see the corruption tearing apart Gotham's police department, and we see the introduction of an infamous foe who decidedly shakes up the course of the narrative.The narrative here is, in a word, shocking. This take on Batman is shockingly dark, much more in line with the Frank Miller and Alan Moore styles of storytelling than, say, the Paul Dini method. Some of the content in this game quite frankly pushes the envelopes of what can be done in a T rating, delving into some deeply disturbing content both graphically and tonally. Not that this is a bad thing, of course, because it all blends up into a delicious stew of gritty, compelling goodness, and ends up becoming my favorite plot in the entire Arkham series of games. We get to know Batman as a character more deeply, smaller villains are given their time to shine, and the seedier days of Gotham City are fully explored to a very effective extent. Not only that, but the titular character is much less focused on heroics, and more interested in sneaking through vents, investigating crime scenes, and taking down in goons in a quick, brutal fashion. This is an origin story worth telling, and one that will stick with me.But there is a huge caviat here, and one that I feel I should fairly warn people about. The gameplay is... well, to put it simply, it's pretty unremarkable for a good portion of the game. While the combat of the series is unchanged, and is still very satisfying, it's gotten to a point where I feel some variety might need to be in order. Yes, they do introduce new enemy types, and yes, the new gadgets are very cool (more on those in a second), but the combat and exploration themselves need a major overhaul in the next entry, and WB's refusal to address that concern might lead to a seriously awful game. Slogging through waves of enemies gets to be a bit of a chore, and getting lost due to lack of a good navigation system threatens to undermine my enjoyment of the game.Luckily, however, those concerns are offset by some pleasant surprises that keep me coming back for more. First and foremost, the stealth segments of \"Origins\" are undoubtedly the best in the series, giving players a wider variety of ways to take down enemies. The head-on approach works fine, but so do stalking and incapacitating, using gadgets to stun and dispatch foes, or simply finding ways to sneak past a majority of the enemies without any major conflict. New gadgets aid this variety. My personal favorite is the Remote Wire, which can act as a tightrope to sneak above enemies, a zipline to kick people in the face, or a wire to fling objects into people, or to fling people off of ledges. Yes, it's a little reminiscent of \"Just Cause 2\"'s grappling hook, but it's still a fun little tool, and just one of the many gadgets that do a good job of allowing players to play how they want to.Another nice addition are the expanded crime scenes, which Batman now uses more high-tech gadgetry to recreate. He can fast-forward and rewind time to look for more details and inconsistencies, which all eventually adds up to a really cool cutscene that shows players blow-by-blow what happened. Personally, I really like this mechanic, but there are some issues. First off, it kind of feels like it handholds players through these segments, taking away a real sense of discovery. Sure, we eventually get a really cool explanation of everything that's transpired, but it feels kind of linear. But my second concern is a bit more major, which is that this was a crucial gameplay mechanic in this year's fantastic \"Remember Me\", and for this game to ape it and not expand upon feels kind of cheap. Other than those two issues, however, it's nice to see Batman going back to his \"Detective Comics\" days.So, when it all adds together, the gameplay is serviceable. Combat is great but overused, exploration is fun but poorly guided; however, the stealth and detective work aspects bring it up to something that I would recommend to a good portion of people. Couple that with side missions that I feel genuinely add to the world and the overarching narrative, and you've got a pretty solid package. But there's one thing that almost ruins the entire experience altogether, and that's the shocking amount of bugs. Bosses automatically die, Batman clips into areas before he's supposed to there, enemy models get stuck in walls (or go through them), and waypoints simply don't appear. It's upsetting that WB saw this fit to release in this state, and while it is still a fun game that is worth playing, it's pretty freaking rough for a \"AAA\" title.And seeing that this a \"AAA\" title, it stands to reason that the game would have good visuals, and indeed, it's a fairly nice-looking game. Enemy designs are fairly varied, and the rogue's gallery of villains on display offers a nice range of psychotic baddies. Batman's character model itself is also something impressive, and it actually has more detail than we've historically seen on him in games, from scrapes on his armor to a defined beard. The locales fair a little worse, though. While Gotham is a fun city to explore, the visuals used to render it are often ugly, and more often than not, you're going to experience some pop-ins and graphical glitches. That being said, building interiors are intricately designed, brimming with things to do and ways to approach different missions. So while the graphics are fairly decent, the design underneath them fairs a bit better.Unquestionably to me, though, the best part of this game next to the compelling narrative is fantastic audio work that went into it. The soundtrack bleeds atmosphere, and hits all of the high notes one expects from a Batman experience, along with complementing each narrative twist along the way. Even the music for side missions (such as a drug-induced trip into Wonderland courtesy of The Mad Hatter) is great. Same goes for the vocal cast, with new V.A.s taking over the iconic roles of Batman and Joker, and completely nailing it. Even the smaller bits of dialogue, such as banter between dim-witted thugs, is well-written and performed with a screwball, comic book-y tone that gives some extra humor to offset the grim nature of the game.This game is not perfect, and in fact, many parts of are woefully unpolished. However, that does not make it a bad game in my mind. It is clear that plenty of effort went into making the story and gameplay come together, as well as into the fantastic voice acting and scoring. While some critics see \"Origins\" as a cash-grab and a rush job, I'm liable to disagree. It is a fun, if flawed, journey, and while it certainly won't be one of the best games of 2013, it is one that I would encourage people to try, especially if they want to see Batman done in a suitably gritty and dark fashion.\"Batman: Arkham Origins\" is a smaller, more focused game that its predecessors, and while it suffers due to some unfortunate design choices and poor bug testing, it is still very much worth playing just to feel the gratification of getting under the hood once again.Plot: 9.5Gameplay: 7Graphics: 7Sound: 9Overall: 8","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2013"}

{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","reviewerName":"Jeffrey Owens","summary":"Hands Down, the Greatest Game I have played","reviewText":"The title says it all, but don't be mislead. The game has flaws, as everything does, such as the AI sometimes sprinting by Clickers for some reason, or always seeming to want to hug you when in cover. But somehow, none of these things bugged my experience, because rarely would they spring around like idiots, and the I moved from cover to cover often enough that hugging didn't happen too much. The mechanics of the cover system, the upgrading system, the enemy AI, the creation of items system, and the shooting mechanics were all amazing, refreshing, tense, and when on the hardest difficulty, darn right pressuring. If the game was what is was without the story, it would be a solid 8, possibly 9 for me just because the mechanics are rock solid (Naughty Dog has defiantly almost perfected their skills that they gained from Uncharted). But What made this the best game I have ever played was the story and the atmosphere. This game is gorgeous, dirty, dark, and real. The environments felt alive to me, and felt very realistic, as did the people and their reactions and actions to what I did and do. The story made me sometimes hate my actions, but I also knew I had no choice, same as them. Joel and Ellie are fantastic and amazing characters that are real, deep, complex, and are tossed into a partnership together that neither wanted, but both had to do. If anything, everyone out there needs to at least watch this game and the story progression of it, for it is one of the more refreshing approaches on a story line that could have easily been forgettable and cliche. Naughty Dog has surpassed all they had done before, and I feel like this is just the start. Before I finish, I want to mention the Mulitplayer. Multiplayer can be hit or miss with games like this, such as Spec Ops: The Line, but for this case the multiplayer is fantastic and actually a great complement and parallel to the single player. The Multiplayer forces players to work together, to think together, and to be aware, just like the story mode. There are only two modes so far, both are four versus four teams, but one mode is round based with each team only having their starting lives to work with, while the other mode has a pool of 20 revives for each team to work with. Both see which team can come out on top, and although they sound basic and boring, they are the complete opposite. They are intense to play, especially when both teams know what they are doing and communicate well. All in all, try the game. If you hate it or dislike it, that is your own opinion. But never just take words around you before trying something yourself.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXGU8","description":"","reviewerName":"Private Quentin Tarantino Fan","summary":"Crysis fans, Rejoice! (4.5/5)","reviewText":"First off, I want to issue a bit of a warning come in here for you folks interested in single player.  Crysis 3 is short.  Much shorter than Crysis 2 and the first game.  However, as I write this review, having payed the full amount of cash, I usually don't say this, but here goes:  I'm glad I payed the crazy amount of money for Crysis 3.  Crysis 3 has made this Crysis fan THIS happy.  There is tons of replay value in its excellent, open-ended game play, and the set pieces I found are so outstanding that I can see myself playing through them more than once.  I'm more than ready to do so myself.  So I'm not at all worried about the short campaign; its sheer re-playable quality over forgettable quantity!  Take my word for it, Crysis fans.In a world where generic, cookie cutter titles clutter the FPS genre, the Crysis series has always been a kick-ass counterpoint to all of the aforementioned clutter.  The original Crysis is the second best FPS I've ever played (Half-Life 2 is No. 1), and the series overall is one of the best I've ever played.  FPS junkies everywhere rejoice upon playing Crysis, and there's a darn good reason for it.  Now, the series is back with Crysis 3, and it's as as predictably awesome as you expect.  Amazing visuals, smart gun play, fantastic production values...you know the score.  This is an excellent FPS, and its a wonderful continuation of the FPS genre's winning streak with 2012's brilliant Far Cry 3.We all know the Crysis series is known for its eyeball melting visuals, and Crysis 3 is no different from previous games in the series.  Let me just say that Crysis 3 looks absolutely gorgeous, and its a technical marvel to behold.  What's even more amazing this time around is the art direction.  Everything here just looks so inspired, telling; you feel you are truly in the jungle, and each level has a brilliant aesthetic that with each of the seven natural wonders.  Oh, and as usual, sound is absolutely amazing.  Explosions are devastating, gunfire sounds absolutely relentless, the Seth sound downright vicious, and the Nano-suit sound effects are empowering.  The Crysis series has one of the most visceral use of sound in gaming, and Crysis 3 assaults you like it's no tomorrow.  It's oh so worth it.  Get your home theater/amazing computer speakers/high quality headphones ready and crank it straight to the top!Regarding Crysis 3's story, the focused story-telling in the form of scripted sequences doesn't mean much if the content of the story doesn't match up.  Fortunately, Crysis 3 has a well told and exciting story that recalls a well done summer blockbuster.  This time, Prophet from Crysis returns after a twenty year period to New York City.  The city has been taken over by Cell Corporation and converted NYC into a large Eco-dome in order to use the city as a land and technology grab.  Through manipulation and whitewashing, Cell Corporation has successfully put into practice their plans of world domination, and hereby looms the end of the world as well. Meanwhile, protagonist must deal with the impending threat and fight his own struggles as a nano-soldier.  Fans who followed the tales of their favorite nano-suit soldiers from the beginning will be satisfied by the story.  As a fan of the series, I count myself amongst the satisfied.  Yeah, Crysis 3 is stellar on the non-game play front in every way.Now, for game play.  Crysis 3 aims to take influences from the best aspects of the two previous titles, while cutting out the worst of each. It merges the focused storytelling of the second game with the emergent sandbox tactics the first game provided. The levels are much more sand boxed based than the second game, which gives the player a greater amount of combat freedom. Second hand, there are many game play choices and tweaks that make the game much more smooth.  Finally, Crysis 3 ends up throwing some all new things into the mix the Crysis series hasn't seen before.  It's quite an amazing melange of game play mechanics, and in conjunction, Crysis 3 feels incredibly cinematic but never takes away your control during combat.  As long as you are playing the game on the highest difficulty (and you should be), there's so much game play meat to Crysis 3.  It's an utter joy to play, again and again.Crysis 3 shares similar controls and mechanics to Crysis 2. although you can now spring without reservations.  The new Seph weapons are awesome, and being able to collect upgrades for the nano-suit adds an awesome level of bodily customization (being able to tweak and customize your various abilities).  The Bow is probably the most advertised feature of Crysis 3, and its awesome.  While definitely a stealth component, using it as an offensive weapon is very possible, due to its multiple ammunition.  It doesn't replace all of your other weapons (ammo is much too scarce), but it adds a definite amount of strategy.  Being able to shock people, kill enemies in clusters, and snipe without draining your suit offers for some incredibly fun.  Finally, I can't forget the fact you can hack turrets in order to take out enemies for you (hint: when hacking, use cloak).  There's a ton of new systems at hand, and being able to use all of these within the game adds a ton of tactical options that solidify Crysis as one of the best FPS series around.Level design in particular is excellent, and a big improvement over the second.  This is where Crysis 2 was lacking in my opinion, because as we all know the sandbox style level design was toned down severely in comparison to the first.  Here, I feel that they have found that excellent sweet spot that let's you have player agency, but still focuses you down a controlled path.  This is easily my favorite I want to let it known though, is that Crysis 3 has numerous level layouts, with both sandbox battlefields and tight corridors; and everything in between.  Frankly, I see nothing wrong with variety.  I enjoy open space as much as do tight corridors, so the variety is fine for me.  It's not the go everywhere shtick of the first Crysis, but since most of Crysis was (let's be honest here) full of nothing to do, it's not a big issue.  I'd say the tactical design of Crysis 3 is stellar.Needless to say, I'm well satisfied with the results.  The set pieces are awesome, and the game is best played with the desire to explore game mechanics.  Taking it slow, picking off enemies, and using all that I've got (which is alot), is the best way to play this awesome game.  I will be playing single player campaign missions for a long time.MP, of course, is another part of the package.  Crysis 3 uses the standard progression based MP that the industry is known for, butw hat Crysis 3 has over other shooters is the nano-suit, as well as other weapons such as the bow.  All of the pretty much depends on how skilled you are with the mechanics, and those who use Crysis 3's multiple mechanics in various ways make for some interesting combat.  It's a ton of fun, and it adds a ton of replay value to the overall game.  I can't wait to see what hardcore Crysis players will end up doing with the Mp mode.  It's life-span is hard to predict as of right now, but hopefully a community will form.  Granted, I don't know, nor do I care honestly, that Crysis 3 can compete with COD or Halo.  All I care about is that it's incredibly fun, so what else do you want to know (after all, popularity does NOT necessarily make something good)?Alright, that's Crysis 3.  As a huge fan of the series, I'm hugely satisfied with this.  I will admit that you may want to pass this game if you don't care about Crysis (if you don't, why are you even reading this?), but for Crysis fans, I give this one my absolutely stamp of approval.  It's definitely the best of both worlds when it comes to Crysis (though my favorite in the series overall is still the first game), and it's almost sublime to see where this While I do let note that the campaign is shorter than previous games, I also wouldn't lie to you when I think the single player is worth playing over and over again.  I mean, one session of Crysis is simply not enough!  This is definitely the best FPS released this year (so far), and other games are going to have to offer a lot in order to compete with this one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2013"}
{"product_name":"B004WLRQMI","reviewerName":"Bryan","summary":"Good value, but overly linear. Some puzzles are a little picky.","reviewText":"Regardless of what I'm about to say, the game is still a recommended buy for Wii owners at the price it goes for now. You'll certainly get your money's worth from this title at under $20.Now, I'm not going to do an in-depth review for this as it's been seven years since this game came out, and you can read plenty enough about the game already. Mostly I wanted to present a good counterpoint to people who are giving it 5 stars saying it's the greatest Zelda game. I certainly would disagree with that very strongly! The game is simply too linear.The classic Zelda games met success by giving the player the ability to explore a huge world right from the outset, limited only from some areas by lack of specific items. These items were found within various dungeons, and you would not need to even complete a dungeon to move on to a new area as long as the proper items were obtained. This was the formula that made Zelda a hit because up to that point, most games were more like Super Mario Brothers where you just went in a straight line to the end of a level. Zelda was really a companion game to Super Mario Brothers in a sense, in that it offered an excellent non-linear adventure that rivaled the awesome linear adventure that you had in Mario.Now in 2006 we oddly got to the point where Zelda Twilight Princess has somehow found itself to be the linear game that Zelda was never meant to be. The world is heavily gated by puzzles which must be solved in order. You will only get access to the world in small bits, and only get to finally explore in any meaningful sense 10+ hours into the game.Does this make Twilight Princess a bad game? Not necessarily, but you have to consider why Nintendo has suddenly in 2013 released the most non-linear Zelda in history: A Link Between Worlds. Despite the glowing reviews you see here for Twilight Princess, the linear style of this game and Skyward Sword was absolutely something a great many players were upset about, and Nintendo addressed it in a big way.  The issue here is that there's really NO reason other than the plot that you shouldn't be allowed to head out and explore the world. The game designers have built this big world, why lock it up behind hundreds of challenging puzzles just for the sake of the plot? Heck, when you become the wolf, you won't even be allowed to go back outside to places you've already been! For some reason, it yells at you for trying to leave the area once you're a wolf. Silly.I'm taking off a second star because I felt that a lot of the puzzles had issues where you were struggling to figure out if you were actually doing it wrong or if the game just was being overly picky. A lot of times, the game was, in fact, rather picky about the precise way you were to do something. A good example is right at the start of the game where you were supposed to fish, but it was really vague about how to successfully accomplish this.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2013"}

Harp","summary":"Poor Quality Release","reviewText":"I usually think the ranting reviews of Madden every year are overboard, but this is a really poor quality release. I'm actually going to return it, which at $40 for a trade-in is what I paid for it after the Amazon $20 credit for purchasing it. I've played Madden every year since the mid-90s and have never really been upset with a release. There are always glitches and annoyances, but overall the game is fun and realistic so I can live with it. I did not buy 11 last year b/c I just didn't have time to play much. So, Pros/Cons since v10 follow.Pros- Sideline catches work now! In v10 receivers would just continue running with no concept of the sideline.- Graphically it looks better than v10.- Auto-sprint and auto-strafe are nice additions.- Half-time is gone, which was annoying in v10 because they would run down the games.Cons- Announcers are consistently out of sync with the action both time-wise and action-wise. I just picked off a pass and returned it for a TD for example, and they start talking about how \"the CB took a risk on the pick and missed and then he has to hope for Safety help, Safety can live with an aggressive corner\" like I didn't even get the pick! Time-wise, you can literally make a first down or score, and no mention of it then when your lining up for the next play all of a sudden \"Huge Touchdown right there!\" And sometimes a mundane 5 yard catch in the middle of the game is met with \"Huge catch there!!\" from them. WTF?- Rosters are horribly out of date, and the game prompted me to update it the first time I played it. Some examples; Palmer is playing for the Bengals, Hasslebeck for Seattle, and Asomugha isn't on the Eagles roster. It's like they never bothered to update the rosters from last year?- You can't turn off accelerated clock in Franchise mode (it always runs down to 20s), which makes no sense to me and makes it harder for folks that like to adjust their play before the snap.- In-game menus are really slow. It's very clunky to change formations or the like, to the point where you can easily get screwed up because your hands are moving faster than the menus.- The overall game is slow, maybe we're reaching the limits of the XBox hardware, I'm not sure.- Using the A button for kicking is harder than necessary, since it's not as responsive as the stick was so you have to better anticipate timing and mash accordingly. I don't really understand the point of this one, since the stick worked perfectly well. Making kicking harder would be fine, but making it more tedious doesn't work for me.- Replays! Their on every play, half the time they don't even show the key part of the play and I can't figure out how to turn them off. Again, just another clunky interruption to the gameplay.It just doesn't seem as fun this year, since you're playing against rosters that aren't accurate and the overall mechanics are clunky throughout the game so I'm sending it back...","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2011"}

There are only two controller ports.  This is disappointing.Also, I prefer the eject loading of earlier models vs. the top load, especially since I have to either pull the system out to chance discs each time or reach into the shelf to do so.  That in itself isn't so much my biggest problem as is my worry of dust, defect, etc., with the insides exposed everytime not only I load but my kids load a disc, and they're the main ones playing games and swapping movies out.  I had a rule that only I would change them at first, but it lasted all of three days, it's just unreasonable.  And of course, as most models since the first or second ps3's came out, not backwards compatible, but that's to be expected at this point.Still, a great deal, and the games are great. If you can find the price comparable with more controller ports and a front loader though, I'd recommend that, unless you don't take issue with it.  I find the top loader buggy myself, though.

Nothing spectacular, but everything did a good job of keeping things relatively immersive. Be warned that due to programming differences, people playing this on backwards-compatible PS3s may see strange distortions of water or loose clothing. Many recent (especially HD) games feel the need to make everything dull, poorly lit, and drably dark. This game looks bright and clear, even when the \"dark and gritty\" might potentially further the setting, but I think it's a pleasant experience. Far better to sneak through a maze of evil soldiers that you can see than bumping into things because you can't tell where the next turn is.Graphics: 6/10Like the graphics, I found none of the sounds exceptional but all of them seemed fitting. There weren't any strange distortions, and the design does a fairly good job of putting everything together and voicing to make a compelling and entertaining experience.Sound: 6.5/10Like the sound, the music did a good job of helping to build and maintain the scene, especially when trying to show everything could have been awkward (at least from a design and art department standpoint). When you walk into a bio-toxin factory, the atmosphere is suitably unsettling, and when flying through the air or cruising on ship the music helps pick things up.Music: 6.7/10Although there are more than a few instances of having to struggle with the controls and camera as well as the enemies and environment, the levels and behaviors are remarkably smooth. Guards are rather stupid, but this is a game designed to be beaten, not to be sadistic against players. The combat is a tad awkward and you're not going to see a lot of fast-paced action here, but it's a stealth/adventure game and plays those aspects fairly well.Gameplay: 7.2/10There is no replay option beyond starting a new game, and as fairly linear as the story itself was you won't find yourself with much reason except watching the cutscenes again.Replayability: 1/10This game received a fair amount of acclaim, and I think most of it is rightly earned. The environments are detailed enough to enhance the setting without making you feel lost or blind, the characters and story felt compelling, and despite the fact that the end finished on a boss fight when combat is NOT this game's strong suit, it closed with a rather triumphant sense. You may not play it multiple times, but you'll probably enjoy your main play-through.Overall: 7.6/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2011"}

Fig.","summary":"A MUST buy for any Mafia game fan.","reviewText":"I've waited a while before reviewing this game, because I wanted to have a full experience with it and I must say, this game is amazing.You play as Vito Escaleta, a war vet going back home for a while (or not), I won't ruin/spoil it for you.Anyway, the game goes back to its roots, if you played the original Mafia, you'll feel right at home with this game, controls have been improved and the game mechanics are simply the best. Graphics are top notch, the term \"attention to detail\" would be an understatement, from the buildings to the water line, everything is simply beautiful; every building has been carefully designed and colored to match the era.Driving is easy and fun, there's 3 radio stations playing hits by Bo Diddly, Eddie Cochran,Dean Martin and many others, the music is different in parts of the game, depending on what year it is. Also, while you're driving, you'll notice the physics of the game, everything from the characters reaction to sudden stops, etc. Also, there's speed limits and one must be careful, specially around street cops and cop cars. You will see car damage and you will run out gas, things like these, make the game that much more realistic. The car models/makes are not actual, but you can see their reference to the actual cars in the era. Why didn't the game creators use real car brands? I couldn't say, but I can say this, it didn't matter to me.If you played the original Mafia, you'll appreciate an episode/mission in Mafia II that will take you back to the original, you will either hate it or love or both (in a good way, can't say more without spoiling it). I did both. I felt bad and at the same time couldn't help laughing about it.You can explore the entire city as you please, there's not restrictions to where you can go. There are some challenges too, things like, finding Playboy Magazines, Wanted Posters, etc.As with any other big game like this, street characters are recycled, you'll see the same people at times, but this is a minor issue. The game took me a good 17+ hours to finish, including all challenges, but there are online guides all over, to help you finish it sooner.So far, I've played this game in all levels of difficulty. It is that good.Some final words, this game will take you back in time, once you drive around, listening to some great old tunes, you can't help feeling nostalgic for a time period, that most of us did not live in. It is a strange experience and a great one at it. I still play the game just to listen to the music, for the driving experience, for the graphics details. A gorgeous game. Buy it. You won't regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2011"}

Wii, like all the previous releases in theSuper Mario Bros.franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros.

Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun.

The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"Jordan","summary":"Better Than Super Mario Galaxy Games...","reviewText":"I've played both Mario Galaxy games as well as this one and I have to say this game reins supreme.

It's quite impressive actually. But I can't stand how the upper flap is layered still; it's still unusable.----------Original review:Generally, it does what it says. It carries the PSVita and protects it from harm. I've dropped it once on concrete on accident and nothing was harmed. It gets the job done.However, I'm not happy with [mostly] everything else. The carabiner that was suppose to come with it, didn't even fit in the small loop. I've tried shoving it in, but nope. Doesn't fit at all (so I left it in the box). The top \"level\" where all the games and memory cards, etc go is tucked into the case in such a way that it always flaps into the top. Some pockets for the memory cards are sown into mesh. This makes no sense whatsoever. They could have put a zipper instead of open pockets so that the games,etc won't fall out. I also would NOT recommend putting earphones in it. There is just not enough space because of the flapping \"layer.\"When the Vita is in the case and strapped in, you can't push the L or R buttons. I really wish it did so I could at least play on it while it's in the case.On the center that holds the top and bottom together, I can see some parts already being undone. I've had it... almost 3 weeks now?For the price of it right now, ~$8-ish, it's decent. It does it's job. If you have a few extra dollars to spend, I'd probably get a better one.The case I received didn't have that dreaded smell, so that's a good thing.Edit (5 Feb. 2013): I'm lowering this to 2 stars because I suspect that it's scratching my PSVita's screen. About a week into use, I noticed 3 0.5-1 inch long cuts on my screen (luckily I had a screen protector) and it had to have come from the case. If they got rid of that layer on top, I think it would have been fine.Edit (19 Mar. 2013): I'm actually surprised that this case has held up for so long. There hasn't been any major rips or tears or anything like that. As for the case being too small to hold the Vita, I made a quick adjustment that seems to have done the trick. Instead of putting the Vita inside (the right way up), I put it in upside down so that it sits on the top flap. This method stops the two \"joysticks\" from being smashed since the system is being held up by the two cords when the case is closed.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2012"}

I have not played the previous installments so my review is only for this one. I don't think the one and two star reviews people have given for this is justified. One and two star ratings are for very poor products and this is not one of them. The game play is fluid and graphics are good. Its relativity linear, but has a bit of an open world feel. The character is not supposed to be a hard core face to face fighter and uses the darkness to get around and ambush targets. The instances where you are surprised or screw up and expose yourself, the dodge mechanic works well and I've been able to dodge, not get stabbed and beat the crap out of an attacker with the slap-jack. Again I have not gotten very far in the game and don't have all the upgrades for the bow, but I've loaded up on most of the different types of arrows and they work well. The climbing works well and you can spends hours entering through doors and windows in order to loot items, crack safes and find hidden compartments to redeem for upgrades. There is a definite feel to this game similar to other Square Enix games, which is a plus for me. I do wish there was a few more types of takedowns and a way to takedown multiple targets at a time. this may come later in the game. I recommend this game for players who specifically play characters in certain games that sneak around, plus the other in game functions and graphics make this a good game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2014"}
{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"A fine, inexpensive system designed for the whole family","reviewText":"The Nintendo Wii is the most inexpensive of the current generation of gaming consoles. At only $250, it provides motion sensing controllers which are great fun - and 480p graphics which aren't as good as our other two systems.The Wii is designed around a menu of \"channels\". These make it very easy for even a non-gamer to start using the console quickly. There is of course the game-playing channel, where the Wii will play any Wii or GameCube game. Simply load the disc in and go - it's a simple front-loading \"slot\", no carriage to break. There is a Mii channel where you set up a profile and avatar to connect to all your game playing, with many cute options. You can even make your Mii thin or thick. The Photos channel lets you look at photos on your TV, although its loading options are limited. Other channels for news, weather, and online shopping require an interent connection, and at least at launch aren't available yet.The system does NOT have a regular network cable port, which both the PS3 and XBox 360 have. Instead, it works with built in wireless or with a USB network adapter. I am a firm proponent of wireless - less clutter! So I am thrilled that they offer wireless automatically. With the PS3, you have to pay the extra $100 for the 60 gig unit to get this built in. The XBox 360 doesn't have it at all. We had our wireless up and running in about 5 minutes.It's hard to generalize gameplay on any console - it really depends on what games you buy. That being said, the comes-with-it software of Sports is really quite fun to play and is about as basic as you can get. We've had 8 year olds and adults try it out and really enjoy it. You swing at baseballs, lob tennis balls, bowl, box and play golf. A \"fitness\" mode puts you through a variety of tasks and then calculates your fitness age, sort of like how Brain Age keeps track of your mental age. If you did both every day, you could aim to be as fit mentally and physically as possible!In a world where video games = couch potato, it really is quite amazing to have a game where it natively expects you to move and be active. You don't lounge back and gain pounds here while playing games. Boxing can be quite strenuous, jabbing, blocking and weaving in real life. Tennis involves quick reflexes and strong arm movements. Bowling might be the most relaxed of the sports, but even there you are standing, moving, swinging. You get your heart going at least a little, and get some exercise. My boyfriend found his arms were sore after a few hours of fun gaming.The 480p resolution is certainly not high def 1080p like our other two systems. It's something you accept when you're paying such a low price for the console. But really, it's not that big a deal. I still play the old Zeldas and love them for their gameplay, even though you can't see the pores in Link's face. If they are going for the cartooney characters and environments, 480p is DVD quality and is quite good. If you really, really crave high definition super realism in your games, then the Wii might not be the best choice for you. However, if you're fine with playing games with a more impressionist / cartooney look to them, the 480p can show that quite nicely. For example, in Wii baseball, there aren't fans in the bleachers - just colored blocks.Nintendo has always been known as a \"Kid's Console\" - but I really do think with the Wii that they have become a \"Family Console\". It's not just kids who will enjoy this. Seniors can have fun bowling without knowing anything \"Tricky\" about how to use a video game unit. It's very intuitive. Moms can easily play with their kids, each with their own Wii profile. Adults having parties can have fun passing the controllers around. Family groups can share slideshows on the big screen while hanging out and drinking wine.With the price tag being so low, a gaming household that \"needs\" a higher end system can easily save up their money to get that XBox 360 or PS3 - and still be able to justify the $250 to get a Wii for the fun, casual gaming stuff to share with their non-gaming friends.Well recommended! I do own all three systems, and use all three online, so feel free to write me if you have questions or want help with something.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2006"}
{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"One of the top games this generation","reviewText":"It's so rare to find a game that not only is immaculately well designed and developed but seems to be more than just what it is. Sure other games are fun but you also have groundbreakers or just plain old awesome. It's kind of hard actually to review Bioshock since it doesn't really do anything that hasn't been done before in other FPS but what it does do it arguably does better than others. The look, feel, the sound as well as the story come together and with the developers behind the spooky \"System Shock 2\", Bioshock is a landmark achievement in gaming and needs to be experienced at least once.Story: The game begins as you're on a plane carrying a package and photo when all of a sudden, the plane crashes into the ocean (nicely done in sound only). Emerging to the surface, you spot a nearby lighthouse with a bathysphere on the bottom which takes you to the wondrous city of Rapture, a haven for scientists, workers and everyone who feels threatened or stifled by the surface world's rules, regulations, morality problems or government and religious restrictions. But something's wrong and what should be a thriving city seems to be falling apart, bizarre deformed people roam the hallways, a man on a radio needs your help and strange growling sounds seem to be heard echoing down the hallways.Graphics: Bioshock's hugest draw is the art decoration and atmosphere which completely manages to immerse you in the environment and is one of the few game worlds that makes you feel like you're actually in that space. From period-specific designs to the ocean outside the glass and stunning water effects, Bioshock simply looks incredible. I occasionally ran into minor slowdown but it was minimal and loading times are only reserved for accessing the levels at the start. But still, this is a game to play on an HD television set.Sound/Music: Working in the similar vein as horror titles, Bioshock's sound design is quite flawless and unlike in other games where a sound has to be accompanied by something causing it (and usually kill-you thinking), a lot of Bioshock's sound is just simply environmental. The creaking and groaning of the structure, gushing water or the distant cave-ins of the place, it's hard not to feel like the whole place could implode at any moment. The voice acting is great as well with the voices of Atlas, a doctor Tenenbaum and Andrew Ryan, Rapture's brainchild, or the big heavies but most of the time it's the frenzied chattering of the \"splicers\", Rapture's residents.Gameplay: Nowadays, the big thing in gaming seems to be open-world gameplay or sandbox style where the gamer can really do anything they want. Whereas those games are a bit more lenient in exploring, Bioshock has an end goal the whole time but it's hard not to just explore and see what kind of goodies you can find. You can find ammo, healing items or scattered item machines that you can hack to decrease the price. This is probably one of Bioshock's few flaws: the hacking game is so tedious and many times it's very easy to hit a dead-in and have security on your tail that sometimes it feels almost like luck unless you have an auto-hack tool.Guns are standard FPS style but old-school so rocket launchers look bulky and not as slick and sexy as newer models, pistols and handguns are now revolvers and assault rifles look more like tommy guns now. The big change is in plasmids, special abilities mapped to your LB and activated by the LT. Some attack enemies directly like Incinerate or Electro Bolt while some offer amusing tactics like Security Bullseye where any turret guns, RPG launchers and security drones will solely focus on the target or Enrage which causes enemies to attack other ones besides you. It's here where a nice variety is found since people might prefer offense while some have a bit more strategy in mind. These abilities also apply to other areas such as slowing down the hacking game, causing electrical static when you're hit or bigger wrench damage. It's nice to customize though some are somewhat useless.So unless you didn't know already, you're wondering what's that scuba diver dude on the cover? That is a Big Daddy, the groaner who protects girls known as Little Sisters, genetically modified youngsters. Helping a Little Sister is beneficial since it allows gene upgrades but there's one problem, the Big Daddy is a big burly bodyguard (nice alliteration, no?) and he's not exactly going to let you mess with her so be prepared for an epic fight. Now found in the rooms of Rapture are what's known as Vita-Chambers...basically checkpoints should you die. It's here where people complain that the game is too easy but honestly I found them helpful. See Big Daddies are tough sons-of-*****es who take quite awhile to kill, not to mention powerful melee and weaponry attacks and killing one is quite the endeavor so should you die against one, instead of resetting his health, you spawn in a chamber, run to where he last was and fight some more. Sure it's just a case of persistence but it also makes what would be frequent and frustrating encounters are more bearable. Once you're done, you can choose to harvest (kill) or rescue the Little Sister. It's not quite as grey-area as the game would like but it works quite well anyway.Is the game worth buying? Definately. Only thing that might hold it back is the lack of multiplayer but this game doesn't need it really. That's what Halo and Call of Duty games are for. It's long, involving, gorgeous and fun as hell so if you have a 360, it's just a simple question: why haven't you bought this yet?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2009"}

The characters talk during your game play so you see no communication, no emotions, no interactions.-you have annoying homeless people in your face every 10 seconds asking you for money-you have annoying crazy people that push you even when your 10 feet away, for no reason,- The guards want to kill you for any little thing you do,  you could be walking or running and they suspect you did something wrongIf you played the other assassins creed and want to know how the story started you play this, if not just play the latest assassins creed which is way better then this","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2012"}

The Sims 2 has provided my family with hours upon hours of fun. There are so many aspects to the game. It is like a virtual doll house for the girls but it has aspects that boys love as well, like vampires, zombies and werewolves (expansions required for these). Your sims can be sweet and nice or be just plain evil. This game has something for every personality. Even my 2-year-old loves to watch my husband and I play with our sim pets (Pets expansion required). It really is fun for the whole family!One of the things I love most about this game, is that a family can all play and have their own neighborhoods and custom content. Just create a username on your PC for each of your children and your spouse, and each member of the family can play and have their own downloads folder for custom content.!!!WARNING FOR PARENTS OF MINOR CHILDREN!!!If your child is old enough to understand how to use search engines, they will likely stumble across adult content for The Sims 2. I highly recommend blocking these sites as they are VERY easy to get into and the content is extremely easy to install. I wasn't aware of this when we first purchased the game 2 years ago and one very popular website in particular mixed adult content in with the regular content, though they have since moved the content to a different site.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2007"}

She loves going to the aquarium and looking at all the marine life.  This game is like having your own giant aquarium in your TV!  There is a twist to that however.  Not only do you get to look at fish, and marine mammals of all kinds, you explore underwater caves, coral reefs, lagoons.  You will find treasure, fossils, underwater villages.  There is even night diving which only adds to the beauty of the deep.  It's really amazing what they have done here.  If you want to just swim and explore and check out the animals, you can do that till your hearts content.  There are little \"missions\" that you can go on, that are given to you, via emails that you receive when you are on your boat.  But you only do them, whenever you feel like it.  The pace is EXTREMELY leasurely, but addictive.  The music soothing yet powerful.  It fits the game perfectly.  My favorite part is that while the kids are playing this game, they are encouraged to learn about sealife.  They are really enjoying this game, and at the bargain price, it's worth a serious look.  If you or your kids are into the ocean, and its inhabitants, I think there is alot to be found in Endless Ocean.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002I08RA0","description":"","reviewerName":"Adnan Chowdhury","summary":"Good Addition but getting stale","reviewText":"I am big fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise. It was one the first game that combined great graphics and gameplay. Now with the latest installment, fans can expect the same thing with continuation with Ezio Auditore' story of being the Master Assassin & the Mentor of Assassin's Brotherhood.Gameplay:There is new hookblade which provides different combat animations and increased movement around the city on ziplines. There are variety of bombs which are in three categories: tatical, diversion and lethal. I played the game and hardly use bombs but I did tried making bombs. You select the kind of casing to use ( metal shell fuse(delayed explosion) or terracotta shell (explode on break), type of explosive and special ingredient to give the bomb the desired effect (poison, sharpnels or smoke), there are some more varieties, and developers claimed that there are 300 combinations to do so. The game follows the same pace as Assassins's Creed 2, side missions and main story, has similar settings. There is the new Den Defense mode where you need the Assassin's Stronghold such as towers from Templar attacks and it absolutely not at all exciting, feels just dumb to play, like as if it was out of context of the game. This is may be the reason why the game got so stale now, its not major change just improvements & additions with new story.Story:Ezio is now in Istanbul, Turkey, in game known as Constantinople. He is on the hunt to retreive the 6 keys of Altair (Assasin from the first game in the series). Each key unlocks a sequence of Altair's memory (where you play as Altair). Of course you will bump in to ups and downs in story. The characters deliver excellent performance in acting makes the experience very cinematic. It is proper conclusion to Ezio and Altair storylines, in return providing the setting for next Assassin's Creed game.Multiplayer:This mode has recieved major improvment from Brotherhood. It is now easy to find matches (before had long searc times), some new game modes such as deathmatch where you don't have compass instead have to identify by looking around in very small part of the map. Another is Steal the artifact which is like Capture the flag. The games have no lag at all, before connection was issue. It is fun and different experience from other shooter games. As you level up in muliplayer, you will unlock special videos that reveal the story of templars, reaching level 50 unlocks the final video which has interesting story tie to main plot.Verdict:Being a fan and finding games getting stale is reason developers are being lazy and not trying out something different and new. I had same experience with Gears of War 3 which is great game but got boring as the experience isn't sufficiently rewarding. I will suggest to buy this game when cheaper. So far there hasn't been new story DLCs, only some stupid multiplayer character and map packs.After finishing the g","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0047TLIBU","description":"","reviewerName":"Review Lover \"ReviewLover\"","summary":"Different","reviewText":"Sequel to the quite incredible \"Dragon Age: Origins\" (and not \"Dragon Age: Oranges\", which was the game I originally asked to be sold in my local game store last year, thereby reducing the sales assistant to tears, and embarrassing myself beyond the point of retrievable fail...), this highly-anticipated action RPG from Bioware hits so, so many high notes that it's easy to forget that, often, it can be less than the sum of its parts.The graphics and sound design in \"Dragon Age: II\" are impeccable - absolutely everything is crisper, clearer, and more beautiful than before. The improvements are difficult to appreciate until you actually sit down to play - long-gone is the slow, deliberate movement of your party through a slightly blocky world that was just a little too grey/brown, and in its place are a series of well-designed, beautifully executed characters, whose attention to detail helps define their personalities as much as the excellent standard of voice acting for each (including your own character - thank you for giving me a voice, Bioware!). Backdrops are highly impressive in their level of detail (although we still don't see many of the actual items in the game - these are almost always held out-of-shot, reminding the player of the game's limitations), and the combination of sound effects and musical score is just as effective as the original game, in its enhancement of the player experience.Some textures are still notably blocky - glaringly so, when most are not - but one massive issue with the audio-visuals in \"Dragon Age: II\" is the size and repeat rate of the play areas. Thaigs, mountain paths, and caves - or I should say Thaig, mountain path and cave - are over-used in a massive way. That swallowed, lost, immersive sense of game world from the original Dragon Age is gone - remember the vast expanses of Thaig that took hours to wade through, and how the werewolf lair opening from the Brecilian Forest made the game seem as though it would last forever? Don't expect that here. There's one main in-game model for Thaig, mountain path and cave, and you'll find yourself exploring slightly different aspects of the same \"stage\" again and again. It feels like Bioware are padding out some of the thinner chapters of the story, and this, more than anything else, reminds you that you're just a visitor in someone else's world - not a participant in a great story.Still, the monstrously good improvements to the game's combat and motion engines mean that the repetitive stages take a backseat to some exquisitely crafted action. While the basic skeleton of the gameplay is very like the original, in \"Dragon Age: II\" you'll find side-quests are shorter and battles are generally pitched at a gentler learning curve. This is a clever compliment to the much-improved speed of battle, and the fluidity with which you engage the enemy now makes Dragon Age combat feel like an organic transition - not an in-game state. The camera is far more free and responsive, and there's a definite sense of improvement to the game's stability. Those of you old enough to remember the difference between the first two \"Tomb Raider\" games will know what I mean when you play.On another note, the gift and relationship system from the first game is almost totally unrecognizable - gifts are now given as part of the main plot, and since there's no more main party camp, relationships (including romance) are dictated by your in-game choices, not convenient conversations by the fireside. It's a big change over the original - particularly painful if, like me, you loved the gift and relationship system from \"Dragon Age: Origins\" - but one which works beautifully when looking at the game as a whole. It, like many other aspects of the gameplay, including truncated side quests and a more manageable difficulty level, is designed to function as a seamless portion of the overall experience.The plot's great - it might take you a few hours to appreciate it, but to any of you who are struggling to find the sweet spot in the initial hours, please don't worry - this game is set over the course of several years, and sticking with it yields the rewards paid out by a well-crafted story populated by memorable characters.On PS3, with the mandatory HDD install, load times are often but not long, and the DLC so far is worth the high price.Overall, I'd give this a four star rating, where the original was five. It's not Dragon Age as you knew and loved it, but \"Dragon Age II\" makes some massive steps in the right direction to improve over the original game's issues. It loses out, sadly, because it can't recapture that all-consuming sense of immersion that the original had in spades, but it's a worthy addition to the series and a pleasure to play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2011"}

I've found this the most engrossing way to play, and at times is a great deal of fun.Here's what I enjoy:You start out by creating a rookie, fresh out of college.  After playing through several scrimmages for scouts, you are drafted based on your performance.  I was drafted by the Memphis Grizzlies in the 1st round.  You'll then play some preseason games and complete drills in order to raise your abilities.  When you begin, your player is for the most part, terrible.  It's the points you're awarded in game and after drills that make all the difference.  You only control your player in the games, and have little control over what else is going on.  This is great when the coach is calling plays for you to participate in, but boring when not or when on the bench (which you can simulated through).Now to the problems that have me close to throwing my controller through the tv:Your in-game performance raises/lowers a letter-grade meter.  When the meter fills, you move up a letter grade and try to then raise it higher (A+ is the highest letter grade you can achieve in-game).  It's great when you're doing what the CPU decides is good, but frustrating when you're docked for \"allowing an inside pass\" (a pass anywhere in the paint, even if your opponents toe is at the top of the key), \"allowing your man to score\" (this is the NBA, nobody is unstoppable), and multiple other frustrating reasons.  Wide open layup made and you're awarded for \"good shot selection\", missed and you're docked for \"poor shot selection\".And speaking of wide open layups, this is the game's biggest flaw!  I'm now on the Lakers, and Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Fischer, Bynum, and Odum routinely miss shots directly under the basket while unguarded.  Just today I played a game where Bryant went 2-26 shooting.  This happens more often than not.  Your team is completely terrible.  And then there's Ron Artest, who will shoot from anywhere as long as he's across midcourt.  It wouldn't be so bad if your CPU opponent wasn't hindered by this same flaw.  They shoot the lights out, at times not missing shots for an entire quarter, and that's with defenders in their faces.I've had numerous occasions where Bryant or Fischer will cross midcourt and throw the ball backwards to me even though I have not called for a pass, resulting in backcourt violation and me getting docked for a turnover.  Offensive rebounds are very difficult to get.  You can move freely through the lane until one of your teammates throws up a prayer, then suddenly an extended arm thrust you backwards.  This compounds the frustration from all the poor shots and easy misses by your teammates.  Defenders are very sticky.  If you bump into one, you will get tangled and molested until you turbo out of their grasp.  At least once a game, I've tried to cut through the paint to follow the play called, bumped into a defender, and got hung up long enough to be called for a 3-second violation, which of course docks you for a turnover.Conclusion:This game makes me mad... very mad.  But it also is a lot of fun.  I can overlook the ridiculous CPU cheap shots just because I'm obsessed with making my player better.  With each game, I gain just a bit more talent (even though a 75 rating for \"shoot under basket\" and \"layup\" still only yields about a 25% success rate with layups!).  This game is difficult.  You can't just whip passes across the court or pull up with a defender near you.  It requires strategy and following the coach's playcalling.  Also, the difficulty and rules settings in the My Player mode cannot be altered.  I hate myself for loving this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2010"}

First off, a lot of reviews say the graphics are best ever seen in a video game.  Is this really true?  I'd have to say no.  Don't get me wrong, the graphics are great and pretty to look at, and the facial features (especially in the cut scenes) are superb, but it's nothing that I haven't seen in Heavy Rain.  And the backgrounds can sometimes appear jaggy (and yes, I'm viewing/playing this game on a 1080p tv via HDMI), in fact, I'd say the backgrounds are about on par with anything you see in Red Dead Redemption.  So to sum up, are the graphics great?  Yes (just take the old village up high in the Himalayas - I can just walk around and look at the scenery for hours on end).  Are they best thing you've ever seen?  No, but you shouldn't be buying/playing a game just because of its graphics (if that were the case, no one these days would be playing the original NES or Genesis games), you should be playing based on game-play and story, and that is where this game excels.Expect to run around, explore ancient ruins, solve puzzles, climb stuff, and shoot bad guys.  Basically everything you did in Uncharted 1, just in bigger and new settings.  This is both good and bad though, because as fun as it to run around and shoot bad guys, it gets really repetitive eventually...go to new area, have about 10 times as many bad guys as there are you, take cover and kill them, then move onto the next area, rinse and repeat.  It eventually just wears on you, but you keep playing because the story is great and you want to find out what happens next.  This game is sorta made/marketed like a summer blockbuster movie is....except I'd say this game actually fulfills most expectations and is way better than 99% of those \"summer blockbuster\" films end up being.I will say the puzzle solving is sorta easy, but that's not supposed to be the games strong point (I wish it were), if you want more difficult puzzles, I guess you're better off picking up a Tomb Raider game.  But I give the game some credit, because it does give you at least a few puzzles to solve along the way, and throwing that into the already great story, it makes for a great game that I recommend everyone with a PS3 pick up and play.  I can't wait for part 3!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2011"}

Night after morning after afternoon to night again, I would be lazily sitting in my room awaiting the next heroic and brave adventure of Vyse the sky-pirate (Much like the disney movie Treasure Planet). There is so much to do in this game, and so many places to explore, and one of the only RPGs that has a relitavely open-ended way of playing it. The main plot is pretty unorigional and expected, but has some great twists, and MANY smaller sub-quests to do that always motivate you on to the next level. For example, in one part (big spolier here), when trying to hunt the large killer whale of this fantasy world, with a compainon whale hunter, you get shipwreked and have to take care of Vyse on an Uncharted Island for three days, then get rescued by a woman-loving and rather whealthy sailor who tells you of a legend of ancient treasure hidden on an uncharted island. While this is all happening, your other two lady compainions, who survied in the shipwrek, were rescued by the very woman the wealthy sailor was running from. Then, being dropped off at a (Greatly themed) dessert village, find one half of the treasure map where those ancient riches are buried. Vyse, while being dropped off at the same island, finds the other half, and comicaly walks past his two shipmates alot without ever noticing them. Later on, both partys eventually meet up at the uncharted treasure island, and after solving some two-person puzzles, finnaly become reunited again!(Spoiler Over now). After going through one-in-a million of these small complicated-yet-simple, and WIDLEY varried sub-quests, you are always motivated to continue on. Its such great storytelling that makes this title one of the most unique RPG's out there. The \"ground\" battle system is nothing new, basic turn based ground fighting with actions like attack, guard, cast magic, and use item, but has a great way of getting the player not confused with all the items you have. OTher RPG's (FF series) has many-many items that comonly get piled up in the player inventory and get him/her confuesed about what to do with them, none of that here. Instead of having a single ice based, water based, ligting based weapon each, you can change a weapon or item to each one of those elementals, saving ALOT of space in the inventory and brain power. WHile this may be the only innovative feature in the fighting system, the player will usually be having to much fun with the fantastic storyline to even bother, as it has practically no downfalls to it. The ship-fighting is a wonder that will forever be remembered, While two sky ships carefully glide through the air side by side, shotting at each other with side-positioned cannons, with commmon panoramas and great other camera angles circling the action, this can be overwhelmingly the most fun part of the game, next to being told the story of course. The ships all fight loosly similar to ground fighitng people, but each crew menber can be asigned a ceratin task, like atttacking, repairing, casting magic, and then speacial attacking. Ypu also get to see some info of what the enemy ship will do next turn, so with each turn you get a chance at throwing the perfect \"combo\" at the enemy, for example, Crew Member A starts off the round by sheling, or incrasing the defense of it. Crew Member(CM) B then shoots a basic cannon at the opposing chip, CM C then does another basic attack, and CM D then casts a magically-cast cannon ball of the opposing elemental at the enemy, while CM E finished the round off with a devistating special attack. Watch as the enemy ship catches on fire and slowly sinks toward the unknown depths of the sky, not standing a chance with it's measly two CMs. The sound effects are pretty averge, but with no voice acting, except a \"whoa\" or \"hey\" at important events, unlike soome people, I am not against this. I think that the voice actors that sega did hire dont sound at all like their characters and if I had to listin to their voices through the whole game, it would of made a completly unenjoyble experiece, but, like i said before, the player will have so much fun watching the story than to bother. The music tracks, I think, are great. Remember on Zelda64, when you first sat foot on Hyrule feild, looking at it's vast, enourmous lands of posibilitys and beauty, and then there was an excellent, perfectly fitting tune to go in the backgoround. With the combination of these two attributes, you probably inerly giggled with delight and became overwhelmed with adventure at your first step upon that beautiful field. Now imagint the same thing, only in Skies of Arcadia, and instead of being in the main feild/center of the world, its everywhere. That sense of adventure, wonder of exploaration, follows you all throughout this game, never stoping at even the deppest and darkest dunguens. This overwhelming sense of adventure, and the perfectly fitting characters and storyline along with it, is what makes Skies of Arcadia so great. From slicing through the whispey clouds at middle sea (or sky,), or frommarching through a savage-roamed forest, and even when running through a poverty striken and dirty city, this sense of adventure follows you throughout the whole game, and theres not a single moment that feels bland, or boring, not a single moment. WIth this implemented so well, along with the ship batteling system, and stupendous storyline, Skies of Arcadia has easily became my favorite RPG of all time, and will probably be there for a very long time, as it easily stomped on and sliced the throat of FFX and FFVII.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2003"}

But, with the success of the new system, many people have had a very difficult time finding the games for it, and the accessories too. The Wii Remote ha worked so well at changing the way we play the games on television so well, it just is more fun to play video games on television. When the Wii came out, it came with Wii Sports, a game that flexed our muscles at how we play baseball, bowling, and tennis. Now, another game is trying to do the same thing, but does it work?Wii Play for the Nintendo Wii, feels like a spin-off to Wii Sports, as you play and conquer through several different mini-games and table sports like billiards, table tennis and table hockey. The gameplay is simple to use with the Wii remote, which also comes with the game, as a convient price. There are some highlights like the shooting range, which brings back the classic gameplay from the NES classic Duck Hunt. The graphics look nice, and the control handles very well. Still, there are a few disadvantages with the game. One of them is the lack of challenge on some of the games, with billiards you only play a 9-ball game, rather than other variations like 15 or 10-ball. Another disadvantage, is that there could've been more games to play with like shuffleboard, to add on to the excitement.Still, Wii play works great as a multiplayer game, but for single player action, it really isn't exciting. Nevertheless, you do get a great bargain for the game, because of the Wii remote, which seperately costs $40 alone. I still recommend this game for anyone who the extra remote, and for some classic parlor fun.Graphics: B+Sound: B-Control: BFun & Enjoyment: C+ for solo players; B- for multiplayer actionOverall: B-","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2007"}
