You take the role of a farmer and maintain your father's farm with the help of his best friend. At first it might be hard to start out but you'll eventually have an awesome farm. You do everything from growing and tending your crops, to getting married, buying cows,sheep,goats,horses,chickens,and ducks(I won't tell you how to get them)The best way how you'll get money will probably be from fishing. I can get about 2500 G in a day from fishing. You sell things to Van-some dude with his own shop(How does he get all this money?) and you can also buy stuff from him. As you continue through the game you'll get new equipment and buildings that will make farming somewhat easier. But i found out a secret about how you can get rich with the seed mixer and i now have about 200,000 G from doing that. I wouldn't consider this game to even have replay value since you can't beat it. If you want a game that will last you a while, this is probably one of them.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2005"}
{"product_name":"B002I08WVY","description":"","reviewerName":"Arch Stanton","summary":"Not the Best Entry in the Tales Series, But Certainly a Worthy Addition","reviewText":"This is my second Tales game and while it is a bit of a letdown from the first that isn't an insult when the first wasTales of Symphonia, which judging by reviews is probably the best in the series. The big difference between these two games is that that one had better characters and a somewhat more theatrical plot. I actually think I prefer the plot in this game, but in terms of iconicness you can't get much better than 'kids raised in a small isolated village have to make their way in the world and prevent the enemy from destroying it'. The characters though were unquestionably better in Symphonia.The main flaw in this game is Luke. Luke is a tool. A complete spoiled brat of a jerk with no real redeeming characteristics until a rather too late change-of-heart. While the game does leave him plenty of time to prove himself after his grand revelation it doesn't make up for all that happened before then. There's also the problem that I don't feel he earned the right to have that character change given the way they set it up. It seems like the lesson I'd have learned is don't be a nitwit, but instead he decides that he has to become a nice person. Which is good, but it seems more a story-driven change than a character one. He does at least have an interesting backstory and the role he fills is interesting if not ideal for him as a character. The other characters are much less annoying, though there aren't that many memorable ones. Guy is fun as his trustworthy companion with a massive phobia of women. Tear is a fairly typical combo of warrior and reserved Japanese female. She's also the main love interest. Natalia is a spoiled princess who cares. Anise is a girl with a major chip on her shoulder and who is always trying to get wealth men to marry her. She's also like twelve, so this is exactly as creepy as it sounds. None of these characters is that great, though I really like Guy, and they don't leave much of an impression. Then there's the exception. Jade is an awesomely sarcastic soldier/ex-scientist who makes every scene go better. He is the stand-out character of the game and makes even Luke bearable.Actually, the characters are the main problem with this game as everything else is near perfect. The plot is great, with special praise due to the extremely unique and unexpected incorporation of a second world. The graphics are quite good for the PS2 and just fine for the 3DS. The 3D is a bit of a problem since the characters are lacking the soft edge that you get in most games and this makes the transition to different depths look sudden and causes eye strain. It has to be said that this is a rather lazy port, but I'm ok with it. It works fine and there are no control glitches and I'm fine with having a game copied this directly if it will lead to other games getting the same treatment *cough*Skies of Arcadia*cough*. Not every game needs a graphical update. Graphicswise I rather miss the cell shading of Symphonia, but I can't fault the game for that.The gameplay is based off that of Symphonia with a few improvements here and there. Combat particularly is improved since I often found the fights in Symphonia (while fun) to be overly challenging. While there are some difficult fights there are none that I was incapable of winning. Like other games in the Tales series they have character moments that you access by hitting the start button. These are just skits but they provide most of the entertaining character moments and help draw you into the game. Jade features quite prominently in these which is always a good thing. And in the end the story is so epic that even if it was just a rails shooter I'd still be enjoying it.Yes, I enjoyed this game a great deal despite the characters.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2013"}

I thoroughly enjoyed each and every one of them. HSG: WI does not do anything new, which was slightly surprising and disappointing, but it continues the high standards and traditions of HSG franchise nicely. You can consider this game a mini-PS3 version as the characters are properly-proportioned (instead of having huge heads like Open Tee 1 & 2 on PSP). Gameplay does not deviate at all, although you do get minor changes such as the ability to choose your swing type; you can decide whether to use the swing meter or the circle-swing mechanic (as in the PS3 version \"Out of Bounds\"). There are 2 other new swing types which I have not unlocked yet so I'm not sure how well they work.Overall, the gameplay is as solid as ever, the visuals are sharp and crisp, and at the end of the day, this remains one of the best franchises I have ever played, and definitely a must-have for the PS Vita!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2012"}

Keep in mind that with certain promotions going on at Gamestop, I only paid $8 for this collection.

No multiplayer gameplay, but in inFamous 2, you can create and share missions.Cole McGrath makes such a great protagonist, and the relationship between him and his best friend, Zeke, throughout both games are always fun and quite interesting to witness.

{"product_name":"B000O5FUKQ","description":"Prepare to experience an evolution in the first person shooter. Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"Typical FPS frustrations in an almost great game","reviewText":"Let me start by saying that this is the most satisfying Turok game I've ever played. It's also a solid first person shooter. The problems I generally have with FPS games are here. Certain control functions don't always work properly and it's sometimes hard to know what's attacking you and from where. I liked the way the gameplay is a constant mix of dinosaurs and gun-toting hybrids. And I would certainly play through it again. So, it doesn't add up to a perfect game. But it's still an experience to be had. There are gamers that proclaim a game is trash the first time the slightest thing doesn't go their way. Unless you're one of those, you'll likely enjoy this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2010"}

From the targeting reticule like Twilight Princess to operating in Trauma Center, the Wii-mote is used in a different kind of way as well in Super Monkey Ball. However, either this was rushed or bad design, but this is one of those Wii titles that you want to try out since it was a launch title but you're disappointed in how off it feels. Which is too bad because buried under here is a solid game but this is just...I don't know, bad?Story: Heh heh, yeah right. Basically you're a monkey in a ball and have to get around mazes in the sky to get bananas before reaching the goal. Like the old Sonic the Hedgehog or Super Mario games which were basically beat a bunch of levels to get to the end, there's nothing ultimately that deep here. It's strictly gameplay.Graphics: The Gamecube could've handled this game probably. A lot of Wii games look like more cleaner versions of a Gamecube title. But luckily SMB has a warm, inviting feel to its graphics which makes it kid-friendly and helps with the overall feel of the game which is basically have fun.Sound/Music: To be honest, this is a stereo game. Meaning you mute the game and just turn something on in your stereo. It's not that the music is bad, it's just the music almost seems secondary to the experience whereas in some games the music enhances it.Gameplay: This is where it falls completely flat on its face. Essentially, to control your monkey you lean the Wii-mote forward to speed him up and tilt it side to side to turn. Ever play that game Labyrinth with the marble? Same idea except you're the marble.. Problem is the monkey is so hyper-sensitive that he either turns too fast or he's unbelievably sluggish. Jumps done by the A button are hard to time since you have to hold the controller steady lest you fall off. At one point I literally couldn't get past one stage because he kept falling off. Some games such as the recent TMNT have decent controls which you put up with the whole game. This on the other hand is just needlessly frustrating.Should you get this? Well, sometimes I recommend a game despite its flaws (Trauma Center for all its strengths, is unbelievably challenging). This, I wouldn't.

Don't get confused this game is based of the movies (a lot of battles have cutscenes from the actual movies in it), but it also has things from Silmarillion and other Tolkien works in it (such as the lands in the east).The Story:- It follows the storyline from the movies. It pretty much blasts through the whole Fellowship of the Ring battles (there weren't that much to begin with), but the cool thing is that it will let you play the battles that aren't shown in the movies such as Eremor's battle against Uruk Khai in West Rohan.Pros:- It's actually pretty difficult to beat the entire game.- The game has a nice upgrade system for your Powers and your main Hero's leveling up grant's them new powers/passive abilities... Pretty much making this game a RTS-RPG.- Also your soldiers also can  level up and the level transfers with them to the next level should the unit survive.- The voice acting is from the actual cast of LOTR.Cons:- Multiplayer/Live server's have been shut done since 2010.I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes LOTR or RTS games.Don't buy this game if you want action/fighting.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2014"}
{"product_name":"B001HWB68K","reviewerName":"Scott Peterson \"I.T. Sme\"","summary":"Very good, kind of an expansion pack that became a game","reviewText":"This is the first \"Halo\" game I've played since the original, and also the first game I played through period on an Xbox 360.  In many ways it's a repeat of some of the same things; the original aliens are there and most of the same weapons.  However, you play several different soldiers, and the action is entirely on Earth.Visually it's a beautiful game, the only let down was the appearance of the characters in close up.  Most of it takes place at night, and if you use night vision this interesting effect appears where everything is outlined and friends are green and enemies are red.  The story is really in the background, and most of the big questions are left unanswered with a setup for a sequel.I liked that there was more of a team/buddy atmosphere than a single lone super soldier, but didn't care for the level designs.  I don't know how Halo 2/3 played out but this one repeated going through a lot of identical looking landscapes, in this case urban terrain.  You have a decent variety of weapons for tactics, but most of the fighting was more comic book style than the serious scary of something like Call of Duty. The only vehicles I found you could operate were the tank and the jeep (I can't remember it's official name), and the general \"feel\" of the game is it's either a very long expansion pack or a prelude to more games involving the orbital troopers.Despite this, it still delivers the important goods, running around and shooting endless alien bad guys, and that's why people play it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2010"}

While many things have been given an overhaul (the battle system and the character development being the most major), it still feels like good ol' Xenogears.  For the new player, there's enough for it to stand on its own just fine, but for a Xeno fan, it's fun spotting all the things that come into play later.The gameplay is almost perfect, the only downside being the steep learning curve.  It took me some time to figure out how to effectively distribute my tech points, use the boost system, etc., and the A.G.W.S. things I still never got the hang of.  They were far too expensive to keep up and nowhere near as useful as Gears.The characters and the story are all well-developed and rivetting.  Each character has his or her own demons which they must deal with, and I think that each character is very sympathetic.Overall, this is a must for any RPG fan and a good edition to the Xeno series.

Maillard \"Digital Enthusiast\"","summary":"&quot;Paradise Gone Wrong...&quot; -- Everything Else is Right","reviewText":"Where to start, where to start? Well, first let me tell you that I am a huge FPS (first-person shooter) fan, whether it's mindless fragfests like Serious Sam or stealth-oriented action like Deus Ex or the Thief series. I've been waiting for the &quot;next big thing&quot; in FPS for quite some time, namely Half-Life 2, but I think the next big thing has arrived sooner than expected, and its name is Far Cry.Let me get this out of the way before I go on: Unless your PC is is a stud monster with preferably 2.5 - 3.0 GHz processing speed, lots of RAM (1,000+), and a gaudy video card (Radeon 9800), you won't get the full effect from this game. Still, even on a mid-range system with graphics toned down to medium, you will be absolutely blown away. I know I was, and still am.Using the supercool Crytek engine, Ubisoft has created a game that features sensational graphics, terrific AI, decent plot, and unusual locales, namely the Caribbean. Where this game stands out is its graphics engine, which lets you see for miles and offers an unparalleled setting ever seen in a computer game. But be warned: don't expect to just walk into huts on the sand and start blasting away at mercenaries. These guys are good, calling for cover and flanking you every chance they get. You'll have to think about how you're going to approach each mission, and even then, you'll be required to make quick adjustments, thanks to the assault jeep that just showed up right behind you or the gunship that is raining missles from the sky. No two missions are alike, as the AI learns as they go, adjusting to your moves and reacting accordingly. Terrific stuff.The voices are a little over-the-top, which absolutely fits this very over-the-top game. The standard &quot;mad scientist creates some monsters from human DNA&quot; plot is a bit trite, but the presentation of the entire game makes up for it, with engaging cut scenes and terrific direction to your next objective. Overall, though, sounds lend a distinct feel to the game, as the birds chirp when you're outside on the island and waves lap against the shore, or your pinned underneath a palm tree with a chopper armed to the teeth sending death from above, the whup-whup-whup filling your ears as the world goes black.Real-world weapons are at your disposal four at a time, and they do the job very nicely. Crouching and arming yourself with an MP90 in the islands has never been so much fun. And you can drive many, if not all, of the vehicles in the game, including jeeps, assault trucks, gunboats, and even hangliders, which is a nice change of pace from the usual duck-cover-shoot tasks involved with each mission.Each mission is very well defined, but by no means is this game linear. You can get to the endpoint any way you want. If you want to take the whole guerilla army on headfirst, go right ahead. If  you want to sneak around and shoot them from underneath the huts, you can do that too. Ubisoft has put the entire game in your hands, and it makes for some truly exciting, innovative gameplay. Some people will have a problem with the difficulty level and overall problems with getting it running at decent speed on a minimally equipped system, but look past this. Also, the auto-save system is a little annoying (no quick saves), forcing you to go through the same mission until you get it right and it reaches the next auto-save point.Not since Half Life has a game been so immersive, so unique, and so rewarding in its gameplay. Far Cry presents PC gamers with a tough challenge that shouldn't be missed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2004"}

{"product_name":"B0016BVYA2","reviewerName":"D. Ferrari","summary":"That old familiar feeling...","reviewText":"I can't really think of much to say about Bioshock 2.  I can't say I was disappointed by it or anything.  It was just essentially Bioshock with a slight tweak.  Playing as a big daddy wasn't nearly as revolutionary as I had anticipated.  Wielding plasmids and weapons at the same time was nice, but by no means a MAJOR game changer.  Also, the Big Sisters were somewhat of a let-down in that all the previews and trailers made it seem like there was ONE Big Sister and that was going to be the big boss battle at the end.  It is too good to be 3 stars, but not good enough to be 5.It may seem all negative, but this is a really good game.  SOLID 4 stars.  It is just the fact that if you've played the first Bioshock you've pretty much played this one too.  The good thing is if you liked the original you'll certainly like this one.  Be prepared to go through a lot of ammo.  Enemies are plentiful and tough.  There is one other tweak I liked.  You spend time hunting down 2 people and when faced with them you actually have the option to kill them or let them live.  I let the first one live, but what the second one had done was unforgivable and he had to die.  The first individual assisted me throughout the remainder of the level.I do need to give it a replay and \"harvest\" rather than rescue the little sisters.Overall I'd say it is worth playing through the story, but if you are looking for a completely new bioshock experience you'll be slightly disappointed but not enough to dislike the game.pros+ Graphics are the same as the original+ Gameplay is the same as original+ Moral decisions are still difficult at times and not limited to Little Sisters+ Excellent variety of weapons.+ I like the new hacking much better than before+ Although I don't play multiplayer on this I'll list it as a pro.Cons- See the first two pros.  Little if any innovation- There is no \"would you kindly\" twist in this one.All in all Bioshock 2 is running on the same engine as the original and it was pretty well maxed out then so really expecting revolutionary changes isn't fair in this case.  It is a solid game and if you liked the original definitely worth playing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0007PIEB0","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Great, creative game","reviewText":"*NOTE: I have the Xbox version of this game but wanted to take the time to help people decide if they want to purchase this game or not.  From what I've read, they managed to keep the game about equal to the Xbox version so my review should be pretty accurate.  The only differences will be that the Xbox has 5.1 surround in game not just cutscenes and the graphics will probably be a bit better.  If you own an Xbox I would recommend that version over the PS2 but honestly the game is great, and if you own a PS2 I would doubly recommend picking this up.  On to my review:Everytime Tim Schafer creates a game, I know it will be a blast. Having been on a roll starting with The Day of the Tentacle up through The Grim Fandango, each game has been delightfully intelligent, creative and an overall wonderful experience. Psychonauts is no different. In fact, it is one of the best games I have played not only this year but in a long time.The setup is that there is a camp for psychic children who feel different in the outside world. At the camp, the counselors teach children how to harness their power to become Psychonauts, psychics who actually enter people's minds and sort out their problems. Because of this setup, each and every world is completely different from the others. Connected to a hub world of the camp, each real \"level\" is a person's mind. And each mind reflects the person's personality, fears, phobias etc. For instance, the beginning level is that of your drill instructor. His level is a warzone complete with mines, air plane drops, explosions, barbed wire etc.Tim Schafer's touch is also evident in the characters who are actually characters. They all have a personality and are very emotive. I haven't laughed at a video game so hard since Conker's Bad Fur Day. This game is hillarious. From the kid who practices looking through a peep hole in the day to get practice for when it's filled with girls to trashing a town Godzilla style, the game has it in spades. However, there are some surprisingly disturbing moments in the game that are also darkly humorous. Because you have psychic powers, you also can do some pretty cool stuff from pyrokinesis, telekinesis, levitation, invisibility, etc. These moves help you progress through the levels and pick up hidden items throughout the game.Graphically, the game is awesome on the Xbox. The levels are done in vivid colors and with a wonderful cartoon style. The campground seems alive as there are creatures walking your path. From squirrels, crows, pigeons, lizards, bears, etc, the world seems populated and just feels real. You can tell a lot of time and effort was put in to make this game come alive and it works. The game is presented in 480p, for those interested.Aurally, the characters are voiced to perfection. Some great voice actors have been employed and it really helps create characters that are lovable. The biggest audio glitch I've noticed is that sometimes my speakers will \"click\" as voices come in or as the sound changes sometimes. For some reason, the sound gets funkier as the game progresses. By the last level, it was as if every time a new sound was introduced or the sound changed, the game would stutter. Definitely some bugs that could have been worked out before the game was released. But, honestly, these aren't game stopping problems and are only vaguely annoying considering how awesome the game is. The game is also presented in 5.1 surround in game.Since the game is a platformer, all of the standards apply. In the real world and in each person's mind, there are a ton of things to collect. In the real world, there are arrowheads that can be pulled from the ground that represent cash. There is a scavenger hunt also going on that will earn you rank (which gives you new powers) and there are cards that can be formed as more rank. In each person's mind, there are also different things to collect such as emotional baggage, mental cobwebs, figments of the imagination and safes which you much punch open to reveal some of the person's past. Some of these slide shows are funny and some are actually kind of sad as you see how these people came to be who they are. I list these items to collect just as a note that the game definitely exhibits all of the charms of a platformer. But there actually is a reason to collecting everything and they fit together in this humorous world.The game moves quickly and besides one or two intstances of panning that had the game do a wave type pattern, it is perfect. My recommendation if you play the game is to take your time talking to everyone. It helps flesh out the story and if you listen and keep making rounds after each world you will see minor breakups, makeups, humorous instances involving squirrels who tell one kid to kill everyone, and plain funny dialogue. Take your time with this one and you will definitely be rewarded.This game is great, it's just what I was looking for. It helped remind me why I play video games. When a person can create such wonderful worlds and allow you to play in them, you realize why you play games. It is so creative. Where else can you be chased by a giant fish, rage across town as a Godzilla-like creature, be in a disco world where you must race, pin-ball style, wage war against a Napolean complex and set fire to squirrels? If you want a creative and fun video game that will take approximately 10-15 hours of your time, then this is definitely a must buy. I absolutely cannot recommend this game enough. And unfortunately, it's one of those games that will end up like Ico or Beyond Good and Evil where no one hears of it and no one plays it. Don't let that happen. Play this game because its games like this that the industry needs to keep creating.A must buy. Creative and excellent.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2005"}
{"product_name":"B002I0GEXM","description":"","reviewerName":"Charles \"Altered Confusion\"","summary":"Disney Epic Mickey Review","reviewText":"Epic Mickey, from the man who brought you so much, Warren Spector, is a game in which you will be playing the role of Mickey Mouse as you try to save a world ravaged by evil with the help of a magic brush that can either shoot out paint or thinner. You will have to piece back what once was, and find away to return home.Graphically this game looks good for a Wii game, I really wish it was a PC game so that I can ramp up the graphics just a touch more, but this is a very well done, from a graphics standpoint, game. You will get to run through side scrolling worlds of old Mickey Mouse cartoons. You'll also get to interact in 3D worlds that feel like they belong in or have been a part of Mickey Mouse cartoons. You'll also get to see very recognizable characters, from the black and white days, all the way to the present.I don't think its really necessary for me to delve to deep into the music of this game, its a Mickey Mouse game, there's different levels from different Mickey Mouse cartoons, so lets say that there's plenty of music that was used in those cartoons present in your adventures.The controls is where the wheels start to fall off for the game. You're going to have control of the camera, which in retrospect probably leaves more room for error than it could have. You'll find that the depth of field is never quite right, and you'll also find that while trying to center the camera you're never going to be able to get it just right to be in the correct position to cause you less aggravation. The sad thing is that the worst part of the controls is probably the most vital piece of the game, aiming to shoot out the paint and thinner. The reason I say this is because of the fact that the camera position is going to make the reticle on the screen false. You're going to have a lot of trial and error trying to paint certain areas because where you're aiming isn't going to be close to where the paint/thinner is going to fly.So you have this wonderful concept of a game that is meant for all ages. There's not really any violence to speak of in the game. You'll have enemies that you'll have to fight but you attack them with thinner to make them melt, or you attack them with paint for them to just turn friendly. You'll have to deal with bosses along the way that you'll have to decide to either fight with thinner or paint, which ever you choose will dictate what you'll have more of when you're at max. Thankfully the reticle issue that plagues you during trying to traverse the levels doesn't come into effect during the boss battles.You're going to get to meet Oswald the Bunny, and a ton of old school characters, as well as robotic versions of your friends, that were created to keep Oswald company. Sadly those versions of your friends have basically been reduced to talking heads, and you'll have to help put them back together. You'll also find that you're going to be going on a lot of quests that will take you back in forth between areas, and to be honest this was the nail in the coffin that almost made this game unbearable. Here's the deal you get a quest from a character to go to another area, well you're going to have to go through a load screen, then you'll have to do the side scrolling action through a clip of an old Mickey Mouse cartoon, you'll get a load screen, then you'll do whatever you need to do there, then you'll want to return, which will be a load screen, that side scrolling clip this time you'll have to go backwards, and then a load screen. Now there's a very good possibility that you're about to get another quest to go back to the same area, well guess what, you'll get to do that all again. The break in the action and the constant hassle of having to re-traverse the same level over and over again is going to leave you wonder what the game could have been if they didn't try to leave it with so much filler. As a result you're going to want to see the storyline pick up, but its going to drag, and you're going to be left feeling like you'll have to drag yourself through the finish line.This was a game that I couldn't wait to get my hands on, I got to see Warren Spector do his keynote at PAX, I was excited, and I got to take a peek at the demo at PAX, but after playing the game, as much as it pains me, I think that I can't give this game higher than a 4.7 out of 10.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00000I1BR","description":"Let me go on record and say that I was never a fan of the original Crash Bandicoot. Even though Crash was disarmingly cute and fuzzy, and even though the game's graphics were just about as good as they got in those days, the frustrating design of the game made playing it such a painful experience that I still have flashbacks when I see small marsupials on the Discovery Channel. But just one short year after his debut, Crash is back in a sequel that is so far superior to the original that I'm willing to forget the mistakes of the past.The new storyline is simple: A very gullible Crash is corralled into collecting crystals for the evil Dr. Cortex and gems for the terrible N. Brio. There are 25 levels in all; each level contains an easy-to-find crystal and hard-to-earn gems. Instead of being forced to approach the game in a strictly linear fashion, you progress through a series of five warp rooms. Each warp room contains five levels, which you are free to tackle in any order. After you have found the crystals in each level, you can progress to the next warp room. This system of warp rooms is a great innovation; it's clear how to progress in the game, and yet you have the option of moving to a different level if you're hopelessly frustrated with one area. Best of all, you can save your game in the warp room at any time (a big improvement over the original game's horrific save system).A lot of variety is packed inside this game. You'll navigate through simple run-and-jump areas, try to outrun a very mad polar bear, work your way through sewer systems, and even fly around with a jet pack. Within each level, the basic gameplay is similar to the original Crash: Running, jumping, and spinning are still the order of the day. Even though most levels are set in a semi-3D environment, Crash Bandicoot 2 is a platform game, plain and simple. The graphics are in a league of their own among PlayStation games, and the music couldn't be better. Unlike the original, Crash 2 is rarely frustrating enough to make you want to throw your controller at the TV. In fact, some expert gamers might find Crash to be a little on the easy side.There are only two real problems with Crash Bandicoot 2. First, the semi-3D setup is sometimes hard to navigate, and you'll find yourself missing jumps because you're unable to judge distances properly. Secondly, the game is just plain cheap at times; in some areas you must sacrifice many lives until you memorize a level's layout.In any event, these problems are balanced out by the game's excellent gameplay and intelligent design. Crash Bandicoot 2 is a topnotch platform game. If you're a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to check this title out. -- John Broady--Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Go through many well known Marvel Universe locations and cameos from favorite characters as you hack, slash shoot and say spunky one liners in his effort to bring out the greatest game in history and maybe he might even land the hot girl.Honestly I was very surprised about this.  While not expecting an epic game like Skyrim, Last of Us or Fire Emblem , this game plays a bit like god of war in the over the top killing and destruction and actually pretty good length in game time.  While the game is simple, they really brought Wade to life with his fourth wall antics and letting his two other personalities shine.  Enjoyable moments like slapping Wolverine silly and grabbing Cable's chest are funny and over the top.  Now this is a m game as Wade also does not have the most \"pure\" of mouths and minds, not to mention when he dies the damage can get a bit graphic.

{"product_name":"B000IMYKQ0","description":"The Wii Nunchuk controller is a secondary controller that adds even more innovation to the next generation of gaming, and does it all with less physical movement.Used in conjunction with the standard Wii remote, certain games need the Nunchuk controller for additional control options. Contoured perfectly to fit a player's hand,The Wii Nunchuk (left) connects directly to the Wii remote.View larger.the Nunchuk controller builds on the simplicity of the Wii Remote controller. The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance. Just be careful not to knock out your significant other, or bruise the dog, severely, while using one, or two Nunchuk controllers.","reviewerName":"Sally","summary":"A great product","reviewText":"I got tired of the original \"white\" nunchuck, so while getting my newest black wii remote I also decided to purchase a new black nunchuck to go with it. The two items together look great!! Much better than having plain old white like I used to have.Also, there are cheaper nunchucks on here that are knock offs (in other words, Nintendo did not make them. A third party did). After my experience with knock offs I recommend you ALWAYS buy Nintendo brand products. Even though it may appear to be exactly as the original, save your money and always buy the original if you want your product to function the way it should and last a few years, rather than a few hours. I purchased mine \"used\" and it works as if it were brand new. This goes to show that when Nintendo themselves makes a product, you can guarantee it will last a long time. I myself would purchase a used Nintendo product, over a new third party knock off any day because I have had my experience once with that already. I learned from that mistake.Overall, if you are looking for a black nunchuck, then purchase this one!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2010"}

The gameplay and level designis inconsistent, and I agree with a Gamespot review that stated more effort was given to producing the earlier parts of thegame.  I'll ignore the latter portions of the game, and say that the graphics in environments that were actually craftedlook good.  The framerate's pretty smooth.  There's a short action cutscene towards the end that makes you wonder who wastaking a nap during the middle parts of the game.  You can't skip any cut scenes, which drives me crazy.  The combatcan be difficult if you don't know what you're doing, but once you figure things out, killing and absolving enemies isa breeze.  There's a cool mini game, in which you gain Holy xp.  There's only one particular demon that I still findchallenging, and when you have to fight two of them at a time, it takes forever.  Along with your demonic scythe,you have magic and Holy attacks at your disposal.  Always upgrade your equipment right before you manually save, so yourchanges are actually saved.  The final boss fight is a real kick in the pants, and is bemusing because the more damageyou deal, the harder the fight gets, common in other games, but taken to the extreme in this one.  There are someenvironmental puzzles in Dante's Inferno, which you may find agitating or rewarding.  I was going to play through the game3 times, but when I got to a puzzle where you have to kick a box onto a platform, I couldn't do it.  I had already done ittwice before, but I just couldn't do it again.  what a crazy game!  You have to know what's coming sometimes (like what buttonto press) in order to progress; your reflex may not be enough.  The color scheme during real-time events is horrible, asyou can barely see which button to press.  I absolutely Do Not Encourage people to play Dante's Inferno.

{"product_name":"B0001KUE7S","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. If your PC has the juice to set this game loose and you have a thirst for first-person shooter action, you're in for a treat. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have.Hell on MarsYour character is a low-ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the Mars Research Facility of the United Aerospace Corporation (UAC). That's pretty much all the backstory you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the storyline department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of the Doom franchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?), it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well-crafted sound effects succeeded at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth... ethereal Revenants fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy... a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll often find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might easily be solved by duct-taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.Looking GoodDoom 3looks incredible. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. The eye candy does come at a price, though, and we were forced to play at fairly low resolution even on a Pentium IV 2.8 GHz and an ATI Radeon 9500. Even so, gameplay was smooth as silk. For higher resolutions (1024 x 768 and above) the latest generation of ATI or Nvidia cards is suggested.--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessRich variety of enemiesPlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineStiff system requirementsNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multiplayer options","reviewerName":"W. Newberry \"agent_47\"","summary":"The Most successful FPS returns & is better than ever.","reviewText":"I gotta admit when I first put this game in I was not as impressed but the more I played it the better it got .When I first played it I was rushing through the levels with flashlite and shooting everything but not realy looking to much but I gotta say now that Ive played it twice I truly am impressed with this game.There is alot of detail if you look for it. Doom3 is an EXCELLENT FPS Game,with great graphics, and the smooth FPS gameplay.The demons are nicely detailed ,the flying screeming heads look realy kool and all the enemies have a fierceness look to them with glowing red eyes ,very kool stuff.The sound is good especialy the whispers ,it sounds good on my stereo, but some of the guns sound a little weak ,but the ambient sound effects are realy well done the whole game has got a real creepiness to it.The footsteps you can even tell what direction they are coming from .Your first set of demons are  possesed slow walking human zombies but that soon changes as the new varied demon creatures will lunge strait at you and they are tougher on the Veteran difficulty.You charachter has a PDA  in Doom3, you can download info,email,voice messages,and video clips from certain terminals which all can been read and seen,also you can down load other peoples lost PDA'S and look at there info stored.It helps you find codes for lockers and doors with either ammo,weapons,health,or level advancement.There's plenty of ammo hidden in all areas of the game ,I never found myself too short of ammo.Its there you just go look in every dark area ,corner, nook and crannie. The more ammo you find the more enemies will spawn in .I noticed that if I didnt pick up certain ammo ,or explore certain areas no enemies would spawn in , the more you explore,and the more ammo you find,the more enemies will spawn in. Like for example the plasma storage room with the door code ,if I didnt go in, not as many enemies would spawn but if I found the PDA & used the code on the door ,tons of enemies spawned in.The bottom line is explore everywhere for a tougher game experience,the more ammo you find the more enemies you'll fight.My fav weapon was the shotgun it kills most demons in 1-3 shots,but of course its useless for long range.The plasma gun or the chain gun takes care of the charging big-bull type demon pretty fast.All the weapons work quite well,except for the handgun which should be used only on slow human zombies. Save your shotgun ammo for the demons who charge you & you should always have it handy.Conserve your big weapon ammo for the tougher guys.There's the  blood & gore type effets in Doom3 that made doom series a stand out fps and the chainsaw is once again back for gory kills.The lighting is well done with dark hallways and enemies popping out from them and all the trippy looking demonic type writing on the walls looks wild.And I love the way the demons spawn in ,very kool. I find myself jumping (flinching)alot because the sound effects(on my stereo) & the enemies pop at you from out of know where .I like the dream type sequences ,it adds  to the tension.This game does a good job of making you feel tense.You cant use your flashlight and your gun at the same time,(what? no friggen duck tape??)which at first is a  little annoying but after awhile it does make the game more  intense  which adds to the effect of the game ,and after awhile you will get so good at switching from gun to flashlite it'll become second nature and besides its a simple one-button switch.white button on default.The first 29 sections your on a station on MARS and  its not all just strait forward (linear),many times you'll backtrack to a previously unopenable door for level advancement.Mostly you'll find a door that needs a special key or a code on another persons PDA,you'll then need to find that PDA for the door code.Not to mention you will be fighting plenty of demons along the way.After you leave the Mars Level  about 3/4 in the game  you get to HELL level its Friggen Intense ! The look of the game comepletly takes a change for the better ,Imagine the whole game with this look ,maybe Doom4 will go that route ,hopefully so.Wait till you get to the HELL level you'll agree its awesome looking,this is what I imagined Doom3 to be.Its really intense you loose your flashlight & all weapons but luckly you will re-stock back up.Also the levels look even better once you leave HELL and go to the caverns levels.Its pretty trippy looking.There's 4  difficulty settings ,RECRUIT,MARINE,VETERAN,& NIGHTMARE MODE. Nightmare mode is only opened up after beating the game and you start the game with the Soul Cube ,you can equip it as soon as you get your first weapon,also your health on nightmare mode slowly drains even if you dont get hurt,but will stop draining at 25.I played the game on Marine mode and beat the game in 3 days,now im on Veteran difficulty.I truly like the game better the second time around ,Im noticing alot more little details.There is a secret Room on the last level just before you fight the last Boss.Its in the cavern level with all the candles in the hallway.You push Id logo on the wall and a secret room opens up and you'll find a PDA from the Id game developers with all the programmers Thank You Notes.  Doom3 is a Fun Solid Tension filled FPS Game  with  decent replay value and Online capability.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2005"}

You can't do events unless the clock is exactly at the right time.  For a supposedly non-linear RPG, I found this frustrating and extremely linear.  Plus there is not an easy teleportation/movement system.  If you are in one part of town, it may take you 5-10 minutes just to 'walk' to another part of town.Second is the combat system.  It is incredibly easy to 'master' each weapon just by repeatedly spamming it in random encounters.  I wasn't challenged by the ultra-easy combat at all, to such a point where I didn't even need the hundreds of in-game 'friends' to help me fight.  So recruiting people for me was both tedious and pointless, especially because there is no 'fast forward' for long spoken voice acting dialogue.Finally, the graphics seemed blocky (though the music was fine). Compared to the beautiful and smooth faces of Final Fantasy X, this title by the same company had inferior figure animation. Felt like bad claymation.  I know Square can do better, but they didn't.If like me, you are over 25, don't buy the game.  The story is too kiddie orientated, and the game play is tedious when it is not amazingly easy.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2006"}

If you communicate frequently with your 360 via with private messages, MSN, and/or voice, then it's an essential add-on.The keyboard (a.k.a. \"chatpad\") snaps into place at the bottom of any 360 controller between the two palm grips.  It adds significant weight to the controller but doesn't otherwise impede playability.  I actually prefer the additional heft that it provides - the 360 controller feels a little insubstantial without it, in my opinion - so I leave it connected continuously.  It's very easy to put on/take off if you'd prefer to do so.The keys themselves have tight feedback that feels great, but it's far from 100% responsive - expect some dropped characters along the way.  But since we're not typing our graduate thesis on the thing, no big deal, right?  Also, all of the keys light up momentarily when you initially press one, so it maintains functionality even in the dark.  There are several pre-programmed hotkeys (e.g. launch MSN) and a full-bodied roster of symbols as well.The headset seems like a toss-in since most Xbox bundles already come with a comparable-quality model.  However, since the chatpad covers the controller's native headset port, this model is included because its plug matches a pass-through port on the chatpad.  It's a decent headset, but if you're this serious about communicating on the 360, you may just want to think about upgrading to the wireless earpiece.With the recent release of the New Xbox Experience for online interaction, Microsoft seems serious about making its console the social/entertainment hub of your life.  The Messaging Kit completes that aim by enabling text and voice communication in a well-made, affordable package.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2008"}

They don't call me \"hater\" or whatever nonsense because I don't rate games I don't think deserve 5 stars for nothing :D. Yakuza Is a highly overrated series kinda like GTA, but too the Japanese and some Weeaboo's, I mean Western fans, lol! With all that aside, here my short review.The story is now split into 4 characters. 1. money launderer, 2. cop, 3. escape prisoner, and the 4. is hero we all know from the Yakuza series. The story each one is really hard too follow this time around. It maybe because there 4 characters, or that the story REALLY drags on this time, but it's really hard to follow this time around. So I recommend you devote all of your attention too every long CS, because you'll become lost within the story really quickly if you don't. The Eng subs still works wonders in this game though, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Eng dub can, and 91% of the time be terrible, so no problems there. The game mechanics play just like a JRPG. You get into random battles, do amazing moves, level up skills, rinse and repeat.Now the main problem I have with this game is (drum roll) everything is DATED! No improvements too graphics, gameplay, and after a while, the game gets pretty repetitive. I love the min games, I love the combat, which needs a big improvement, but all of it could of been improve. Sega might as well place a Yakuza X3 sticker on this, because that what it is. Overall I was disappointed with this. They could of improve a lot more, but when a game is over hype, and overrated, you 9-10 can get away with this, but not for me. This game gets a fair in my book.

Weidman \"beawei\"","summary":"MGS3 DEMO Review/Preview","reviewText":"As can be seen in the subject above, this review is a critique of the Demo of the game. Therefore, keep in mind that the reviewer has not played through the entire game yet. Just the first prolougue level. Also know that the demo probably contains some glitches and imperfections that will probably be fixed in the full version. Now, with that said, on to the review!First, I should say that MGS2 fans will immeditatly become dissapoited with the first few playable seconds of the game. The quick, snappy constant-60fps action of the old game is now gone, and moving Snake around the first level is a much slower, chuggy experience. Aiming is slower but not neccesarily as precise, cycling through the inventory dosnt feel quite as quick and easy as last time, The first cutscene can't compare to the cinematic brilliance of the first cutscne in MGS2, and the loading times in-between cutscenes is quite a hassle as well. Not to mention that is takes over 30 seconds to bring up the screen for the Codec as well. The screen resolution has also been lowered significantly, making aiming and combat more straining on your eye. Cycling between crouch, crawl, and standing postions has still been left as the confusing and time-consuming procces that it was in the previous game.However, once those first impressions wear off, the game suddenly flutters it's wings and unfolds to become a beautiful masterpeice. While I won't give away any story elements (as if any of those can be gained from the demo), Soviet-occupied Pakistan looks absolutly brilliant: you can see all sorts of leaf-shaped shadows get thrown across Snake; beams of soft, pretty sunlight shoots through the thick canopy of trees on top of you; the tall blades of grass quickly and beautifully get knocked off to the side when frogs, snakes, or even bullets travel through them. Beehives hanging off of trees can be shot to quickly and easily dispatch of near guards; Apples, mushrooms, rats, frogs, and yes, snakes, can all be eaten and are easily found crawling everywhere in the jungle. Overall, the detail and effort put is wonderful, and you can easily tell that the developers put mountains of time into crafting just this single demo level. The enviroments to be found in the full game should truly be fantastic and I absolutly can't wait to see them. On another side of the graphical area, some individual guards look really pitiful, and the first-person gun models are absolutly HORRID! The first-person models specifically for the rifle-weapons look incredibly blocky, are poorly textures, and have strange firing animations.As for gameplay, there is an absolute bevy of fun to be found here. There are several available weapons, and each one functions completly differently and is obviously made to be used in a different situation. As was stated, the first-person models for the rifle weapons are very fugly, but when fired, they all sound incredibly realistic and look fantastic when fliyng through tall grass. One definate change in gameplay is that survival is now a vital aspect to keep in mind. Snake is givin no food or water at the beginning of the mission, and is instructed to find it himself. If he gets hungry, his aim will be shaky, he wont be able to grip onto branches as good, and his life will go down faster, and re-generate slower. If worst comes to worst, Snake can eventually die from starving to death. Hunting the food is rather easy and quick, all you do is scan the area with your thermal gogless for nice, red life and shoot it. Once the poor creature dies and starts turning into a black spinning hovering box that says \"YOUR FOOD\" on it, you just run into it and it gets inserted into Snake's inventory. In fact, the process is so easy and quick, that it becomes an almost forgettable task, and this is where the challenge of it comes from. Several times, when I wandered into an intense firefight, I said \"Damn. Why did my aim get so bad suddenly.\", and then took a look at the stamina bar and realized how fraggin' hungry my charachter was! Eventually, you'll have \"Hunt for food\" as a rudementary task to do when guards arnt looking in your direction. Edible creatures and plants seemed to be all over the place in the demo level, so hunting for food in the full game should come as no trouble. One thing that did bother me though, was that snakes, rats, and frogs wouldnt ever try to bite me. If I'm crawling directly on top of some dangerous jungle python in real life, I'd expect it to bite me. Oddly enough, even though they're about to get eaten, snakes (the long, slithery creatures) love Snake (the american super-spy), and would never ever want to bite him.As for the stealthy sneaking and intense, loud firefights this series is known for, MGS3 delivers. You still look down at Snake from an overhead 3D view that can easily turn to the left or right with a turn of the L-stick. Press R-1 and it seamlessly swoops down to Snake's first-person view, usefull for getting a closer look at guards, or just to cap their heads off easier. Snake is now given an assortment of 7 camaflaugue uniforms that can be easily changed in just a few milliseconds. Each one is usefull for being worn in a specific variety of terrain, such as tall grass, thick, brown soil, or even when you're pressed up against brick walls. You're also givin a handy meter that tells you how effective your current camaflaugue is depending on where you're standing and what position your in. If this meter is up to say, 95%, guards can't see you hiding in the grass unless they're actually walking on you. Of course, that can change depending on what stage alert they're on. As in previous MGS games, guards in MGS3 go through several alert stages if your found. Once a guard sees you and an exclamation point suddenly flashes over their head, you've got 90 seconds to get out of their sight before they quit looking for you. Once thats done, you've got 90 more seconds to avoid a more slower, leisurely chase. After this, the guards go in another stage of 90 more seconds where they pitifully and slowly try to find you, an event that can be easily avoided in this last stage of alertness. Instead of being shown as a meter below a radar at the top of your screen, these stages count down on an actual timer in the top-middle of the screen. In fact, they're isnt a MGS radar at all in this game! This comes as a blessing to me, sicne I thougt the radars in the previous MGSs really gave you an unfair advantage over the guards, and the suspence and un-predictability of sneaking through a guard-filled peice of land is greatly increased with the absense of the radar.For the times when you are locked in the middle of an intense firefight, aiming your gun seems much slower than in the last games. A low resolutin makes pinpointing a guards face right down the barrel of your tranquiliser much harder, and you still have a very tedious and unconvential method of crouching and crawling. Press X to crouch. Move the stick to crawl. Don't move the stick to not crawl. When crawling, press X again to crouch. When crouched, press X again to stand. As can be seen, it can be confusing trying to figure out when to press X and when to not press X but move the analog stick instead. Plus, there is no way to crouch-walk. You can only run along, or crawl along. You can barely move the stick to walk instead of run, but why can't they simply let you run after crouching, and bind the crawling to another button? This crouching system is probably the game's major flaw, as, it out and out sucks. Several times guards can walk over and melee attack you, knocking you down. While down there, you'll start mashing X really fast in an attempt to get Snake back up faster. Oh joy, you just made him get on his belly and crawl 2 feet to the left instead! Plus, the transition animation between crouch, crawl, and stand position is rather long and it can be VERY, i mean, ULTRA-VERY frustrating to try and get back up quickly and easily while in a firefight. But, I guess since this is supposed to be a stealth game, you're not supposed to be in firefights, eh? Anyways, they could've easily fixed this by simply mapping the crawl to a different button instead of having to cycle to it by pressing X over and over again.Overall, the demo for MGS3 was a fantastic experience. Codec conversations were nice and long, the music was so dramatic that it was almost was corny (as was the opening cutscene-compared to the subtle, dark, and more movie-like opening cutscene of the MGS2), guns are very loud and make very satisfying effects, and a cigar is one of several inventory options. All of those features are stuff MGS fans are gonna love in this game, and even first-time MGS players won't be turned off either. Overall, I can definatly tell you that this game is gonna end out being awsome. The shoot-em-up fans might be turned off by the horrid gun models and crouching system, but the guns also make such fun firefights, special effects, and painfull-looking ragdool effects that lovers of that genre should love the game as well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2004"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"From Detroit","summary":"Lovin' it!","reviewText":"I was worried about this installment.  The series seemed to be losing steam since VIII (well, for me anyway, and I've played since the very first one.)  I quit XII about 20 hours in out of boredom.  I made it to the end of X, but found out I wasn't strong enough and had to backtrack to \"unlock\" stuff, and quit because the combat system was like nails on a chalkboard to me.  So, I pre-ordered and canceled the order several times before I stuck it out on this one (I had just got burnt on pre-ordering Demon's Souls and White Knight Chronicles, so I was extra cautious here.)  Well, I've played several hours into it, and here's the verdict:  It's great!Many of the complaints from the previous titles seem to have been minimized, or have simply vanished.  The combat system is fast paced.  You have some control, but mot all.  The AI does a fine enough job picking jobs.  Is it perfect and going to make everyone happy?  Probably not.  But I like it.  Most of he characters are likable too.  Your main character isn't a whiny brat (though they have one in the mix, but fortunately his dialog is minimal compared to others.)  You also get the obligatory aggressively cheerful girl in the group too.Story, visuals and sound are where this game (and most of the series) really shines.  Graphics are very cinematic, and the sound's there to match.  The story is outstanding!  I've been hooked since the beginning.  A major complaint that many seem to be having is this idea of \"linearity.\"  I'm sorry, but all the Final Fantasy games have been linear.  Until you reach a certain stage of the game, you follow the path of \"Got from point A to point B to point C\" and you cant' stray from it.  If you do, you get smacked down by monsters that are way too powerful.  The only difference is that most of the previous titles had hours of running around said points leveling and making money to upgrade your stuff. Once you're strong enough, you completed your task for 10 minutes of story.  Lather rinse and repeat.  Well, this game took out the repetition.  You get lots of story, separated by some button mashing.  For me, this change is rather refreshing.The only complaints I have are rather minor.  Hope needs to be repeatedly punched in the stomach.  And the voice acting is a bit overdone sometimes.  There have been several instances where silence would have been perfectly fine, but they decided to fill in the silence with random grunts, gasps, giggles and other strange noises (mostly from the kids.)  Over all, it sounds almost pornographic.  Facial expressions would have done just fine.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2010"}

{"product_name":"B003O6EATE","description":"","reviewerName":"Shaide","summary":"Best Handheld currently on the market!","reviewText":"Easily the most powerful handheld gaming system available. It has a larger screen than the PSP-3000, and is capable of PS3-like graphics. It can also play select PS4 games remotely, so if playing a PS4 on a small screen is your ultimate dream, you are golden there.While the system is extremely powerful, it's also full of gimmicks, including a touch screen, a back touch pad, front and back cameras, light sensitivity pad, Augmented Reality capabilities and that's just what I can think of off hand. All of the gimmicks are pointless, and don't enhance gameplay what so ever. If anything it complicates the games.Another thing that really grinds my gears, is the game library. There's not a whole lot of exceptional vita exclusive games, but the few that do exist are not just good, but great! Although, since the games for the VITA are stored on tiny smart cards instead of CDs, they tend to be short on content and can leave you wanting more.Lastly, one of my favorite things about the Vita, is that it will play Digital Download versions of PSP titles, and will allow you to map FPS to the right analog stick, instead of using the Triangle, X, Circle, and square buttons to look around. However, unfortunately not ALL PSP games can be played on the VITA, in fact a good many can't, which is a disappointment beyond belief. The same applies for Digital DL PSOne games.Overall, this is a great system with few flaws, and if you are in the market for a handheld game system, I would highly recommend picking this up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2013"}
{"product_name":"B003ZHMMEM","description":"","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"This game time traveled me back to 1994.","reviewText":"I was fortunate enough to have an SNES when the first Donkey Kong Country hit stores in 1994. That game changed everything in the console war between Nintendo and Sega, and the graphics alone blew everyone's mind. Essentially, DKC was a Super Mario World clone, but my god did it have style. 5 animal friends, 101 hidden bonus stages, hands down the best soundtrack I've heard in a game, and it was just plain fun. DKC2 was just as strong, but DKC3 lost a lot of people, myself included. Since then, the poor gorilla was stuck with bongo games on the GameCube, which were fun and all, but not the DKC that many were hoping for. Retro Studios revives another franchise, and does great things once again. And while I really, really wanted to give this game 5 stars, a couple of big cons that stuck  through the whole game held it back. Still, this is one of the best platformers I've -ever- played, and I have nothing but high hopes for an improved sequel.The story is simple- Donkey Kong's beloved bananas have been stolen once again, but not by the Kremlings this time. No, it's a bunch of little tiki masks with magical powers. As you progress through the game, you'll find out that somehow the bananas power the tikis, and they want to make more and more of them...hence why they took so many freakin' bananas. Donkey Kong isn't too keen on his banana stash being stolen again, so he and his buddy Diddy go out once more to make things right in the jungle. DKCR is a platformer just like the previous entries, meaning you'll do a lot of running and jumping, bouncing on enemies, collecting items and discovering secret areas while taking out some pretty nasty bosses.First things first, Retro really did a heck of a job here. From the minute Donkey Kong clobbered a tiki and jumped out of his tree house, and that classic track kicked in, I felt like I was 9 years old in 1994 again. And don't get me wrong- I'm not one of those people who thinks that something's good just because it makes me nostalgic, but everything felt so right at first. Very rarely do I stop and enjoy the scenery and level design in games anymore, or kamikaze myself and jump off ledges to find a secret area, but my old way of playing games was revived with DKCR. They took the first DKC for the foundation of this game, but have truly made a new game, not just a remake. The art direction is a sight to behold, especially the levels where you just see Donkey Kong as a silhouette, with his red tie being the only other color. Gameplay is classic DKC, right down to collecting the KONG letters and extra life balloons, and succeeding or failing in bonus stages. Stages range from the jungle, beach, rocky cliffs, a volcano, and more. There are just the right amount of levels in each world, as well as a secret level for each one if you get all the KONG letters in every stage. This is something that drove me to collect everything, knowing that getting all the letters was necessary for entering a secret area after you beat the game. In addition to this, there are puzzle pieces in every level, and if you collect them all in one stage, it opens some bonus artwork on the main menu to look at.Now, a ton of people have complained about how hard this game is. I won't deny it- I probably died over 400 times by the time I beat the game. Like New Super Mario Bros, DKCR is very generous with extra lives. You can even buy them from Cranky Kong with the of banana coins you find. But where this is much different from New Super Mario Bros is that the levels are actually tough. This game does not hold your hand once, and if you think you've reached a dead end, you're going to have to sit there and think about how to advance until you get it. Techniques like rolling off a ledge, then jumping in mid-air, were big in the original games, and very useful here too. Veterans of the older games won't have as much of a problem with some of the trickier areas here, but there are some other levels I'll mention in a minute that will. The boss battles weren't that tough, but sometimes it's hard to get the timing just right without dying a few times. If you scoffed at them giving Donkey and Diddy an extra hit each, rather than dying with one hit each, playing a couple stages in the cliff world will slap some sense into you, and you'll be thanking the heavens when you find an extra heart or DK barrel...or a checkpoint. Yes, this game did get hard in some places, but it seemed like the difficulty wasn't consistent. There'd be times when I'd breeze through 6 stages in a row, hit a tough one where I'd die 30 times, then I'd moonwalk my way through some more. And if all else fails, you can bite the bullet and let the checkpoint pig do the work, and he'll have a white Donkey Kong clear the stage for you. You can still advance to the next stage, but the one you needed help with will remain red on the map screen, and all the power ups you got won't count. I never used this option because of that very reason, but I can see why they put it in here. But I'll tell you, beating a tough level, or even quick area where fast paced platforming went on, I felt accomplished, and was happy. Usually when I get past a hard level in a game these days, I think nothing of it and move on. Here? As frustrated as I might've gotten at times, I felt like I was getting the hang of things.As for what keeps the game from getting 5 stars, I'll bring up the obvious first- waggle. There's absolutely no reason why I should have to shake the Wii remote for DK to do a simple roll attack. NO REASON. In the old games, it was a push of the Y button, and DK would roll, or Diddy would cartwheel. Here, you have to shake the controller, and playing with the Classic isn't an option. One of the reasons I died so many times in a stage would be because of this, and I kept wishing that there were a Classic feature, or way to just program the roll attack to one of the buttons that wasn't used for anything else. Imagine having to shake the controller to make Mario shoot fireballs. Yeah, it wouldn't be fun would it? Fortunately, you can do most of the attacks with barrels or jumping on enemies or with Diddy's rocket pack, but when you have to roll off a ledge and then jump for an extra boost, it'll drive you crazy. Shaking the controller for slamming on the ground is fine, and fun since it makes sense, but not for a main attack. Next, the lack of animal buddies. Rambi's here, and so is Squawks (to an extent), but that's it. No Clapper, Winky, Espresso, Enguarde, Squitter, Rattly, etc. Don't get me wrong- riding Rambi and smashing through everything is way more fun here than it was in the first DKC, but I would've liked some more variety, or even more chances to use him rather than like 5 times. Co-op play is pretty bad too, and the less said about that, the better. If you're playing with a friend, just take turns when you die. It'll be less stressful. I also don't like the fact that the only way to play as Diddy Kong on his own is with a second person playing. If you're playing by yourself, you're stuck with Donkey. Finally, the main thing most people hate- the mine cart and Rocket Barrel stages. I actually didn't mind the mine cart ones until near the end, when you could only make a jump if you jumped off your current rail at the absolute last second, but it did get tricky later on. The Rocket Barrel stages are just cruel, and I made the mistake of joking to myself 'watch, the last boss is just a Rocket Barrel stage'. As it turned out, that's how you GET to the boss in the final level, and is a part of the level too. Ugh. Just when you get the hang of these stages, it'll throw a curve ball, and you'll have to watch out for things coming up behind you, not just in front. Oh, and my final complaint? No underwater levels at all. Not one. What gives?Visually, the game is beautiful, and maintains the classic Donkey Kong Country look. There's nearly no slowdown until the last 5 stages, and they have some creative animations in here. The music is just as good, though for a diehard fan of the first DKC's soundtrack, it's a mixed bag. Some of the tracks from that game (and the sequels) are here, and redone...and they sound really good. But the rest of the tracks aren't very memorable, and I wish they would've just had a totally new soundtrack, and tried to make it great.In the end, I enjoyed this game from start to finish, and it never left my Wii. I was determined to get everything in it, and felt great when all was said and done. The difficulty isn't as bad as say...getting an S rank in Ikaruga or clearing the last level of Metal Slug 3 with one life, but it's pretty high, if only because of those crazy Rocket Barrel stages. Any platformer fan, or anyone who wants to feel like a kid again playing the first DKC, I wholeheartedly recommend this. It's one of those rare games I can say that I didn't mind paying full price for, and will keep playing months/years later down the road.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005NZ1G","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play. However you choose to hero your way throughHalo: Combat Evolved, the action should break in your new Xbox in explosive style.","reviewerName":"Peter \"aragorn318\"","summary":"Revolutionary game in it's time!","reviewText":"I thoroughly enjoyed this game.

{"product_name":"B0002A2S26","reviewerName":"Ryan H.","summary":"Highly Over-Rated","reviewText":"Okay, I know that this game will get a bunch of good reviews that it is the best game ever.  Well obviously this game is fun, which I do admit, it is.  They haven't gone through the flows of this game.  There are a lot of good points of this game, especially multi-player and the fact that it works on Xbox Live.  That alone could've made me give it 5 stars but there are other things with this game.The first good fact, the graphics are gorgeous, alot of time went into making the environments as real as they get.  Another good thing is the ability to duel weild weapons, this adds to the stratergy, although it does take the place of the grenades, which kind of threw me off.  Also there is more of a storyline, and we get to go to Earth this time around.All of these problems come from the Campaign Mode.Okay to start off with the bad I should mention the Allies AI.  The programmers must've put more work into the enemies than with the allies because they'll either commit suicide (which is no different from the first) or kill you, that's right, they'll kill you again, and again.  I found this to be more of a problem when they drive the warthogs and I drove a ghost.  Honestly, I kept getting hit from behind, I died more to them than with the covenent.  So here's what I did, I either shot them, blew up the warthog, or let them be stupid and run into the covenent guns ablazing.Another thing, the storyline, while interesting at first, returns to it's old routine and yes there is another Halo you have to go onto.  The storyline also includes a new character, an elite.  While this sounds good on paper, he's really no different than Master Chief, except he doesn't have a flash light but replaces it with a Camoflage suit that last for about 10 seconds.Dialogue can be really slow, Master Chief mainly has one liners, Cortana, while still funny at some instances, has lost alot of her attitude, and Commander Keyes sounds too much like Cortana.Also the campaign mode is alot easier than the first game.  When I played the first game it took me weeks to beat it on normal, while it took me 2 days on the sequel.All and all, if you're just buying this game for the Campaign mode, you'll be feeling deprived by the end of the game, but if you plan on playing this on Xbox Live, then this is the best first person multiplayer game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2004"}

The plot is back there behind the curtains, of course, but those who haven't read the books or seen the films won't be able to make heads or tails of it. Being a Tolkien zealot, so to speak, and an avid supporter of the first film as well, I found &quot;The Two Towers&quot; to be a mixed bag. It sometimes borders on greatness, but then falls short. Why? Well, let me begin with what the game does well. First of all, the gameplay is fast, intense, and relentless, and it generally mimics key moments from the films. Yes, there are a handful of moments from \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" as well as the upcoming \"Two Towers.\" The production values go above and beyond. Several of the film's key players are on hand to vocalize their gaming counterparts, which goes a long way toward injecting you with that \"Wow, I'm in the movie!\" sensation. On top of this, Howard Shore's rousing soundtrack throbs during the action, giving you that much incentive to \"hunt some orc.\" The sound effects and the graphics are splendid as well, and further give you the sensation of being there. The game's transitions between film footage (some good \"Two Towers\" preview moments here!) and in-game graphics are worthy of honorable mention. \"The Two Towers\" allows you to play as Aragorn, Gimli, or Legolas, and each of them have their own particular abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. They can also acquire experience points which can be used to purchase new orc-dispatching attacks. The addition of these three playable characters is vastly important, because it gives a short, linear game some replay value it might have lacked. For fans of the films, there are interviews, documentaries, and other goodies that can be unlocked during the course of the game. \"The Two Towers\" is challenging, but rarely frustrating (with the possible exception of the Plains of Rohan stage, which played havoc with my temper). The game's most fascinating missions involve epic battles, like those that take place at the fortress of Helm's Deep. These moments are extremely memorable, and you'll want to play them again and again.Alas! All is not perfect in this valiant effort. Here are some of the game's failings. The gameplay isn't story-driven, and for the uninitiated, it won't make much sense (but, then, why are you even playing this game if you're not a fan already?). Missions leap from one story sequence to another without warning. For instance, you go from playing as Aragorn defending Frodo on Weathertop immediately to the mines of Moria, and there aren't any cut-sequences that actually smooth the transition. The clips that do pop up between levels are essentially promotional campaigns for the upcoming film, and not story-driving elements. It's jarring. The game tries for camera angles reminiscent of those seen in the films, but which are usually functional as well. However, in every game that has a fixed camera, problems do occur, and they can be very annoying. Fortunately, it's the exception rather than the rule. The action is very arcade-like, and feels like a cutting edge Double Dragon clone. The play mechanics are essentially the same. You slug it out with opponents while traveling a very linear path from which you cannot veer for any reason. Times have changed since Double Dragon, naturally, so this is the best variation of the formula I've ever seen, but it remains an aging gameplay mechanic. It's not for everybody. Timed missions involve too much trial and error (especially the aforementioned Plains of Rohan level, which is particularly frustrating). You can't skip all of the video sequences, even if you've seen them a hundred times. The game isn't as true to the source material as it should be - and when I refer to the source material, I mean the books, as it's early November and the next film won't hit theaters until mid-December. Fortunately, most of these deviations are acceptable in the spirit of the gameplay, provided you're not a less open-minded Tolkien fan than I am. I just hope the movie doesn't take so many liberties with this beloved tale. I tend to trust Mr. Jackson after such a successful adaptation of book 1, however, and I digress... The single most disappointing thing about this game is its length. This game is excruciatingly short, and experienced and dedicated players should have it conquered within a few hours. It may have incentive to replay it from the beginning, but that's still not as cool as a longer campaign would have been. No chance to duke it out with the Balrog. Argh!So, in the end, I recommend this game to fans of non-stop action gaming, but it is important that you also know at least a little about the storyline that is moving things along behind the scenes. On top of this, you must be willing to deal with the game's shortcomings (and I do mean SHORTcomings, because the game is over so bloody quickly!). As far as Tolkien zealots go, be warned that the game strays from the storyline at times in favor of visceral gaming. However, if I can handle that, I'm sure you can as well. When it's all said and done, this is a fine product worthy of your time.Final Grade: B- (or 4 stars, to grade on a curve)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2002"}
{"product_name":"B008277M0E","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Tyler","summary":"Charm, style and stealth!","reviewText":"Over the past couple of years Playstation has finally begun to secure some FUN games.  I am an older gamer in my thirties, but have never cared much for the constant parade of grey and brown first person shooters that were released for the system.  I know that there are people who enjoy the \"serious\" or \"dramatic\" or \"mature\" games that are largely represented in triple-A titles, but not me.  I play video games as a form of escapism.  I have enough serious, dramatic and mature events in my real life - I don't need more of it when I try to relax.Sly Cooper is the antithesis of those brown boring games.  It oozes with style, charm and playfulness.  It is much like the Ratchet and Clank series in that regard.  And the vibrant colors that the developer used (thank goodness!) really pop on the Vita's beautiful screen.  One of the most impressive things about the game is how polished it is - visuals, controls, story, voice acting - all of it is top notch.  The developer, Sanzaru Games, has knocked it out of the park with their first (as far as I know) foray into this genre.  They are the real deal.Personally, I have never played a Sly Cooper game before.  With the exceptional job that Sanzaru has done with the other aspects of the game, I imagine that they also did a good job in paying homage to the series in maintaining its spirit.  Maybe other reviewers can comment on that.  You do not need to have played the other games to enjoy this one, though.  I can attest to that.Here's the list:ProsStyle, style, stylePlayful and lightheartedTight controls - the use of the Vita's touchscreen edges is spot onPopping colorsGood voice actingGood gameplay varietyConsMaybe the minigames - you either like them, you don't, or you're indifferent.  I'm indifferent.I bought the PS3 version, but have played it almost exclusively on my Vita.

In 2001, Nintendo started their Super Mario Advance series with this title, an enhanced port of Super Mario Bros. 2 and released it on the Game Boy Advance. Basically, they enhanced the graphics and sounds, included an intro that was not shown on the original hit and included an enhanced port of the original Mario Bros. arcade game, which can be played separately.The PROS: Just like the original NES hit, Super Mario Advance is fun to play and a perfect fit for the GBA. The enhanced graphics and sounds are nice and the controls are spot on so it's very easy to get into. When you are done playing, you can check out the other game that is bundled, Mario Bros. Originally an arcade game ported to the NES years ago, this game pits you and up to 4 players to battle it out against enemies in an underground pipes system, complete with enhanced graphics and sounds. It's more fun to play with friends than by yourself.The CONS: Well nothing else has been added but for what it is, it's still a fun game to play.Super Mario Advance is a game that should be in anyone's GBA collection. It's a great port of a classic sequel that's spot on and with extra features added, you can take it on the go whenever you want. Track this down because it is worth it.

Featuring detailed environments and complicated new battle mechanisms, this game demands a different kind of perspective than the first-person shooters from the original Halo series. You'll need to uncover the hidden strengths and weaknesses of each unit and play them to your tactical advantage, and that's just the beginning.UNSC: Be Part of a Legendary ConflictThe story opens with UNSC forces retaking the planet Harvest from the Covenant. At your disposal -- should you choose to take command of UNSC forces -- will be everything from a corps of highly-trained Marines to the Warthogs, Scorpions, and Hornets you'll need for air and land attacks. You'll take stock of the map and decide between holding your ground or advancing on enemy strongholds, all while trying to navigate the local terrain and outsmart Covenant forces. And when you need something extra to tip the tide in your favor, UNSC leaders can provide you with the ability to mobilize highly specialized units or call the Spirit of Fire vessel for support from above.Covenant: A Capable, Playable Enemy FactionThat's right, Covenant is playable in this corner of the Halo universe. This alliance of alien species has manipulated advanced technology, firepower, and tactical prowess into a powerful force that is engaged in a Genocidal war against human race, having branded humans as heretics. With the ability to play as these tough, alien fighters, you'll have advanced shield technology, the modular Citadel at the heart of Covenant's colonizing power, and, of course, the iconic Scarab attack vehicle at your disposal, adding a whole new dimension to your strategic warfare. The Scarab is a terrifying military vehicle crafted from heavy mining equipment. And with a mining laser that delivers massive damage across battlefields large and small, turrets for taking on air attacks, and the ability to clamber over any terrain, what's not to love about commanding Scarabs instead of fighting against them?Developed Exclusively for Xbox 360Most console RTS games are adapted from existing PC games, which can make their controls bulky or awkward, butHalo Warshas been developed for Xbox 360 from the ground up. This means the controls are sensitive, intuitive, and easy-to-operate in the midst of battle. And the UI is just as intuitive, so whether you're managing a unit of marines or a deadly machine, you can focus on creating a battle strategy instead of worrying about how to overcome a clumsy controller.No matter which faction you choose to play as, you can test your skills against those of other players in online skirmishes that allow up to six players with the New Xbox Experience through Xbox LIVE.","reviewerName":"Halo","summary":"So much fun","reviewText":"Lot of fun not a great RTS but online is compettive and fun as anything.

{"product_name":"B0009WPZMW","description":"Burnout Revenge X360","reviewerName":"Brian Seiler","summary":"All the Wrong Moves","reviewText":"Burnout gets a lot of credit for its concept.  And, to be fair, that's credit that's deserved.  The idea of a racing game that promotes a powerful sense of speed and encourages the player to hit things (and builds itself around a somewhat realistic prosecution of the aftermath of those collisions) is a good one.  And it leaves its marks all over this game.Why, then, am I only giving this (to read the other reviews) apparently superb game three stars?  Well, folks--that's simple.  Absolutely every wrong deicision that could have been made with respect to this game has been made, and the end result is a piece of software that has great moments, but can only be considered middling at best.To start with, the game is about twice as long as it should be, and that's where the problems really set in.  Racing games can be occasionally frustrating.  This game is regularly, unforgivingly frustrating.  In order to effectively \"finish\" the game, you have to perfect every event (there's a LOT of events).  In the beginning, that's pretty easy to do.  Once you reach the middle, you'll probably have five or six events that you have to repeatedly try just to get close to making your perfect rating.  By the end, pretty much all of the racing events fall into that mold.  Worst offenders are the \"Burning Laps\" (time trials), where the game designers seem not only to have assigned some wild and irregular difficulty levels (some tracks you'll get on the first shot; one notable track has taken me three hours to not perfect thus far, and I believe I'm just going to give up on the game as a whole, rather than waste another minute of my life driving the same path again).All of this, of course, could have been solved if most of the latter half of the game had been left on the drawing boards entirely.  By the time you hit the sixth or seventh rank of events, you've pretty much seen everything the game can do for you as far as race events go.  You've done the Traffic Attack scenarios (where the challenge is basically to go fast and hit cars into oncoming traffic), you've done the Road Rage scenarios (where the challenge is essentially to learn the best places on each track to perform takeouts without injuring yourself), and you've learned all the tricks you're going to learn about general racing and driving.  The additional tracks you have to grind through serve to do nothing but extend and taint the experience of what would otherwise be an enjoyable racer.The crash events, thankfully, don't have this problem to quite the same extent.  While several of them can be ridiculously and inexplicably frustrating (you may never know why you fail sometimes to get the gold medal in an event and succeed others), that negative element of the experience is at least kept to a comparative minimum.But the problems - the failures of execution - don't stop with the length of the game.  There are some fundamental programming errors that also plague this title; most notably, the fact that the developers saw fit to attempt to access the disk drive BEFORE saving race result data back to the user's profile.  The result, of course, is that if you have any difficulty at all reading the disc (a smudge, or, in the case of MY 360, some sort of internal defect that causes it to fail reading any game after about an hour and a half), your results will not be saved back to your profile and you will lose any progress you've made in an event.  Add that to the work-intensive, frustrating late game and you have a recipe for disaster.Games are supposed to be fun.  For the first ten or fifteen hours with this game, I had fun.  You can have fun with it online.  But if you expect to finish this game, you're not going to have fun.  You're going to be bored, you're going to spend a lot of time memorizing and grinding, and ultimately, you're going to end up questioning why you're finishing the game in the first place.For the price that Amazon has this title for, it's not a bad pickup if you don't have the title on any other console (if you do, you're not gaining much, as this is just a rerelease for 360 with a little bit of extra content).  Just don't expect it to be all sunshine and roses.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2006"}
{"product_name":"B0009WPZMW","description":"Burnout Revenge X360","reviewerName":"Vynny \"Vynrod\"","summary":"Worth buying - even if you've got the Xbox version","reviewText":"I was unsure weather I should get the 360 version of Burnout Revenge. After all, I own the Xbox version which is awesome. But the game's recent price drop had me hankering for Hidef burnout action and so I caved.So does the 360 version warrant a new purchase? In a word, almost. If you loved B:R on the 360 then yes, yes, yes - go get it. However, it's not a massive leap in either graphics or game so don't expect a mind blowing upgrade. PC gamers know what it's like when you upgrade your graphics card - everything's cleaner, at a better resolution and there's some new things to look at but really it's the same game with a fancier wrapper and that's true with B:R 360.Why 5 stars then? Well it's just this game is so ruddy fun, and the Criterion guys have even removed some of the tiny niggles I had with the original version that kept that from being a 5 star game.So - onto noticeable differences - better graphics sure, but the original was pretty damn good. There's a lot more particles and crash, flame effects for a start. Crashbreaker is like a nuke! And there's also a lot more objects that are scattered around for you to hit (tables, drums, cones etc). But mainly, aside from the higher rez, it looks like a polished xbox game. Some depth of field blurring would be nice as well as less 'bloom' which plaque all 360 games. The sense of speed is considerably greater though -wow!Gameplay it's been tweaked subtly in all departments. Good players who whizzed through the game may be pleased to hear getting takedowns are much more difficult to get and some strategy and timing is required. This is a good thing. Crash mode has lost that stupid power bar so no more exploding on the start line. It still has the silly tap, tap, tap B for crashbreaker which is annoying but maybe that'll go in the next release. Checking the traffic seems to have more impact on your speed but the cars have more effect on your opponents, which again is good and helps when planning your line. Car control is improved; good for getting those aftertouch takedowns.By far the biggest update is a proper camera replay! Yes - harking back to the days of Burnout 2, you can now see an entire race on replay. Or view the crash mode from any angle. You can even save 30 seconds of any mode to the 360 and share it online. Fantastic! This is a big leap and is very welcome.Everything else is more or less the same - same ladder system, same excellent crash reward trophy anims (except now they look even better), same tunes.All in all this is an almost perfect arcade racer. It's amazing to look at, fun the play, easy for the beginner, challenging for the expert. I really love it - and so will you!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-28-2006"}

{"product_name":"B0054INKZK","description":"","reviewerName":"Andrew Mulligan \"Joker\"","summary":"A great game when new, even more so at the cheaper price","reviewText":"When Angels fall and claim godhood, the real God tends to be none too pleased.StoryThe story of El Shaddai is (loosely) based off of a religious text 'The Book of Enoch' and follows Enoch, a heavenly scribe chosen by God, to find and return 7 fallen angels to heaven, the game explains this over a series of small cutscenes and novel-esque pieces. These fallen Angels have taken shelter on Earth, creating a veil, or false sky, to hide from God, the humans who once prayed to God saw they Angels as gods as well and began praying to them, eventually forgetting their true God. Since these people are praying to these false gods who have been corrupted by 'The Darkness', they do not ascend to Heaven when they die and instead become creatures of darkness themselves.GraphicsIf you ask anyone what stands out the most in El Shaddai, they'll say one of two things, the anime-like art style, or the remarkably amazing visuals (hopefully the latter). El Shaddai makes up for the lack of story with graphics that will leave you mesmerized, the coloring and lighting are done EXTREMELY well and make everything pop. The changing color scheme, which happens often, makes things come alive to a leel I have never honestly seen in gaming.Normally, graphics are nothing special and remain unchanged from one game to another or differ slightly, in El Shaddai they are breathtaking and stunning, while they aren't realistic, they are some of the best (if not the best) artistic graphics I've ever seen.ControlsThe controls are rather simple to grasp, but can be tough to master. You have your standard jump, attack and guard buttons (A, X/Y and RB respectively), as well as a purification button (LB) which allows you to purify, or clean, your weapons as they get 'dirty' from attacking enemies. While they are rather basic, the timing is critical, a block at the right moment can send the enemy reeling, allowing for Enoch to follow up with a series of blows, attacking at the right moment has the same effect.I mentioned Purification  you must purify your weapon regularly as it builds up darkness gained from enemies, if you don't purify, your weapon will inflict less damage and have a reduced chance of staggering the enemy, so you should really purify after every battle.Music/Sound/VoiceThere is little music generally, it is rather quite and almost harmonic with everything else that is going on in game, you can hear it but it will not stand out on most occasions. Somehow, this works well with the games settings, so I personally didn't mind the ambiance it brought.Sound is done much tot he same effect, you'll hear somethings on some levels and nothing on others, these can be as simple wind blowing or fireworks going off, small things that add to the games ambiance.Voicing is done very well for an anime styled game, which are usually quite over-dramatic, granted there's very little talking outside of confrontation or narration, but what little there is is done quite nicely.OtherOne of the negatives, or positives, depending on how you look at it,  is the fact that there are only 3 weapons in the game, the Arch, the Gale and the Veil (you can also use your fists, so technically 4). Each has their pros and cons, they are sort of like rock-paper-scissors, one beats the other which loses to a different one.The Arch - A bow like weapon that is really a sword, the bow stings are sharp blades. The Arch is an all-around average weapon, average strength, speed and recoil.The Gale - A series of shard like crystals that can be hurled at enemies and easily linked together. The Gale is very fast but also very weak and causes little recoil.The Veil - A giant shield, broken in half allowing Enoch to easily wield it. The Veil has the best physical and defensive capabilities, causing recoil at a high rate, it is very slow however.Once you've beaten the game, you can play through it again with extras such as outfits, higher difficulties and you are also graded in each level and leaderboard ranking.OverallEl Shaddai is a rather unique game for both it's reference to real religious texts and for its amazing art, any fan of action/hack and slash titles should check this out.8.5/10.0Pros- STUNNING visuals- Simple, yet complex combat- Interesting real life referenceCons- Limited weapons- After you've mastered combat it's very easy- Story takes awhile to take offSee the complete review at lvgrb.blogspot","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2013"}

From Darth Vader's pursuit of Princess Leia aboard her Blockade Runner to a showdown on the reconstructed Death Star, the game includes the family-friendly LEGO action, puzzles and humor that earned the original LEGO Star Wars such popularity and acclaim. Drop-in/drop-out feature enables friends to join easily and engage in multi-player action.","reviewerName":"David Foskin \"SneakyGoblin on XBL\"","summary":"Great for all kids - all of us that never grew up","reviewText":"The original Lego Star Wars was a great little lighthearted romp of a game: an amusing way to play out the three most recent Star Wars films in virtual form. The Lego and Star Wars combo proved to also be a terrific formula for the game space, generating an experience in Lego Star Wars that was oftentimes even more entertaining than the source material it was based on. Like any good sequel, Lego Star Wars II improves on the original in almost every way. But most importantly, it's about the good episodes now. For that reason alone, Lego Star Wars II is one of the most enjoyable games of this fall.Featuring the story lines and characters of A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi, it's hard to believe that any Star Wars fan (which is, what, pretty much everyone?) wouldn't love this game. While the gameplay is pretty standard action fare for the most part, it's somehow made so much more fun because of the Lego characters. Levels that could perhaps be dismissed as lackluster in other games absolutely work here. Star Wars scenes are comically recreated and look and sound great (though, to nitpick, some of the John Williams music samples don't play in their entirety, making you wish for more). But make no mistake, even those without a predilection for Star Wars will enjoy this -- it's the combination of great story lines, characters, and comedic elements provided by Lego that makes it all work. The game's designers clearly had fun with it all -- you'll be continuously entertained by how they incorporated elements of the film into the gameplay (often taking some rather humorous liberties along the way). The Lego brand clearly afforded them freedom to have fun with the Star Wars license.While most of the gameplay consists of run-and-gun action, there are lots of puzzles to be found -- many of which are quite good, even though some have rather unclear objectives -- and several missions that take place in vehicles (from AT-ST Walkers to X-wings). While the vehicular stages vary in terms of quality, the mere fact that so many exist really adds to the scope of the game. Lego Star Wars II offers a surprising amount of playtime, and is much larger and longer than the original game (which was one of its biggest criticisms). Once again, you control a group of characters that pertain to a scene, allowing you to easily switch between them on the fly in order to take advantage of their unique abilities. Unfortunately, though, your A.I.-controlled buddies are kind of clueless at times and offer little support in battles (while they do fire, it's all for show -- their shots inflict no damage on enemies). The game's far better when a second player joins in to play (a game can be joined at any time); it's loads of fun as a co-op experience. It's just a shame that Lego Star Wars II offers no online support.What's also neat about the game is that there's a lot to do outside of the standard mission structure. There are lots of collectables to gather, secret items to discover, and hidden areas to unlock (certain areas aren't immediately accessible on the first playthrough -- only on return using other characters can they opened). The option to build your own custom characters with parts taken from others (such as a C-3PO equipped with a Darth Vadar head) is amusing as well.There's definitely a lot of fun to be had with Lego Star Wars II, making it a good choice for those looking for a solid action-platformer; it's an ideal choice for those fans of Star Wars. It's also perfect for almost all ages, offering a rewarding experience even for younger players. All of the many versions (Xbox 360, PS2, PC, Xbox, GameCube, and PSP) look essentially the same, with the PC version offering better resolutions and the Xbox 360 version more visual effects (though it's unfortunately priced $10 more than the others). Rumor has it that developers Traveller's Tales have more Lego games in the works after this (including one based on Batman) -- here's hoping, as this formula simply works.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2006"}
{"product_name":"B002I0F5M8","description":"","reviewerName":"HeavyMetalSushi","summary":"Outstanding Sequel To Arkham Asylum!","reviewText":"Batman Arkham Asylum has, to date, been one of my absolute favorite titles on the latest genre of systems.  I have beaten it multiple times, and not to mention that Batman is one of my all time favorite comic book characters.  So naturally, when I heard there was a sequel being made to Arkham Asylum, I was all over it!  As soon as it became available for pre-order, I put my money down on it at Game Stop.  I missed the midnight release, but was first one into my local Game Stop to pick this up the following morning.  Spent nearly 2 straight days playing it, spare little breaks here & there and some errands that my wife and I needed to run.  Beat it the 2nd day.  I vowed next time that I would pace myself a bit more, but I was just so into it that it was hard to put my controller down.  Fortunately, after you beat the actual story mode, this Batman features something Arkham Asylum didn't...continuous play.  Once the credits are finished, you can actually continue playing...screwing around, exploring, finishing up side missions, etc.  Graphics are pretty legit on this game as well, and the gameplay is amazing.  You even start out with items you had at the end of Arkham Asylum and earn more new gadgets in Arkham City.  The storyline is pretty cool too, and there are more villains and other characters that you come across from the Batman universe.  You actually get to play as Catwoman a few times too.  Plus, after you have beaten the game, when you resume on continous play mode, there are pads in which you can actually go and switch back & forth between Batman and Catwoman, to finish each of their side missions and find their specific bonus items throughout Gotham.  To wrap things up, if you're a Batman fan or just plain love a good action/adventure game, this game is for you friend!  Definitely pick it up!  It's worth while, and there is definite replay value to it.  Plus, there is quite an ending to the story in this game.  Check it out fellow gamers!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2011"}

Love their customer service and love their product quality overall. Now, with that being said, I think they could have come out with a better drum kit for the 360, the kit wobbles a bit wich makes it annoying when you're trying to concentrate on what's on screen, it feels loose, that to me affects the overall game experience which is why I took one shiny star from my score but I can still say that this kit is still quieter and better looking than the official drum kit, also, the new price makes more sence than the $200 + price tag that it had before.I would recommend this drum controller only if you don't already own the official one, although it is a better kit, it shouldn't be taken as a major upgrade over the official.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2010"}

When I'd first read the description of the game, I thought to myself, \"How is this going to make for an interesting game?\". Yet, after booting up Rage on my Playstation 3, I can see how it does. Straight from the get-go, Rage pulls you into its' story. It goes a little something like this: The world is nearly wiped out by an asteroid. You emerge from an underground vault, prematurely, to find a world that's not a very friendly place. Not very friendly to you, of course. Through a series of missions, side quests and whatnot; you find out why. Despite it's variety of missions and so on, Rage is primarily a traditional FPS.First thing you'll notice in the game is the detail to the graphics of the game. Everything loooks photo-realistic. Not only that but the areas you visit are brimming with life. NPCs and enemies react just as we would in real-life, according to the situations(That's something that made Rage all the more believable to me). If you come into Rage thinking it to be like past id Software games, you'll be pleasantly surprised to find out that things things are much different this time around. Enemies react accordingly when you fire at them or swing at them. The towns and areas you visit and do battle in actually feel inhabited and lived in. It's really hard to explain all the nuances about the game that draw you in but id has did so with this game. Course, six years in the making has really paid off with this game. Id Software has outdid themselves this time.The only downfall or fault I found with Rage is that it didn't come to a good satisfying conclusion at its' end. Even though reasons why everyone is after you is peppered along in the game, you never really find out the whole reason why. Course, there could be a reason why it was done that way. Perhaps a Rage 2?Despite that, Rage is a great game. While it might not be revolutionary as people tend to think id Software has to be with every game, it's a winner in my books. It's an absolute blast(pun intended) to play and is an extremly beautiful shooter.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003S2MXRA","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Baptized in Fire and Blood","reviewText":"If you've ever played an RTS or Tabletop Warhammer Game and wondered what it would be like to stand and fight on those front lines as an elite character, here is your answer.Concept: 9/10Blends the melee elements of God of War with the shooting elements of Gears of War in the Warhammer 40,000 setting.  You are an Ultra-Marine, an elite commando of the Empire and you must defend your compatriots against charging hordes of blood lusted Orcs and other foul creatures.Story: 9/10You lead a squad of Ultra Marines into battle on a planet overrun by Orcs.  You must accomplish various mission objectives to give the Empire a fighting chance.  As the story unfolds, there seems to be something even more sinister behind the onslaught.The Empire in Warhammer 40k is a lot like the Roman Legions of the Holy Roman Empire in the 1500's - 1600's, but the Space Marines are equipped with Power Axes and Bolt Throwers, rather than swords and shields.  This game does a great job at bringing the characters and warring armies to life.Gameplay: 7.5/10The Story is broken up into 5 Chapters and these Chapters are broken up into Missions.  The Missions involve taking ground, defending ground, killing a boss, or moving through hostile territory.You are armored and you have a recharging shield and a health bar like the Halo games.  Your Shields replenish after time, but you must regain health by performing a \"Brutal Kill\" in combat.You are armed with a melee weapon:  Knife, Chainsword, Power Axe, and Two-Handed Thunder Hammer.  And you can perform very basic combos.  X,X,X,X performs slashes.  Pressing Y after X executes a special power attack.  The longer the combo goes on, the more damage you do.  You can also perform a melee attack while running called a charge.  If an enemy is near death, they are stunned and you can finish them off with a brutal kill and regain health by pressing the B button.  There is no block or jump, but you can dive roll out of the way.That's pretty much it, unfortunately.  The combos are very simplistic, the weapons are short range, and the only way to get health is to perform a brutal kill.  Unfortunately, you are vulnerable when you perform the \"Brutal Kill\" and you will probably die the most while you are trying to regain health.  So many times, I was about to finish off an enemy and I got hit by 1-3 enemies at once when I was half a second from getting my health.  The game would have been much better if there were \"special offensive and defensive attacks\" with a mana bar and / or cooldown associated with them.  The melee combat also suffers a bit because the camera is too close.  The camera is set at Ninja Gaiden Distance, but the attack speed is like Kratos from God of War.  The game would have been better if the Space Marines attacked as fast as Ryu from Ninja Gaiden, or the camera was pulled back farther so you could react to the enemies in your range.  If you perform your dive-roll, the camera is so close, you can't see where you will end up.  Sometimes, you can roll into worse trouble than you are already in.The Shooting is more like Gears of War where you have powerful weapons that are fun to use and many enemies to shoot.  Head Shots are extremely satisfying because the orc heads explode in a burst of blood and brains.  You get handguns, plasma weapons, grenade launchers, a heat gun that vaporizes everyone at close range, and long range rifles.  You can carry 4 guns at a time and quickly swap between them by pressing a direction on the D-pad.  The only problem I had with this was that you didn't have complete control over the weapons that you carried.  When you found a new weapon, you could only swap it for a specific one in your inventory.  It would have been better if the game allowed you to swap new guns for ANY gun in your inventory.In some levels, you get a jet pack, that allows you to burst into the sky the way Buzz Lightyear whishes he could.  As you descend, you can perform a shockwave attack and take out multiple enemies.You also get a few grenades that you can lob into enemy ranks to slow their advances.What saves the simplistic gameplay are the encounters.Encounters:  9/10This game loves to throw hordes of enemies at you.  Hundreds of enraged orcs wielding axes charge down a hill at you and your allies, while others drop back and spray cover fire into your ranks.  You actually feel adrenaline and the rush of battle when you see these charges.  The atmosphere and the intensity of the battles are the strong point of this game.The Warhammer Universe is full of ancient and unique looking architecture and the armor and weapons are the perfect amount of \"over the top.\"Graphics: 8/10It's not the best looking game of all time, but the graphics create atmosphere.  The art direction is great.  The structures, weapons, characters, vehicles, all bring the Warhammer Universe to life.Sound: 9/10There are some epic soundtracks that help set the atmosphere and the battle sound effects are great.  The dialogue is well acted and well written.  It definitely sounds like a summer blockbuster action film.Replay Value: 8/10There are 4 different difficulty levels for the Campaign and two Multi-Player Modes.  The campaign is VERY Linear, so it is doubtful that you will ever play it again on the same difficulty.The Multi-Player Modes are team battles.  One requires teams to reach a certain number of kills.  The other requires them to control areas and accumulate points.  You get a set amount of points every few seconds for each area you control.  The first team to 1000 wins.  As you play, you gain XP which is used to unlock character classes, give you upgrades, and new weapons.  You can also customize the look of your characters to the last detail.  (As you would expect in a Warhammer Game)Note:  If you rent the game, you can only advance to level 5, and you need a special unlock code to keep advancing from levels 6-40.  So, if you enjoy Multiplayer Team Battles, you'll have to buy it.Maturity: TeensThere is fantasy blood and gore, and wonderful violence.  If you've ever played with action figures or a Warhammer Tabletop game, this is what you've been imagining... if you watched a few gory movies before.Overall: 8/10The atmosphere and intense battles shine, while the gameplay does enough to get you through the encounters.  This is a very exciting game that really captures the spirit of Warhammer 40K.Buy it if you love Warhammer 40K and you want to experience these battles.Buy it if you love the idea of God + Gears of War.Buy it if you will play the Multiplayer.Rent it if you just want to blow through a fun campaign and have 8-10 hours.Avoid it if you like complex melee combat like Ninja Gaiden or Bayonetta.Avoid it if you don't like exploding heads (but seriously, who doesn't like exploding heads?)I would definitely be excited about a sequel.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2011"}
{"product_name":"B003S2MXRA","description":"","reviewerName":"Too Old for Games \"casualgamer\"","summary":"God of War meets Gears of War","reviewText":"This is just a review on the campaign:I came into this game with no prior knowledge of the Warhammer universe and left it with same lack of knowledge so this game to me is just another 3rd person shooter a la Gears of War with roided up heroes and pretty cool weaponry.  The comparison to Gears if valid and the developers didn't even try to hide this fact by the way each chapter unfolds to having a 3-person squad to having almost identical button mapping.  You could put in Marcus and Dom and not skip a beat, but I will say this game is pretty fun nonetheless and even funner then Gears 3, which was pretty much a letdown.  That's because in addition to being a 3rd person shooter, it's also a hacknslash game.  Whereas Gears has you taking cover and take pop shots, this game gets rid of the cover system and forces you to hack and slash when you are overcome with orcs which makes for a much faster paced, frenetic game.  During these instances, you essentially become Kratos and even have his rage mode when you press down on both analog sticks.  There are other fighting sequences that they basically plagiarized from God of War 3 like the kill sequences and knockdowns when you are on a jet pack.  But I'm not the type of game who knocks a game for lack of originality so I'm all for copying other games as long as you can improve on the formula.  I won't say this game is an improvement, but it's still fun and definitely worth a playthrough if you liked any of the games I referenced.  Don't judge the game by gameplay videos.  I usually can tell whether I like a game by watching videos, but the videos don't do this game justice because the graphics are just average and the characters look kind of wonky, no offense intended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0002CHIWO","reviewerName":"Madisen","summary":"Play it now!","reviewText":"You shouldn't be reading this review--you should be either at the store buying this game, at home playing it, or reflecting on how great it was after you finished it, like I am. But if you must have reasons, then I suppose I will give you some.The --it's perfect. That's the only way to describe it. Every button on the controller is used, making for an interface that's both challenging and intuitive. The combat system is fast-paced, but it's loaded with strategy elements as well. Basically, you must play your Magnus (I refuse to call them \"cards\", as that is demeaning) in combos like pairs and straights to demolish your enemies. But as you level up, things get complicated, keeping the game fresh. Magnus have multiple numbers; you're allowed to play more in a turn; and the time you have to play them gets smaller. Therefore, battles hit the perfect spot between boring and frustrating. I can't speak for everyone here, but as for myself, I truly looked forward to every battle. It's also worth mentioning that you can see enemies before you fight them, making exploration less nerve-racking.The places you'll visit are widely varied, but they're all creative and gorgeous to look at. I don't want to spoil too much, but I will say that there's a village made completely out of candy, a peaceful mountain cabin amidst a gigantic herd of sheep, and a huge castle where clouds constantly cascade down the walls like water. The phrase \"How do they come up with this stuff!?\" will pop into your head more than once, I can guarantee.The story and characters aren't too shabby, either. The story doesn't seem too unique at first, but after you get past the part where a less original RPG would end, plot twists are the order of the day. There were a few moments that stopped my heart completely, and a couple more that had my jaw on the floor. The touches of humor will make you smile, but the emotional momenets felt a bit too forced for me (especially the crying, which sounded like a dying animal trapped in a tin can). As a last little gripe, some parts were a bit confusing, too. Overall, though, the plot's strong parts carry it through.None of the characters are amazing, but each one had a unique backstory that fleshed them out well. At the start, they all seem to have cookie-cutter personalities (the silent mercenary, the peppy cheerleader, the \"cool young dude\"), but as the story progresses, they begin to show a much wider range of emotions, and near the end, there are major revelations centering around every character, which makes you feel more bonded to them.As we all know, little touches can make or break a game, and Baten Kaitos has some great ones. For one, all the Magnus are cool to look at and a blast to collect. I found myself giggling with delight every time I found a new weapon or shield. Sure, most RPGs have equipment options, but since this game gives you an entire deck to fill, you'll be finding new loot much more often.There are lots of sidequests to perform, ranging from short errands to game-spanning searches. Each one gives you good rewards, though; you never feel as if your time was wasted.Finally, there's the fact that this game certainly gives you your money's worth: I played for a whopping 65 hours! Much longer than most modern RPGs, and definitely longer than games of other genres (what do they expect you to DO in action games--play the measly 10-hour campaigns, and then play endlessly repetitive multiplayer for the rest of the time!?).Now, the above reasons should be enough to convince you to buy this game. I have already wasted too much of your potential playtime by writing such a long review--the only way you can compensate is to play it immediately!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2005"}
{"product_name":"B003VJNPPE","description":"In BriefThe second instalment in the RPG saga about the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia, features a thoroughly engrossing, mature storyline defining new standards for thought-provoking, non-linear game narration. In addition to an epic story, the game features an original, brutal combat system that uniquely combines tactical elements with dynamic action. A new, modern game engine, responsible both for beautiful visuals and sophisticated game mechanics puts players in the most lively and believable world ever created in an RPG game. A captivating story, dynamic combat system, beautiful graphics, and everything else that made the original Witcher such a great game are now executed in a much more advanced and sophisticated way.DEVELOPER: CD Projekt REDBrief Story DescriptionAfter helping to stop the rebellion undertaken by the Order of the Flaming Rose and saving King Foltest&rsquo;s life, Geralt became one of the central figures of political turmoil in the Kingdom of Temeria. Geralt continues to protect the King in the monarch&rsquo;s mission to bring peace to his state. The last bastions of the Order yielded to the royal army. The only remaining task is to pacify the rebellious castle of Baroness La Valette, who announced separation from the Kingdom. It&rsquo;s been a month since the attempted assassination of the king, when his army arrives at the gates of Baroness La Valette&rsquo;s fortress in preparation for the final battle. In the meantime, Geralt, stuck with Foltest, cannot begin his personal quest - to discover the origin and identity of the mysterious witcher-like assassin responsible for the attempt on the king&rsquo;s life - a quest that would answer many questions...Key FeaturesA truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative events are dependent on the player&rsquo;s choices and lead to multiple different game endings and several additional plot forks. This time gameplay time will be shorter than The Witcher 1, but more intense and packed with events.A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter seldom seen in other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and attractive to contemporary gamers. We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt&rsquo;s personal theme, in which he&rsquo;s looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to play.Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski&rsquo;s book series and The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues sequences, thanks to a new game engine.New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in which we observe the link between our past choices with current actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.Sex and eroticism will be introduced in a much more realistic, involving and mature way, thanks to which sexual relationships are presented more credibly than in TW1.Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide an incredible, believable story-driven experience.Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further actions in the game.Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine create a cohesive, fully accessible world!Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a wider range of new tactical options.

Due to the fact that this is a direct sequel to the first game and it plays very similarly, I'm going to be making comparisons between the two.  Now, since that's all out of the way, here're some things you should know.  This is a point n' click adventure game (not an accurate simulation of being a lawyer, thank goodness).  As per the genre conventions, it is text-heavy, gameplay is repetitive and non-action oriented, and story and characters take precedence over puzzles (of which there really aren't any).  If any of these things make you unhappy, then I would avoid this game.  Also, it's a good idea to play the first Phoenix Wright game before this one, or you will be missing a lot of references.Graphics (score 9/10): The graphics are exactly the same as they were in the first game.  PW features mostly anime-inspired character-portraits on static background environments.  The character portraits do change position and facial expressions, so it isn't entirely static, especially during the court sequences.  This sort of graphical style is acceptable in this genre (and pretty good for its purposes, in my opinion).  Everything is crisp, clear and looks good, so no complaints from me.Music (score 10/10): The music here is just as good as the music from the original PW, in fact, much of it is very similar.  As such, it merits the same score in music I gave the first PW.  However, if you've played the first game and then immediately play this one, it may sound stale and re-used to you.  The music scores are pretty good in and of themselves, though.  Plus, they keep it from getting too dull since each location and character has their own theme, plus music often changes dynamically based of what's going on onscreen.  For example, the music might change from a character's normal theme to something melancholy if they start talking about something sad.Characters (score 10/10): The characters are the highlight of this series, and they don't disappoint at all.  Our plucky lawyer protagonist Phoenix Wright and his sidekick Maya make a return, of course, along with several characters from the previous PW game such as Detective Gumshoe, Winston Payne, and Wendy Oldbag.  Several new characters are introduced as well, the most important probably being Franziska Von Karma (she looks a bit like a German dominatrix with a whip).  If you haven't guessed it by now, the character designs are quite quirky.  Despite being humorous, there is actually a lot of good subtlety to their personality and decent character development for the main characters; none of them feel one-dimensional at all.Story (score 10/10):  Well, you've probably figured this out by now, but you play as Phoenix Wright and you solve cases and defend your clients in court cases.  There are four cases in total, and each one involves its own little storyline, but they really need to be played in order since they form a cohesive continuous narrative.  The storyline is excellent and I'm quite pleased overall.  Much of it is quite humorous, but an equal amount is very serious, lending itself to a nice balance.  Unfortunately, in order to help ease new players into the game, they decide to use the old \"amnesia\" plot device for the first case.  Oh, so that's why Phoenix doesn't know how to do anything (thus necessitating a tutorial), he has amnesia; of course!  All joking aside though, I can forgive them for using the old \"amnesia\" clich&eacute; since the rest of the game is so very well put together story-wise.  Objectively, the storyline is excellent, but I found it to be a little less gripping than the original PW, if for only one reason: Miles Edgeworth.  He is a very compelling and interesting character from the original PW and I started to feel impatient with what was happening in the here and now of the current case since I badly wanted to know what had happened to him.  This is especially apparent during Case 3, which just ends up feeling like a giant cock-tease for the appearance of Miles Edgeworth.  If you are a big fan of his character (like me), this can start to drive you nuts.  Of course, this \"weakness\" is also the story's strength--it keeps you playing till the very end (and don't worry, he plays a big role in Case 4).  Obviously, my complaints won't mean a thing to you if you've never played the original game or if you have no interest in his character.  In fact, if you aren't a huge fan of his character like I am, you won't be distracted from the fact that all the cases are interesting and extremely well-written (yes, even Case 3).  The awesomeness that is Miles Edgeworth aside, though, the story is quite good and fully deserves the 10/10 score I've given it; you'll likely become very emotionally invested in the story like I did.Gameplay (score 8/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Well, you should have gotten this from the introduction, but this game is a point n' click adventure game, and basically has that sort of gameplay.  It's just reading text and choosing options.  If you don't like that sort of thing or don't have much patience, then you should avoid this game.  The gameplay here is almost exactly the same as the original.  You basically have portions of the game where you investigate by collecting evidence and talking to witnesses at the crime scene.  The other half of the game is spent in the courtroom cross-examining witness testimonies and looking for inconsistencies with the evidence or within the statements themselves.  There's a life bar, and if you screw up too much, you get a game over and have to start over again from your last save.  Thankfully, you can pretty much save at any point in time, so that should help prevent too much repetition.  There are really only two differences between this game and the original: 1) the new Psych-Lock system and 2) the ramped-up difficulty.  Firstly, the psych-lock system basically allows Phoenix to see (via magic) when a person is lying to him (although sadly he never uses this in court, only in the investigation phase).  The person who's lying has to be shown key pieces of evidence to get them to tell the truth, and there's a life bar just like in court that depletes if you get things wrong.  If you do drain your bar, you're forced to start your Psych-Lock over again from the beginning (which is kinda pointless since it's pretty short).  The difficulty with this new feature comes from the fact that you can initiate a psych-lock even if you don't have the proper pieces of evidence.  This leads to a lot of floundering in confusion as you get almost all the way through a psych-lock only to realize that you must be missing a key piece of evidence to finish the thing.  Aside from that though, the court-room portion has been ramped up in difficulty, particularly in Case 3 and Case 4.  The penalties become especially steep; in some parts you can actually lose your entire bar in one fell mistake.  Not to mention, some of the leaps in logic they expect you to make in order to solve the case become quite ludicrous.  On that note, I hated cross-examining Moe the Clown for this reason.  It also feels like you flounder directionless more than the previous PW in the investigation phase as well.  Overall, the gameplay is just a bit more frustrating this time around as compared with the original which flowed beautifully while still making you feel like a deductive genius.  I broke down a lot in the third and fourth cases and had to look up hints in an FAQ online.  I just hope the third sequel (Trials and Tribulations, which I haven't played yet at the time of writing this) goes back to being less brutal in the difficulty department.Overall (score 9/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  Despite the fact that the gameplay got a bit more frustrating about halfway through, Phoenix Wright: Justice for All is still an excellent game and is a solid sequel to the original.  The most important new character introduced, Franziska, is a strong addition to the cast and I hope to see more of her in the future.  Overall, I highly recommend that you get this game if you enjoyed the original.  In fact, I went out and bought all of them in the series to date.  If that doesn't give you an indication of how much I enjoyed the first PW (and this one), then nothing will.  I know the original games of the series can be quite pricey now, but it's totally worth adding to your gaming library, at least to me it was.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2010"}

This time round, he's no longer a rookie defense attorney. Instead, having achieved some seemingly impossible victories in the courtroom last time round, he's now quite a celebrity. Which is why, when a policewoman is charged with murdering his fianc&eacute;, she turns to Wright for help. Unfortunately, just before the trial, he was attacked by an unknown assailant. He wakes up with amnesia, and is then pushed straight into court to fight the case. An impossible case again, perhaps? Not exactly, because by examining every piece of evidence, pressing every statement from the witnesses, and pinpointing every contradiction that are present, the ace attorney has return to yet another famous victory.The above basically sums up Phoenix Wright's premise. Justice for All, which begins soon after the end of last season's sleeper hit, employs primarily the same gameplay features from its predecessor. The game is still divided into two parts - investigation and trial. During investigation, you will still go from place to place, talk to NPCs, and gather clues. During trial, you will still press witnesses, present evidence and, more often than not, bluff your way through. Nothing really changes here when it comes to the basic nature of the gameplay.Capcom does attempt to make things a little more varied though with the new, but rather tedious \"Psyche-Lock\" system. This time round, secrets that are guarded by NPCs (even your allies) are typified by on-screen locks. These prevent important conversations from happening. You will need to gather enough information before you can unlock these Psyche-Locks. A wrong deduction will expectedly lead to loss in health, even during the investigation stages. This is a change from the previous game, in which you could only get \"hurt\" in court. The system is not exactly bad, since it does make the game more challenging. But it also slows the game down, and adds more backtracking efforts to a game that is already filled with various backtracking requirements.To complement the Psyche-Lock system, your health in Justice for All is also changed from the \"Five-Exclamation Marks\" bar to a more conventional health bar - something that you usually see in most action adventure games. Now, this is definitely a good move, even though the exclamation marks present more uniqueness. The good thing with this new health bar is that damage taken is varied. Some mistakes will hit you minimally; while others may totally wipe out your health (beware!). On top of that, you can also recover loss health by successfully unlocking a Psyche-Lock. Ah, now you know why I said that it complements the Psyche-Lock.The fun in Phoenix Wright is not restricted to the gameplay, of course. Interactions with quirky characters are part and parcel of the investigation and court proceedings. In this instalment, you will take on clowns, magicians, and even a radio transceiver. Many of these encounters provide great comic relief. Especially the one with the clown, but I will leave that to you to find out. The game also features returning casts from the previous game - those interested in the Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth sub-plot will be happy to know that he has a major role to play in the intense finale of the game.On the topic of intensity, you may also want to know that Justice for All has a much more compelling story than its predecessor. Even though it doesn't have a bonus case like the last game, the cases are generally longer here, which more or less compensate for the absence. Murderers are also smarter, more ruthless, and will continue to frustrate you through well-constructed lies. These generate a great sense of competitive tension - if you're the emotional type, you may find yourself totally immersed into the game's universe. The final case, in particular, will test your resilience as well as your conscience. The only gripe is that some parts of the game are a little too draggy. It's almost as if these moments are lengthened just for the sake of lengthening the game.Justice for All doesn't provide any breakthrough when it comes to presentation. The graphics remain typical anime fare, and some sprites are reused from the previous game. Nevertheless, you will still find them charming, simply because of the various expressions on the characters. Each character has a fixed set of expressions, and many of them are simply hilarious if you spend time observing them. We particularly like the one with a flying puppet's head, so be sure to check that out when you play the game. Sound wise, some scores from the last game are used again, especially the ones played during court. As usual, they provide a sense of excitement, and sound really sweet when you're on the verge of victory. Some of the new scores are a little disappointing though, as they sound bland and uninteresting.In conclusion, Justice for All is another great entry in the Phoenix Wright series. It doesn't rock too much of a steady boat, and prefers to focus on its strength of delivering a deep and compelling murder mystery. Fans of the adventure genre would better gear themselves up for another round of sleepless nights as they engage to solve these murders. As for those who haven't played the previous game, I'd suggest picking that up first to fully appreciate the story in this one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2007"}

It is very true to what UFC is about.  You must train, learn a moveset and get very good with it, and most of all, be patient when fighting - pick the right time to go in for the KO.  This game is not very easy.  Sure you may win 4 or 5 fights in a row - particularly when you're just starting off with low-level opponents.  However, should you get cocky you'll soon be face-down on the canvas.  You really can win or lose at any time in any fight in this game.  One wrong move at the wrong time and you could end up on your back getting pummeled or find yourself in an unescapable arm bar.  That's what I think makes this game so good.  You can't simply build a dominant fighter and just dominate everyone.  I mean, if you get good enough you will certainly win your fair share of contests.  However, there is always that chance that you can be KO'd as well.  This adds to the eexcitement level in my opinion.  This game isn't for everyone, though.  There is a fairly steep learning curve relative to the complete moveset.  There are a LOT of moves.  It's not just punches and kicks - we're talking sweeps, takedowns, posturing, recovering, blocking, submissions...there is SO much to absorb in the beginning.  I played through the tutorial three times before the majority of it sank in.  This may turn some people off - particularly those who are used to games like Fight Night, that have 5 or 6 moves total.  True UFC fans will enjoy this game.  I know I do.PROS- Large roster of UFC fighers- Large stable of movesets- Nice player progression- Very nice graphics- Very realistic and true to UFC- Hours upon hours of entertainment valueCONS- Steep learning curve in terms of movesets- Lower level fighters tend to be easy, then all of the sudden the competition is overly difficult.

{"product_name":"B0050SWUTQ","description":"","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"Can This Sequel Be Called Dead Space? (Spoiler Free)","reviewText":"I'm a big fan of the original Dead Space and over the years since its release I've replayed the game several times. Dead Space is a true survival horror game set in the claustrophobic atmosphere of a derelict space mining vessel. The game manages to to build tension and horror in the player through a careful mix of storytelling, use of limited light and shadow, excellent sound-effects and a carefully controlled use of \"necromorphs\" the series' antagonists. Dead Space 3 eschews that formula to the furthest extent possible and the result is a game that is almost completely different with the exception of name alone. Whether or not Dead Space 3 is a 'good' game or not is a subjective exercise. But it can be compared unfavorably to its predecessor.--------------------Storyline:In the original Dead Space, Issac, your character and the series' main protagonist is mostly silent. You rarely see Issace without the signature DS helmet on and communication is kept to sparse exchanges via his suits built in communication device. This time around you immediately get a full treatment of Issac who is clearly suffering from the mental stress of surviving two bouts with a necromorph infested Ishimura. The game opens in Issac's rundown apartment on a moon where agents are set to retrieve Issac for a last-ditch effort to save humanity from the Marker-obsessed Unitologists (kind of a cult that thinks that humanity has to die in order to elevate to the next level or existence). Soon Issac finds himself in orbit around a planet called Tau Volantis working with his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend and team to turn off a mysterious device that they believe are responsible for the Markers and the Unitologist's efforts. I'll stop there to avoid any possible spoilers.--------------------Environment:The story and ultimately the environment involve a lot more people and a lot more set pieces. Issac goes from environments ranging from a heavily populated moon city, to orbit around Tau Volantis and then ultimately to the snowy surface of Tau Volantis and more. Part of the greatness of the original Dead Space was it's incredibly creepy, dimly lit interiors of the Isimura. That has been somewhat lost in DS3 because of the huge variety of environments and the increased lighting in these environments. There are still interior spaces that are dimly lit and crawling with enemies but the effect is not the same.--------------------Gameplay:Perhaps the most controversial area in DS3 is gameplay. The most noticeable change is the adoption of multiplayer for the entire storyline. In fact large portions chunks of the game (side-missions) are only available when playing with two players. I played through the game with a friend and found that it isn't to my liking but others may feel differently. I respect that. I will say that multiplayer takes any sort of tension, suspense, and horror right out of the game. Further, Visceral Games chose to make another major change to the game. The careful mix of pacing in the original game has been removed for favor of over the top encounters with waves of enemies. You can almost count on being swarmed over and over again at any point during DS3. Because of that the amount of drops has increased dramatically. Having to carefully allocate resources or choose flight over fight was a major factor in Dead Space. In DS3 you'll be annoyed at having to drop items in your inventory to clear room for better stuff. By the end of my first multiplayer run I had over one-hundred health items in my inventory. Ammo is another area where the game has changed. You can carry only two weapons but each weapon used the same type of ammo, again removing the inventory management aspect out of the game.--------------------Other Changes:The weapon and suit upgrade system has been scraped entirely. Nodes which were found in the environment in the first two Dead Space games are gone in favor of resources that consist of Tungsten, semi-conductors, somatic-gel, transducers, and a few other items. Each suit upgrade costs certain amounts of resources. Weapons can be upgraded by finding upgrade circuits or building your own at 'benches'. Resources are harvested from the environment, from killing enemies and from releasing little robotic harvesters that bring resources to the nearest bench. Weapons can be crafted from parts you find and from blueprints. Each weapon has an upper and lower (alt-fire) weapon that can be customized a number of ways. That's a lot to take in. Personally I didn't like the new system at all. It's complicated and the result is less satisfying than the system used in the first two games. Interestingly, there is plenty of (day one) DLC to buy up scarce resources. Connection there?... possibly.--------------------Final Thoughts:Another reviewer put it well - this is Dead Space after receiving the Michael Bay treatment. There are lots of pretty explosions, a lot of color, some sort of love story... you get the idea. Some people will love this game; certainly those that are interested in online co-op gameplay. For fans of the original games that appreciated what those games did (true survival horror) will probably not like the changes here. All told this is a game worth playing and worth your time as it does seem to wrap up the series but falls considerably short of the high mark established by the original Dead Space title.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2013"}

Team health was sweet.The story is engaging and the missions, including the side missions, are better laid out and longer this time around. That is a positive for me as it adds to game play and replay value for me. I don't feel cheated by a 6-hour game like many of these new games do. This is a longer game if you want to do all the missions and focus on building your character to a high level.I will admit to not being the largest fan of the first game. Unforuntately, my experience with the first game was hampered mostly by playing for the first time with someone who had played multiple times and led me around instead of followed me, so I didn't get the same experience as I have had playing for the first time with friends who are still on their first time through. The enemies are repetitious, but you expect that in these types of games. I am still going to new areas and don't feel cheated by the shortage of different enemy types.This game does have a good sense of adult humor. Perhaps it's not appropriate for children, but if you're the type that will buy your kids Call of Duty, than this will fall on deaf ears anyway, so whatever. The game is hilarious. Great writing and great visual experience. Highly recommended to all, if it's your type of game.

{"product_name":"B0009PETYO","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Finally","reviewText":"Back in 2003, to coincide with the release of the second and third Matrix films, a video game was created.  Enter the Matrix was a highly anticipated movie tie-in that disappointed on every single level, much like the following films in the series.  The biggest complaint from many about the game was that you didn't play as Neo; instead you played as Niobe and Ghost taking place in events surrounding the storylines of the film.  Now, Atari and Shiny have finally answered the prayers of Matrix fans, finally allowing you to play as the savior of mankind, with all his fantastic abilities at your fingertips.  You play as Neo from the beginning as you train your way to becoming \"the One\" by learning to manipulate the Matrix to your advantage.  You are directly in events taken from the film trilogy; from the subway battle to the Burly Brawl to the epic, rain soaked finale against Agent Smith, only this time it has a different ending than that of the film.  The first thing you'll notice is that the game's graphics engine isn't the most attractive one you'll see.  There had to be sacrifices made in order to inject so much into this game, and while the graphics may be jerky, they suit their purpose.  The biggest flaw of Path of Neo is the control scheme.  Basic hand to hand combat is easy enough, but when it comes to the gunplay elements the game suffers mightily.  Between unholstering your weapon, aiming it, and moving around at the same time, you'll be giving your fingers cramps.  This is the biggest drawback of the game and it will turn off plenty, but the ability to pull off some insane combos which can be unlocked throughout make the gameplay rewarding.  Laurence Fishburne is the only cast member from the films to lend his voice to the game, while the likenesses and sound alike voices of Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and the rest of the cast are here.

When I first heard of it at E3, I was so happy that a Final Fantasy game was coming to a Nintendo system. I preordered it on Amazon and was so excited to play the game four days after the release date. Overall, the game is a lot of fun and the new battle system is great. However, the game doesn't provide an in-game tutorial, so you had to learn how to play by reading the manual, which most people don't read, or by making mistakes and learning from them. I am a quick learner, so after several deaths and realizing that I was going the wrong way and over leveled my first character, I went right back on track.The art style of the game is not as serious as other Final Fantasy games. All of the characters are chibis except for the four heroes on the box art and the instructions manual. Personally, I like chibis.The battle system is pretty simple to use, but I don't like the fact that you can't recharge your battle points outside of the battle except near an inn. I could use a heal spell outside of battle, but I can't use it too much since our battle points don't recharge. Battle points is basically the mana of this game. You gain one battle point if you run out in battle, and you can gain more by skipping your turn.Classes in this game is called crowns. You start off with only one and you slowly unlock more. You can change them at any time outside of battle and you can upgrade them with gems. Gems are collected while battling and they can be sold for a lot. Selling them is the best way of making money.It is very easy to get \"stuck\" in the game. If you want to avoid spoilers, skip this paragraph. After beating the witch, which took several tries, I watched the opening credits and was teleported outside of the witch's castle. When I went back to the main character's village, everybody was turned into stone. There were people who resembled inspectors everywhere inspecting the scene. I went to the castle, talked to the inspector in the throne room, and two characters left my party: Jusqua and Aire. For the past two hours, I have been walking in circles, talking to everybody, and exploring the world map only to not advance in the story at all. I'm still stuck right now, and it's getting very annoying. The two characters that I do have right now is probably way over leveled.The story in the game is pretty good so far, but as I said above, I'm stuck in an early part of the game, so I don't have the right to judge the entire story line yet. Considering this game is by Square Enix, however, I think the story line will turn out to be very good.In the end, this game is a lot of fun to play, and I highly recommend it. If anybody is nice enough to help me at where I am stuck, feel free to comment.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2010"}

Play as Crypto, an alien warrior sent to Earth to clear the way for the Furon invasion force","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Great Spoof for Older Gamers","reviewText":"Destroy All Humans is a great adventure game with you as the grey-skinned, big-eyed alien out to destroy / conquer human-kind. The humor is great!The basic concept is a campy spoof on all 50s alien movies. You are wandering around a traditional 50s landscape with drive-ins, town centers, and town fairs. You have a variety of cool alien powers that assist you in your take-over attempts, flying your saucer around from spot to spot.This game is marked for teens, and that's true both from a \"violence\" standpoint and a simple enjoyment standpoint. Many of the in-jokes are going to go right over the heads of younger players, who will only understand the game as a simple shooter. For example, reading the minds of the various townsfolk will have adults laughing for hours, while younger kids will be going \"Huh?\"On the violence side, the \"blood\" is green, but it's still pretty nasty. You are ripping brains and spinal cords out of creatures, blowing things up, and being generally destructive. There are a number of references to sexual acts, since many in the 50s felt that aliens were only out to rape females and to perform \"unnatural\" acts on males. This definitely is a game geared towards older teens and adults.It's really funny to see all of the old stereotypes - about aliens and cows, aliens and politicians, etc. - played out in real time. The graphics are rather good in supporting these scenarios, and the sounds fit in as well. But the real fun is in the plot and dialogue.Yes, the basic game is rather short - it's not going to last you months like the FF or GTA series. On the other hand, this game isn't meant to be epic. It's meant to be a really funny spoof for older gamers, and it fits this niche extremely well!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2005"}
{"product_name":"B0065NP39E","description":"","reviewerName":"NeuroSplicer","summary":"WHAT DIES IN VEGAS, STAYS IN VEGAS","reviewText":"The previous installment of the Fallout series,FALLOUT-3, was an excellent open-world Role-Playing Shooter (RPS). Although it suffered a far from...happy ending and most of the DLCs offered little more than even more loot and a handful of unique items, it was a game I greatly enjoyed for hours at no end and was more than happy to replay it only to follow different paths every time the story bifurcated. I for one was sure left craving for more and the Obsidian/Bethesda people were more than happy to deliver. Even so, true to Vegas mentality, they seem to have let their winnings ride...The first thing that hits you in the Mojave desert is how...familiar this new world looks like. The graphics, which were excellent two years ago, are still very good - but they are no longer cutting edge. Besides some richer shadowing and somewhat more vivid colors, if there are any major graphical improvements since FALLOUT-3 I failed to notice them. Having said that, I must admit that I loved the desert skies, especially during sunrises and sunsets!Although both the story and the location are different from FALLOUT-3, I was happy to meet old friends: the handy PIPBOY-3000, the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skill system and the V.A.T.S. targeting aid. The gameplay seems to fit like a favorite old pair of jeans.Character development has both acquired more depth (with the return of Traits which offer advantages but at a price) but also made easier. There are new guns and more explosive kill-shot sequences as well as more skills and perks but I felt far less pressure to complete quests to gain experience points and translate them into perks, skills and traits as the game is generous in offering different ways to accomplish this.Notably, with all the conflicting groups and factions angling for an edge in controlling New Vegas, the story seems more byzantine than FALLOUT-3 and the choices one has to make now cut deeper. Note also that this is a longer game than FALLOUT-3.Now some bad news. Whereas FALLOUT 3 had a simple disk-check, FALLOUT:NEW VEGAS comes with mandatory OnLine STEAM registration and activation. If you are wondering, the game lost its fifth star neither because of its somewhat dated graphics, nor its numerous bugs or occasional crash but rather its anti-customer DRM scheme. (That was a serious misstep BETHESDA, I was disappointed). Having to activate your game OnLine means that you never actually own the game you paid for at full price. Just try to sell or gift your original version in order to replace it with the Ultimate edition and see what happens. If this does not concern you, well, you can now make an informed decision either way.This ULTIMATE EDITION includes all of the DLCs, namely DEAD MONEY, HONEST HEARTS, OLD WORLD BLUES, LONESOME ROAD, GUNRUNNER's ARSENAL and COURIER's STASH (consisting of the CARAVAN, CLASSIC, MERCENARY & TRIBAL Packs).I almost never buy individual DLCs. If I like a game enough, I wait for such an Ultimate or GOTY edition to pick them all up at a reasonable price. And here lies the irony: the game requires STEAM anyway - and yet it was available at a much lower price on STEAM some months ago. I would advise waiting for the price to drop again.RECOMMENDED.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2012"}

Discover the true origins of Dracula and the Belmont family in this exciting first episode of the saga.","reviewerName":"K. Ostrowski \"bra1n1ac\"","summary":"A 3D Castlevania worth playing?","reviewText":"Well, when we look at this game, we are faced with the origin story of Leon, first and most vile (apparently) Belmont, and how he began his struggle against all monsters. He enters a castle in an attempt to rescue his beloved Sara.This game sports killer graphics, nice animations and awesome renditions of some classic Castlevania enemies.But it's not for Castlevania fans like me. Let me tell you why.First, the sound. I have precious few problems here. The music wasn't up to the level of Symphony of the Night, but it was pretty good. The voices, in turn, were actually done quite well considering what they were asked to say (see story presentation.)Secondly the graphics, from a technical standpoint, were really quite good, and the characters and monsters well-represented in appearance, but I had a few problems. First off, the cutscenes. When the cutscenes in the game were in effect, the characters would frequently sway back and forth or jerk around as if they were bored, and many of those body motions were quite uncalled-for. Secondly, the whip. In mid-game, you use a whip to &quot;swing&quot; from place to place and to attack monsters, but unlike a real whip, no skill is required to twirl it around or aim it at your enemies. You just thrust it forward like a sword. As for the whip-swinging, all you do is smack the whip against a pole and watch yourself get vaulted over it, like you're using an iron pole instead of a whip. Whip-swinging should look like web-swinging. The whip was handled better in &quot;Circle of the Moon.&quot; Third, the environments. I'm sorry, folks, I really am, but the environments were ugly and confined. When one plays a game like Symphony of the Night, one finds oneself in vast, glorious halls dressed in a fancy style, and well-lit for the most part. This game just had a bunch of dark hallways no more than a dozen feel in any direction, and the few large rooms you do visit don't feel glorious at all.My last problem with the graphics was that this game uses a static and rigid camera and although it's often a cooperative one, sometimes you'll get to an area and say &quot;Gee, I wish I could see above me, or below me, or off to the side.&quot; That got truly annoying after a while.Now, Story Concept. Well, it's a fairly interesting story about Leon Belmont, the first of the Belmont Clan to fight monsters. The story was, even in concept, destined to be a poor one, however, since the series' central draw (for me,) Count Vlad Tepes Dracula is missing from the game entirely.Story Presentation, however, REALLY drags it down. The scriptwriting (or was it the translating?) was truly bad and just felt lame, cheesy and depressing. Leon uses a whip made from Alchemy, and no distinction is ever drawn between that alchemy and the one used by the vampires. Leon does not even strike me as being that good of a person, except in his description in the game intro before you meet him. In all the other games, a Belmont or someone else would enter the castle of Dracula (known as Castlevania) and slay him. In this one, Leon enters a Castle that is plainly NOT Castlevania, and slays several creatures that are plainly NOT Dracula, with weapons that are NOT plainly good. In past games, the Belmonts are always drawn up as good and holy men who always try to do what is best. Leon seems like more of a grief-crazed fanatic.The gameplay itself doesn't even compensate. Gone is the experience engine of the past several games that made them more fun than most RPGs. Gone are the vast numbers of common and rare items that made SOTN and the GBA games such a hoot, and what has been added in their place is a bunch of switch-pushing puzzles, and maze-exploring.I don't know why Konami thought this would be good. Instead of a righteous warrior, fighting evil beasts for the good of all, we are given a depressed, revenge-driven person who crawls through dark tunnels after the next big treasure like a mole or packrat, without the star-talent of the series' main villain as backup. I only rented this game, but I have already beaten it with all secrets (except the playthroughs in different modes.)Is this 3D Castlevania game worth playing? Yes it is. But not more than once, and I wouldn't say it's worth buying. Frankly, I thought Circle of the Moon was better. I do think Konami could make a truly good 3D Castlevania, but this whole game felt like it shrunk in the wash. Considering how much this game lost in the 3D translation, I'd just as soon they stay 2D in the future, unless they can manage to do it right next time.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2004"}

Gameplay is great, and with the ability to lift, throw, use abilities, level different classes, and completely setup your own party, you'll have plenty to work with.The visuals are dated, and definitely don't take advantage of the PS3's hardware.

However, the game does have great presentation in both its UI and layout design.The story is absolutely terrible and annoying. It tries to be funny, but seems like it is trying way too hard. The voice acting doesn't help either, as each character seems to be voiced by a young teenager.Tutorials are limited, so you will spend much of your time confused, and will very likely end up referring to the internet where you will find very little information.

Perhaps it was due to the relentlessly BAD games that were spawned from television shows.  Well, I am happy to report that I was actually surprised.  24:The Game does in fact follow closely to the show and you could actually believe that it was a lost episode.  The game is designed with many of the details that fans will surely recognize; the camera work, the split screens, the dialogue, the fact that Kim got kidnapped AGAIN, etc.  Voice acting is top shelf, with most of the actual actors on-board.  The game also has decent graphics (the characters actually resemble the actors for the most part) and exceptional sound effects. The game is easy to pick up and play without tedious explanations and training demos.  In fact, the game kind of just drops you into the story and away you go.The bulk of the game is dedicated to missions; some that require stealth and others where you can just blast anyone in your way.  There are also several driving missions that operate in the way of any of the GTA games.  Puzzles are usually tossed into the mix, most are easy to solve but some can be a bit frustrating.  Thankfully, the game typically auto-saves after you complete part of the mission objective so you don't have to replay the levels from the beginning, thus reducing the frustration associated with similar games.  Many of the missions are timed so it is often difficult to explore the surrounding area but to be honest, there isn't much to find.  Each mission is wrapped up with your stats and believe me, it isn't always easy to get a high score.  If you manage to accomplish this, you will accumulate various unlockables which are usually videos and character animation (not real sure what that was all about) but they aren't required to enjoy the actual game play.Load times are decent and there is virtually no lag as your character moves from one area to another.  The game is fast-paced and you will play not only as Jack Bauer but as tech support, other CTU members and even the bad guys on occasion.  Overall, a good game that holds your interest and also holds true to the show.  Replay value is fairly decent as the game is relatively long and to improve your overall ratings to obtain unlockables.  If you are a fan of the GTA games, The Godfather, Scarface, etc., then this will be right up your alley.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2007"}

Usually when something drops to $15 that fast its not worth the time to pick it up unless you really want to play it.  Enslaved suprised me at how good it really was.Its not going to wow most people seeing how it is a Button masher, and some of the combat can get very repetitive.  But the story is where the game shines and makes you move forward button mashing, swinging and climbing all the way to the ending.Graphics look great.  Alot of detail used in the facial animations.  You might recognize the voice of the fat guy (Scott Shelby) from Heavy rain who plays Monkey.  From the bosses to the backgrounds the game looks gorgeous.  Top notch.Story is the best part.  You rarely come across a great story anywhere be it movies or sadly in videogames but Enslaved actually pulled the story off very well.  Basically you are caught by Slavers who want to Enslave you to do their work etc.  When Trip (the female) breaks you (Monkey) free unintentionally and as you try to escape you meet up with trip who has highjacked one of the slavers headbands used in controlling the slaves to force you to help her get home since she can't do it on her own.  Pretty much if she dies you die.Gameplay is probably the weakest part of the game.  You have the climbing, leaping sections similar to Uncharted and the typical button mash then grab said enemy for a finishing move similar to almost every other God of War clone game to date.  But because the combat is so standard doesn't mean its without any fun to it.  You have some cover sections where you use trip as a distraction to get closer to enemies so you can beat their heads in and also the opposite, you can draw attention away from her when shes being targeted by fire.Replay value all depends on if your a trophy hunter or not.  I for one am somewhat of a trophy fiend but i shyed away from this platinum because of the tedious collecting X trophies.  While some of the other trophies are fun to get, some of the others seem way too time consuming to bother with.  Twice through was about enough for me then i moved on.  At $15 that's pretty good value.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0016PZYLS","reviewerName":"Trell","summary":"O........NO!","reviewText":"I only have one complaint about the ps3 version of this game. The O button doesn't work! That's the inventory button for crying out loud! Makes it unplayable almost if it wasn't for the ability to change the buttons around but i don't like having to do that because i've got this on 360 and the button layout is the same and having to change it around for the ps3 version is a pain and makes it hard to pick up and play. The O button cut in and out when it wanted to but then it just completely stopped being responsive and it's not my controller because i'm using brand new controllers that i only had for a few weeks. The game itself is 5 stars for me but i was really looking forward to enjoying this game on the ps3. I paid about 27 for it even though it should be 20 bucks and under for being the greatest hits version but that's how much love i got for this game. I doubt a patch will be out for it because it's an older title that not many people play. So the 3 stars is for the O button being unresponsive and not for the game or the gameplay itself. Just warning potential buyers.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2013"}

Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced.

As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game.

On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games as they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

{"product_name":"B0028ZNX68","summary":"My Disappointment Knows No Bounds","reviewText":"I was SO excited to be able to review the review sample version of DJ Hero.  This version came with a wired controller and three playable mixes (one set), along with the tutorial.  I was excited about the musical artists who would appear: Black Eyed Peas, Gwen Stefani, Gorrilaz, Benny Benassi and Rick James to name a few.  I like this kind of music just as much if not more than I like the rock music that appears in similar music games.  The game can even be played along with a Guitar Hero guitar controller, mixing DJing with guitar.  I believe that is the only way that two players can jointly play.  At any rate, as someone who enjoys electronic music and has been to a few clubs in her day, I thought it would be great fun.Grandmaster Flash led the tutorial and while he was great, the tutorial was not.  It was a little unclear how the skills we were learning related to real DJing.  Why is that?  Well, I bet most of us know very little about real DJing.  I used to actually DJ (college radio and goth clubs) and never touched on any of this stuff besides cross-fading.Playing the game consists of Taps, Cross-fades, Scratching, and effects.  Effects and Scratching are fun.  Much like Rock Band or Guitar Hero, the screen indicates what to do when the notes scroll into the hit zone - in this case, it's not notes but scratches, taps, effects.  You use two hands to control the taps on the tracks, the crossfades between them, and blowing off sound effects from your sampler.  The game doesn't really allow you to be creative, which is one of my complaints.  A cool feature would have been to allow the player to make his/her own mixes out of the two songs, rather than rigidly requiring you to hit buttons.  The most creativity you get is WHICH sound effect to play when the it's time to mash the sampler button.  All the mixes are pre-determined as well - you do not choose which songs to mix together; the makers of DJ Hero have done that for you - for better or for worse.It isn't so different from its predecessors, so why does it fail to rock? It really lacks the visceral feeling of picking up a guitar and playing it. Also, I think most of us grew up seeing Rock Gods on MTV.  We understand how the guitar is played and we see the Rock God (or Goddess, as the case may be) rocking out on the stage.  DJs are unsung heroes, often behind the scenes.  We boogie down to what they play - but do we understand how they do it?  Real life DJing may actually be easier than trying to keep up with this game.  It is certainly challenging, this game, but it is not fun.  In fact, it is rather boring.  I wanted to quit 1 minute into the first mix, but made it through all three demo mixes in order to do this review.  It didn't get any more fun.  And I'm not just saying that because it was hard -  once I got the hang of the controls, it was still immensely boring.  Although I love electronica, hip hop and techno - I'd rather play a guitar-based game any day.One problem I had with it was the lack of feeling connected to the music.  In Rock Band, Guitar Hero and even Karaoke Revolution, you could listen to the background music and get into the rhythm and know when you'd hit the next key or sing along.  In this game, you don't know what the predetermined mixes will choose to do, how they'll choose to mess with the songs.  So you are at the mercy of your visual senses.  I think people enjoyed the other games because they really felt like they were making the music, they felt musically connected.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2009"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J5UQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Felllix","summary":"Does so much wrong that it's amazing it's as good as it is","reviewText":"LA Noire is such a strange and original game that it's a shame so much of it goes wrong. I kept playing the game and wanting to like it more than I actually was, which is encouraging and disappointing all at once.LA Noire was clearly a labor of love by its developers. The game is built around motion-capture technology, which allows facial animations to mimic human beings with an alarming clarity. The technical credits at the end of the game are staggering, and the technology is pretty impressive. Unfortunately, This means that the rest of the game has a pretty standard and uninteresting look to it. I've been wondering lately if the pretense of realism is enough for games to not stylize themselves a little more. Nowadays everything looks real enough, but we're getting more and more games that look real but don't look interesting. This beef has less to do with LA Noire and more to do with games in general, but I digress.The core gameplay of LA Noire consists primarily of 3 things: searching, talking, and driving. You'll start most missions by driving to a crime scene (or arriving at one), searching it for evidence, and then talking to witnesses or suspects. The searching starts out very easy and gradually gets harder, making clues tougher to see and the layouts of crime scenes more complex. The game's approach is a bit scattershot in this regard; you can look at a lot of things, but not everything, at a crime scene, but only certain things are relevant. What the game doesn't tell you is that you need most of the relevant stuff in order to cross the scene off your list and continue the game. This came to a head when I had to interview someone at a crime scene, go to another crime scene, then realize that I had to backtrack to the first scene in order to find one last clue that triggered one last question.What's strangest about LA Noire is that I could never quite pin down how much game it contains. It took me around 19 hours to complete, which is respectable, but the entirety of it is spent doing exactly what the game tells you to. Go here, search, go here, talk to someone, go here, accuse a criminal. Yes, there are side missions dealing with street crime, but once I found out that there was no real benefit to doing this (aside from completion), I stopped caring about them. This is compounded by the fact that LA feels pretty small, which may be the time period (I have no earthly idea how large LA was in the 40's), but is more likely a nod to the open-worldedness of other Rockstar Games. The game really didn't need an open world at all, since there's only one mission where you're scouring the city for anything at all instead of just going from point A to point B to point C.Furthermore, the interview aspect of the game has some real issues. Whenever you're interviewing a suspect or witness, you take a statement, then have 3 options- truth, doubt, or lie. While this sounds straightforward, it's surprising how many different things \"truth\" can mean. There were times that I assumed that this meant I was trusting the statement made, but when I selected it, my character seemed to be doubting it as much as anything. Another time, it seemed clear that the suspect was lying given what I knew about the case, but the evidence I had only sort of proved it. When I chose \"doubt,\" in these situations, it was usually wrong. There was more than once case where a given piece of evidence did contradict the interviewee's statement, but the game wouldn't accept it because it wasn't on the pre-programmed route. I would have preferred a little more information about what was going to be said by me when I chose a given option.One would expect that this kind of setup would lead to a conversation-branching, multi-storyline narrative. Alas, it is not to be; LA Noire insists on being entirely linear, which means that it somehow makes as much sense when you're demoted even if you've made no mistakes whatsoever as when you've completely botched it. I'm a bit baffled by this, to be honest; the developers can't claim that such a game hasn't been done before at this point, so why not go a little more ambitious with the writing, and cut the driving that doesn't have you chasing a criminal? Stranger still, the narrative spends the first half of the game feeling like it's a bunch of isolated cases not adding up to anything larger, then builds to a larger conspiracy that... well, I don't want to ruin it for you. Suffice to say that the payoff here is considerable, but getting to it might try your patience beyond its breaking point. It's strange that the game turns out to have big plans after roughly 10 hours of seemingly puttering around, and I think more care could have gone into making the game more compelling early on.The technology on display for facial animations is worth mentioning, as you're attempting to find out if a given character is lying or not. This has the neat effect of actually providing an experience not possible with previous technology; LA Noire could be the first of its kind. Here's hoping on that. Another new experience is being able to recognize actors from other mediums; Detective Cole Phelps, the main character, is played by Aaron Staton, who you may know from TV's Mad Men (along with several other faces throughout the game), and, well, he's not terribly suited to play a veteran-turned-police-officer. He's a bit too wispy and slight in his delivery, but I think the bigger problem is that the character is a generic \"good cop with something to prove\" type, which doesn't lend itself to great acting. A bit more specificity would have helped him along, as well with more personal stakes in a few of the cases he has to solve (the game makes a stab at this, but it doesn't have much impact).I played through LA Noire right after starting a new job. I was basically busy all the time and had very little attention to pay to a game that would have really engaged me; it would have been too much work. For this, LA Noire fits the bill. It's sort of like that movie you see on a Saturday afternoon when nothing else is on and you've got nothing to do; it passes the time reasonably well. There's so much that's new and innovative about it that I just plain wish it were a better time. Because of all these, I can barely recommend it for the $20 price tag it's currently offered at; any more than that, and you might not feel like you've got your money's worth.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2012"}

But although it comes in a small package, this is a full-fledged game that stands on its own. With an all-new, deep story that approaches the familiar sights and sounds of the infamous Liberty City from a different perspective, an innovative control system and multiplayer options,Chinatown Warscaptures the tone and flavors of the long-runningGTAseries in unique ways that both longtime players and those coming to it for the first time will find hard to put down..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Grand Theft Auto:Chinatown WarsPlayers:Offline: 1; Online: 2Gameplay Modes:Single player; competitive &amp; coop multiplayer via Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.Kick some tail as Huang Lee.View larger.Use the DS stylus like never before.View larger.Reconquer Liberty via PDA.View larger.The Story: Left for Dead in the Worst Place in AmericaFollowing his father&rsquo;s murder, Huang Lee is given what seems a simple mission: to deliver an ancient sword to his Uncle Kenny to ensure his family retains control of the Triad gangs of Liberty City. Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement. While driving players also have access to five in-game radio stations and use of their weapons. Your PDA provides efficient management tools for your growing crime empire, including quick weapons switching, a running total of available cash, in-game e-mail and Internet access and nearly instant game saves any time. The control scheme inChinatown Warsutilizes an easy to use and comfortable to play combination of steering via the D-pad, choice of action through the face buttons and/or stylus taps and manual and automatic weapon locks and unlocks via shoulder buttons.Key Game Features:The Largest DS Game Ever- Contemporary Liberty City is a massive world complete with pedestrians, weather and traffic patterns, five different radio stations and four different sprawling boroughs to explore.Endless Gameplay- Mature storyline with over 70+ story missions; plus dozens of side quests, collectibles, contextual mini-games and the all new mission replay feature.Street Economics- Addictive drug dealing side game with 6 different drug types, 80+ drug dealers and a supply / demand driven narcotics economy.Play with Friends- Nintendo Wi-Fi mode for head-to-head and co-op multiplayer mayhem.Bragging Rights- Chat, trade guns and commodities with your friends, and compete for glory via online tournaments and leaderboards on the Rockstar Games Social Club.PDA Interface- Use the touch screen as a PDA device to set GPS waypoints, change radio stations, communicate via e-mail with in-game characters and order weapons on the Internet.Online Bragging Rights and MultiplayerCare has been taken to ensure that players can share theirChinatown Warsexperiences with friends and fellow players in different ways.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Final Kombat","reviewText":"Reportedly the final Mortal Kombat game (I'll believe that when I see it), Mortal Kombat: Armageddon rounds up every single fighter that has appeared in the past six MK games.  That's right, there's over sixty fighters present in Armageddon, which is reason enough for long time MK fighters to pick this up.  Every fighter, from fan favorites like Johnny Cage, Raiden, Kitana, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Kano, and a zombified Liu Kang, to obscure fighters like Kai, Stryker, Chameleon, Mokap, and Jarek, to old bosses like Shao Khan, Goro, Kintaro, and Motaro; all of whom are brought together to do battle and fight to take on demonic final boss Blaze.  Those who have had avid experience on Deadly Alliance and Deception will feel right at home here and be able to get right into the game, mainly because nothing has changed.  The graphics are still the same (although by now they are dated) and the gameplay is virtually the same as well.  The only real changes to the gameplay is that every fighter now only has one fighting style and a weapon based style now, instead of having two different styles and a weapon style.  Now, it's understandable that perhaps there wasn't enough room or time to implement every single fighting style into the game, but this is a bit of a disappointment.  Not to mention that the individual fatalities for each character are gone, replaced with the Kreate-A-Fatality feature, which is pretty much a method for saving space on the game disc.  This is Armageddon's most disappointing aspect, and does hurt the overall rating.  Also, for being a final boss, Blaze isn't that hard to beat.  Sometimes he can be frustrating, but he isn't that hard to put down like Shao Khan or even Onaga (who is also here) before him.  Konquest Mode is back, and it's better than ever here, having become a full fledged third person adventure.  The Krypt is back as well, and finally only runs on one Kurency to unlock extras, and the online features are back as well and just as good as they were on Deception.  There's also a new mode called Motor Kombat, which is basically a bloody version of Mario Kart with Raiden, Cage, Baraka, Kitana, Mileena, Baraka, Cyrax, Jax, Scorpion, and Sub-Zero racing each other, with mixed results.  All in all, despite the negative press that this game has received, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon is still a fun fighter that delivers the goods, and is a fitting send-off for the long running and influential series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2006"}

Furthermore, the home console version will deliver additional content including a terrifying new enemy, extra difficulty mode and improvements to Raid Mode such as new weapons, skill sets and the opportunity to play as Hunk and other characters from the series. Raid Mode, which was first introduced to the series in the original version of Resident Evil Revelations, sees gamers play online in co-op mode or alone in single player taking on the hordes of enemies across a variety of missions whilst leveling up characters and earning weapon upgrades.

Resident Evil Revelations features series favorites Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield, plus their respective BSAA partners - Parker Luciani and Jessica Sherawat.  The action begins on board a supposedly abandoned cruise ship, the 'Queen Zenobia', where horrors lurk around every corner before players head for the mainland and the devastated city of Terragrigia.

The challenge is that to get to the point where you can enjoy this simplicity, you nearly become engulfed in a spaghetti monster of wires.  Granted that's how wired headsets work, but there are so many wires included it ceases to be a benefit and becomes a real pain.The sound quality and comfort are where they need to be, but the quality of materials continue a declining trend Turtle Beach has been on.  It's a bit more excusable in the $100 Ghost vs $200 Spectre, but neither hits the mark.Execution is generally solid with lengthy breakaway cords, removable mics, etc, but the mess of these same cords makes a mess of everything.

He's trapped in a dark, abandoned castle, and must navigate it and find his way out. The main gameplay is puzzle-centric, with a few features that make it stand out. The first of these is the use of light: if Daniel is not standing in the light, his sanity meter drains, eventually causing panic and hallucinations. Light can be generated in two ways: either using a tinderbox on a candle or torch, or using your lantern. Both tinderboxes and lamp oil are limited, so the player can't always be in the light.Adding to this is the presence of monsters of various shapes and types. Unlike some \"survival horror\" games, there is no way for Daniel to defeat the monsters. Instead, they must be avoided. This is most commonly done by hiding in the shadows - but the above problem presents itself, forcing the player to choose between their safety and their sanity. This adds to a sense of actually being hunted - monsters aren't just there to be easily outsmarted or defeated, they're plausible threats that the player has to deal with.The puzzles aren't anything special - they're just sort of an obstacle. They're probably the least-notable part of the game. The whole \"light and dark\" thing gets a lot more attention; puzzles are just a way to occasionally break up that mechanic. One neat thing about the game is that your character \"interacts\" with objects: he picks them up (with ghostly invisible hands) and can throw them, rotate them, and so on. Doors aren't just slammed open, the player's invisible hand grips the doorknob and pushes or pulls on it. While this is kind of a neat touch, the fact that \"Daniel\" doesn't actually have a model makes it kind of weird - you can't see your body, so it's just sort of floating in front of you.Overall, \"Amnesia: The Dark Descent\" wasn't perfect, but it had some neat ideas. It's atmospheric and it does a lot with illumination, which is something that a lot of games don't care much about. Other than its main mechanic it's kind of simplistic, and might not hold the player's attention if they get bored of \"stay out of darkness except when monsters are around\", but if you can deal with that then it's pretty good.Rating: 8/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

It can still be addicting even though I have beaten it at least 4 times, and mastered the whole thing at least twice. I think what stands out with this game are the characters. Most games just develop ordinary backrounds for characters but don't really emphasize them, but with this game, the story almost IS the characters...it basically revolves around their life, how they met, how they are related to Laguna and his friends, and stuff of that sort. I have played and beaten almost all of the Final Fantasy's (save a few of the Japanese ones and the PS2 ones), but this game really stands out and is possibly the greatest in my opinion. FF6 and FF7 are also very good, along with 4 and the first one. I just can't find a flaw here...the love story is fantastic , you will really get into Squall and Rinoas relationship together. I also think Squall is a very interesting character, as others have said, you will want to get into his mind and find out what makes him tick. When i first played this game I thought it was horrible, but I gave it another chance and it really grew on me. If you are looking for more of a Mario RPG style game, or Final Fantasy 9 style game, you will be disappointed. If you can accept an RPG with the story revolving around something some sort of love story, this is for you, but I can assure you this is not your typical Final Fantasy. The sound is also fantastic, and doesn't repeat the same tunes over and over too often like some other games (Xenogears). The graphics aren't bad either.

How can I fairly review a game  that has resided on my hard drive since the very day it was released? For  the technical minded, Half-Life (H-L) is based on a modified Quake 2  engine, but the modifications simply blow Quake away in almost every  aspect. Valve made an excellent move with this choice. It is well known in  the gaming community that Quake's engine has some of the most stable  networking code in the business. Too bad the video compatibility is a  little odd. For the gamer at heart, this game may have a . . . half life  longer than Quake itself. Valve made a good move allowing the gaming  community to have the WorldCraft level editor and other SDK software. What  this means to the average player is that a simple jaunt to a good web page,  will yield every manner of new levels, characters, and baddies to download  and install to their hearts content. And with Valve's Op-for expansion  pack, this game will take up a large amount of space on a lot of hooked  players' computers.One of the most notable modifications to Half Life is  the apparently intelligent enemies. Shoot the &quot;dogs&quot; and they'll  run for cover and regroup with their pals. Let the marines see or hear you  and they'll drop a hand grenade on your head. Ninja's don't just run into  you, they jump over your head and land behind you. Crabs pop up at the most  inconvenient times. A well designed level and a poorly designed level is  differentiated by the &quot;intelligence&quot; of the enemies. Although the  modifications are great, they are certainly predictable to an extent. Play  the game enough and you'll eventually spot patterns to the enemies  &quot;thinking&quot;.So of course, after defeating the game forward and  backwards it would be time to test the Quake engine network code. Needless  to say, a 56k modem is NOT recommended. Even though with my experience the  network game play is better than the Unreal engine, the modem does this  game sad justice. Hopping up to anything better than a 56k modem really  makes this game shine. Valve has multi-player levels packed right in with  this game, nice big areas with lots of weapons make this game a fun  &quot;frag-fest&quot;. The levels don't have that disgusting  &quot;dark&quot; feel to them. Underground levels have suitable colors and  lighting. Out door levels have an expansive feeling (although no where near  the &quot;out door&quot; feeling that Unreal does so well). Too bad that  H-L has compatibility problems with various video cards.It's really not  so much compatibility problems it's really more that valve's default  settings for the are usually not the correct settings. (The voodoo video  family suffers the worst from this.) By default the video gamma is far too  bright for the voodoo 2 card. The decals have the incorrect value. Lighting  don't appear correctly. And SLI seems to have an odd effect on the game.  Most cards have their unique set of problems, and all of these adjustments  have to be done at the command level. Not something to be done by the  average gamer.And this game screams to be played by all gamers. With  many advanced gamers using the enclosed Software Developer's Kit (SDK) and  WorldCraft to make new levels, and in some cases, completely new games.  Valve guaranteed H-L's place in the gaming community. Even if the average  player has no idea how to use the software to create new levels, they can  still go to numerous web sites and download any number of home made levels.  The  Opposing Force expansion pack and the upcoming Gunman game are direct  descendants of users and their Valve's SDK That are purchasable in the  store while hot downloads like They Hunger and D.S.S. Darkstar add free  life to the game.This leads up to the final gripe with H-L, though not a  major one. I have the Team Fortress Classic (TFC) expansion, the Opposing  Force pack and numerous &quot;user made&quot; levels and my directory  continues to grow. Currently the space taken by H-L and the various packs,  levels, and extras has reached 912 MB of space. In contrast Diablo 2 (Full  installation) is 1.10 GB, while Diablo 1 is only 10.1 MB! The game's are  growing guys and gals, so the PC requirements should be followed like a  bible.All in all I would have given more than five stars if the system  would have allowed me to do so. But I admit I had to take at least one star  away, I did this to force a point onto most people who wish to own a copy  of H-L. The game can be played right of the box but to get the full effect  of the game, you're going to need to edit the auto start and configuration  files. Voodoo 2 owners used to have the H-L Voodoo Doctor but alas, I have  not seen his web page in months. H-L really does not like the Voodoo card.  ATI Rage Fury does a little better, but you'll get a bizarre  &quot;ghost&quot; on occasion. The TNT family does the best out of the  bunch with the default values. I understand Valve is working on this issue  in H-L 2 (TFC 2?)  but we'll have to wait and see. Congrats Valve, this  game shoved Quake, Quake 2, Unreal, and Duke Nukem 3D permanently off of my  drive. I've since gotten a dual 13 GB drive configuration (26 GB total),  I've never even bothered to dust off those games. With the purchase of  Bungee software by Microsoft (Please God, Don't let Halo and Oni be X-Box  only games.) , the Multi-Player nature of Quake 3, and Duke Nukem (with the  Unreal engine) on a perpetual release date, H-L will be a tough game to  knock off the &quot;Game of the Year&quot; throne. Has H-L cursed the first  person shooter genre? Are developers afraid to knock the king out of the  ring? It may look that way.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2000"}

You're basically building an ecosystem of pinatas in the game, there are alot of tradeoffs based on your actions.You're even capable of sending items from your garden to people on your Friends list, which is a neat extra feature.To give you an idea of how fun and addictive this game is, I bought Gears of War earlier in the week (one of the best games I've played in a long time) ... and I ended up playing Viva Pinata instead of Gears over the weekend.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2006"}

Lang \"Chris L.\"","summary":"Pluses and minuses...but overall mediocre (BC2 fan's opinion)","reviewText":"I had some pretty serious concerns as this game was released...but overlooked them when my friends purchased the game.  Playing online with my friends (who live all over the country...and XBL takes the place of phone-calls and airline tickets) is one reason why I love online FPS games.This is an ambitious, but utterly flawed game.  I still play it occasionally, but serious FPS (like Bad Company 2) and even controversial titles (Brink) have knocked this out of my playlist.The good:*Battle points - It's nice to be able to \"purchase\" what would normally be called \"killstreaks\" in certain \"not-to-be-named\" series.  You can get these points just as easily from completing objectives as kills.*Campers are outdated - As I mentioned, you can get just as many points from completing objectives as you can from camping and getting kills.  One of my major issues with the Call of Duty franchise was the fact that many players (\"campers\") were incented to AVOID objectives, due to the over-reliance on killstreaks.  Thus, players with great Kill-to-Death ratios, but horrible Win-to-Loss...*Battle Commander is fun - the more deadly you are, the more advantage the opponent gets.  This has the incredibly fun effect of keeping poor players in the game, while challenging the advanced players.The bad:*Graphically, this game is ridiculous (and I wish I meant that in a good way).  It falls somewhere short of Cod4:MW1...and while that was an amazing game at the time, it's not exactly something to aspire to in 2011.*Variety - While Battle commander is great, the thrill only lasts so long.  More game modes would significantly increase the replayability of this game.*Limited unlocks/customization - There are VERY few weapons/perks to unlock.  While Bad Company 2 had the same issue to a certain degree, the ability to customize your weapons was incredibly varied.  Which leads me to the next issue...*Replayability - I just don't feel the urge to continually return to this game to unlock weapons/perks/power-ups.In short, while this game isn't great, it isn't awful either.  I could easily return to this game periodically, however I can't dedicate myself to this in the long-haul.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2011"}

I was let down by the great hype machine. And the big drop in price already should tell you people something. If your getting it for the campaign Dont Buy It..rent it instead..Single Player Campaign  is really short. (5 Hours)Controls are sluggish.Hit detection is off.Takes alot  of shots sometime in the head to get it to detect it and the enemy finally dies.You can get hung up on a little rock and the enemy can shoot you behind rock cover as well.And it is very laughable on how your character throws grenades.The story itself wasnt flawed. Just the way it was carried out within the game. Framerate slows down to where the screen studders along.Multiplayer (Updated) Finally 24 hours later was able to play the multiplayer portion.Multiplayer has potential once the server issues and glitches are fixed. But does it make up for the campaign short falls? Yes It Does.For a game that has been out 24 hours and with the server problems you still have people maxed out on rank all ready.Overall this isnt worth the $60 I paid for it. And still isnt worth the $41 they are selling it for now.Guess I am back off to Battlefield Bad Company 2.My original rating was one star. but since the multiplayer made up for some of the slack I give it 3 stars now....","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2011"}

{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"MisterMusicFan","summary":"A console with plenty of promise","reviewText":"My friends and I eagerly awaited the launch of Nintendo's Wii U in November, and were quite anxious to see what new innovations (and fun) the console would have to offer. After spending more than a solid month with my Wii U, I feel confident in my ability to assess and discuss what it brings to the table, with an understanding that it is a console still in its infancy whose limits don't seem to have been pushed just yet. This doesn't stop it from being a great new system more or less worthy of this new generation, but it does certainly come with its fair share of setbacks, some of which will hopefully be patched up in updates to come.We'll get started with the specs; the processor is an IBM Power multi-core, alongside an AMD Radeon-based High Definition GPU. That's right, at long last, Nintendo has gone full HD, meaning we'll now be able to enjoy the likes of Mario and Zelda in glorious 1080p. The games and menus look crisp and razor-sharp so long as you have a TV display that can accommodate; this was definitely a boost the previous Wii was in serious need of. All Wii U consoles come prepackaged with an HDMI cable, but if you do not own an HD-compatible television, you'll have to purchase the standard definition AVI cord separately (or use the same cord from the original Wii). The Wii U is powered by a tri-core PowerPC-based CPU, clocking in at an average 1.24 GHz (one trait in which in falls behind its previous-generation competitors, at less than half the speeds of the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3, although the Wii U does offer twice the amount of RAM of either of those consoles, which helps cushion the difference). As for storage space, the Basic Set comes with 8 GB while the Deluxe Set has 32 GB; neither is spectacularly impressive and pale in comparison to what the Xbox and PlayStation offer storage-wise, but you can drastically increase this amount of space with an SD card and/or external hard drive, and this won't really be a concern at all for those disinterested in downloadable content/games. For those disinterested in the technical mumbo-jumbo, however, your heart's in the right place, because this console's tech specs take a serious backseat to its innovative new gaming experiences.As most of you surely already know, Nintendo's latest home console novelty is the addition of the Nintendo GamePad, which comes prepackaged with each and every Wii U console. The GamePad is, as its name insinuates, a tablet controller featuring a touchscreen display (of about 6.2'') surrounded by two analog joysticks (on each side of the screen), a classic D-Pad and diamond configuration face buttons. There are also two triggers behind each respective upper end of the pad, as well as a front-facing camera (used for taking pictures and/or video chat). The GamePad inherits the Wii Remote's Home Button at its bottom center, allowing you to return to the main menu at (mostly) any given time, and a Power Button that can again be used to turn on both the GamePad itself and the entire console. The GamePad is glossed with a smooth, white or black finish, depending on whether you purchase the Basic or Deluxe Set (more on that later).In and of itself, the GamePad is pretty nice; its resolution is only 158ppi, about the same as the first iPhone (so to answer one immediate question some may have, no, the GamePad's screen is not HD), but it utilizes this display pretty impressively, as most games, menus and webpages still look clean, polished and colorful. It is also impressively comfortable to hold; despite its at-first-glance size, it is extremely lightweight (lighter than most iPads) and easy to hold with its well-designed grips. Unfortunately, however, only time will tell how durable the thing is-it doesn't necessarily strike me as extremely fragile, but shake the GamePad and you'll hear the joysticks and face buttons rattle. My GamePad suffered a nasty drop recently (it was quite literally flung onto a tile floor), and although it still works perfectly fine, the black finish near the bottom was noticeably scuffed, although I will say in this instance the color worked out in my favor-the damage isn't visible at all from afar. As with most items of consumer electronics, particularly those likely to be (man)handled by young children, a protective case may be worth serious consideration. Like most handheld devices, the GamePad has a rechargeable battery that you can power up with the prepackaged GamePad charger (despite what it looks like, it is not the same as the 3DS charger, the two are not interchangeable). Obnoxiously, the GamePad has a very weak battery life and will in fact sometimes have to be charged after a measly two to three hours of use, depending on what you're using it for. This can be particularly frustrating given that you can't charge it from the Wii U console and must instead free up an entirely separate outlet for it. For this reason, if you use the Wii U moderately often you'll be best off leaving the GamePad on a charging cradle in moments you're not using it unless you want it constantly dying on you. I'm hoping that future accessories or attachments, like the upcoming Nyko UBoost, help remedy this issue.One of the key features of the Wii U is its interaction with the GamePad and how what you or other players see on the GamePad will differ from what's displayed on the TV; the pad will be used in a variety of different ways depending on the game you're playing or menu you're navigating. In certain Nintendo Land games, for example, the GamePad will be used as an entirely separate screen in multiplayer modes, allowing one player to see things that others cannot, making for very exciting challenges and surprises. Certain touchscreen swipes on the GamePad can affect what appears on the TV screen, and in certain games you'll even be able to aim the GamePad like a weapon to launch projectiles onto the TV screen. There is also of course the awesome option of remote play, which will allow you to (so long as the game/software you're playing permits it) play an entire console game directly from the GamePad itself, completely freeing up the TV for alternative use. This is one of the Wii U's greatest attributes in that it effectively becomes a home and handheld console all-in-one, which will prove particularly useful for parents who don't want the TV constantly clogged up for gaming use or people who relish the thought of playing console games in bed. One unfortunate limitation, however, is the fact that the GamePad must be within proximity of the Wii U console in order to function; this means you'll likely have trouble using the GamePad upstairs if the console is downstairs, and certainly won't be able to leave the house with it.Another great function is the TV Remote, which allows you to control your entire TV directly from the GamePad-you can turn your TV on/off, change the channel/volume, or even screen input from the controller's touchscreen. I'm not positive this feature is compatible with all models of TVs, but it's a fantastic option to have, allowing you to set up everything with nothing but the GamePad in hand. The Wii U also offers a web browser, which allows the option of mirroring the GamePad screen to the TV (so you can view webpages on your HD flatscreen while navigating from the GamePad's touchscreen) or format the settings so that webpages will only display on the GamePad itself. The web browser is fast and reliable, but like most products of this type, it isn't compatible with Flash, so don't plan on watching many videos through the web browsing app.Thankfully, however, this won't be too much of a concern, as the Wii U is the first Nintendo home console to offer a fully expansive app store and online user network. This comes in the form of the Nintendo eShop, modeled closely after its 3DS counterpart. You will now be able to download apps that allow the use of YouTube, Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Instant Video, downloadable mini-games or even entire retail games, directly from your Wii U console. This brings the Wii U a big step closer to being a multi-use gaming system, like its competitors, although it unfortunately still cannot play DVDs or Blu-rays (most likely due to licensing issues with Sony, whom technically owns the Blu-ray format). This new eShop also comes with the Nintendo Network and Miiverse, a massive online user base through which you can finally tie a personal account to your Nintendo console and accompanying games. This account can be synched with Club Nintendo (Nintendo's rewards program), used to purchase downloadable games, apps and other content, and interact with other players all over the world on Miiverse.A very intuitive and unique addition to Nintendo and the gaming world in general, Miiverse is something of a game-centric social network (imagine Facebook, Twitter, deviantArt and the Nintendo section of IGN all rolled into one) in which Wii U owners all over the world can communicate with one another through a series of messages and pictures. There are separate threads for each respective game release, and because the network is so frequently trafficked, chances are you can find out how to beat that one pesky level within a matter of minutes, particularly if the game is a popular one. You can post short messages (whether they be exclamations, complaints or questions) or draw pictures (on the GamePad touchscreen); the core addictiveness of the feature is that it's quite entertaining to browse through the posts, as many of them are quite hilarious and you'll come across some shockingly impressive artwork. For parents or other users paranoid about obscenity or other general inappropriateness, Miiverse is shockingly void of the spiteful trolls and putrid hate-spew that plague a vast majority of online networks, thanks primarily to on-par administrator monitoring; any and all posts that can be interpreted as hateful or obscene will be promptly removed. For those ready to bemoan excessive censorship, it's actually a very welcome addition and makes for an unexpectedly pleasant community; your post won't get removed for saying the new Mario game sucks, but it will get removed for displaying an image of Mario teabagging Peach or calling the user below you a four-letter word. Rational users should find the whole thing to be a breath of fresh air, especially in an online environment-gasp-common decency, what a concept. Better yet, Miiverse can be accessed from the GamePad without interrupting your game, so you can hop on to get a quick question answered mid-game and then hop right back without missing a beat.As for the main menu and interface itself, the Wii U's menus are modeled after those already made familiar on the previous Wii and 3DS; you'll be able to scroll through a menu of panels (\"channels\") on the GamePad to select which game, software, app or setting you'd like to open; the setup is once again pretty clean and user-friendly. There's also an all-new main menu view, which incorporates Miiverse and online connectivity; in this option, you'll be able to view trending community topics in real time as several Miis from all over the world enter your \"WaraWara Plaza\" (as it's called). You can browse through things people are saying (and drawing) all over Miiverse, with a focus on games you own/have played recently. This is an awesome way to cruise through what's up with other community members, and you can tap on a post from the GamePad (you can swap menu views between the GamePad and TV, viewing WaraWara Plaza from one and the classic channel menu from the other) to see its details.The Wii U is also completely backwards-compatible with all Wii games; whether it's The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword or Wii Sports, you will be able to play it on your Wii U. Keep in mind, however, that the Wii U does NOT offer GameCube controller (or game) compatibility, so you'll have to turn to Wii Remotes or Classic Controllers for Mario Kart Wii or Super Smash Bros. Brawl. For those who previously owned a Wii, you will be able to transfer virtually all of your previous console's data onto your Wii U, including Virtual Console software, save data, apps, and other information. In order to do so, however, you'll need an SD card with at least 512 MB of free space and a little less than an hour or so of free time, depending on how much data you've accumulated. The process is relatively painless once you know how to do it (you can find the step-by-step process via the System Transfer app in the console itself or just about anywhere online), and comes with probably the most adorable system transfer cutscene ever. Keep in mind that once you transfer the data, it is impossible to transfer back, and your old Wii will be wiped clean. In a questionable move, Nintendo made the Wii U's \"Wii Mode\" completely separate from the primary menu; you'll have to deactivate the core home screen to switch over to Wii Mode (in which you'll shift to the old Wii home screen, same as it ever was) if you want to play any Wii games or old software. This is a bit annoying that it couldn't have just been incorporated into the new interface, but perhaps it will change with a future update.A word of caution to parents buying for young (i.e. particularly impatient) children: the console, as of right now, requires a day-one system update in which you will have to connect to the Internet and update the operating system before the console will be useable at all. Regrettably, the process will take about an hour depending on your connection strength; for this reason, you might want to consider taking it out of the box early and getting the update over with yourself before handing it over as a gift. This ties into another recurring issue: the loading times. While this is something that could theoretically be improved with beefier servers and/or system updates, as of right now the Wii U seems to be plagued with noticeably unfavorable loading times; depending on the time of day and/or connection strength, you will sometimes have to wait several moments before the home menu, Miiverse, or game you're playing finally load, and there's absolutely nothing you can do during this time. There is no progress bar on most of these screens and at its worst it will leave players impatient and frustrated. This is an issue that seems to have lessened with a recent system update and I'm hoping continues to do so, since at their best the web browser and other screens can load quite quickly; here's hoping this is progressively repairable.As many already know, the Wii U is currently available in two separate versions: the Basic and Deluxe Sets, respectively. The Basic Set comes with the console itself, a GamePad, HDMI cable, and sensor bar. The Basic Set Wii U console comes with 8 GB of storage space (very, very little, but enough to get by if you're not huge on downloadable content/games). The Basic Set is currently priced at $299.99. The Deluxe Set comes with all that plus the Nintendo Land game, GamePad stand and charging cradle, console stand and the Deluxe Digital Promotion (which offers 10% back in Nintento Points on games and content downloaded on the Nintendo eShop). The Deluxe console also offers 32 GB of storage space, more than three times that of the Basic. At only $50 more than its Basic counterpart, the Deluxe Set is definitely the way to go. As of right now, all Basic Sets are white and all Deluxe Sets are black, so this may cause issues for some who want the features of one but the color of another, although keep in mind the Basic Set's storage space can be expanded with an external hard drive and the accessories can be purchased separately.All in all, the Wii U is full of awesome ideas and potential, much of which hasn't been fully utilized or properly executed just yet. It has its fair share of setbacks, the most glaring of which are the loading times, weak GamePad battery life and general lack of fully fleshed out features for the \"hardcore\" audience (games with online multiplayer, seamless voice chat, an easier/faster way to communicate with other gamers or invite them to join you in a game). As previously mentioned, however, this is clearly a console in its infancy and I'm confident the best is yet to come. Regardless of its setbacks, most early users will find themselves swept into a honeymoon period love affair, as the GamePad functionality and other addictive features are fun, intuitive and user-friendly. Although Sony and Microsoft's next offerings will surely push more along the lines of sheer horsepower, if you're looking for intuitive, innovative new ways to game and excited to see where the classic Nintendo IPs will head next in this new era, the Wii U is the way to go. As soon as the big first-party games start coming out, it's likely to become a solid must-have.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000CQIDTC","reviewerName":"Ryan J \"Ryan\"","summary":"Very familiar but still very fun.","reviewText":"When Half-Life 2 came out in 2004, the ending left many of its fans scratching their heads. The game ended leaving some pretty big questions unanswered. Instead of waiting for another six years for the answers, Valve software has gone the way of episodic content. By releasing three much shorter \"episodes\" in six month intervals, they are able to get the game out quicker.Half-Life 2: Episode One starts out with a disappointing explanation of how Gordon and Alyx survive the ending of Half-Life 2. While the explanation does appear make some sense, it feels like a big cop-out and could have definitely been done better. The good news is that the story get a lot better from there. The game quickly has you infiltrating the citadel once again to try to stop a reactor overload and you eventually attempt to escape from City 17.Unfortunately both the citadel and City 17 were fully explored in Half-Life 2. All of the areas that you visit in Episode One seem very familiar. In fact, you will probably experience de-ja vu a few times before the game is over, which will take most gamers between four to six hours.The levels are not the only thing that has remained the same this time around. Your arsenal of weapons remains completely unchanged. The selection of weapons is impressive and they worked great for the last game, but it would have been nice to see at least one or two new weapons. It is also worth noting that there are no vehicle sequences in the game, which is a shame.The enemies in the game are the same as well except for one new addition, a combine zombie. These \"zombines\" take a lot of punishment and like to pull out grenades and rush after you. This tactic makes them extremely deadly and usually makes the first enemies you go after in a crowd.With pretty much the same enemies and weapons from Half-Life 2, it is no surprise that the gameplay remains mostly the same. However, there are a few additions here and there that do a little to help keep the game fresh. For instance, it is now possible to plug up ant lion burrows to stop them from coming up out of the ground. Puzzles are back in the game, but unfortunately a lot of them boil down to finding switches to open locked doors, which is a shame as the last game relied heavily on physics based puzzles. They also tend to reuse the same puzzles over and over again, which can get pretty stale as you are trying to find the 4th fuse box to power a locked door.The great voice acting and animation is still there. The characters seem more believable and show more complex emotion then ever before. Alyx, who is with you for most of the game, has great dialogue. She also does a pretty good job of taking care of herself when you are busy solving puzzles, so it does not feel like a babysitting job.The graphics in the game are pretty much unchanged from Half-Life 2. It looks like most of the textures and objects in the game are reused art from Half-Life 2. With reused art and locations, the game pretty much looks exactly the same as it did two years ago. The only difference is that Valve has added its new High dynamic range rendering (HDR) lighting system into the game (if your video hardware supports it). The main purpose of HDR is to allow bright things to be very bright and dark things to be very dark while still being able to see detail in both. While HDR can look amazing, it tends to be over used in the game and looks downright silly on some objects. For instance, characters will glow unrealistically when you shine your flashlight on them. Still, the two year old source engine still looks pretty good today and runs pretty well on older hardware.So you ask, \"With all the gameplay and graphics the same, why should I buy Episode One\"? First, while the gameplay is mostly the same, that gameplay is still extremely good. Half-Life 2 was way beyond many of the mediocre action games out then, and it still holds up very well today. Second, Episode One does a great job in continuing the story. There are a lot of awesome scripted sequences that move the story along. While you don't learn a whole lot more, and it ends with a cliffhanger ending, it sets up what looks to be a very interesting Episode Two. So if you don't mind the short length, no new multiplayer content, and think $20 is fair for more of the great Half-Life 2 gameplay and storyline (though not as epic or original), then go ahead and pick this one up. That being said, if you were one of the few who did not enjoy Half-Life 2, this game will do nothing to change your mind.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2006"}

But I couldn't contain myself cause this was one of the best games I played, and still do, I'm currently on my 8th play.Story: Cloud, a former SOLDIER(kind of like an elite squad) member is recruited by Avalanche to help bring down the Shinra Corporation whose reactors are draining the planet of its energy. Where it goes from there involves a being from the sky, genetic experimentation and mind freak-outs.Music: Some of the best music ever is on the soundtrack. One track, Aeris's Theme is worth the price of it alone. This song can't be put into words, one of the most beautiful compositions I've ever listened to(and it's played in a sad scene but I won't spoil it). But this soundtrack also included a wide variety of music like rock(Boss Battle Theme)New age sounding(City of the Ancients), funk like(Wall Market) to ominous(Those Chosen By The Planet).Graphics: Back in 1997, these graphics were jawdropping. That opening sequence with Aeris, the entrance to Gold Saucer, and awakening of ancient beings were just amazing. They seem tame now but back then, they were gorgeous. It isn't flawless though: the characters look \"blocky\" like it'll have a big block for a hand and in some cases, you can see them without a mouth but it doesn't detract from the feel of the game.And one thing to note if you've haven't played a Final Fantasy before, yes it is Part VII but it's not like a saga where each part is a continuation of the story. It's all new story, characters, villains, worlds etc.For your spells and abilities, it includes the Materia System. While I'm not gonna spoil what a materia is, the basic function of it is to give you special abilities. Equip it on your weapon or armor and you can cast magic, summon beasts, counterattack, steal or give you some benefits. Master it and it'll create a new one. So awesome materia like Ultima, Knights of the Round or Mime can be replicated, giving you almost an endless string of summons.In VI and in VIII, certain special attacks can be accessed when a character was low health. Here it's a bar that fills up whenever you get attacked. Fill it up and you can unleash a string of powerful attacks, one big beam, or even cure party members. One flaw is that regular attacks can't be accessed so you can't save it for an approaching Boss, you either have to use magic or just defend.This is one of the best games you'll play and even though there's other games out currently that can distract, it always helps to go back to what started it all: what brought people into the RPG genre in a HUGE way: Final Fantasy VII.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2002"}

But the third installment is something a lot more intense, dynamic, addictive, and a lot more fun.Even though this game is considered to be extremely violent, I think of it as a common M-rated game out there, nothing special in here. The driving part of the game is somewhat close to the Carmageddon series, and the times where you are on foot are the same as an average action game( Max Payne, for example).In GTA3 you play as a common street thug doing favors for the mafia. Your character is set in a huge city, and he will be interacting with all people out there, from hookers to cops, from gangsters to triads. Even though there are over 70 big-time missions in the game, you are free to roam the city, stealing all kinds of vehicles, including fire trucks, ambulances, limos, police cars, taxis, and many, many more. You can do pretty much every thing that you want, but there are consequences. Be bad and cops will be on your tail before you know it, be very bad and the SWATs will give you a hard time, than the feds, and the military. The possibilities in the game are endless.Technically, the game has a solid good side and a bad side. On the good side, you have a big city filled with people, cars, people, and lots of buildings. Buildings include subways, docks, hospitals, mafia mansions, and oh so much more. And all of the features are rendered in 3D with amazing environmental effects such as rain and fog, plus unbelievable time-of-day effects. Yes the game has its day and night, and its own weather. On the bad side though, due to the PS2 hardware capabilities, the framerate is sometimes intolerably shaky, and there is even some lag at times. And the game crashes quite often, with the message: &quot;there was a problem reading the GTA3 DVD&quot;.In conclusion, this game is definitely a must have. The missions alone will take about 100 hours to complete, while you also can steal a cop car and be a vigilantee or gat a cab and be a taxi driver or you can just get cops' attention and than make some wild get-aways. Every aspect of a cool video game is present in GTA3: story, voice acting, graphics, cutscenes, music (you have a selection of radio stations while in the car), gameplay, controls, all are superb. GTA3 - game of the year 2001. Gamespy can't be wrong.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2001"}

Exciting! WHAT A TRAINWRECK OF A GAME !!!!  Only reason I continued was to get out and see world. But I heard that's just more of a tedious chore so why bother.

{"product_name":"B0000DJX7I","description":"Praised for brilliant scripts and open-ended gameplay, vilified for unapologetic violence and mature themes,Grand Theft Autohas deservedly become one of the most popular game franchises in history. This double pack contains the full versions of bothGrand Theft Auto IIIandGrand Theft Auto III: Vice City, enhanced for Xbox. Xbox gamers can rejoice that the grand king of video games--The Sopranoswith a gamepad--is finally available on the big black box.Grand Theft AutoWithGrand Theft Auto IIIRockstar proves that not all developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games. This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking more structure can embark on dozens of missions driven by a genuinely interesting crime-story plot or steal cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and you can go on vigilante missions. Grab a cab and you can play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi. Take a fire truck and you can earn money putting out fires. The minigames are a good way to unwind after a particularly difficult mission. With so much to do, the game just never gets boring.As you'd expect, there are consequences for criminality. As your random acts of mayhem mount up the police start hounding you, eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic, pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing. Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerGrand Theft Auto III: Vice CityHow big is this game? Even publicists for other games end up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto IIInever dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action. InVice Citythis is--to use a clich&#xE9; that is for once apropos--taken to a whole new level.--David StoeszPros:Open-ended gameplay; player can chose to be relatively law-abiding or engage in wanton virtual destructionVaried missionsBrilliant scripts with Hollywood voice actingRocking sound track (also available in our Music store)Xbox-enhanced graphicsCons:As theThe Sopranosof games,GTA 3draws unwanted attention from overzealous legislatorsNo multiplayer","reviewerName":"Jimbo Jones","summary":"a pair of old friends revisted with minor tweaks","reviewText":"I'd like to start this review by saying these are 2 of the BEST games I've ever played on any console (both were fist released for the PS2 console and later for the PC.)

Now it may look like the ps2 game but rockstar made little improvements to detail our hero (from GTA III) now sports a leather jacket (did I see this on the ps2 version?) the cars and textures are now more realistic and smoother (I thought) the rain effects were cool and colors are bright and vibrant.  The controls for both games are customizable (the default controls just don't do it for me) Even though I have already played both these games countless times (many many sleepless nights) its the playability and fun factor of both games that drew me back.

A second screen, from the makers of the Nintendo Dual Screen, with all the....groundbreaking things it did? Well it's been six months, with a year or so of games taking advantage of the tech and it appears that the innovation starts and stops with maps and screen mirroring. There isn't any evidence that Nintendo had any semblance of a good idea when creating this touch screen controller. Not even second screen functionality is built into apps like Netflix, which not only prevents me from living the American Dream of surfing the internet while not paying attention to what I'm watching on TV, it shows such a basic lack of instinct for why you'd want a second screen in the first place. I speak on behalf of everyone when I say nobody wants a dumbed down tablet with a poor resolution and even worse battery life that's poorly implemented into the system interface and counter-intuitive to use in-game. I would much rather Nintendo pull a Kinect and just make the thing an optional peripheral and ship the console with the pro controller. They could probably get away with dropping the price further and net some market share as games like Mario Kart and Super Smash Brothers come down the pike. Neither have given any indication that it will use the Gamepad for anything novel anyway.Nintendo games have and will always be some of the best games for your money, but the Wii U is just not good design.

Ratchet himself is cute-but-not-too-cute, just butch enough to carry off his hardshooting lifestyle.Sony must have found a lot of positive feedback about the arena battles from previous games in the series, because as others say, Deadlocked is mostly that.There are two major areas to go - one is a shuttle to the arena, two is a shuttle to whichever planetary quest you're currently on.  Two is still very much dodge and shoot, not as inventive and expansive as the earlier games, and you get the feeling that Deadlocked is rushing you.  You're humming along and suddenly it's the last challenge and you're left wondering where all the game went.  \"Get moving and finish already!\" you can almost hear it scream.  Maybe it's a subleminal audio track.Although the non-arena quests do offer some of what the former games had, they simply don't compare with their scope.It is still great fun, though.  I like the new weapons system and the fact that you can earn bolts quickly enough to get some serious firepower, unlike the earlier games where it took forever to buy and upgrade your hardware.  At first I was annoyed that they had changed some of the controls (the first 3 worked essentially the same), but quickly got used to it.  Also, I used the target-lock view instead of normal 3rd-person view for the first time and found myself preferring it (at least for Deadlocked).So, should you buy? I suggest 'absolutely yes.'  The humor is still there (although the announcer's comments can get repetive after you've played it through once), with one or two genuine laugh-out-loud moments, the weapons are great, the graphics are excellent, and the quests have some replay value.  There are a few much more tolerable \"race\" type challenges, a hoverbike, a hovership and a dunebuggy, which is a good thing.  I hate, hate, hate the races from previous games.It's not as good as Up Your Arsenal, but then again, how could the Ratchet franchise top that?","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2005"}

One thing that I have to say that I was impressed with was the feel that you could see from miles around, and the graphics really didn't show that big of a letdown. There are way too many games that try to get away with it, but this game did it right.The must feels like its a compilation of a ton of old western tunes with a little bit of updating. Its definitely something that doesn't intrude upon your experience, but gives the game some spice. Then there's the voices, and I have to say that I was very impressed that there was voices for basically everything, be it random people you accidentally stumble into or the sounds of animals running around or screaming their last breath.The controls at first seemed completely solid, but I did notice that there were some times later in the game when I'm trying to make sure I have a gun, and I select it from the radial display where that gun wasn't selected and I ended up having to start over again and hoping that this time around the game would see that I don't want to bare knuckle fight and I actually want a gun while riding in a wagon.This was a very ambitious game, and for those who don't know this game was also declared game of the year at the VGA (Video Game Awards). To be completely honest this is Grand Theft Auto in the west. Instead of cars you have horses, buggies, and wagons. You can be a complete ass and be constantly hunted or you can save the lands with the power of your guns. You'll have this interesting ability called Dead Eye which slows everything down and allows you to aim your gun and go for multiple shots on a moving target. I do have a word of caution you'll get to a point in the game where it will no longer automatically pick the shots you'll have to do that yourself.There is a lot to this game, especially when it comes to story, or at least that's what it looks like on first glance. What it really boils down to is a lot of filler, and a story that gets drown from time to time with the amount of twists that the developers felt needed to be thrown in there. Yes I liked early on that I was hunting wild animals and taking on random quests but when you get to a certain part in the game you kind of just want to finish it, and the carrot on a stick routine becomes plain as day, and I found it beyond frustrating. Once it was done one too many times I found myself trying to find loopholes. I skipped entire cutscenes because I didn't care any more I just wanted to find the man I came there to find. At the end of missions when I needed to go to the next place to get a quest you could find me running for the nearest cliff and taking a swan dive so that I could respawn in a safe house closer to where I need to go next.This game has a lot of power behind it, and I can see that there's a lot to like in this game, but if there could have been a way to peel off a good chunk of the filler and fluff, this game would have been amazing. There's also the fact that some of the twists that are thrown at you, if you're paying attention, can be figured out about 4 quests before it comes.Red Dead Redemption might be the Game of the Year, but personally I don't think it completely matches up with the high expectations that a title like that gives a game. This game gets an 8.1 out of 10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

Rose \"Blu Aficionado\"","summary":"A True Masterpiece!","reviewText":"===================================================QUICK REVIEW (LESS READING)===================================================Graphics- 9.5  Excellent details and textures, everything from the wool jackets, to the animal pelts you collect is highly detailed and gorgeous in HD.  I did have a few hiccups and a freeze up during a cut scene, it happened one time, and could very well be my Xbox.Sound- 10  The surround sound is top notch in Red Dead Revolver, from a steam engine barreling down the tracks, a cougar growling from the bushes, to the small things like birds chirping and wind blowing...the sound envelops you and keeps you on the edge of your seat.Gameplay- 10  Excellent control setup (GTA vets will be right at home) the only thing that took a bit of getting used to was riding a horse, its not bad, just a bit different than a car in terms of handling.  Plenty of story/mission hours to waste away, followed by double the hours you'll spend just exploring and causing havoc (or helping the kind settlers).Re-playability-9  Just going home and being able to run around the Wild West is enough for me, Rockstar included a solid story, but you can make your own as you go, helping damsels in distress, or massacring an entire settlement, its all up to you.  This is gonna be a great game for a bit of relaxation...or some stress relief.Multi-player- 9.5  I only played a bit of MP, since the rest of my \"posse\" hadn't received the game yet (or were struggling to get one at the store) The premise seems really interesting though, and the game of death match I played was a real nice change from the normal FPS death matches I've been playing lately.  The open world MP game has always been something I wanted to see more of, and I'm sure once this game gets into more peoples hands its gonna be a real treat for the gaming world.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------I've been a fan of the Grand Theft Auto series since it had a top down view, so when this was announced by Rockstar I was pretty interested.The first thing I must say is Rockstar has really outdone themselves, this game takes GTA to the next level, while taking it back a hundred years on the time line. The first thing you notice is the vast area you get to call \"home\".  The colors and sand blowing and swirling is truly beautiful eye candy.  I hate to compare this game to GTA, but the undertones are all there.I don't wanna share any of the story, and honestly that's icing on the cake for this game.  The graphics are simply gorgeous, from the leather straps, and jackets, to the grizzly beards on the characters...all very well done.  One thing I must say is not being in the big city setting is a breath of fresh air, no car horns blaring, police sirens at every corner, just the wide open Western range...at times I thought I could taste the fresh air.As far as game play goes, its hard to beat.  You can do anything, and I mean anything (*Ill give a example at the end of this) The stores and shops are fantastic, and walking into a new town just makes you feel like a real gunslinger!  Again I don't wanna get into the story to much, but the voice acting and cut scenes are almost Hollywood movie grade, its always nice when you feel for the characters, and this game does an outstanding job of delving into their history and stories!As another reviewer said the game takes about 20 hours to play through the main story, however getting 100% completion will take you some extra time.  The problem is playing through the game, no matter how hard I tried to go to the next mission, I ended up going way off track, killing a bear, saving a stage coach, or just getting a bunch of horses together to test a dynamite stick on.  No matter what path you choose, your in for a surprise...Red Dead Redemption really delivers.If you haven't picked this gem up yet I would highly suggest it, I said I'd give an example of doing whatever you want and here it is:  Find some poor townsfolk, give em a round from your six shooter in the kneecap, hogtie them, drag them behind your horse to the nearest railroad...and leave em on the track, sit back and wait for the train to come through, nothing better to relieve the stress of those long days at work/school.Red Dead Redemption far exceeds anything you've played before, pick up this game, and I'll see you behind the saloon at high noon!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2010"}

If you look as it in basic terms the game is just like the Mario brothers game except that instead of playing on one world and passing levels you travel through the galaxy onto different worlds that obviously represent levels to rescue the princess yet again and help restore the cosmos back to the way it's suppose to be.  You will also have some of the regular baddies in the game as well as a few new ones as well also a few unique bosses to beat on certain planets to advance through the game as well.  The effects and animation are great for the Mario gaming world as well a some of the new ways Mario can use to jump stomp or spin past his enemies to reach the end.  The one thing though is if you're not a fan of the Mario games you might not have as much fun playing the game though as this game was definitely meant for Mario fans,  though I think most people will still find some entertainment in playing the game.

In the end, I'm glad I did because this is one of the most entertaining and well made role playing games I've ever experienced.The story is pretty interesting, not to mention detailed. A game that requires at least thirty hours to play through needs at least that, so I can safely promise you an entertaining sci-fi adventure with a little bit of this and a little bit of that to keep you playing. Everything in the game is detailed to the point that you probably won't get to read every single line of information that comes your way. You travel to literally dozens of planets and each one has a detailed breakdown on everything from its weather conditions to its population numbers. Even though most of these planets are unable to be landed on, it still adds a sense of depth that just adds to the universe that Mass Effect lays out for you. Characters are voiced by an able cast and even popular celebrities like Keith David and Seth Green join in to lend a hand with some of the characters.Speaking of voice acting, the characters you encounter engage you in conversation that is probably the most involving of all games that require some kind of a response selection. Yeah, you'll have conversations that might seem a little off but 99% of the time, I'd say that the conversations flow very smoothly, impressive considering just how many selections you are given to answer with.Those who've played Bioware's Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic RPG will be instantly at home with this title. It's not an exact copy of that game but the mechanics share more than a couple of similarities. Battles are fought and controlled with a nice and easy to grasp control scheme that maps out player actions to both bumpers. The battles are a lot of fun and pretty intense. Graphics and sound are top notch and some of the planet surfaces are actually quite nice, visually speaking.I do have some reservations with the game but nothing too serious. The driving portions of the game are a bit monotonous and something about the way it controls feels like its lacking a bit. You land on the planets in a dune buggy type vehicle which is armed with a machine gun turret and a cannon that is pretty fun to blast things with but the controls are just a bit off where the vehicle might not control the way you want it to. You do get the hang of it but I don't know, I wasn't too crazy about these portions of the game after a while.My other problem has to do with managing the inventory in the game. i found it a bit frustrating whenever I got a new item, it felt like I had to check every single character's inventory to see who'd be able to benefit from it most. That's usually how it goes with these games but after a while, I felt like I was spending way too much time in the inventory screen on too many occasions. I recall this being one of the problems with Knights of the Old Republic and its here as well. The inventory management could be streamlined somehow or at least easier to see who had what and compare. In the end, its not much to complain about but worth noting.This is a great title with loads of replay value. I'd recommend this one easily to anyone who hasn't already played it. I'd say RPG veterans would really enjoy this as well as those who've never tried one. And for the price its going at the time of this writing, this is an even easier recommendation to make.NOTE:They made a big stink a while back about the sexual content in the game. It's absolutely ridiculous and in the end, not even worth crowing about. What is here is tastefully done and if you're that paranoid about subjecting a minor to something that may or may not be inappropriate, then steer your kid elsewhere.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2008"}

I really enjoy the game and am very suprised that is has a meta-score in the low 80's.I have a few VERY random thoughts.1) The character can run very fast, almost an unaturaly fast speed.  At first the speed of the character was bothersome but I then realized that the speed was necessary to keep the pace going.  I then realized that the main issue I have with character movement is his/her ability to turn seemingly on a dime at full speed.  I wish the character movement was a little more realiztic, more like Assassins Creed.2) You scroll the menu with the R and L trigger, it seems gliched at times randomly skipping from page to page.3) You can spend 100+ hours on this game.

It's mostly about the language, the sex part is not as bad as people describe it. I'm half way through the game and haven't encountered anything worse then Vice City, so far it's cleaner in that respect.The language however... I curse heavily at times, but I know when to keep my mouth shut. Kids tend to immitate what they see. It could be very dangerous (physically) for your child to run around using the word \"ni**er\" in a non-chalant fashion, like characters do in the game - kids just don't understand the meaning of the word or the consequences of its usage.Rockstar should have protected themselves better by putting extra warning on the box.

Rather than button mashing, GW 2 requires more player input. One button makes you dodge, while skills are tied to specific weapon types, so swapping out creates on the fly battle strategies between close and long range encounters.The standard class structure of other MMO's is more flexible here, for instance every class can heal.  You can build and play a character that appeals to your play style. You have more choice where to play in the world, and how to play. It feels more like a living, breathing world, combining scripted stories and dynamic events. It is easy to get lost here for a long time . . .Guild Wars 2 graphics are something to gush over, as the game looks absolutely stunning.

I was looking forward to getting 2k12 after the lockout ended with updated rosters but I'm not sure if it was worth the wait now.  The graphics are excellent and the presentation and features are new an improved as well, but I have problems with this game.First, of all I got it a couple of weeks ago and I'm already having technical issues.  Lately its been bringing me to the start screen while it's loading.  Also the connection to online is faulty and shuts down.  Now the gameplay, as a  first impression, I am so disappointed.  It is completely different from the previous 2k games.  What I dislike most is the controllability.  The players on defense move so slow that it's pretty much pointless guarding the guy with the ball on user mode.  Don't even get me started on playing against the CPU.  The CPU is so hard and BS, its not enjoyable unlocking all the legend teams.  Because of the change in difficulty to do anything, stats are way down.  But then again, it could just take some time getting used to.  I'm not going stop playing, since it's still addictive and a great basketball simulation, it's just not what I expected.I'll be sure to update if I catch onto the new gameplay.  PS name: ChaptopherUPDATE:So I've been playing a lot of 2K12 for about a month now and I have a few new things to say.  My opinion stands that 12 is much harder on so many levels and incredibly annoying on many occasions.  I don't think there's anyone who can play this game without ever saying \"WTF!\" and \"BS!\" There is constantly something that ticks you off when playing.  Examples include constant stepping out of bounce, losing the ball by bumping into your own team mates, constantly bumping into defenders, the huge influence of consistency and slumps, and even some errors or gliches when playing (like getting points taken off in MyPlayer for something you did not do).  Another thing that really can drive you crazy is the lengthy presentation and loading.  Loading takes MUCH longer than 2k10 and 11, probably because the improved graphics.Despite all these ARRRGGGGHHHs and UGGHHHHHs, 2K12 is a huge step up in basketball video games.  The presentation is fresh and a breath of fresh air, compared to that of the lackluster predecessors.  Each year 2K comes closer to the lifelike image of the players and the atmosphere.  This year, there was a huge step in this area.  With big change, I think 2K felt they had to revamp the way execution in the gameplay.  Playing 2K10 and 11 now feels much easier, but not necessarily a good thing.  2K12 is much closer to lifelike movement.Here's the goods and bads I have for 2K12:GOOD1. Improved Graphics2. Features and Ad ons (new and improved)3. MyPlayer improvements  (no summer circuit though which I personally didn't like)4. Addiction5. Realistic gameplay (not overall gameplay)6. Improved pass accuracy (to some degree)BAD1. Constant turnovers (especially from stepping out of bounce)2. Annoying gameplay3. Difficult CPU challenges4. Consistency of shots and bricks5. Ability of LBJ6. Plays (a little difficult getting used to)7. Pick and roll and pick and pop offense more complicated to control8. Gamesliders need major adjustment in future 2K games","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2011"}

Your radio man  became a midnight snack for the T.rex, so it's up to you and your two remaining teammates to explore a  dino-infested research station, rescue the scientist, call for a helicopter retrieval, and escape with your lives.  Along the way you'll uncover the grizzly remains of those who got in the dinosaurs' way, and you'll unravel  the mystery of how a top-secret energy research project turned into a Jurassic nightmare.And about those dinosaurs: they're all over the island. One instant you'll be walking along a second-story  balcony, admiring the view, the next instant you'll be dodging a T.rex as it smashes its huge maw through  the concrete walls. Velociraptors chase you down blood-spattered corridors, flying reptiles circle the  outdoor areas, and your only weapons are your pistol, whatever else you can salvage, a dwindling supply of  ammunition, and your wits.Packed with clever puzzles and heart-pounding surprises, all superbly presented with realistic graphics and  horror-movie camera angles,Dino Crisisis a triumph of survival-horror gaming.--Mike  FehlauerPros:Great sound effects and musicWell-integrated, varied, and clever puzzlesAwe-inspiring, terrifying dinosaursBranching story line improves replay valueCons:Doors impervious to explosives","reviewerName":"Poo Poo Pooey","summary":"Not just another resident rip-off","reviewText":"it would be unfair to pass this game by as another resident evil rip off because, although the basic premise is the same it is actually a very different game in every respect. And with the exception of 2,  dino crisis easily excels any of the resident back catalogue.The graphics are very good and use a different technique than RE allowing for much more user interaction. In RE the graphics are made up of pre-rendered backgrounds but DC uses polygonal characters and backgrounds to better effect and look very much like the areas they are trying to convey. This style of graphics works better than in RE and heightens the tension very well.The gameplay is more innovative than in the RE games with more puzzles and less emphasis placed on action. DC's weapons are reasonably feeble compared to those in RE but this works for the better. Instead of just splattering every enemy you come across you need to think of alternatives as shooting everything will soon either get you killed or make you run out of ammo fast. Throughout the game you have to use security fences to your advantage, running past a raptor when its back is turned, past a sensor and then turn on the fence, much better than just killing the raptor and more satisfying to boot.Enemies are also more intelligent than in RE games, as they would need to be, and will chase you through doors and follow your trail of blood. They are all also more agile than those in RE and so those encounters you cannot avoid are made even more visceral.The use of puzzles through the game is also well done and some are real brainteasers, they are also more inventive than in RE, such as finding the right combination of gases for a poisoned room to gain entry or searching corpses for fingerprints to make a keycard. Much better than RE's simple need key, find key approach.The enemies in the game is where it starts to slip a bit with not too many variations in there but this isnt much of a problem as dino encounters are not all that frequent anyway. The way the dinos are presented to you is good and the ways you are encouraged to beat them is refreshing. such as guiding a pterodactyl into a fan or electrocuting a raptor.The main boss, although it hd to be a T-Rex, is better a good alternative to the tyrants in the RE series and provides a constant menace much like in RE3 and always seems to be breathing down your neck. Even when you think youre safe he bursts through a window or finds some way of spoiling your day.The longevity of the game is pretty much what you expect of a game of this type, a fast play through can take approximately 3 hours but the first time took me about 5 1/2.The game length did surprise me though as at one point i was sure that i had finished the game but i was only half way through.There is significant replay value in the game with three endings and many different costumes to be unlocked and with the game made in such a way you can play through and experience it differently each time.Overall there is not much to gripe about with this game and i really cannot find much fault with it at all. Although the game length is expected with this sort of game it can seem annoying to others for it to be over so fast but with MGS the game is so enjoyable that this isnt a problem. Also hardcore blasters may complain about the puzzle orientated gameplay but if you ask me its far better this way.i'd give it a 95%","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2001"}

Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Super Slim","reviewText":"STATEMENT OF PERSONAL BIAS: I've been a PS3 owner ever since the 60GB Classic became available in 2007 and I've been impressed with the PS3's reliability, versatility and its sheer power - I've owned both Classic and Slim models, upgraded most, gave away a couple. In the end one's choice for a gaming console is a matter of personal taste and preference but the PS3 is by far the more popular 'gaming' or 'entertainment' implement in our household. And we do own an Xbox.The FAQ below and the more free-form text that follows are the outcome of the quick unboxing of the Uncharted 3: Game of the Year Bundle.___________________________________________THE FAQ:Q: Why should I buy a PS3 at all? What's it good for?A: With a PS3 you can play disc-based or downloaded games and this includes no-fee support for multiplayer, play Blu-ray, DVD movies or stream, rent or download movies or your own videos, play CDs or upload and play your own music, upload and display your photos, listen to Internet radio stations, access an ever-increasing number of Internet services such as Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, Hulu Plus, YouTube, Music Unlimited, browse the Web, play content off DLNA-compatible computers, laptops, media servers or network-attached storage (NAS) or allow your computers to play content stored on your PS3, integrate with your PSP or Vita portable consoles.Q: In what ways is the new PS3 different from the current models?A: The new model (Super Slim) is smaller, lighter, more quiet, more power efficient, has a larger HDD and has discs top-loaded vs. front-loaded on the Slim.Q: Is the new model less expensive than the Slim?A: The Super Slim is only available as a bundle at the time I'm writing this (will update). The current bundle consisting essentially of the console itself, a physical game, a downloadble game and 30 day Playstation Plus is slightly more expensive than the plain old model console but sells for less than a similar old model bundle -PS3 160GB with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 Blu-ray Disc Bundlewhich is $300 and it adds only a movie and a 30-day Playstation Plus membership.Q: Can I get the console without the games and pay less?A: Not at this time. But the console I helped unbox had the Uncharted 3 shrink-wrapped and it should be possible to sell it through Amazon as `new'.Q: I am ready to order a PS3 but I'm undecided. Should I buy a Slim or a Super Slim?A: If you would buy Uncharted 3 with the Slim, then you should pick the new model. If not... it's a matter of preference: front loading (Slim) vs. top loading (this model). Buy the Slim if you can't stand `top loading' your discs but buy this model otherwise because of the small improvements (see first answer)Q: Should I buy this bundle or should I wait for more choices or a price drop?A: Either or both are likely to happen post Black Friday but if Uncharted 3 is your kind of game this could still be a good buy,Q: Isn't Sony expected to announce the PS4 soon?A: It is likely that Sony's next generation console will be launched in 2013. Sony recently committed to support the PS3 at least through 2015.Q: If I already have a PS3 is this model worth the upgrade?A: See the answer to the first question. The new model has an additional 90GB of HDD storage when compared to the 160GB Slim.Q: I am planning to buy my first Sony console? Should I buy the Slim, the Super Slim (this bundle) or wait for the PS4?A: We bought our first PS3 in 2007 and we paid a lot for it. The reward was us enjoying it for the 2 years between the time of our purchase and Sony announcing some less expensive models. In our case it was well worth it. I would expect the PS3 to remain a viable gaming platform and home entertainment center for at least two more years.Q: Is the new model compatible with all my existing peripherals: controllers, Move, Eye camera, keyboard, charger?A: Yes.Q: Does this model come with HDMI, USB cables?A: There is a USB cable in the box but you will have to supply your own HDMI if you need one.Q: What is actually in the box?A: The console itself, power cord, composite video cable, USB cable, the controller, Uncharted 3 game in a sealed case, DUST 514 voucher and Playstation Plus 30-day membership, User Guide.Q: Once I buy this bundle, what else will I need to have a fully functional console?A: You should buy an HDMI cable if you are going to connect your PS3 to an HD TV. You may also want a second controller. A Move bundle (controllers, camera) is highly optional. A charger should be okay but it's not needed because controllers charge through the PS3's USB ports.Q: If I buy the 250GB model can I upgrade later to a larger size?A: Yes, Sony will allow you to replace the existing HDD with a compatible 2.5\" SATA drive without voiding the warranty. There are dozens of step-by-step guides on YouTube.Q: Will I have to pay Sony if I wanted to play co-op or multiplayer games?A: No. The basic PSN access is free. There is the Playstation Plus option that adds some perks such as free trial games, betas and demos and some discounts on downloaded titles but `non-essential' is the key word. I never felt I needed to pay for that service.Q: Is there a complete list of services currently on the PS3?A: This is what is available at the time I'm writing this: NFL Sunday Ticket, Hulu Plus, Netflix, YouTube, Vudu HD Movies, Crunchyroll (anime), NHL Gamecenter Live, MLB.tv, XOS College Sports, CinemaNow, Laugh Factory Live (beta), Music Unlimited.___________________________________________SLIMS vs. SUPERSLIMSIt's likely that Sony may stop making/selling the existing 160/320GB Slim models and  this 250GB and the upcoming 500GB models with their various 'bundles are going to be the only models to choose from in the near future. At the time of my writing this review this 250GB Uncharted 3 Game of the Year bundle is the only 'super slim' configuration available with the 500GB bundle expected to launch in October.The few hands-on hours I spent with this model convinced me that the new PS3 is a slight improvement over the models it replaces and here are the changes:- Price - yes, the 250GB Super Slim's bundle costs more than a plain 160GB Slim but it's a bundle - it comes with a physical game and a download voucher in addition to the console. There is a resalable, shrink-wrapped copy of Uncharted 3 inside and you could probably sell it at Amazon for more than the price difference between the bundle and the Slim. It's quite likely that we are going to see an unbundled 250GB configuration for under two hundred dollars during the holiday season.- Smaller - I believe Sony stated that the new model is 20% lighter than the Slim.- Larger HDD - the extra 90GB (250GB vs. 160GB) may not sound like a lot but the extra storage is enough room for maybe 30-40 downloaded games or 20-30 DVD-quality movies.- Burns less electricity - the Super Slim comes with a 190W power supply which is 60W less than the Slim's 250W.- Fans are more quiet - the smaller model has smaller fans and I could hardly hear them.- Disc loading - it's changing from the front-loader to a top-loader method. This method guarantees that you'll never end up with a stuck disc but the sliding door can be noisy.- Finish - the shape is more streamlined but the overall impression if 'cheaper looking' when compared to the Slim or the Classic. I personally don't care because my PS3 lives under the TV and it's not seen.RATING THIS BUNDLEI tend to like this new model for the several small improvements over the Slim. Because I don't mind `top loading' and `looks' for a console that's not seen don't matter. I would pick this model over the Slim because of the several small improvements. If this was my first PS3 purchase I would buy one with the knowledge that a new model may be announced one year from now because paying less than a dollar a day for one fine gaming and overall entertaining center is well worth it but that's just my view.I am going to rate this bundle a four stars, mainly because at the time I'm writing this review and at least for the next few weeks we won't have the freedom to choose between a bundle and a just plain Super Slim for a lower price. Uncharted 3 is a great Sony exclusive and we already own a copy and I'd prefer to buy a copy because I wanted to, not because I have little choice.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2012"}

It's like your favorite chocolate bar that you curl up with while you watch your favorite TV show. You know and love the characters. You know how all the screens work. You laugh out loud as your friend misses that jump and you barely save him.The game is appropriate for all ages, and easy to learn. It's got a nice challenge to it, and at the same time it makes sense. You know what you have to do, and it's just a matter of actually doing it.Are there any down sides here? If someone is looking for a completely new experience, this probably isn't the game to get. There are plenty of other games out that \"push the envelope\" in terms of new styles of graphics and innovative gameplay.But for the tried-and-true lover of Mario, this is definitely fun to play and good for all ages.Well recommended.I purchased this game with my own funds in order to do this review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2013"}

However, it's one more box taking up space in my entertainment cabinet, it's powered externally so you'll need yet another power outlet, and it must be physically connected to a desktop (or laptop, of course) for initial setup.  While I am satisfied with the performance of the Linksys unit it does occasionally drop signal, which kicks me off online gaming sessions.  Every now and again it also won't connect until I cycle the power.The Microsoft unit, by contrast, has never once cut out- not even while playing streaming audio from my computer.

{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"A. Son","summary":"Pretty Good coming from a MGS fan","reviewText":"First off let me tell you how I feel about this series so you can get an idea of how accurately I grade this game. I've played all of the metal gear games and completed MGS-MGS4. I loved MGS, I felt MGS2 was lacking and goofy in the story department but still had great gameplay, and MGS3 I thought was incredibly well done and is still my favorite of the entire series. That being said here goes:Right off the bat, MGS4's graphics will amaze you. The world around you is beautifully rendered. The sounds and action going on around you feel incredibly genuine and MGS4 does a wonderful job of immersion during gameplay. The controls are a tad different that usual but don't take long to pick up. Combat is a lot more fast and furious. Sneaking seems harder to accomplish in this game due to the amount of activity going on in these levels but it can still be done if done right. The gameplay still feels a lot like Metal Gear but little things have been changed that add more realism to what's going on in the game. It's harder to sneak yet usually easier to get away from people pursuing you and sometimes it's easier just to kill everything in your way instead of trying to sneak around it. The boss fights are awesome and they DO take quite a bit of time (most of them),they're all very unique and require the player to figure out good strategies to win.However, MGS4 is definitely not without flaws. I know how MG works, cut scenes are long and the feel of it is almost like an action movie. However, even I had to sit back sometimes and wonder why some of the scenes had to be as long as they were. It'd be one thing if I had a lot of gameplay time before and after each scene but this wasn't always the case I'd take control of Snake after a long sequence and play him for 5-10 minutes before it'd takeover into another really long sequence.  This didn't feel like a game using movie elements. It felt like a movie using some game elements. The game is also more linear than the others since each act takes you somewhere entirely different so it felt more like the game was moving you along at it's desired pace instead of you being able to move it along at your own pace. My biggest issue probably of all though was probably the dialog. Parts with Snake and Raiden were great. However, other moments would sometimes get inappropriately goofy. I know MG humor has been like this and usually I think it's great but some of the stuff that was done in this game was way too over the top and just plain lame. It's hard to explain without using spoilers so I'll leave it at that.All in all, I thought MGS2's story was really lame and goofy and I thought Kojima did a decent job mopping up that mess in this game. From least to greatest I feel the series goes in this order: MGS2, MGS4, MGS, MGS3. I will make this note, the first half of this game I was really getting upset and thinking this was going to be another MGS2. Thankfully, the second half kicks the crap out of the first half and takes some awesome trips down memory lane. I enjoyed this game and if you're a Metal Gear fan and haven't played this yet, you need to. If you don't play MG games, I don't think you'll enjoy this but give it a shot if you'd like.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2009"}

{"product_name":"B007M6W38W","description":"","reviewerName":"pastapadre","summary":"The most well-rounded NBA 2K title yet.","reviewText":"NBA 2K13 reaches the market with a prime opportunity to not just reestablish itself with consumers this time of year following the lockout that affected NBA 2K12, but also expand its reach to new gaming segments and cultural significance. 2K Sports was able to succeed in just about every facet of the game and have produced the best NBA 2K title to date even exceeding the spectacular 2K11.Positives*GameplayIt should come as no surprise that the NBA 2K series once again excells in the area of gameplay. Improvements to areas such as contact between players and affects on shots, fast breaks, player differentiation particularly in the area of speed, and better passing including manual bounce passes are all worth noting. The addition of \"Signature Skills\" helps to better differentiate individuals beyond just their ratings adding another layer of strategy.The biggest change comes with dribbling moves shifting to the right analog stick. The system is a vast improvement over \"Isomotion\" of the past. It does take some time to get accustomed to and become natural to utilize but the array of moves at a player's disposal is impressive. NBA 2K13 still wouldn't be described as especially accessible to new or inexperienced gamers but the ability to learn and practice in the Training Camp feature is helpful. It just takes time to translate into game situations.Kinect voice command integration, as with other titles that it has debuted in recently, is hit or miss. It's nice to have the option to call out substitutions or make play calls on the fly without having to look down at the controller but whether it actually is less of a nuisance to do so in such a manner is harder to quantify. In a few instances Kinect called timeouts without being prompted to do so...apparently picking up on something the commentary team said.The one area that arguably needs the most attention going forward is rebounding which has proven to be inconsistent and at times frustrating. Other aspects such as not catching passes in stride, catch and shoot responsiveness, and boundary recognition are also identifiable as areas to improve upon. An occasionally disappearing scoreboard (that doesn't return) has been especially troublesome and a patch to fix that should be expected. Despite there always being room for improvement, with all that is right, there is very little reason to complain about the gameplay experience.*MyCareer ModeLast year NBA 2K12's MyPlayer, which is now known as MyCareer, fell into the 'Misses' section of the review. With 2K13 however a number of problems that seriously grinded on the experience have been addressed while the feature set has continued to expand.Teammate AI has been vastly improved along with the CPU's handling of the rosters. MyPlayers start with better ratings and can even go as high as first in the draft...keeping in mind that whatever player was originally selected in that spot in the draft will also be on that team.There are still some issues like the CPU not running plays or being unable to see the art on the court anyway, freezes (one already corrected on the 360 but others have been hit too), any passes being deemed \"bad\" that lead to assists not counting, a still at times frustrating on-court grading system, and poor looking representations of players that is screaming for something along the lines of EA's Game Face feature. For the most part though these things are no where near the severity of what had been wrong in the mode in past iterations.MyCareer continues to offer an admirable cultural experience that comes with off-the-court features. Though things like interviews and GM discussions are stiff and awkward having a style section, contracts that matter (\"VC\"), a number of endorsements, and the new Twitter feature which includes relevant commentary on events from journalists or \"celebrities\", really enhances the emotional attachment to progression through a career. The ability to add \"Signature Skills\" also takes things beyond just numbers for ratings and adds more personality. All-Star Weekend content is also integrated meaning the potential of participating in the Dunk Contest or 3PT Shootout is there, though limited only to those who pre-ordered the game.*Presentation and CommentaryOne of the significant influences to NBA 2K13 comes from Jay-Z's involvement. As executive producer he had input on areas such as the soundtrack, look of the menus, and even some of the game presentation elements. Some will like these touches while other's won't care for them but ultimately they don't really do any harm regardless. At the very least it's different.Commentary is once again excellent and oftentimes provides interesting information or even laughs. Clearly a lot of new audio was recorded and the flow and relevance of it is excellent. A few celebrities can be spotted courtside which is a neat thing to see. The broadcast presentation remains top notch. The graphics this year take a slight step back and the colors are still off for some teams. Loading times are brief and menu responsiveness is crisp.*Online PlayFinally online play is not a huge drag on the NBA 2K series. Neglecting such a huge element of the game over the years - and making excuses like being stuck with Dreamcast servers and code - was unacceptable particularly considering it's increased cultural stature. Online makes an unexpected appearance then in the 'Hits' section despite not being stellar. It's just so improved that it needs to be noted.Instances of lag and disconnects have been limited and connections into games have been much quicker. Considering the initial tracking of online performance was done in release week, which is typically when game's struggle under the pressure of high usage, it was especially encouraging. Games have been smooth and consistent making them exceedingly fun to play.The feature set online is still lacking however. MyPlayer Blacktop is a decent addition but one that isn't terribly compelling and can be boring when playing with random people. Crew mode, a favorite of a vocal contingent, didn't return this year. Even pauses by opponents during games still leave a user sitting around and unable to do anything but wait. Check out the full detailed online impressions here.*Historic and Olympic Teams2K Sports may be phasing out the presence of classic teams and players within NBA 2K but the impressive roster of those available is still worth considering. There is no central mode for them to be used in, and the Dream Team and 2012 Olympic team fall into that same boat, and that is somewhat disappointing. Allen Iverson was the big addition allowing for the 2001 76ers to be the only new historic team for 2K13. A few key names are also missing from various teams while Charles Barkley is only found on the Dream Team. Though there is no real centerpiece for any of these teams, including the complete Dream Team which is great to have, the depth and value of them is still there.With the company minimizing their place in the game, from the cover and marketing to their usefulness within, it's reasonable to expect that this may be the last year that they are a big part of the product or involved at all. Many of the players, including Michael Jordan, were believed to be locked in with three year contracts that would expire after 2K13. The big names of the past and their respective teams helped take the 2K series to a level that many never believed possible. With no competition and the level of regard the game is held at now they may be deemed unnecessary or cost-prohibitive going forward.*All-Star ContentAs far as the Dunk Contest goes 2K received some criticism for adapting a \"Guitar Hero\" concept. Is it far more simplified than past implementations? Yes...but that doesn't mean it's necessarily easy at the same time. The higher difficulty dunks will take a lot of practice and even a bit of luck to pull off. Because of the the action slowing dramatically in order to allow for the process to be completed there isn't a great rhythm to the contest but there is still a sense of satisfaction to completing each dunk and watching some crazy ones play out. The commentary during the All-Star Weekend events is also particularly great.The Three Point Contest is unquestionably the weakest event. There is a distinct lack of responsiveness - though that is somewhat alleviated beginning the shooting process immediately after releasing each shot and manually advancing to the next rack. It still doesn't provide a sense of proper rhythm. The All-Star Game and Rising Stars Challenge are just what one would expect of them. Their integration within MyCareer and Association is where they offer the most value. As of now there is no way to obtain the All-Star Weekend content for those who did not preorder the game.Undesignated*MyTeam ModeThe clone of Ultimate Team from various EA Sports titles, MyTeam, deserves at least some discussion for what it offers but didn't fit well in either the positive or the negative column. Someone like myself who currently doesn't have an emotional investment with one particular team can find a constantly changing and improving roster of players especially compelling. There are plenty of people out there who simply like the team-building aspect regardless. There's a reason why Ultimate Team makes EA hundreds of millions each year and many are shelling out cash now in MyTeam. It's a fun and compelling concept when executed well.The biggest problem with MyTeam however is super-teams have been formed killing the enjoyment of the process for those that want to earn their way through which is what the mode should be designed to reward with a sense of achievement. The matchmaking does no favors by placing teams compiled of backups against those that are stacked say eight deep with All-Stars and legends. Given that this is essentially an online mode - playing offline can earn \"VC\" to spend but has no point otherwise and there is no way to just play exhibition games against friends online - it's a big problem. It is not at all practical to invest the number of hours required to be able to compete with those who are paying their way to star-studded lineups.Aspects such as applying signature skills - which can make the same player perform differently than he would on other teams without that skill or with different skills - and a fluctuating market value of players throughout the season are interesting twists on the mode. Unfortunately there isn't any real incentive to not just buy the best players out there as lower rated ones really aren't all that much cheaper anyway. MyTeam will be fun for those who invest money in it while others who choose not to shell out cash will get quickly discouraged and move on to something else.Negatives*Association/Online AssociationAssociation mode in the NBA 2K series remains one of the better franchise modes out there but a lack of advancement, not just this year but now for several iterations, shouldn't be overlooked as a refresh of some sort is needed. This year Association took a backseat in favor of MyTeam mode. Even the All-Star content being integrated within Association was held back as a preorder incentive. The inability to turn off auto-saves has also frustrated some and no credit in the way of \"VC\" is provided for games completed.Online Association was not ready to be released in 2K12, and while a number of much needed admin controls have been added for 2K13, failing to address concerns like single anonymous vetoes scrapping trades and a number of other confusing elements make the mode a struggle to sustain long term. There is also now a stamina bug that causes players to be drained of energy only minutes into games. A website to tie into 2K13's Online Association has not launched.*Virtual CurrencyThroughout NBA 2K13 is the new economic system that is intended to reward time spent playing 2K13. Unfortunately it is the biggest detractor of enjoyment at the same time. \"VC\" penalizes those who want to play 2K13 organically and in turn dissuades more than it incentivizes.2K Sports has failed to communicate precisely enough how the \"VC\" system works - where it is earned and how much for doing what - and that confusion will play into frustration. Ultimately the currency system is the driving force behind progression in MyCareer mode and team building in MyTeam mode. In MyCareer it can be spent on improving attributes, adding skills, or fashion while MyTeam requires it to purchase players or boosters and maintain the roster.The prices are out of whack however with their true value. There is no reason to spend on expensive clothing or accessories when its better put to use on actually improving a player's attributes or skills. In MyTeam, even on day one, there were super-teams already ruining the experience for people who did not want to pull out their wallet to buy their own and compete. Getting quit on in an online game also means losing some VC earnings and payouts seem to be higher for one-off exhibition or blacktop games than those actually completed in MyPlayer. There is a huge imbalance in how many hours need to be invested to earn the amount of VC, upwards of 20 hours, to get a single All-Star for MyTeam when one could just be bought outright for $6. It just ends up making more sense to pay if that is the goal being worked towards.The way things are set up with \"VC\" is to encourage the purchase of it rather than properly earning it. It even can discourage someone from playing the game the way they want to play it as they'll be forced to choose between spending \"VC\" in one mode or the other - or split it which will mean slower rate of improvement in both.NBA 2K13 is the best all-around basketball video game to date. Where NBA 2K11 delivered a once-in-a-generation type experience that helped to cover up its deficiencies, and NBA 2K12 struggled to do so nearly as well with the lockout having a big impact on early enjoyment, 2K13 is well-rounded and avoids many issues that have plagued the series in the past. Even MyTeam will be fun for some people as will Association mode despite the lack of additions or advancements. Only the \"VC\" system really deserves negative scrutiny.With online play that at least works fairly consistently now, a deep and involving career mode, excellent gameplay and presentation, and the large selection of historic teams plus the Olympic squads, NBA 2K13 has become arguably the best value in all of sports gaming. It's a return to greatness that proves the NBA 2K series has earned its increased stature and not let up in the face of unchallenged success.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2012"}

Humanity has been ravaged by infection, the diseased prowl through the streets, waiting to prey on your living flesh at every turn!  ZombiU is built from the ground up to take full advantage of the WiiU and its revolutionary New Controller and will test your will to survive in a fear-fueled zombie Survival Horror First Person Shooter. Make every second count; you only get one chance.  Stay Human.","reviewerName":"Joshua","summary":"You will die... again, and again.","reviewText":"I'm sure that this is an unpopular opinion, however I'm beginning to get a bit turned off by the whole zombie craze.  I've always loved classic horror, but in movies and games it feels like the genre is starting to get a bit played out.  I almost picked something else up in place of ZombiU, but now I'm glad that I gave it a second glance.  I've played for a few hours now (although the way I play games that isn't saying much).In ZombiU you wake up in a post-apocalyptic London that has been infected with zombies.  You come into contact with another character over the a radio who helps you navigate the world.  He helps you hack into doors, CCTV systems, and provides general advice about how to stay alive.  You learn quickly that you are not the first or only agent that this character has sent out into the world--the moment you die you start over where you left off as the next character that he's brought into the game.  In doing so you can track down previous incarnations and collect your old goods.  In fact, the first task given to you when you're brought to your home base is to locate the body of your predecessor, kill it (now turned into a zombie), and retrieve their goods.ZombiU is played from a first person perspective, but it doesn't have the pace of many first person shooters.  Your goal is to navigate the world from the shadows, taking out zombies without alerting others to your presence.You've got a number of weapons and other items at your disposal.  You've got clubs (a cricket bat is your primary weapon in this grim world), guns, food, drink, door access cards, and other standard fare.  The GamePad controller gives ZombiU some new tricks.  As you navigate the world the GamePad gives you an interactive smart map a sonar beacon for finding enemies.  At the press of a button the GamePad turns into an intelligent blacklight scanner that shows you the location of items and doors around you and allows you to tag specific locations on the map.  The scanning mode is pretty cool.  Through most of the game you're using the GamePad like a normal controller that is enhanced with additional features, however when you activate the scanner you hold it in front of you, scanning the world around you (a fairly immersive experience).This game appears to have divided critics a bit because of the slow-paced gameplay and difficult fighting (you have to hack your way through the infected rather than seek out a good head-shot).  I find that ZombiU invokes a sort of desolate feel that such a world should have.  Everyone is caught off guard and, quite frankly, life sucks in this new zombie-infected world.  My biggest advice about choosing ZombiU would be consider your own level of patience.  If you are looking for a fast-paced shooter with an abundance of ammo ZombieU will most likely disappoint.  Personally, I love the look and feel of the game.If you go into ZombiU without any specific expectations I think that most people will be pleasantly surprised.  I certainly was.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2012"}

I play Fallout, Gears of war, Crysis and other games with no problems.The controls are cumbersome such as, you have to crouch to pick up ammo or other items off the floor. Why not make us press a button to breath?Some mechanical doors won't open unless you flip a switch across the room? There was no electricity required to open the door!! This made simple tasks such as going short distances overcomplicated. You may clear a room and when you get to the door, it won't open even though your character reaches for the handle. It doesn't tell you what to do so you re stuck wandering around a room trying to find an alt exit or a switch that has nothing to do with the door.Some doors push you out of the way when you open them which slows you down from getting out of the cold. Some pass right through you which just makes it even more frustrating.You will shoot an enemy multiple times and it won't be effected. It will still walk right up to you and kill you. Meanwhile you are stuck in a small room with nowhere to go (strafe shooting - not allowed).I walked up to a switch and flipped it. It went to a cut scene showing the enemy coming after me. I found my character had been magically transported to a different area of the room with nowhere to go.Poorly made game.I only gave it 2 stars for the graphics but you can paint a piece of poo and it's still poo.If you want a game based off the cold and horror, buy The Thing.

Garrelts","summary":"Believe the Hype, Killzone 2 is the Real Deal","reviewText":"It's no secret that Killzone 2 is one on the most hyped games of the current generation of consoles. Since it's first appearance as a teaser trailer years ago the game has garnered a lot of attention - both good and bad. I'll admit that I was a bit skeptical only because games that receive so much pre-release hype rarely live up to promises or expectations. Having beaten the single player campaign and spent a reasonable amount of time online I can safely say that Killzone 2 is one of the finest console First Person Shooters I've played.Graphically the game pushes the PS3's hardware to new highs. Arguably K2 is the best looking game on the PS3. Character models, the environment around you, heck even the load screens are impressive. What's even more pleasing is that the game is absolutely intense. Battles occur on a large and breathtaking scale with dozens of ISA (friendly) and Helghast (enemy) forces battling it out. Another nice touch is that the environment features destructible areas. Shooting at enemy hiding behind a pillar for instance will start blowing pieces of the pillar away.The storyline is probably K2's biggest shortfall though given the genre it's not surprising or unprecedented. For anyone who played the first game you'll know immediately what's going on. For everyone else, expect a standard story with they typical plot twists. Though K2 doesn't really explore anything new with it's storyline it does entertain and provide reasonable motivation to press on.Next up the controls. After reading some other reviews I was surprised by how many people cited the controls as lacking. Or more specifically it seems that most people are comparing the controls in KZ2 to Call of Duty 4. So let me knock this out right now. Killzone 2 is not Call of Duty 4. It is an entirely different game with it's own unique configuration and learning curve. If you go in expecting Call of Duty 4 you're only fooling yourself. That said the controls present no problem to me. Thankfully Guerrilla included several unique customization options. So tailor them to your liking and get in the game and learn the controls. Why people go in expecting other game developers to essentially copy games they've already played is beyond my understanding. Embrace the new experience and if you can't get over it, go and play Call of Duty 4!The online portion of Killzone 2 is just as well polished as the rest of the game. It's difficult to describe just how deep the customization system truly is but I'll try. First, the game features the ranks Private through General. Killing enemies is only one way of earning points. There are many other game modes including \"Seek and Destroy\", \"Assassination\", \"Body Count\" and more. Each of these present unique ways to score points. Additionally the game rewards players with ribbons upon completing certain criteria. Ribbons add up and eventually unlock medals. Medals grant your player with certain abilities. For example the \"Kill Count\" ribbon is awarded for killing 10 enemy players during a match. Collect 8 Kill Count ribbons to unlock the \"Natural Born Killer\" medal which grants you the ability to carry more grenades. Simple, rewarding and addicting.If you have any doubts left about the quality of this game forget them. Go and buy it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0038N0A24","reviewerName":"tvtv3 \"tvtv3\"","summary":"Great Family Friendly Video Game Based Upon a Movie","reviewText":"Like many adults who have played TOY STORY 3 THE VIDEO GAME, I originally didn't think the game would be very fun to play.  Though there are exceptions, usually video games based upon a particular movie are terrible, just look at the SPIDER-MAN 3 and IRON MAN video games for proof.  Not only that, but because the characters are trademarked developers are usually limited with how much they can do with the characters.  Also, since the TOY STORY franchise is owned by Disney and Disney is a purveyor of merchandise for kids, I didn't think the game would be at all interactive or exciting.  I was wrong.TOY STORY 3 loosely follows the movie of the same name.  The difference is that Woody and company are talking with Bonnie's toys and telling them the adventures they had to get to her house.  Instead of just copying the exact story from the movie, the game fills in some of the gaps in the movie.  In certain instances it messes with the congruity of the story, but since this is a game largely aimed at children and the developers had to create it around a loose knowledge of the movie's plot, those few inconsistencies can be overlooked.The story mode (campaign) of the game has 8 different sections.  You can't continue onto a new section until finishing the first.  However, there are all sorts of rewards littered throughout these levels so once you complete a level you can go back and replay it to pick up the rewards you missed on the first run.  The game starts off with a Western feel as Woody and Buzz race to save a train full of orphans from the nasty Dr. Porkchop (Hamm).  After that there are levels in Andy's house, a space-level for Buzz that plays like a video game in itself, a level with Woody trying to fight off a wicked witch (Dolly) at Bonnie's, a couple of different levels at the day care, a level at the garbage dump, and the final level is a fantasy level with Bonnie and Andy playing with the toys and Buzz fights the Wicked Witch (Dolly) and a bunch of man-eating muffins.Most of the games in the story mode are of a platform style.  However, there are some puzzle and shooter missions, too.  In some of the missions you have to play back and forth between Woody, Buzz, and Jessie in order to complete a mission.Beside the story mode, there's also Toybox mode.  This is sandbox mode of play.  You can play either as Woody, Buzz, of Jessie as the sheriff of a growing town.  You earn money for completing a variety of tasks and are able to purchase additions to the town and keep it growing. There are a variety of side missions you can complete as well as the main Toybox storyline.  Characters from previous TOY STORY films, such as Stinky Pete, Bo Peep, and Wheezy can all be found in the Toybox.The overall graphics look just like the films; they are brilliant.  Except for the main protagonists and a few other characters, the voices of the characters are performed by the original actors from the films.The storyline setting could be finished by a serious gamer in a few hours. For a more casual gamer, it'll take about 5-6 hours. The toybox part of the game takes about the same amount of time to finish.  However, for kids it will probably take them longer.I enjoyed playing TOY STORY 3.  I thought it was a good movie tie-in video game that wasn't a complete copy of the film it is based, but there's not so much new content that it makes the game unfamiliar to younger fans of the film.  It does a good job of having a nice mix of features that appeal directly to kids and a few that there parents might enjoy.  It's a high-quality family video game that parents and children alike can enjoy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2010"}

But Luigi has once in awhile been known to have a escapade away from Mario. That showed a decade ago with Luigi's Mansion, the launch game for the Nintendo Gamecube back in 2001. The game was underrated but had maintained a steady cult following. But it has been a longtime since there has been a follow-up to the classic game. There was never a sequel to the game for the Nintendo Wii, instead the return comes to the Nintendo 3DS with Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon. The question is for Luigi fans, is the game worth while. Well, it is a haunting yes and a fearful scare from Luigi himself.Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon does deliver what fans of the original Nintendo Gamecube game wanted in a game. This time around Professor E-Gad is seeking help from Luigi as he is trying to study friendly ghosts during a eventful moon. But sadly, the moon and the ghosts get possessed by the devilish King Boo who takes control of the harvesting Dark Moon and Luigi gets to return on a ghost hunting spree. This time around Luigi has to use his puzzle solving skills and quests through 5 different mansions hunting different ghosts from traditional boos to ghosts spooks and dog ghosts. There are some new features as well like a multiplayer challenge called Scarescaper where you and your friends can go on a ghostbusting spree, and try to escape first to the bottom of the tower. Graphically, the game does stand up very well to the Gamecube original, and the sound and control of the game measure up nicely. Sadly though, there could have been more for the multiplayer action to draw more people in. There could've been a multiplayer in the main adventure to measure up to the game, like Luigi's past games with Mario. Still, it does measure up to the challenge for any single player action.All in all, despite a few flaws Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon is definitely worth playing from beginning to end. I have always found the original game to be challenging but fun to master. This time around, it definitely is up to the fun, especially for anyone that wants to scare up to the task. If you have played the Nintendo Gamecube game, you'll definitely be up to this scary good game. But for those who have never played the original game, might be uncomfortable with the ghost hunt. For them, I recommend you play the original Nintendo Gamecube title first, and see if you are up to the game. But for those that want to have a second haunt from King Boo, this would be one worth trying.Graphics: B 1/2+Sound: BControl: BFun & Enjoyment: B 1/2+ for single player; C+ for multiplayerOverall: B 1/2-","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2013"}

When a game is great and they make a sequel one of three things can happen:1. The sequel just stinks it up,2. The sequel is more of the same, or3. The sequel improves upon an already great formula.Obviously, option 1 is bad and option 3 is great.  But most sequels (GRAW2 included) fall in option 2 with hints of 1 and 3.  GRAW2 is a very short game with the same graphics and gameplay as GRAW and a few improved tweaks on the multiplayer game.  By itself, GRAW2 would be a good, albeit short game.  But as a sequel with a year's addtional production I just expect more.  This game feels more like a $60 expansion pack than a full game.  With the explosion of online content for console games I expect to see this kind of crap less and less as a stand alone product and more as additional content.  GRAW2 is good but I docked a star because it feels like another piece of subpar development and exploitation by the game megacompanies.I'll get off my soapbox now.  If you really liked GRAW then wait until this goes down to $25 or $30 and then buy it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2007"}

The game's soundtrack and ambience were great, as everyone says, and the vast empty world that you run around in, withtout any \"minor\" enemies, is poetic and beautiful.  The developers even took the trouble to create an original language for the game (listen closely to the in-game dialogue), and that lends life and credibility to the world they have created.It's rare that I get a triumphant sense of accomplishment when I beat a video game boss, but that's exactly what I got every time I beat a Colossus.  Sure, some of the Colossi were rather frustrating to figure out, downright infuriating even, but I guess that's the point here: it's you against the world, literally.Having said that, let me gripe a bit here: I wish they could have designed the main character a bit better.  His animations are stiff and robotic, he's less athletic than a couch potato (i.e. me), and his repertoire of moves/abilities is incredibly limited.  And speaking of limited: I keep thinking that the hero's horse could have used some tweaking too.  The horse fights me too much; it's not the easiest \"vehicle\" I've controlled in a game.And let me rant a bit about the visuals.  The frame rate is a bit choppy, and I have to admit they made my eyes hurt after playing the game for an hour or more in one sitting.  And what is up with the camera?  Like my horse, it is constantly fighting me!  Whenever I use the right analog stick to move the camera, it tries to automatically re-center itself, and I have to constantly wrestle with it if I want to take a good look at my surroundings.  I think they should have given me an option to toggle this re-centering thing on or off.  I mean, the game HAS a re-center button, for crying out loud.But these are minor gripes, really.  SOTC's positives far outweigh the negatives, and it's really rare that I actually feel like I'm IN the game.

The best yet!","reviewText":"From my video game review blog:  [...]Ezio Auditore di Firenze is back for his second adventure, and the third Assassin's Creed game from Ubisoft.  While his mission was complete in his mind at the end of Assassin's Creed II, a few of his confidantes didn't think so.  The additon of a few new Borgia members, most notably Cesare, become the main villians.  I actually purchased this game first, before the first two games in the series, but waited a few months to try out the single player as I had never played an Assassin's Creed game before.  It always seemed so daunting and seemed like there were too many actions to perform and not enough buttons and the game too vast.  Once I got the hang of the multiplayer, I gave the single player a try.After debating a while, even though I had heard you didn't need to play the previous iterations, I purchased and completed the first two games, aptly titled: Assassin's Creed and Assassin's Creed II.  I'm really glad I did, as it added more to the whole experience of Brotherhood through some inside jokes and older characters returning.  I would recommend at least playing ACII, before Brotherhood.I was a big Altair fan from the beginning, so I was a bit disappointed when Ezio was introduced.  In fact, even after completing Assassin's Creed II (platinum trophy!) he still hadn't won me over.  So when I popped in my Brotherhood disc, I was expecting to be a little disappointed.  Needless to say, Ezio really won me over with this game (the Assasssin's Creed: Revelations E3 trailer helped a bit too).GameplayAfter being dropped in a battle scene where you need to just press buttons, Brotherhood opens with you replaying the final moments from Assassin's Creed II, in which Ezio must escape with his Uncle Mario.  The game quickly returns to Monteriggioni, which had changed a bit, however, with a few simple memories to make sure you still remember how to control Ezio, the main game begins.  The quaint town is quickly under attack, so Ezio and friends need to escape.After a brief interlude with Desmond, Lucy and the 2012 crew, the game, then turns its sights to Rome.  After AC II, with all of the different towns to visit, I was a bit surprised to see Brotherhood only featuring one city.  This is definitely the Liberty City version of Rome, which seems absolutely huge (makes Florence seem like Forli).  Within Rome, however, there are nicer parts, poorer parts, and even countryside settings, which reminded me of the original Assassin's Creed game, with the variations.The missions are what you'd expect, however I loved the variety in Brotherhood.  It wasn't all about the killing.  Two words sum up why this game is the best in the series:  Full Synchronization.  Someone not as enamored with the AC series could still enjoy this game, but potential \"couch assassin's\" get so much more out of it.  Each mission could be completed how the user preferred and still progress through the story, but those who take their games seriously could opt to carry out the mission the way Ezio would, and achieve Memory Full Synchronization. This could mean do the mission in a certain time limit, use a particular weapon, don't be detected, don't use the roof, don't kill anyone, etc.  The first time I only achieved 50% synchronization on a memory sequence, I immediately paused and restarted the mission, sometimes multiple times (you know who you are \"Hell on Wheels\").This game is loaded with optional side missions, as well.  There are still the Tomb Raideresque missions (this time called Follower's of Romulus Lairs - which are worth it for the bonus after they are all completed), the search for Subject 16's video, feathers to collect (only 10 this time), Borgia flags (101, but you can purchase maps), the usual contracts (Assassination, Courtesan, Thieves), Guild Challenges (Assassination, Courtesan, Thieves), and the capturing of Borgia Towers under command from a Borgia leader (Some fight, others run and hide, leaving you to wait until a guard shift change to challenge them again) . The addition of the crossbow, throwing multiple knives at a time, Leonardo missions (where you try out some of his inventions - Renaissance tanks!), and horseback riding as it should be, make things even more interesting and enjoyable.But, what would the game be without a Brotherhood of assassins?  For every Borgia Tower toppled, you can recruit one assassin (male or female, even).  These can then be trained (by being sent on missions in other places) and upgraded with better armor and weapons until they reach the ultimate ranking of assassin.  When the assassins are needed, they can be called upon to help you battle forces or dispose of foes without you being spotted or bothered.  They also have a power called arrow storm, which releases a flurry of arrows out of nowhere into multiple targets in your vicinity.  While the training of recruits was quite basic, as you had to pick proper missions to send them, resulting in experience points and subsequent leveling up, they certainly come in handy.The story progresses nicely, with even a few surprises thrown in.  Ezio is one determined dude, but you do get to see a softer side of him as he matures, especially when it's not all about the assassinations.  Where it does seem to lag, is unfortunately in the 2012 sections.  The interactions between Desmond and Lucy seemed forced, while Shaun is even more irritating than before.  Plus, guiding Desmond around, seems to lack much of the fluidity that Ezio posesses.  At least those sections are few and far between.  Yes, I did achieve 100% Synchronization in all missions, including every side mission, and often liked just roaming around finding treasures, flags, etc, so that my 55 hours invested in the game, really felt like around half of that.The fact that this game finally has multiplayer, has to be mentioned.  The fact that it is actually very good definitely deserves higher praise.  Multiplayer in Brotherhood is a totally different experience than I'm used to.  There are a variety of modes, some where you're on your own (Wanted), and some where you're part of a small team (Alliance, Manhunt).  Anyone looking for a run and stab kind of game should look elsewhere.  The mulitplayer modes do a great job of mirroring the single player experience, but kicked up a few notches.  It's all about blending in and sneaking around.  In Wanted, you're searching for your target, but are also being targeted by one or more of your opponents.  The more obscure your kill, the more points you'll get.  This is a game where you need to sit up and concentrate!In Manhunt, for example, for one round, you and your teammates are the hunters, but in the next round become the hunted.  Any mode I've played definitely gets the blood pumping.  It does have to be noted that actually getting into a multiplayer game can be tortuous.  Sometimes it connects with the correct amount of users and the game starts right up, but more often than not, you are waiting 15-20 minutes before you get a full group of 6 or 8.  Extremely frustrating, to say the least.  It's tough going at the beginning being lower leveled, but once you get to level 29 (poison is now an option), I would think things pick up (I'm currently at level 25).GraphicsThe cities are quite detailed, but often a little repetitive.  If you don't mind that kind of thing (I didn't), you'll be fine.  I did like the differences in regions, from the buildings, to the clothes the people wore.  There is, however, quite a bit of pop-up when on a horse.  I didn't notice it so much at the beginning of the game, but later on when I was trying to avoid certain groups of troops, all of a sudden a guy would pop in on top of a building's roof.  I'm not really a huge graphics person and I was so immersed in the story, that it wasn't a game killer.SoundThe city is vibrant with sound, ranging from people getting annoyed that you ran into them, to those mystified by your agile grace, and the return engagement of those annoying minstrels (which I just tackled this time around).  Also, the score does pick up, especially in tense moments, with the correct mood music.Replay ValueThere is A TON to do in this game, especially if you'd like FULL SYNCHRONIZATION on all missions, and the additional sidequests.  I'd say a quick run through might take around 15 hours, and going for everything around 30-40 hours (or my 55 hours).  Quite a lot, I think.  Ubisoft could have just put out a filler game for half of that.  The multiplayer adds infinite replay, in my opinion.  That is when you get connected.RATING:9As enjoyable a game as I've come across, although I am an AC fanboy.  Definitely the best in the series to date.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2011"}

What makes this game so great is its open world environment that comes with so many different challenges, an in depth story that focus on Ezio and Desmond, real historical characters combined with fictional ones, real combat sequences as well as supernatural ones towards the end of the game and being able to recruit your own assassins. Recruiting your own assassins makes Ezio more powerful because in many situations he doesn't even have to fight, his assassins will fight for him. Even the different challenges from using Leonardo's war machines adds an originality to the game. I did not like the way the game ended because it did not make any sense but I assume that will be explained in the next Assassin's Creed game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMB3","description":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timemay be the greatest single-player video game ever created in any genre. It's that good. Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide.

Terrorists operate openly, killing thousands; drugs, disease, and pollution kill even more. The world's economics are close to collapse, and the gap between the insanely wealthy and the desperately poor has grown to the size of the Grand Canyon. Worst of all, an ages-old conspiracy bent on world domination has decided that the time is right to emerge from the shadows and take control. No one believes the conspiracy exists--no one but you.In this thrilling role-playing adventure, you play the part of J.C. Denton, a powerful, nanotechnologically augmented antiterrorist agent. It's up to you to stop the conspirators from achieving their goals. But this world is full of lies and betrayal, a world where nothing is as it seems and entire nations can seemingly be turned against you at the push of a button. To succeed, you must travel the globe in a quest for knowledge, develop your character's nanotech augmentations and strengths as you see fit, build a network of allies to assist you, and determine when stealth and strategy are more important than action. And each time you think you've got the mystery solved, the game figured out, there's another, deeper mystery to be unraveled. You will never know whom to trust, who your friends are, who's in the conspiracy, and who's innocent. Maybe no one is.","reviewerName":"NeuroSplicer","summary":"DEUS MANIFESTARE!","reviewText":"During this ongoing Dark Age for PC gaming, when corporate Greed has coupled with pseudo-DRM schemes to stifle any original idea or creative process, I found myself, again and again, reaching for the classics. And DEUS EX is definitely a classic masterpiece.Set in the near future, infused with equal doses of cyberpunk mentality and noir atmosphere, playing like an FPS with strong RPG elements (inventory, character development, modifiable equipment, secondary quests) - and yet one is better off avoiding shooting more often than not! Whoever played DEUS EX can attest that this game will stay with you. Forever. And rightly so.This is a game infused with life. The characters act natural. The script is brilliantly paranoid. And the whole setting will immerse you into this twisted world of technological possibilities and power.In a perfect world, David Lynch would have realized William Gibson'sNeuromancer.

Sea life swimming around, racing full speed over still, mirror like water...The visuals are sweet. The coastline is sometimes a tad glitchy, but you won't care once you're off the starting line. The control takes some getting used to, but i thought it became natural very quickly. THe only problem with Blue storm is that around the time you get the hang of everything and really start enjoying it, it's over. The tracks are huge and challenging, with a good amount of secrets and variety, ut there aren't enough of them to keep you from finishing the game in a weekend if that. It's a shame cux it didn't feel like Expert circuit was the hardest it could get. Races can sometimes be very frustrating, hit a buoy or a walll and in no time flat you'll be in last place, facing the wrong way. You can recover, but knowing how to use turbo and avoid other racers wakes is the key. Anyone who takes the time to learn each course's nuances in Time Attack will have no trouble. I would've enjoyed multiplayer racing more, if My friend Greg and Jon weren't constantly crashing into things, blaming it on the control. Amateurs, it's too bad there aren't more options to customize your racer. ONly two or three of the eight racers handle well enough to be of any real use. I wish there were more to it, but i still thought it was great fun. Arcade racing fans, this one's for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2001"}

It was better than I expected and I keep seeing this game appear in forum discussions about underrated games. I feel that this game should be played more than it actually was, but I understand why most people turned away from this game. There are 14 chapters in the game, plus an epilogue that you can't actually play through, but you get 25G just for watching it. Instead of the tutorial being something short, the first four chapters are basically a giant tutorial. It isn't until you can use your Cloud, then the game gets fun.Pros:- A very compelling story with three quite memorable main characters fighting a post apocalyptic war against Mechs (robots). Even though it's a cliched story, they execute better than most and make it into a unique adventure.- Great voice acting for a video game (Andy Serkis from Lord of the Rings plays one of the main characters and also directed the game)- The combat system is simple yet fun. (Basically hack 'n' slash).- Better than most linear progression games, as there is a little room to explore(finding masks) and there are a few puzzles mixed in.- The cloud is really fun to use(when you can).- Boss fights are epic and fun.- Uses Unreal Engine graphics and looks very nice(Shouldn't really effect anything considering, it's a game and not a movie, but for those who care).Cons:- The controls (especially while platforming) are a tad floaty(I did use multiple controllers) and sometimes (especially if you're a button-masher) your actions get cutoff. So you really have to time your controls.- It wasn't one of those games I just wanted to keep playing, I found it was more fun if I took a break after just one stage.- There are only two collectible achievements (which is a good thing), but finding all the tech orbs really sucks as you have to go to the exact spot in whichever stage it is to get the orbs. Remember that this is a linear progression action game. This means that like most linear progression games, you can't backtrack most of the time. You have to be extremely thorough when searching an area.- While the boss battles are epic, there really are only three bosses.Buy this game if:- You want to enjoy a very immersive game that has a pretty original twist on the usual post-apocalyptic human versus robot story.- Have patience(to survive the first four chapters). It does move very fast after you can use the Cloud.- Enjoy hack 'n' slash/action games.Don't buy this game if:- You want everything to be fast paced.- You want a crazy amount of action, while the fighting is fast paced and epic, there aren't gigantic armies of enemies and after chapter 10 you get help from the other characters while fighting.- It is more than $30.Other:- Took me a week to beat the game on Hard difficulty. I got 715G on one playthrough, however I did not play the DLC.- Like I said, it's very slow start, but it is definitely worth it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2013"}

With the major hype of Heavenly Sword, and luke warm sales to the crappy Kinect Joy Ride, and the controversy of DMC it's struggling. Enslaved is probably NT's most successful game mainly commercially due to it's better marketing. The story is probably the game's strongest point, as well as character development and combat takes a back seat.You play as Monkey a guy who escapes a slave ship that's crash landing in post-apocalyptic New York. Along the way to escape he finds himself stuck, and enslaved, but a young woman named Trip who needs his muscle to get her back home further west. The relationship between Trip and Monkey is what makes you keep playing, and their constant fight for freedom is heart warming.The combat had a lot of potential, but after the first chapter you'll get tired of it. It's the same two combos over and over again with a crappy camera that can't stay put. Sure the angles are cinematic, but if you get backed into a corner it's nauseating. The camera can't stay put at all, and it leads to cheap deaths, and frustration when mech after mech is beating you down. You can charge an EMP burst to disable shields and make the mechs temporarily stunned, and this is essential to defeating them due to their constant blocking and shielding. You can command Trip to use a decoy so long range mechs shoot at that instead of you so you can climb around and get to them. Some mechs have weak points that allow faster kills, and you can use your staff as a projectile weapon equipped with plasma rounds and EMP rounds. This staff is also used for puzzles and exploring as well.So combat is pretty finicky, but exploring can be a blast thanks to huge sprawling vistas, and easy to see glowing handholds and what not. Occasionally the camera gets in the way here or controls can be a bit touchy, but it's not nearly as frustrating as the combat. You'll notice orange orbs floating around everywhere and these are used for upgrades, but you can only upgrade if Trip is in the vicinity. There are some points where you can use Monkey's Cloud hoverboard and there are a few exciting moments like chasing a giant mech, but this feels a bit tacked on.The game also has pacing issues since the first chapter is epic then the next six or seven are the same repetitive area-to-area beating mechs up, jumping around affair. It's a shame that Enslaved feels like it's only 80% complete because it needed a lot more polish. Even though the game looks good technically it's pretty bland with just lots of green everywhere. There's no unique art style or anything and this is a shame. The mechs all look the same and the enemy variety is less than half a dozen. Boss fights some times feel epic, but they repeat often, so Enslaved is iffy on every subject. I do recommend this as a great weekend rental or bargain purchase.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Heavy Rain, being one of them and having unique story and gameplay elements, was a must buy for me. After finishing the game and unlocking 2 different endings, here is what I thought.*****************PROS*************A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE: As most of you have gathered from the Heavy Rain trailer, the game is about unveiling who is the mysterious Origami Killer. Unlike most games these days, this one is quite different in the sense that you just don't go around killing people to progress through the game, but rather you participate in different scenarios to experience the story and solve the mystery of who the killer is. Like me, if you are tired of playing same type of games over and over again, this is a great break.ACTION/REACTION GAMEPLAY: Majority of the game you control your character by showing specific button commands (O, X, right analogue stick movement etc.) or button command combinations and thus accomplish different goals by finishing different actions. There are a lot of scenarios in the game where you are in jeopardy or are trying to escape the danger and these are the time game uses quicktime command input (i.e. like God of War games, press O,X etc. quickly when prompted on the screen. These quick-time events do a wonderful job conveying emotions of urgency and stress to the player. Depending on what events you complete and how successful you are avoiding or overcoming danger dictates the end result of the given scenario as well as the final ending you unlock. I personally loved this feature of the game.TOUCHING AND SUSPENSEFUL STORY: Before I played the game the story was my biggest concern I was hoping that they don't make the killer obvious or lame and I have to say I am not disappointed. The killer was not the one I suspected and the story did a wonderful job to veil him/her. The game also does a wonderful job leading you to the killer and joining the loose ends. Can't tell you more without spoiling.DEEP CHARACTER DESIGN: You get to play as four different characters. Great attention to details has been when it comes to designing these characters' looks, personalities and attitudes. In addition there are other characters that you don't control, but are designed just as nicely. This variety of characters contributes greatly to create suspense, thrill and exhilaration in the story.SOLID VOICE ACTING: Not only these characters are nicely designed, the development has spared no cost hiring good voice actors and scriptwriters. There hasn't been a single moment in the game where I have found lines or voice acting lame, on the contrary it is as genuine as they come.FOUR DIFFERENT ENDINGS: These days games are hesitant to pay full price for the game that consist of mainly single player due to lack of replayability. That is not the case for this game. While it doesn't have multiplayer, it does have 4 different endings. Depending on how you play the game, one or more of these endings may be unlocked. This will encourage you to play the game again experimenting different things.MOVE ADDITION: Not something I care about, but to those who do, you can now play this game with move.***************CONS****************USE OF SIXAXIS CONTROLS: This is my one and only complain with the game. I hate sixaxis controls. While they work nicely 95% of the time, the 5% of the time they didn't work for me, I found that to be a bit frustrating. If I want to waggle my mote, I would play wii. I truly wish there was some way to turn sixaxis off.*************CONCLUSION*************Contrary to the con I described, this is a great game. If you like mystery, suspense and thriller and don't mind quick-time events this is definitely the game for you. I would say it is a must buy, but if you don't at least give it a rent.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2011"}

Many people initially said the game was a terrible SP game and/or had impossible boss fights.. to sum it up just an overall lack of polish.  I was a giant fan of Lost Planet  and at first glance  Lost Planet 2 really has nothing to do with the original, but this is completely wrong.  Lost planet 2 is a game that might not be a greatest hit or all time classic but it is a lot of fun and provides many different avenues for said enjoyments.Gameplay:  Lost planet 2 handles similar to the original.  Controls at first feel a little strange  and there are times you'll want to toss a grenade but oddly your character won't.  This isn't broken mechanics but simply trying to make things realistic.  You go to toss a grenade and get shot in the face you get interrupted.  The game wants you to play smart and not stand out in the open like Rambo.  Anyhow, the game funnels you through 4 different storyline moments with 6 different scenario areas.  Snow covered areas, jungles, underwater  etc.  Very diverse and just when it might start feeling repetitive or old  the game changes locations to keep it fresh.  To enhance gameplay each chapter contains \"good job\" awards that are mostly hidden... such as get headshots, or transfer T-eng.  VS kill streaks etc.  These make for a sort of challenge to partake in while fighting monsters and enemies.  Boss battles are impressive as these Cat-G akrid made the monsters from Lost Planet look like normal enemies.  They are a lot of fun to battle and you can tackle them quite a few different ways really.** With Patch 1.02  recently released in the past few months  changes to the game have been made.  On Easy and Normal (solo) the game is easier to manage where as in the past.. many bosses were hard to solo and Episode 3  was just absolutely ridiculous (the infamous TRAIN)  This has been resolved.  Co-Op campaign returns the difficulty to how it used to be, with Hard and Extreme getting a small difficulty boost! **Sound/Story: Awesome sound effects.  Guns sound strong and akrid sound creepy.  Voice acting in some spots can be a little silly, especially when you unlock Femme Fatales Faction and can play as female characters.  Female characters actually have male voices LOL  that is a bit of a disappointment as it wouldn't of been so hard to get a female voice actress in there for a handful of cut scenes.  The story takes place over 6 episodes w/ chapters breaking up the episode; and picks up after Lost Planet 1.  Basically rebel factions have sprung up and are raiding NEVEC and causing havoc.  As the story unfolds you find there is more going on than you think and there is a reason the planet has been changed so much. The opening to 6-3 is pretty epic I think and links Episode 1-5 together nicelyGraphics/Presentation: Amazing graphics.  Some of the best out there I think at the moment still.  The Cat G akrid just look amazing and there is such fine detail.  The game is well presented also, and sets up nicely.  You can play Offline,  Playstation Network  or play Multiplayer Online.  There is even an Offline Training setup which tests your skills and has Bot based MP matches.  The bots actually don't play fair reminding me of Unreal Tournament set to Hard or higher difficulty.  A lot of fun I think, trying to overcome a cheating AI.  To setup a Co-Op match all you do is campaign w/ playstation network enabled.  Set your private slots and go.  if you set up 0 private..  at anytime a random person can join your game for instant co-op fun.  Set up 3 private , you play by yourself unless you invite friends  Very simple and works nicelyLength/Replay:  The game has some good length to it.  I think it took me around 8hrs to complete on Normal , but I took my time and was learning where things are.  Replay is amazing.  I've played this game non-stop since getting it.  There is so much to do!  *Voice supported Co-Op  *Multiplayer modes  *Career points to level up factions for unlockables  *Collect ? boxes in campaign to get money, weapons, emotes etc  *use money to play the slot machine for goodies  *Customizable character skins, weapon loadouts, emotes, names, abilities etc  I started as a normal character, changed myself to WESKER from Resident Evil 5, then changed myself to a two legged Akrid fighter which has made my friends LOL .  There is a lot of fun in this game especially if friends own the game, and even if you have none, I set the game to Open (no private slots) and within a minute I had 3 random people in my game ready to blow up some akrid.  MP also is still alive and kicking, took less than a minute to get a 8 v 8 team game goingOverall Score: 87%A great game especially now at this low price.  You could say Lost Planet 2  got \"lost\" in the mix.  A bad launch, w/ bad reviews and a unbalanced solo campaign at first hurt it, but now the game really has matured to a point in which you can have constant fun and almost want to beg Capcom to make a Lost Planet 3.  The reason why it gets 4 stars (87%) is simply because despite all the fixes you will find a few parts in which the game clearly needed more polishing that never was addressed.  Minor but playing \"solo\" it kills the pacing totally.  Not nearly enough though to cost it to many points.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2010"}

It's the one game that's actually taken me a month to beat and I'm still enjoying playing through it.The story of Demon Souls is simple enough though has a bit more depth than you'd think. NPC's are sparse but what few there are set the dark mood of the game perfectly. There aren't really any plot twists or anything like that but you won't care. Your character is there to defeat the big-bad and that's pretty much your entire motivation. Demon Souls is NOT a story heavy RPG.Demon Souls is an RPG with a heavy emphasis of action. Though instead of just simply hacking and slashing your way through a level, there's a tremendous amount of strategy involved. It may not seem so at first but every motion you make with the controller, every  slash, dodge, roll, jump makes all the difference in the world. Even the weakest of enemies has the potential to kill you if you're not careful. You can switch to wielding any weapons two-handed style for wider archs (which all look and control differently), you can block or bash guys with a shield, and fighting with two weapons means LITERALLY having to control both weapons at the same time. This is by far the best combat engine developed for an RPG video game and I hope great gaming developers take note.Oh yeah, if you haven't heard yet, you will die ALOT in this game. In the first stage I died at least 40 times (I lost count after that), and if you die you lose your souls (souls are your exp/money you use to level up and buy items) and have to start over at the beginning. This is where the difficulty comes in. You CAN however fight your way back to where you died to regain your souls again which IS possible. You do also keep all your levels and stats though the game thankfully has you relying on SKILL instead of stats. What's even better is your souls STACK so that you gain everything you lost, plus keep everything you gathered so you're twice as powerful as what you were. Death is kind of your GRINDING aspect.Demon Souls is without a doubt the best and most satisying gaming experience I've had on the PS3. It probably wont be everyone's gig, but if you're up to the challenge you won't be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2009"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J5YW","description":"The award winning makers of Mass Effect are bringing the Mass Effect franchise to Playstation 3. Two years after Commander Shepard repelled invading Reapers bent on the destruction of all organic life, a mysterious new enemy has emerged. On the fringes of known space, entire human colonies are vanishing. As Commander Shepard, you must assemble the galaxy's deadliest team and stop the most terrifying threat humanity has ever faced.","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Superb","reviewText":"I am a PS3 owner so this is the only Mass Effect game I have, but I think it's great. At its core its an action 3rd person shooter; you pilot a huge spaceship and you can visit numerous planets in the galaxy, which either contain friendly populations with shops and bars, or deserted places that are either crash sites, prisons, frozen wastelands, deserts, and so on. Any planet that does not have a town is typically a \"mission\", for example, you need to go to locations to free an enslaved community, or destroy a crazed robot that is guarding a mineshaft. The game does have a plot: you play as Commander Shepard (male or female, it's up to you), and you have been recruited to investigate why an alien race is stealing thousands of people from colonies and taking them away. To do this you need to recruit team members. so the first 75% of the game sees you travelling to far-flung locations and trying to meet these characters and carry out whatever task is required to get them to join you. These recruitment tasks are the story missions of the game, and while they vary in content, they usually involve a certain amount of similarity, because each mission is basically a journey from point A to point B, during which time you either have to kill any resistance you meet on the way, or sneak past, or unlock things, or help the new recruit to find something. Some of the most fun are the more unusual, for example in one you have to become bait for a predatory lover who always kills their victims after seducing them. Will you say all the right things...will you agree or decline to drink the spiked cocktail...I enjoyed this one. But for the most part is it about fighting. Action is in 3rd person, Shepard has an impressive arsenal of firepower and some telekenetic powers. You usually use the plentiful cover that the detailed environments provide to overcome onslaughts of enemies, which can at times be relentless! Each mission allows you to choose two of you crew to accompany you, and these AI controlled teammates usually do a pretty good job of helping out - you can pause the action and give them commands, although I found this quite tricky to do, so I usually ignored them and let them do what they liked, which is a shame really as I am sure there was supposed to be some strategy to be played with there.The game allows you to recruit up to 12 crew members to fight with, and you are bound to have favourites as they are all different - and not all human. One very clever thing about Mass Effect 2 is that you only have to be as nice as you want to. You have a \"good\" and \"bad\" rating which changes depending on whether you behave accordingly or say supportive or threatening things to your team in conversations. You can also do an optional 2nd mission for every single crew member which adds extra stats to them and (more importantly), makes them \"loyal\". This is hugely important for the game's climax, so I recommend doing all of them!Apart from the recruitment, there are loads of side-quests to do. Some just involve scanning planets for minerals, which I found very relaxing (a bit like fishing!), and some are vehicle driving, involving using a small launch craft which you drive around different terrains, and these were all great fun. There are even some tiny fetch quests when you happen to overhear a conversation in which a stranger has a problem, and you can choose to help out. All the completed missions and quests gain you experience points in return, because Mass Effect 2 has an RPG element in it too - the more missions you do, the more stat bonuses you can unlock such as more health, shields, skills and so on.Once you have completed all the missions you can find/endure, you move to the game's final chapter in which you warp into another galaxy to confront the alien menace. This is by far the best part of the game, because as the commander you now have to assign key roles to your recruits in the hope that they will play their part in the success of the final mission. I didn't realise until I read some FAQs, but if you are a poor leader you can end the game with over half of your team dead! And after all my efforts to win their trust this was not something I wanted to do, and I am not ashamed to say I loaded up the save prior to the final mission begins more than once to ensure I had made the right choices!I think most gamers will love this game, it has action, plot, story, great graphics and scenery, and some very realistic characters. There is A LOT of spoken conversation in this game - but please don't skip any of it, as it's nearly always relevent, plus you build your \"good\" and \"bad\" ratings with nearly every conversation, so choose carefully! My small niggles are that there were a couple of glitches, plus if you took away the (amazing, it's true) space age environments, you could play the exact same gameplay mechanics in any Wild West or 20th century war-simulation game. But the futuristic setting is a great addition and altogether this game is hugely enjoyable.Comment","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2011"}

Clearly the budget wasn't much - the models look like programmer art, so does the textures. The voice acting is something out of a bad B flick porno flick, down to the random missing timings: people talk over each other. The story is, meh. And the game play and controls are without polish. The model animations are randomly OK or horrible (notice the first scene where people keep falling, how everyone falls the same and their hands are floating off the ground).They attempted context sensitive controls... attempted. It either over shoots, gives you the text as if you can perform an action, but you can't (for example, holding a sword prevents you from picking up items, but it says you can - lack of polish).Overlooking all the graphics and voice issues, I gave the game a chance based on it's gameplay. The controls were impossible. Not over complex, just, again (word of the day), unpolished. Easy, fixable issues were overlooked, and are now ingrained as standard (I mention this as not to imply they will ever fix them; they will not, they are now expected). For example, you attack/action the direction your character is facing, not the direction you are pushing on your control stick. So, in the middle of combat, you find yourself hitting enemies several times, you attempt to dodge out of the way, but you dodge at them, even though you are pushing away from them. Again, actions are based on your characters direction - this is a defect, contrary to how these types of games traditionally play.There is no jump button, and trust me, you want to jump a lot. So it takes the road of Mega Man, big deal...? Still, I attempted to overlook these minor issues, but the fighting is so bad, I found nothing redeeming about this game.I predict failure for this game development house.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2011"}

There's emotion and color and big set-pieces and just whole buckets of plain 'COOL'Take all the previous away, replace Drake with senior citizen, insert generic escort mission with even more forceful 'father-daughter bonding', and change the setting to post-apocalyptic Zombie Land and there is The Last of Us. You'll see everything seen in Uncharted and so much LESS. Gameplay? Nah, Son, we got Portentous Big Serious Themes for you, you don't need gameplay! Look, Ellie is wearing goggles!...Erm. This is another fine example of developers going 'Serious' and torpedo-ing themselves, I read Dostojevski and Goethe, I know when to be 'Serious' and really...the game medium doesn't lend itselve for it. Gameplay is quitessential and supersedes all else, that's why Dark Souls, Mass Effect, Dragon's Dogma are hundreds of hours worth, the story is a setting into which the player does his own thing with enticing gameplay. Last of Us doesn't have that, it's just sneaking and walking really slow to the next cutsc&egrave;ne and while you somewhat appreciate it on an 'intellectual level', you're more bored and disconnected then anything. The story must be worth it though, right?? Erm, no. Everything is derived from Walking Dead and at no point are you surprised or taken aback. The entire game is basically you figuring out Joel's psychological profile in order to explain a classic 'Look, we're artists!' ending which ends replay value immediately. At least I could see more hope and love in Bioshock Infinite, this is terribly executed and an outright finger to the gamer. Moving on to the multiplayer...sigh....it's atrocious. Just like singleplayer, it tries to instill Serious Themes, but for all the 'stealth', 'tactic', 'teamwork' and 'strategy' boloney, you'll get highest score running CoD style, killing a dude, getting killed, waiting 30 SECONDS and repeating. Your rewards are...A HAT....A MASK! Aren't you happy? It's Our Artistry! In short, mp is barebone garbage.Guys, it's really not worth 60 bucks so don't give in to peer pressure, your kids will hate it or play it a bit, and you'll be secretly bored, save your money for GTA 5  or buy Uncharted in discount.

This game was a complete let down because it was nothing really new to the brand.First off Infinity Ward used the same game engine fom Modern Warfare 2 but just added some new perks and kill streaks to make it look and feel different. The actual maps feel very similar to maps that were created for modern warfare 2 and overall feels like ths game should have been called Modern Warfare 2 1/2.The campaign is a little dull and confusing. The story just picks up from were we last left off. For those of you who know what m talking about, it seems the stories events are the same things over and over.The only new addition to the game that is pretty fun is the survival mode. Going solo or teaming up with a friend, ths mode allows you to take on endless waves of enemies while using some cool kill streaks and perks.Overall, I was disappointed but since everybody has pretty much upgraded to this game I'm forced to keep it o keep playing with my friends online.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2011"}

This is also exacerbated by the fact that the story/dungeon ratio is very uneven. The beginning is mostly dungeons and then the story soars about 15 hours in. This can cause doubts about continuing the game and it is well worth it past the 10-hour mark. Add  in an overly complex battle system and the game doesn&#8217;t seem that great at first.I want to take time and say that the core of the game is very genius. The only RPG that I&#8217;ve made sure that I&#8217;ve vigilantly discovered every square inch of dungeons and very few do I habitually traverse back to the towns. The items you find in your travels will help you level up your shops which then upgrade your equipment, items, weapons, etc. Not only does this make more logical sense compared to the usual new-town-better-equipment charade, it provides huge incentive to make money and take time to find these items. You could indeed have an incredibly powerful weapon for the level of your character. These items aren&#8217;t few and far between like other RPGs that have a few really hidden chests strewn about. These items are scattered absolutely everywhere, which makes it worthwhile and considerably rewarding. It is almost like following bread-crumbs sometimes where you realize that you just traversed an entire area once you realize it.This is also the first game where I went out of my way to do side missions. Since the game&#8217;s shops allow you to continuously improve your character at your own pace, you can never have enough money for those upgrades. The insanely fast load times make help significantly.&#8220;Dungeons&#8221; if you want to even call them that because some of the areas are beautiful and straightforward, which is a refreshing standout as most JRPGS have large, exhausting, and tedious labyrinthine dungeons.Battle system is overly complex albeit fun.

You have the possessed baboon and plant boss in the Temple, the balrog in the Mines, the colossal Morpheel in the Lakebed Temple, and the totally friggin' awesome Stalord fight.

Considering the original Fallout 3 was astonishing, the GOTY edition only adds to its incredible gameplay and content.  It is such an incredible value, having included all five expansion packs (which comes on a second disc).  If you've never experienced the world that is Fallout 3, do yourself a favor and get the GOTY edition.I have the original Fallout 3 on PC, but I wanted all of the expansion packs in an easy, convenient package.  I also thought I'd try the game out on a console so that I could see it on my big 40\" LCD and see how a controller worked with the game.  I decided to get the 360 version rather than the PS3 version due to stories of the PS3 version freezing and crashing.  It's unfortunate that Bethesda didn't give the PS3 as much love as the PC and 360.  Oh well.The GOTY edition on the 360 looks and runs great.  It doesn't have quite as detailed graphics as the PC version, but it still looks amazing.  You can pick up and manipulate just about anything in the environment.  NPC's still have that stiff, plasticky look to them, but that's not a deal breaker.  When you take into account the grand scope of this game, the developers made everything eye catching.You'll likely need the strategy guide to get the most out of the game and the expansion packs.  I got the limited edition, hardcover guide and am very satisfied with it.  It would be easy to get lost in the Fallout world without some direction, but luckily there are a lot of online resources if you prefer that.For $60, you are definitely getting your money's worth.  It's a game that provides almost limitless freedom, so it will consume a lot of your time.

It's got an amusing story with some incredibly dirty, but funny dialogue. It has some of the best graphics you'll see on any console, but most importantly it's addictive as hell. Ignore all the whiners complaining that its linear and repetitive. Hello, it's a shooter. Would you rather play a shooter where all you do is shoot people with a gun over and over? Yeah, that's not repetitive I guess...DERP. In Bulletstorm you literally have dozens of different ways to kill bad guys at all times and its up to you to figure out the best way. My favorite is shooting a big guy in the stomach, forcing him to double over in pain, run around him and kick off his back plate, and then shoot a flare up his butt. This will earn you a Skill Shot called Fire in the Hole, and as the big guy dies he lets out a really disgusting fart. Great stuff.The game is about 8 hours long if you don't rush through it, but when the campaign is over you then have Echoes mode, which is a ton of fun and adds hours upon hours of more gameplay.

{"product_name":"B001CMJAP6","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Like a rollercoaster: Great highs and awful lows","reviewText":"The Last Remnant is a game thats hard to shove entirely into a single box. Rush Sykes, son of two famous researchers, watches his sister kidnapped by a flying flamethrower and a wizard, and bumbles into a massive battle near the Mark of Athlum, where he makes a total embarrassment of himself at meeting the marquis of Athlum, who, rather than break his legs for gross breach of etiquette, takes him under wing to help find his sister.The world of tLR is gorgeous in the extreme, and breaks away from the Tolkien realm enough that you'd be extremely hard pressed to accuse of plagarism. The species are fairly unique and well characterized, but not falling through the stereotypical cracks. The technology is a mix of steampunk, cyberpunk and magic, and the Remnants themselves are as gorgeous as they are gigantic. The remnants are also one of the major failings, as you're never given any understanding of what they are, apart from they can be anything, do anything, and be found anywhere. While this gives the magic a pervasiveness that would be charming, when you're told treasure boxes are remnants that you have to \"bind\" to open them, you're running well on the wrong side of asinine and pointless. Also, some are ridiculously named and poorly explained. Its like having an incredibly shiny, incredibly artistically rendered box: beautiful to look at, but theres almost nothing inside.The characters of the main plot, and Rush Sykes himself, oscillate wildly between fantastic and awful. Rush himself is sadly in the traditional main character stereotype: the body of an 18 year old, the intelligence of an 8 year old, and the attention span of an 8 month old. He varies between willing to walk away from the support of an army to look for his sister alone, to adopting a happy-go-lucky, we'll find her when we find her attitude an hour later. Some of the characters are played well and too the hilt, namely the feline general with the mother hen mantra, and the tough faced lady general who's more fragile than she lets on.Gameplay is again where the greatest highs and lows are found. Combat is run by squads, called unions, of up to five members, which are given general orders rather than the traditional final fantasy setup of selecting every individual action. That makes sense, given in the swirl of a real melee, you couldn't give more than a three or four word command. But the commands are fluid, meaning you can only heal when the option is present, rather than all the time, unless you're willing to retreat, and you can't control where you attack a enemy squad from, or placement, or any of a dozen other things that require any strategy, which boils the combat down to picking the command which has the highest AP cost, as normal attacks are completely worthless. Area attacks and group support? Better hope you're crammed in like sardines and you don't accidentally kill your enemies, since every action following is canceled, including the area effect spell you were hoping would hit five units. You only manage Rush's equipment, and every other member takes care of themselves, looting items from combat to improve their gear. Sounds interesting and simple, right? But they can only pick items from combat loot, meaning you can't provide them with what they need to improve, much less will they tell you what that is, resulting in you running through a level 40 dungeon with level 15 equipment since you didn't pick up a piece of copper ore in a dungeon from five hours ago. And enemies are always a threat, even in ones and twos, as certain attacks are nearly unstoppable even at higher levels, meaning a runt monster fight that's ten levels beneath you could still kill you if the timing is right, or if you're slightly outnumbered, resulting in a lot of pointless reloading.All told, this is definitely worth a look. Innovative, new style combat where the polish and innovation blurs out the faults and a story that manages to intrigue and frustrate by turns will quickly shove you into either a love or hate category.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2009"}

This classic title was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1986 and has been ported over to the Game Boy Advance in 2004 under the \"Classic NES Series\", a collection of some of the best NES games that is available on the Game Boy Advance.Many reviewers before has already broken it down to what you do and what made the game such a classic and a blast to play so I'll add in my two cents on it. This is hands down a perfect port of the hit NES game, which is hard to find in its original cartridge form (even harder if you want the gold cartridge released it its initial release for a limited time.) Since the GBA control layout is perfect for games like this, it's a natural fit to play the game on it and now you can take it on the go wherever you want.So if you loved the NES gaming era and The Legend of Zelda was at the top of your list, pick this up as soon as possible.

{"product_name":"B00005TNI6","description":"Final Fantasy Xis the first title in this landmark RPG series to be released for the PlayStation2. The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"J. N. K \"Esco\"","summary":"Linear Schminear!!","reviewText":"There are two types of RPG players: one who likes the interactive novel, plot-based game like this, and those who like the infinite choice games, that sadly often feature embarrassingly shallow characters and practically non-existent plots (some were even by Squaresoft, some of them loved still -- like: Chrono Cross!). The world of RPG's was introduced to me with the fourth entry of the Final Fantasy series, a game that featured what is still one of the greatest plots to grace an RPG, and as such, plot and character have been the reasons I play such games.As such, Final Fantasy X fit perfectly with my personal tastes. More than just being plot and character for me to like, but being a film student, this game's almost overdone cinematic tone is, to me, an additional bonus to a game of already high merit.To start off, while maybe not the most detailed of looking games, the visuals are brilliantly artistic and colorful, and flow usually at a constant framerate. The characters are really the aspects that one could say the least impressive aspect of the game, but they look real, their movement is often fluid, and their facial expressions are as good as in any game. With the modern flashy-type of cinematic tone, the lighting is often very stylish in nature, and the special effects (in and out of battle) are phenomenal, with my favorite being the pirefly effect when a fiend dies. And the FMV...don't even get me started on how amazing it is!The sound is somewhat short of perfection, but overall rather nice. The music, while sounding rather fake often, is still nicely composed, and a nice step up from the lacking FFIX musical score. Some of the music however is just too shallow to get a liking for, but the more emotional music is easily as good as anything in the past, featuring what is the most beautiful central melody of the entire series. Along with the slightly improved sound quality of the music synth, the foley has taken a huge leap foreword in production value, with some explosive sound effects that rattle, well, my TV speaker when loud. That leaves the voice acting. All I can say is that it isn't perfect as the voices do occasionally flop, most often Yuna's, the casted voices match the faces perfectly (voice wise -- not lip-sync), and feature rather solid performances overall. Tidus is whiney, but he is a character that does indeed evolve, with impressively presented moments of narration, and Auron's voice fits his infinitely mystique character perfectly.The gameplay is slightly more old school than before, but with some nice modern alterations, mainly the sphere grid. The sphere grid changes something in the overall formula of addiction. Before, it was the plot that kept one playing, but for once the interface is actually as addicting as any story.However, for the first time since FFVII, the story and characters were actually enough to get me through any tough spots. While following the conventional dramatic style of story (which I personally wouldn't have it any other way), it seems to have been written with emotion to be involved even more than it's already deep...depth. There are countless character subplots, mainly involving the main character, which work incredibly, despite how some of them might sound when you first hear them. Final Fantasy has somehow often been able to take a conventional, cliche or silly plot device/subplot and make it truly an emotional experience. Once again, the story is insanely detailed and thought out, and like the better entries, is interesting enough to want to understand it all.The characters are also my favorite since the sixth entry of the series, with finally some truly differing personalities. Tidus is a young man forced from his happy world into the harsh world of Spira, Wakka is an unimaginative yet friendly sort, Yuna is determined and strong willed yet sometimes unwise, and Auron is a man of few, yet powerful words, who seems to know everything in the world, and fears literally nothing. These four are easily the four most developed of the seven characters, and the final developmental result is quite impressive. I was shocked by the depth of the scenes between Yuna and Tidus, giving them a sense that they were very real; their emotions too.These are the reasons I liked this game. I guess I can understand how some people can like this game less than I, such as lack of freedom or that the story moves too slow (welcome to the world of RPG's, mate), but how someone can say that this game is terrible...that's beyond me! May Square continue their sometimes unstable, yet often incredible cinematic works in the videogame arena, forever!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00000DMAT","description":"GoldenEye 007has been a huge success for Rareware, and it's easy to see why. More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"Adrian Cooper \"That Guy from Venus. :D\"","summary":"A classic in its own right!

Socom 3 is the first Socom game I have played and I got to say its quite enjoyable. Its obvious the developers poored a lot of time into this game and it works and looks great.The missions are varied,fun and can be a challenge. There is a great selection of weapons and you can even drive vehicles and change the position on the vehicle you want to be. Say for instance if you want to man the gun mount on the back of a vehicle. One thing I was surprised about the online community is still pretty large and when I got on there was over 900 people playing in varied rooms. The biggest downer was getting things set up and I am not for sure why but I had troubles getting my account to register. I only got in on a few games and I did not experience any lag. The hard part is entering a game room. You might be asking yourself why. I am not sure myself to be honest. Either the games I was entering on were either over or when I got in they were close to being over. Some required passwords. Also a lot of them require map packs to be purchased which is fine. I am not going to invest in any map packs because I do not play the ps2 much online.The graphics are a real treat on the eyes even on the aging ps2. Fire effects are quite nice and the character models look pretty sharp. The CGI cutscenes are well animated and have a life all there own. The sound is pretty good also. Controls work really well. My only gripes were my squad at times either did not do what I told them or they would get hung up on a wall or building. Whether the developers were lazy or did not have time to fix this portion of the game I do not know. There was also a bit of slowdown in places but it was few and far between.It is really hard not to recommend Socom 3. It is a great game that really does the majority of things right. My only real gripe is when my squad decides to be stupid and get hung up walls or buildings. Other than the few gripes I have this is truly a top tier game. Granted the ps2 is nearing the end of its lifespan its hard to argue the fact it was one of the greatest systems of all time and this game is shining example of the sheer quality of not only the system but the games as well.

Okay. This is one of the best games I've played. I didn't think much of it, as it was a gift, but this game proved me wrong. Aviation games are usually not something I even look at. This game blew me away with its graphics, gameplay, storyline, and sound. I fully recommend this to every one. On a side note, this comes with a demo ofVoodoo Vinceand some videos.Graphics- 9.5/10The only thing you can complain about is that the CG between the action isn't perfect. It is very well done CG though. Everything else is perfect by X-Box standards. The level design of this game is some of the best I've ever seen. You will love exploring the incredible world they give you. Whether it is: canyons, islands, underground cities, or above ground metropolises, you will love it all. You travel to many different worlds to play in, so it's not repetitive either. The final couple stages are put together so well, it's mind blowing. You planes are very well designed and all look very interesting.Story- 8.5/10You are Nathan Zachary of The Fortune Hunters. You live in an alternate 1930s; a world in which The Great Depression tore apart the United States. The United States has turned into many different self-governing states. Many have taken to the skies to steal and control. The game starts off with you having a gambling problem. You have lost your zeppelin and your plane. You take your plane back and work to getting your zeppelin back. As time goes on, you are asked to keep Dr. Fassenbiender's plans for a weathering machine safe. The machine could be used for many great things...or it could be used to create F-5 Tornados. Of course, someone knows about the weathering machine and you are on a chase to figure out who it is. Your story leads to many turns and twists and is very well thought out.Sound- 8.5/10The music will always match the mood of what you are doing. If you are exploring canyons, you will have quiet, mysterious music playing. If you are engaging in air warfare, you will have fast paced music that gets your heart beating. The voice acting is done very well by most of the characters. Some of the characters just sound too unrealistic though. Weapon and plane sounds are done to perfection.Gameplay- 9.5/10This is an arcade aviation game. Does that mean it's only worth a quarter to play? No. It has arcade physics. This mean you won't have you do everything perfect and the game can create some tight squeezes for you too escape. You start in Sea Haven doing missions to try to find Big John. He is the only person that knows how to fly your Zeppelin. You are in a free environment. Much likeGrand Theft Auto III, you can do whatever mission you want and in whatever order you like. You will have missions where you: attack planes, use turrets, race, navigate, steal planes, and much more. You ability to use turrets or planes in most missions keeps the game interesting. Also, the variety in missions keeps the game very fun. The bosses on this game are incredible and are some of the most well thought out even compared toGod of War. Unlike GOW though, there are many bosses in this game for you destroying pleasure. The Multi-Player in this game is pretty fun, but not really a major focus of the game. There is a game called Wild Chicken that is extremely fun though. You try to catch a chicken and return it to your base for points. Yeah, it's crazy, but its very fun. I haven't played online as I don't have X-Box Live.Difficulty- 10/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty)Even on Easy you have a have some challenge. That's the way it should be. If you think that's too easy, you can try any of the other three harder difficulties. Some of the final stages are very hard and you will really feel like you accomplished something. The game is really short, and can probably be beaten in around a day of good gaming. The game will still leave you satisfied after playing it though, and that makes the game perfect.Overall- 9.5/10This is one of the best games I've played in a long time. Don't just avoid it because it's an aviation game; buy it now! Really, the game is just that much fun. The single player is one of the best I've played in a long time, and the multiplayer is good fun once you're done. I recommend this to everyone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2008"}

Thanks to the intuitive controls of the Wii Remote, even the most inexperienced gamers will have no trouble mastering the controls.    &lt;p&gt; Wii Play features nine separate mini-games, including the following: &lt;li&gt;Shooting Range, a point-and-fire game of target practice in the Duck Hunt tradition. &lt;li&gt;Billiards, a simplified variation of nine-ball with stunningly realistic physics that uses your Wii Remote as your pool cue. &lt;li&gt;Find Mii, in which you scan the crowds to find the right Mii&#8212;and Miis you and your friends created make an appearance. &lt;li&gt;Tanks!, in which you command a toy tank on a miniature battlefield in a gauntlet of 100 missions. &lt;li&gt;Other games include Pose Mii, Table Tennis, Fishing, Charge!, and Laser Hockey. &lt;p&gt; Every game features a multiplayer mode, so you and your friends can compete for the high score or go head to head to see who&#8217;s the best.  Wii Play comes with a white Wii Remote so that your friends can join in the action. (Nunchuk not included.)","reviewerName":"Chris Swanson \"I'm just this guy, you know?\"","summary":"The controller is great! The game... well... yeah.","reviewText":"I love myNintendo Wii. I wrote a review about it right after I got it. It's a wonderfully fun little machine! Now that I've got it online, I've downloaded all sorts of stuff, voted in polls and had a generally grand time! What I lacked was a second controller.Enter \"Wii Play\".Don't buy this game for the game. The game is crap. \"Wii Sports\" is better and more entertaining and you get that for free. But to make \"Wii Sports\" even more fun, you need a second player. For that, a second controller is vital. Since you need one anyhow, buy this bundle.\"Wii Play\" isn't completely bad. The cow racing, laser hockey, shooting and pool games are basically fun and provide some dandy two-player action. The others are forgettable.So in short: don't by this game for the game. Certainly don't buy the seprate version of the game. But since you need another controller, buy this bundle. Get the controller. Spend $[...] on a game you  might play for a couple hours.Enjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2007"}
{"product_name":"B0041OWQTO","reviewerName":"Samuel Ray \"RPG Fan\"","summary":"Fun and addictive","reviewText":"There are much more in-depth reviews, so I'll let you read them for specifics. In general, find the character you like and one that fits your playstyle, then have fun. Early in the game you need some strategy, but as you level up you generally can blast your way through most situations. Taking cover is pretty easy, but rocket launchers are somewhat of a disappointment. Stick with your character, develop them as you see fit, and wreck havoc, you'll be glad you purchased this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2012"}
