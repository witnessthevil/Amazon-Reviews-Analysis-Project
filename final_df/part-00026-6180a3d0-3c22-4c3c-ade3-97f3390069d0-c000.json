{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"PS2 Bruce","summary":"NOT Like GTA or RDR!","reviewText":"I got this game today, and have played it for about 3 hours. I think it is going to be excellent. I have played throught the first \"patrol\" missions, which serve as tutorial material, and have started the first \"traffic division\" case. This game is NOT a \"sandbox\" game or a \"shooter,\" or, really an \"RPG.\" It is basically a simulation of being an LAPD detective, about 60 years ago.The graphics are amazing, and the thing that is getting the most attention is the motion capture. I have never seen facial expressions like this before. This, combined with excellent voice acting (some of the faces are recognizable, by the way), make for a very unique experience. This isn't a game puntcuated by cut scenes. This is like watching a film. There are a few facial expressions that you will see, that are actually shocking, they are that real. The downtown part of Los Angeles is pretty well rendered (but it is like the 1945 version). I like that because I am from LA, and when responding to incidents, if I'm on Temple St, I know how to get to 7th and Alameda).The people that have given it poor reviews, basically don't understand, or were not expecting this. They thought, I suppose it would be another \"GTA.\" WELL IT ISN'T. It was PUBLISHED by Rockstar; but developed by another company. Yes, the controls are similar, but that's where the similarity ends. You start as a new patrolman, then get promoted to detective. Your captain assigns you and your partner cases. This involves responding to the crime scene, searching the scene for clues, including examining the victim, if the body is still there, examining any items that the first responders found and marked (with those yellow number cards), which could include shell casings, victims personal effects, items that could have been dropped by the perpetrator,etc, as well as looking all around for things the people first on scene may have misses. THIS TAKES TIME. Sometimes you will interview witnesses on the scene. THIS TAKES TIME. The combination of gathering physical clues, and interviewing subjects, lead you towards solving the case. You must try to determine if the subject is being truthful, lying, or leaving things out. If you challenge what they say, you must have already collected the evidence to back that up. You also sometimes must interrogate suspects at that station, using these same techniques. If you do everything correctly you solve the case, and move on to the next, and then eventuall, to another division, where there are new cases.You and your partner, may encounter violent subjects, in which case you defend yourselves, but this is NOT a game based upon shootuts. They do happen, but it's more like being a detective in real life, most of your time is spent looking for clues, interviewing people, and putting it together. I am enjoying this a lot; this is a different experience from most games you play. As you gain skills and experience, I would think the cases get more difficult. Anyway, this is what happens in the game.In closing, people that are expecting \"GTA\" or \"RDR\" this game IS NOT LIKE THAT. One thing I had to get used to, it is NOT a \"sandbox\" type game. You play through the story. You CANNOT go about doing random mayhem. (maybe that's why people don't like it). You cannot, for example, shoot someone on a whim, like you can in GTA. Your character does not draw his weapon unless he is fired on, or there is a risk to other people. You can NOT really be \"evil\" but hsi MAKES SENSE because your character is a decorated marine, trying to be an exemplary police officer. Shooting peds in the head because you feel like it, is not allowd. (You can still run them over, but that will get you in trouble.) One way that you CAN do other things, is as you are driving to the scene other radio calls will come over about incidents in progress; you are free to respond to these. I like doing these because I know the city, as I stated above. As we're heading down broadway, and I hear an inicident on San Julian, I will take it. These \"random crimes\" could be theives, gunmen, robberies, etc. Completing them adds to your stats.This a a GREAT game. You just have to understand what is about. It's not GTA.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2011"}

Possibly what makes ICO irresistible in this category is the endless amount of puzzles and rewards that are fluently encountered. The story is about a young boy, Ico, and his escape from the persecution of his village. The townspeople order Ico to be executed as a result of the horns that bore his head when he was born. Now at the age of 12, it is his calling by the village to be sent off and killed. Well, if you hadn't guessed, Ico escapes, and his adventures are what make up the story with his meeting of Yorda, the sacred girl who is pursued by demons. Your journey will begin after a magnificent CG that shows the departure of Ico to be killed. His escape triggers the adventure, and you are then thrust into the role of this small boy, looking for hope in a world that has shunned your existence. As soon as you even press a button to move your character, you are presented with a hint of the puzzle atmosphere, as you will need to find a way out of the first room you encounter. After some time, you will be shown the presence of Yorda, and once again, her survival is an intuitive puzzle that makes for your enjoyment. Keep in mind, this is the structure that surrounds ICO, and is an unlimited joy as you move from stage to stage, accomplishing great tasks as you vie to understand the meaning of your journey. In a sense, it is about the rescue of Yorda, but what awaits for you is only describable by playing the game. The game is a truly marvel to look at and experience, with many dimensions wrapped up inside.It's tough to put together a stellar sound scheme for a title like ICO, but Sony has excelled in every part of ICO so far, why not keep going. Every obstacle you face, every natural occurrence is bursting with harmonious splendor, from the soft chirping of birds, to the loud clamor as you fight for your freedom. Each level has it's own sense and feeling as the sound format fits perfectly as you travel. A mood is set in every level and you will be transformed to suit this mold each time your adventure changes form. Trust me in this category. Sony has not forgotten to include a part of the game, which in some cases can make or break a title. The beautiful arrangement is well noted, and will not be forgotten in my book, as it will not be forgotten in yours either.The control scheme and setup of ICO is also very well put together. Ico's movements are well taken care of, with only small confusion as the camera angle changes. The fluent motion and sensitivity of the game is practically flawless, as it aids tremendously in the quality and value of the game. The controller setup is extremely simple and will be picked up in a matter of minutes. For those of you wondering, the button layout goes like this: Square is to strike with your weapon, Circle is to either walk or is the action button for levers and picking up and pushing objects, Triangle is to jump, and X is the release button. As you can tell, the easiness of this category is almost without saying. Ico's actions are perfectly taken care of with an excellent control setup that will put your fingers at ease.Possibly one of the categories that seems to lag in a lot of adventure games is the replay value. Most titles are a long fought out battle to complete, and is almost exhausting in its finality. You may not want to venture through the long process again, and would favor moving on to another game. I, however, believe ICO is as far from this stereotype as possible. From beating the demo numerous times to the point I am at now, I guarantee another mission through the world of ICO. Like I said, there is just something about it, and it continually calls me to play. As you become familiar with the puzzle tendency, it is a truly enjoyable venture throughout the entire game, and a process that will surely entice you to return to this year's best adventure title.With ICO still a very recent title, I know there are many of you who have yet to try this wonderful piece of gaming masterpiece. It is a disservice to you and gaming as a whole to not at least rent this game. My recommendation, of course, is to purchase the game, as will be the same for many of you who decide to rent it. This is truly a rare title for everyone. Set genres aside, and try what may be one of the best titles of 2001. Disappointment is not an option here, and enjoyment is inescapable. With so many quality games out right now, let me make an easy decision for you; ICO is by far the unsurpassed hero and is a must experience for everyone.9.7 / 10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2001"}

{"product_name":"B000TVT8PI","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"Truly Next Generatin Gaming","reviewText":"First a little background - I bought the Playstation 3 80gb with MotorStorm about 3 months ago. I really wanted to use the system for a while before submitting a review.First I've got to say that the PS3 has an elegant design. It's sleek and best of all quiet. You won't hear fans or anything like that. That trend continues when you power on the system. The user interface involves a series of simple icons that let you do everything from watching a Blu-Ray movie to surfing the internet to playing your games. The interface is very Spartan, but dig down and you have quite a few options for advanced users including several options for home theaters.Now to the important bits: Gaming. Simply put the exclusive titles on the PS3 are phenomenal, ports of games that appeared on other consoles - not so much. I've noticed that this is something that's starting to change more and more, however, it's something that everyone should be aware of.Graphically the power of the PS3 really shines on games like Resistance: Fall of Mankind and Heavenly Sword. There are many, many others - Ratchet and Clank, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, Warhawk and on and on.On the control front, if you've used a Playstation before you're going to be right at home with the SIXAXIS controller. Its strange using the tilt functionality at first and some games don't support the feature, but when implemented well by the developer it really adds to the game. Plus rumble support is finally returning to Playstation with the new Dual Shock 3 controller!Online support is fantastic and growing every week. The absolute best thing about PS3 games is that online gaming is completely free. No fees for 'silver' or 'gold' accounts or anything like that; everyone is ready to go right out of the box as long as you have a broadband internet connection.So after 3 months I've acquired a small collection of AAA titles and I'm enjoying the system. I would highly recommend to anyone!EDIT:9 Months Later: After a solid 9 months of use I'm still loving my Playstation 3. I've built up a solid library of single player and multiplayer games, taken my PS3 online, use the media server option to stream music from my PC, watch Blu-ray movies and have made friends online.First, major improvements have been made to the Playstation Network Store (PSN). The entire store is much easier to navigate and to find games, demos, themes, wallpaperes, etc.Great titles have been released including Call of Duty 4, Metal Gear Solid 4, Grand Theft Auto 4 (that's a lot of 4's!!). I'm also happy to say that the previous problem of porting games from the other console to the PS3 has improved as well. Developers are starting to understand the machine more and really adopt their games to the PS3.With the adoption of Blu-ray as the definitive next-generation optical media format the PS3 is also a fantastic BD movie player with an ever expanding library of movies.Sony continues to provide great support by releasing firmware updates that improves functionality, and adds new features.Games like Call of Duty 4, Metal Gear Online, Warhawk, Battlefield Bad Company have thriving online communities and best of all - it's completely free!The multiplayer aspect of the PS3 is also solid with games like High Velocity Bowling and Rock Band. The use of the SIXAXIS of DualShock 3 controllers is has grown more integrated into games. For example in High Velocity Bowling you hold the controller simulating a bowling ball and actually got through the motion of a swing. Great fun as a party game with friends!Anyway I will continue to make updates as I see necessary. So far I am extremely pleased with my PS3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2007"}

I finally grabbed it and plopped it into the 360 this past week, and was pleasantly surprised at how well it holds up.  Outside of a few overly long sections of the game early on, it really has a nice pace, solid mechanics, and good atmosphere (especially later on).Pros:-Even though this is an early XBox 360 game, the graphics are pretty good.  Meaning, it runs very well, and it looks very good for such an old game.-Nice atmosphere through most of the game.-Interesting story line.-Great mechanics and good use of bullet time, which is a core component of the game play (most combat situations take place in bullet time)-You really get a sense that these guys were doing something ahead of their time.  Many of the story telling devices and narrative elements are things that weren't common when this game came out, but are now, and for good reason.Cons:-Don't play this game for achievements, they are terrible.  I played through the game on the normal difficulty and ended the game with 85 achievement points, 35 of which were for beating the game.  Every other achievement I received was 5 points, with the exception of 1, which was 0 points for committing suicide.  Nice.-The sound design leaves something to be desired.  Some dialog sounds very low resolution.  There are phone messages you can listen in on to get more out of the story, and they are interesting, but half of them are so quiet you can't hear them.  I tried adjusting the levels, but I could never get it to be satisfying.  I will never understand how people making a game get that wrong, but it was a prevalent problem around the time this game was made.-There are a few sections, especially early on, that are overly long and tedious.Overall, it's a solid game.  It holds up very well, and is still a fun and entertaining experience.  In a lot of ways it reminds me of Half Life 2, and the way that game looks and feels on 360.  It's not as good as Half Life 2 (which I would give 5 stars easy) but it is worth your time to check out, especially since you can get this game for under $10 used all over the place.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMAX","description":"Mario Kart 64, one of the first games released for the Nintendo 64  platform, is an updated translation of the very popularSuper Mario Kartfor the  Super NES (SNES). And while the game clearly takes full advantage of the graphics  power and speed of the N64, a few components that made the original so compelling  have been left out of this release.Still, Nintendo's expertise at sucking players into the game world is strongly evident, andMario Kart 64offers enough challenges to keep players (especially casual  gamers) entertained. Placing a familiar Nintendo personality behind the wheel of a  sputtering kart powered by a 50, 100, or 150-cc engine, the game lets players race  computerized opponents or up to four other players on a variety of well-designed tracks.  Because karts lack the power and speed of race cars, drivers must focus on collecting  power-ups and nonlethal weapons rather than negotiating hairpin turns on two wheels.  Grabbing and using on-track items is the heart of the game's fun: a strategically-placed  banana peel sends the unlucky victim into a spin, nailing an opponent with a turtle shell  launches their vehicle skyward, and a rocket provides a quick boost to near-breakneck  speeds, if only for a moment.The multiplayer mode provides enormously chaotic fun for up to four players--flip it on  at a party and watch the guests congregate around the screen.--Eric TwelkerPros:Well-designed tracksSimple controlsStrong multiplayer appealCons:Computerized opponents sometimes pull off questionable feats","reviewerName":"Adrian Cooper \"That Guy from Venus. :D\"","summary":"Great game overall.","reviewText":"It has spawned such classic levels (as I recall) such as Luigi's Circuit, Moo Moo Farm, Frappe's Snowland, Toad's Turnpike, Koopa Troopa Beach, Banshee Highway, Bowser's (infamous) Castle, Wario's Stadium and the ridiculously long and bright track, Rainbow Road, which has spawned at LEAST 5 different versions throughout the series!My all-time favorite level in the game is actually Sherbet Land.

{"product_name":"B005THAX5Q","description":"","reviewerName":"Distant Voyageur \"Nicholas Computer\"","summary":"Was this game made in 1998 and then left in a vault for 14 years afterward?","reviewText":"I have no idea how this game came into my life but while it has it's ocassional moments of glory, \"A:CM\" I swear, must have been a re-issue from some previous release.So apparantly the game came out in 2013, that is after the release of Assassin's Creed III, Battlefield 3, Ghost Recon: Future Soldier, and even Call of Duty: Black Ops II, all of which are to varying degrees fabulous games in their own ways. Yet judging by the look and feel of the entire game, I could've sworn that I must have accidentally gotten on a time machine and travelled back to 1998 or earlier and played this game on a PC because the graphics are extremely dated-looking, even by 1998 standards. The way the entire game, both single and multiplayer function is of a nature that I could've sworn would've looked like a prototype for an early Playstation 1-era console. I can't even begin to go into details of how big a missed opportunity \"Aliens: Colonial Marines\" has turned out to be.To me, my impression is that the game combines aspects of the Halo Series and the engine-interface aspects of Call of Duty, but completely strips away any of the things that made both franchises worth the countless hours, worth spending rainy days and nights, and earning achievements, playing with. \"Aliens: Colonial Marines\" combines Halo and Call of Duty but more of the scraps of both franchises, resutling in one of the most poorly-produced games I think I've come across in the last decade.Most games usually shine on their multiplayer servers rather than single player campaigns. Crysis, Call of Duty, Battlefield, and even Halo and Ghost Recon. However, that is not the case here with A:CM. The multiplayer suffers from horrendous lag and lacks any significant edge with the graphic interface showing the kind of quality I'd expect from an amateur prototype made on somebody's home computer. Not only that but there is very heavy bias towards the marine faction with limited ability to level up on the Xenomorph side. Mentioning that, controlling the xenomorphs is an unnecessarily difficult nightmare due to the changing camera angles when climbing on walls and ceiling, all of which completely throw up my playing. It ruins at least half of the multiplayer fun for me and made it nearly unplayable. On both the single and multiplayer portions of the game, I see entire graphic sceneries that look more like small to large colored pieces that attempt to become holes in walls, ceilings and floors, or blood stains but simply look like glitches in the graphics. Just the way everything about the game operates gives me two impressions.One-Somebody or some past crew were working on producing  this game probably as early in 1996, but then stopped further production in early 1998, and then put it away in a vault and was forgotten for the next 14 years and then somebody, in a foolish decision, decided \"Oh let's release it now!\" and released it in it's half-assed state.Or two, the makers put almost no effort into the quality or playability of the game rendering it perhaps the most poorly made product I've ever come across in the video game realm. The ultimate result is something that is easily showned to have been rushed right out the door with zero input into the background, the graphics, the sound effects, and the aliesn themselves looked like mere cartoon-puppet props, rather than the feared alien antagonists they were/are in the movie series.Either way, it's hard to believe that in 2013, considering the price listed, that A:CM could have turned out to be so haphazardly done but it really is. It's far from terrible but considering the hype I've read and heard about it, this is perhaps the weakest game I've come across and the biggest letdown of a video game since \"Twisted Metal 3\" from 15 years earlier.Don't bother wasting your time with this mini-lemon of a game. If you want to play, fine. Rent it or borrow it from a friend or family member. Even \"Medal of Honor: Warfighter\" and \"Homefront\", for all their issues, were better than this.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"F.

I simply love this game. It has one of the best and most immersive storylines I've ever seen in a game. There are plot twists and unexpected developments throughout the game. You have numerous choices to make, and some of the choices effect the outcome of the game. There are a large number of quests, including many optional ones and and you may choose to take a good or evil path or something in between. There are numerous well developed characters who can join your party, each with their own personality. They may help or hinder you, during quests or even leave the party or turn on you depending on your actions. You have influence with the characters and it depends largely on your action and your choices.The storyline is simply excellent, the sound effects and graphics are excellent, music is excellent, and the buildings/scenarios are unique and diverse. The endings are excellent and one of the best I've ever seen in a game. I really enjoyed playing this game.The only cons I think of is the combat, which I didn't mind because this is an rpg first.

The bottom line: I can't help but recommend this game for the classic gameplay and the familiar 16-bit Final Fantasy feel captured perfectly on the Playstation.

{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"Brendan Ross","summary":"Very Good Reprise of a Classic Title","reviewText":"The long-awaited sequel is a somewhat streamlined yet still quite old school reprise of the classic titles from 10+ years ago.  Many of the complaints about the game center on the infrastructure and the streamlining, so I will address those first before talking a bit about the gameplay.In terms of streamlining, the main element of this relates to the way skills are handled in the game.  In earlier titles in the series, a permanent attribute allocation and skill tree system was followed which permitted a greater degree of uniqueness, in theory, at the cost of a higher risk of completely gimping the character in a permanent way.  Diablo 3 has replaced this system with automatic skill and attribute gains happen automatically as the character levels, while the player can, at any time (other than in the middle of a battle, due to a cooldown mechanic) switch out skills (6 are active at any one time) and switch out runes for each skill (each rune having significantly different effects on the base skill).  The intention was to avoid having \"one min max optimal build\" which all informed players followed after learning about on the internet, with the remaining customization \"choices\" all being suboptimal, and therefore to some degree illusory.  Instead, various skill and rune loadouts are viable, and players are encouraged to experiment with various combinations to find one that is effective for their own preferred playstyle rather than following one cookie-cutter \"optimal\" build for each class.  Some players will prefer this system, while players who like to theorycraft themselves and figure out optimal builds before other players do, will not like this system.Another element of streamlining involves various game mechanics, such as town scrolls (no more need to stockpile them, it is a skill everyone has that can be used at any time), potions (no longer chugged, now on a cooldown) and item identification (now a skill, no longer requiring a scroll).  All of these make the game somewhat more manageable compared to Diablo 2, but more purist players may find them irritating.The other main element of complaint involves the tie-in to Blizzard's battle.net system.  As with Starcraft 2, the game is intended to be played through battle.net.  Unlike SC2, however, Diablo 3 can't be played in an offline mode once the game has been authenticated on the battle.net servers, but instead is actually played on the servers themselves, even when played in single player/non-public mode.  That is, Diablo 3 is, in effect, an online game, but one that can be played in a private, non-public way.  This was done by Blizzard primarily to limit item duping, because Diablo 3 will soon feature a real money auction house -- that is, an auction house where players can sell their items for real world currency instead of in-game currency.  Blizzard will be taking a commission on these real currency sales, and because real money is involved (and potentially quite a bit of real money), is keenly interested in limiting, or making harder, the kind of item duping that was fairly commonplace in the heavily hacked Diablo 2.  The battle.net system also limits other kinds of hacking as well, and provides, on average, for a cleaner game environment.  The cost, however, of this approach is that the playability of the game is entirely dependent on being connected to the internet at all times, and having a fairly good connection as well.  While this is not an issue for most people, it will be an issue for some people (to take one example, military stationed without constant broadband internet), and if it is an issue, it's a 100% issue, and this has resulted in a huge number of negative reviews of the game.  For people who are impacted by this decision in a negative way, these criticisms are understandable.  For this reason, I have deducted one star -- because while the issue doesn't impact me personally, it does impact others and that makes it a less than perfect design, from the game infrastructure point of view.The gameplay of Diablo 3 is quite old school, true to the spirit of the older iterations of the series.  Blizzard chose to go with a retro approach, rather than an innovative one.  Some players will like this, as it is reminiscent of the gameplay of Diablo 2.  Other players will dislike it, finding the gameplay to be dated, and superseded by gameplay developments and innovations that have taken place since the late 1990s.  This is primarily a question of taste, but it can have a huge impact on one's overall impression, and enjoyment, of the game.  Diablo 3 is a point and click hack and slash game where the idea is to progress through the game several times, with increasing difficulty each time, as your character advances in levels (more skills and runes) and acquires better gear through loot drops.  It is not designed to be played once on \"normal\" mode and then put aside, so if you are not the kind of gamer who likes to replay content a few times with increased difficulty, then Diablo 3 may not be for you, because this is the core mechanic of the game, and the core design idea that carried through from Diablo 2 as well.  If, however, you like a more retro, old school approach to the classic action RPG genre, you'll get plenty of fun from Diablo 3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2012"}

THQ is not really known for FPS games and Homefront showed their lack of experience.I just can't believe how short the SP is. On normal, I had beat it in a little over 4 hours. What really made me upset was the abrupt ending. I understand you can't liberate an entire country in one game, but they could have ended the game in a manner where you get some sense closure. Not just an abrupt ending where you are scratching your head thinking...WTF just happened??? I guess they are setting up for a sequel, but they could have done a better job in ending the game. The SP was fun, but could have been a lot better.To me the MP was just plain boring. I played a for a couple of hours but it just didn't hold my interest. Oh and if you rent this game, the max you can level up is 10, then they want you to buy a code to go higher.This game has a good premise of an occopuied USA and the horrors that the people of an occopuied country experience. Its just a shame that THQ destroyed the premise it by making a below average game. Hopefully an experienced studio will pick up this premise and make a better game.I almost fell for the hype and bought the game, I am glad I waited a bit longer and read the reviews.

{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Thomas Swift \"video game virtuosso\"","summary":"the first of many","reviewText":"this game started it all. now its trash and no one cares, but it takes a man to look back and realize that when this came out, it was as good as it gets. why  not have that same feelings now? its best on computer graphically and what not, but nothing compares to a controller. had to buy on PC. one i bought for xbox didnt work","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2013"}
{"product_name":"B001ASJIS6","reviewerName":"A. Tyler","summary":"Pure Art","reviewText":"I had owned this game a couple of years ago, but sold it.  I recently purchased it again so my son could have a non-violent platform game that was fun, and I thought it would fit the bill.  Now I realize that this game's design was totally lost on me the first time around, and I think I play it more than my son.  This has now become one of my favorite games of all time.  I will provide a list of reasons, and then a list of negative aspects about the game.  In other words, a pros and cons list.  I must tell you from the onset that this is a casual game.  There are few enemies.  It is 90% platforming, in a beautiful, artistic fantasy world.  I think that is what the game tries to be, and it succeeds.  This is not \"Sands of Time.\"  All of the hack and slash elements of that game have been completely forgone here.PROS:- The best level design I've seen in a game: Each world has its subsections, but all section of each entire world are completely visible, no matter where you are.  It is beautiful.  There is nothing like platforming for ten minutes, then looking back at the beautiful section you just came from and thinking, \"I was there.\"- Artistic design: The watercolor effect solidifies the artistic mood of the entire game.- Great map system: I am too old to enjoy tons of backtracking or trying to find my place.  Others have said the system where Elika (the pricess) points you exactly where you need to go is too simplistic.  Perhaps they enjoy getting lost.  I don't, and I have limited time to play video games these days, so I appreciate the system that is in place.  I am an adult with a family and a life.  I need the help.  You can also transport between \"healed\" lands.- Kid friendly: It is nice to have a game that I can play in front of my kids that isn't a port from a kids movie or part of the Lego franchise.- Sense of scale: This game feels huge.  Each world is HUGE, and there are four of them.  It is something akin to Assassin's Creed, but much more artistically done in a fantasy world.- The best ending I've seen in a game.Now for the CONS:- The writing and voice acting for the prince was horrid.  Other's have bemoaned his new jerk-like personality, and I concur.  Not only is it bad, the voice actor is bad at pulling it off.  I think the writers were going for more of a wise-cracking young guy, but he just comes across as annoying.- The boss battles really do suck.  They are far too redundant, and pretty much amount to chaining the same attacks together over and over, with some quick-time elements thrown in.  Luckily, these battles are only a small part of the game.At this game's current price of sixteen dollars, it is really a no-brainer for those who enjoy stress-free gaming in a surreal environment.  I fully recommend it.  4.5 out of 5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2011"}

I already have a PlayStation Eye, so I only bought Move and pretended to play it with Heavy Rain (when the path releases), Flower, Pain and Hight Velocity Bowling. The only game currently of that list that I tried is HV Bowling and some demos, which are Spots Champions, EyePet and Tumble (which I ended up buying).This were my experiences:XMB: First of all, you can navigate through the XMB with Move, just hold the trigger(T) button and move the controller UP, DOWN and SIDEWAYS. I found the navigation to be much faster than the DualShock in every aspect, even when navigating in the PS Store.HV Bowling: Is much intuitive, comfortable and newbie friendly than with the DualShock's SixAxis Montion System, but its has its cons, (1) is much difficult to make curve balls and (2) move controller doesn't shine in this game, remember this is almost a launch title, so don't expect too much.PROS----+ The sphere turns multiple into colors when you do a strike, this give a sense of achievement that the SixAxis didn't have.+ Much more intuitive.+ Much more comfortable.+ Much more user friendly for new comers.CONS----- Much more difficult to do curve shots.- Motion technology doesn't shine with this game.- Aiming system is harder than with the dualshockOverall: 7/10EyePet's Demo: You are only able to test the move when you shower your pet and when you draw an airplane. This game is a move required one, but it seems it only uses Move's technology like 50% of the gameplay's time. The only part were the controller shines is when showering the pet, the tracking  is 1:1, you can twist the controller in every direction and the game will recognized the movements and show it to you in real time. The drawing was slow paced and the crayons were to big to draw a detail airplane (I guess this is because its focused for a younger audience).PROS----+ Some of the move's options are cool.CONS----- Some of the move's options are slowpaced (like for kids)Overall: 6/10Tumble full game: The experience is great, can't imagine in 3D (pure awesomeness), this game is designed for the move controller, although the speed in the menus is slow and it doesn't work as a true pointer, the experience in game is great.PROS----+ Ingame motion true 1:1+ Great user of move's technologyCONS----- Speed in menus is slow for non reason- Menus pointer is not intuitive (I guess it kinda works like the gameplay pointer which doesn't makes sense since you can't see a controller in the menus)Overall:8.5/10Sport Champions: WOW.... AMAZED. This is were the move's technology really shines, great move lunch title, true 1:1 tracking with the a real speed feedback and pointer. Its simple, both minigames on the demo (table tennis and golf disc) were 100% accurate to the movements I made with the controller. (OffTopic, I found Disc Golf entertaining, unexpected, I have been re thinking on getting this games thanks to the demo, wow, I didn't had a good experience with Wii Sports (which aren't accurate, just fun and balanced, but not accurate), because of Wii Sports I initially didn't have plans on getting this game, but this is NOT WII SPORTS, this is PS3 SPORTS (much more hardcore, unbalanced between casual and hardcore gamers, and off course, much more precise)).PROS----+ 1:1 True motion tracking+ Best experience with move yet on the market+ Move shines with this game+ True pointer tracking, NO DELAY+ Overall NO DELAY.CONS----NoneOverall:10/10+++++++++++++++++++++++++CONCLUSIONWhat a piece of hardware, we ps3 owners, are lucky to own, is really surprising the precision move's technology has; it's clear that the response time will depend on the software, Move's is capable of 1:1 motion tracking, the speed and delay will depend on how developers program their games, this is very clear.PROS----+ Comfortable controller (not as the wiimote, which with the condom is much more comforter)+ Coloring Sphere feedback+ MOTION TECHNOLOGYCONS----None- Sony for not packaging a bundle of a Move's controller with sports champions (Got dam... they didn't thought in the current clients that already own a PS Eye).OVERALL 10/10OVERALL","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2010"}

Could be the fast and strategic action.  I dunno.  But I am hugely opposed to the game of soccer - I think it is a wretched sport.  HOWEVER... I started off playing Super Mario Strikers at the electronics stores only to find out later that I can't get enough of this game!  Who'd have thunk it?Super Mario Strikers combines the classic Mario World characters with fast and fun features designed to bring out the coolest parts about soccer.  And, of course, the tournament mode and the multiplayer games just push the great game concept over the brink.My favorite part is the strategy within the game of soccer that is so overly pronounced in MSS, namely, getting out front, then cross-passing to your teammate coming up across the field but behind you.  As you power up your kicking foot - pointing to the quarter of the goal you wish to attempt penetration - the game slows down to get the anticipation up.  Then, your player boots the ball with a powerful affect - the slowing down action obviously makes the kick look like a rocket! - and the goalie (who is automated) dives for it.So awesome...I also love the take-out slides.  I appreciate obliterating opponents, even when unnecessary.Anyway, take it from a guy who can't stand soccer - Mario Super Strikers is a great game that can be fun for anybody.  Unlike the other Mario sports titles, however, this is one game where the single player mode might be the more fun.

I must have played 100 hours of it last year alone (keep in mind how old this game is!) - and I have the epic soundtrack in my car right now as i type this.  Long story short - I give Diablo 2 an 11/10 - and Diablo 3 8/10.  I will be playing diablo 2 again when/if I get done with Diablo 3 anytime soon.So the junk PC gamers had to deal with?  Gone.  You don't have to spend your hard earned $$ to cheat your way into having good items.  You do NOT have to have online connection to play.  A major victory.

Do you like movies like \"Army of Darkness\"?  The cheeze factor is here - and you will either love it or hate it.My MAJOR complaint on this game is the way you communicate in this.  I HATE communicating via headset.

The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance. Just be careful not to knock out your significant other, or bruise the dog, severely, while using one, or two Nunchuk controllers.","reviewerName":"Scott","summary":"Get one of these","reviewText":"This is the nintendo made nunchuck i got mine for about $13.00 and that is with shipping included. a smart purchase. you need it and if you dont have it make sure you get the official one as china made ones die. so get the legit one. and this one is legit.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2011"}

Unlike Doom 3 Quake 4 is more of a \"on rails shooter\" where it guides you through a lot of scary and tense scripted events. These work for the game and separates it from it's brethren. You play as Kane who is a soldier that has to help stop the Strogg invasion by destroying them at their core; the Nexus. As you make your way to the Nexus you can pick up a ton of cool weapons, upgrades, and even turn into a Strogg yourself. The weapons range from your piddly blaster to a dark matter gun. You have your railgun, a nailgun, shotgun, lightning gun etc.Throughout the campaign you can unlock upgrades for these weapons like clip extenders, scopes, and extra damage. This let's you easily change your strategy around and what gun works in what situation. The game has some pretty neat enemies types ranging from Grunts that rush you with their bulky body or Berserker's who are all about melee. You have floating enemies that shoot rockets at you, you have giant spider robots, you even have massive Strogg with shields and railguns. These are all gruesome looking enemies that are both terrifying to look at and really fun to fight. The game sports great AI with enemies dodging your shots and ducking behind cover. Each enemy has to be taken care of differently, so you have have five weaker enemies and two guys with railguns. You take the five weaker ones out with a grenade or a rocket then deal with the railgun guys with your dark matter gun, or you can shoot rockets at their feet. This allows you to create a strategy that works best for you. I just really love the atmosphere Quake 4 delivers. You'll walk through rooms and lights will dim and enemies will run across corridors, your team mates will get dragged off and tortured, and there are also some really cool vehicle sections. You either mount a machine gun, drive a tank, or a mech. All handle really well and these sections are both fun and challenging. This is a nice change too Quake which has always been on foot.Now when it comes to multiplayer the game is fun, but nothing really special. What doesn't help is no one is playing online (which really sucks) and the one map I did play was really boring. The game does have a lot of downfalls though. The game does have major framerate issues, but isn't as bad as what people say. It only bothered me a few times in the game. The graphics are really good yet the Doom 3 engine is really dated and can't be pushed any further. While the game does have weapons upgrades and vehicle sections the game still feels redundant, and has the dumbest ending ever. So, if you want a good single player experience it's worth a rental or purchase (it's less than $10 everywhere) then play Quake 4.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

We had hours of fun with that one with all the neighborhood kids when it was raining or snowing and we weren't able to go outside. This is another varation of the many word games on the market today. I love word games so Bookworm is right up my alley!You hold the DS sideways. That's actually kind of a con for me as I find that doing this requires that I take the DS out of the case which is just too heavy to play a sideways game. I keep it in the case to protect it (play through case). I also find games where the DS is flipped to be harder on my wrists and hands so I can't play as long. Depending on how you look at it that could be a con (can't feed the addiction in long bursts!) or pro (my kids get something besides mac and cheese for dinner!)I started playing in classic mode which is not timed. You just keep going until you lose. There really isn't any pressure in this mode. Its my favorite. The action mode can get intense as you try to get rid of the burning tiles before they hit the bottom. Because I play this game to relax I don't want to create too much stress for myself--I only play action when I'm tense since it lets me channel my energy.As with many word games like Scrabble you will find yourself defaulting to the quick short words instead of looking for the longer words worth more. That's why classic mode is so nice since you aren't timed and can take your time (except for the burning tiles!). There is a handy little area where it keeps track of how many of each word you've created e.g. like 565 3 letter words, 456 4 letter words, and so on. I like that the little guy also tells you the meanings of words occasionally.That's really all there is to this little title. It is simple but highly addicting. Those are the best kind of puzzle games as they can be shared with all family members and it doesn't take days to learn how to play them. I think this game would be a great fit for anyone who can spell at least 3 letter words. A homeschooling parent could use this to enhance curriculum and someone more my age (let's just say I'm on the other side of 40) can use it to keep his/her mind quick.Bookworm also has multi and single card download play so for all you who like to play against other or with others you'll appreciate that! It is a great feature especially for kids in the car as you just need one cart to play.Overall this gets a very enthusiastic thumbs up. At the under twenty price its a good deal for your DS library. It doesn't break the bank and it has many fun hours of exploring for you. Recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2009"}

The graphics don't look better than Halo 3 and ODST, they look different. The colors and armor looks different with all the new customization and the new credit system. In previous Halo games you would level by winning games. In Halo Reach you earn credits on your own by your kills, playing objective, assist, etc. I think this was a great addition to Halo Reach because most time your team sucks unless your running a full party of players with you.This game is very different indeed but, I cant name what makes it feel different. The new armor abilities take effect on the game. Most people don't find balance with the armor abilities. I believe there are 5 or 6 abilities to choose from depending on what game type your playing. Most people stick to the simple abilities(Sprint,Camo,Jetpack). I rarely find people using any of the other abilities. The thing about Halo 3 was everything was equal. Everyone spawned with the same weapons and had weapons just as good on each side. I really admired the Halo series for that.The replay value of this game is very high. The brought Forge mode back which is better than ever and makes it a lot more simpler for people to create there own maps. Custom games are also being incorporated with forges while players are working on new custom games to make for Halo Reach.The reason I'm going to give this game four stars in overall is because I think the campaign wasn't as strong I believe there are only 2-3 missions where all six members of Noble team are together. I found it was just me as Noble Six playing by myself or another Noble member 30 feet away from me doing something else. The other things I don't like so much are the maps. In Halo Reach the maps are either really good or really bad. I know at least 3 maps were based in forge world and made out of things you can have in forge. I'd rather have new colorful maps instead of 3 of the maps built in Forge mode by bungie. Last, I do not like how they organized the game types. I find every time I want to play BTB(Big Team Battle) everyone votes for Team Snipers or SWAT. If your not a good sniper in Call of Duty you will be very terrible at Team Snipers. I find myself getting 10+ kills in Team Snipers depending on my team. SWAT is a game type where you have no shields and it's one shot headshot.Even though I do decent in SWAT if I wan't one shot headshots I'll go play Call of Duty, otherwise I'd rather play a game where you have shields.Thanks that's my review.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2010"}

Here's hoping that the next Halo will actually be as smooth as Call of Duty insofar as the weapons and collision detection go. But that is nitpicking.There are few other games that truly deserve a 10, Reach is DEFINITELY ONE OF THEM. I don't believe that a better game will arrive for MANY years. Perfection is still a long way off, but until that day..... YOU WILL BE PLAYING REACH. Call of Duty for the time being has cleaner and smoother shooting, but a meatier game you will not find.

The graphics and gameplay were spot-on, while it provided a lot of interesting characters and furthering the mythology of Metal Gear. There was just one problem: you couldn't figure it out. Wave after wave of cutscene and plot twists left you wondering what the hell? Over the course of the game, you find out a group called the Patriots are secretly controlling America, only thing is they've been dead for a century. In the words of Snake: \"what the hell?\" In comes 3, which actually goes back when Metal Gear was first being developed.Story: You are Naked Snake(not literally, his code name), a CIA agent sent to rescue a nuclear scientist named Sokolov from a group called the Cobras who are using Sokolov to build a device capable of launching nuclear weapons. The Cobras are basically like 1's Foxhound or 2's Dead Cell. Over the course of the game, you find out more about Naked Snake's old mentor the Boss as well as the origin of Metal Gear.Graphics: Metal Gear Solid 2 looked very shape-y with squares and it looked flat while this is more detailed. The jungle looks quite detailed and there's a lot to see despite the fact it's only branch and trees. The character models look better too and emote more.Sound/Music: David Hayter returns as Snake and he's more expressive and human then the soldier badass Solid Snake. The rest are pretty good, especially the Boss, played by Lori \"Diane Simmons on Family Guy\" Alan. The Cobras, especially Fear and Pain have those stereotypical \"evil\" voices but they're not bad. The music has a nice epic score done by semi well-known composer Harry Gregson Williams of Armageddon fame. Also has a James Bond feel to it.Gameplay: A bit of changes which makes it feel different. Since the story's set in the 60's, Mei Ling hasn't invented your Radar system which got really annoying since your only types of radar consume battery power and the enemy's green coats tended to blend into the green backgrounds. Now you use the Camoflage system where you dress up according to the surroundings. More higher the %, better you won't be seen.You get the option in fighting of CQC(Close Quarter Combat) where you have more options when you grab an enemy: either throw him, slit his throat, interrogate him or use him as a shield. If you're like me, you just pick them off from far away and not worrying about them finding you. Your CODEC hasn't been invented yet either so you only have your radio.One thing that has been reduced but not by much is the frequency of cutscenes and CODEC transmissions and general weirdness of that plot. There's no Colonel acting virus-like on here or double crossers and thankfully, no 10 minute Codec screens everytime you're in a new area. You can press R1 now and then during cutscenes for some neat moments like Snake staring at a woman's chest or a mysterious ghost like figure to helpful hints. It's not as overtly complicated as MGS2 or as cool as one but it's the first time I've beaten the game twice within the span of a few days so I find it strangely addicting.Overall, it's another great entry in the series that has been rumored to be the last although I think they announced a 4. Let's hope it takes place after MGS2 so they can explain what the hell happened.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2004"}
{"product_name":"B001D7T2VC","reviewerName":"Yi-sheng Chiu","summary":"Read the review before buying...","reviewText":"I bought the game when the game releaeed. It took me about 10~12 hours to complete the game. As you might have read reviews of some websites. What the editors say is true that this game absorbs lots of ideas from other games.For anyone considering buying the game. I'm writing about my opinions about this game. I own computer, wii, PS3, Xbox360.First of all, this is a combination puzzles and combat (plus some exploration) If you are looking for a game that has a very good fighting system or combat combo. It won't satisfy you especially after playing fast pace games like \"Bayonetta\" \"Devil May Cry\" etc. You will probably spend 50% of time solving puzzles, looking for treasures. Although the combat system feels like God of War but they're not even close. In Darksiders, the combat is just not as smooth as other action games.I love action game. However, this game I'd enjoy the puzzle more than combats. There are some interesting dungeons put together.Graphic: The character design and world design is pretty cool. I think it's one of the strong point in this game. Some of the cut scenes are amazing. You can find the trailer on the internet to have a taste. The in-game graphic isn't as good as I expected. I feel like it's a little monotone. The world in Darksiders doesn't have whole bunch of details but you'll see the big picture, deserts, caves, water sewer graveyard, various of places to visit.Sound: Voice acting was satisfied and the sound effects are decent. Since I'm using 2.1 studio speaker I'm couldn't really analyze this part deeply.gameplay: As I mentioned it's not a 100% action game. The combat won't be too intense. Somehow, the game can be finished by simply repeating 1 button combo. There are couple more close combat weapon for use of choice. The weapons share similar quality so it's fun to use them, however, not the most effective way in combat. There are also some ranged weapons. Most of them are for solving puzzles while couple of them can use in combat. I don't recommend using them because you need to use the close range weapons in order to upgrade your weapons.There are a little bit control issues when I'm climbing the edge. The direction is harder to control. I got confused sometimes. I freezes in the game randomly couple times which force me to reboot my console. Otherwise everything was smooth.Darksiders did not meet my expectation. Many will tell you it's a great game. I agree with that, of course, it's a combination of many good ideas. But I just don't feel fresh while I'm playing. It's not that excited for me as a gamer. There isn't a high replay value for me. Starting a new game won't keep the status of previous game. Basically, the first round you'll find everything you need to find like lifestone or magic items even train your weapons. It will spend sometime so I don't think I wanna do everything all over again for 2nd round...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"M.D.C. \"Tempting Reviews\"","summary":"You are NOT a Final Fantasy fan IF...","reviewText":"- Before reading my review, you thought this was the 13th Final Fantasy game;- You think \"Garland\" is a plant next to your sirloin steak;- Your first Final Fantasy was 7 and you never played any of the previous ones;- You never knew that Final Fantasy VI for GBA is actually a very old game first released on SNES; or- You think this is true to what Final Fantasy stood for.Didn't think I'd throw that last one in there, did you?  Well, I did...because this definitely is not true to the Final Fantasy creedo.  Let me be clear, and I feel deja vous from my Star Trek 2009 review: This is a good game.  It is not a good Final Fantasy game.  If Square Enix had released this as the beginning of an entirely new franchise, this game would be getting nearly perfect scores across the board; do you know why?  Because then reviewers such as myself and IGN and GameSpot would not have a point of reference to compare against.  Unfortunately, Square Enix wanted to capitalize one more time on the Final Fantasy name and felt compelled to release this game under that umbrella.  It was a mistake.  Nearly as big a mistake as not calling Final Fantasy XI \"Final Fantasy Online\".  Probably a larger mistake than some others I'll note.***For summary judgment, skip to the very bottom***Many others have already reviewed, and I'll add my two cents in here.  I think I understand what people's general issue is with the game and I'll try to speak to it as best I can.  In a nutshell, the gameplay is fine, the graphics are above peer...it's everything else that seems screwy.  It's clear that SE wanted to try some new things, freshen up what they thought to be an aging franchise, and in truth it was...but in my opinion, as I said before, this should have been a new franchise.  Nevermind the fact that SE has at least four other franchises that for some reason they refuse to continue with.  I don't necessarily know which one this might have fit into, probably none of them.  All I can say for certain is that this game feels more like an Enix-ish game than a Square-ish game, if that makes any sense.If you ever played a wonderful game named Legend of Legaia, or Legaia:Duel Saga, the battle engine reminds me of a faster paced version of that.  That's not a bad thing.  In fact, the battle engine is a shining part of the game, just not for a Final Fantasy game (I know I keep saying that...I promise I will explain).  IT's turn based, but it goes so fast that you probably won't recognize it as the traditional turn based gameplay.  The difference between this game and many others is that you don't control more than one person at a time.  Some actually like this - gamers who don't want to do too much thinking in their games.  I have an acquaintance who is such a person.  There are others though, like myself, who like total control over their gameplay and don't want to be subject to blind rules.Speaking of the story, if I had to explain it, I can best say that it feels like opening a book to the midpoint and reading 30 pages, reading backwards to the beginning, then reading forward to the end.  When the game starts, unlike previous Final Fantasy games or other RPGs for that matter, you're not introduced properly to your characters.  Unlike FF7, you're not introduced as a member of SOLDIER.  Unlike FFX you're not explained as a Blitzball champion who strives to be better than his father.  Unlike Star Ocean you're not presented as the member of an elite fleet of space ships.  No...here you're thrown right into the thick of a war.  It's never clear what war, or why you're fighting.  You meet characters, seemingly out of thin air, with no backstory or anything in common that brings them together except fighting in said war.  People die that you never got a chance to really meet (or so it seems at the beginning).  Only via flashbacks are you then introduced to certain people.  But it expects you to have remembered these key events as you progress through the game.  They present all sorts of \"shock\" instances trying to bring you into the story and attach you emotionally, but in the end it feels disjointed and confusing.  You're often wondering why these people stay together.So...I think the reason people are half-and-half on this one lies in three things, having to do with the presentation.  First, the gameplay is totally abstract from any Final Fantasy that ever was.  The battle engine is a throwback to Legend of Legaia, and it retains turn based roots, but the way it plays out just doesn't feel \"Final Fantasy\", at least not to me.  Second, the story is told in a very odd way...to use an analogy, refer to any Matt Damon movie, like The Talented Mr. Ripley, where things transpire out of order of a straight forward story, with the climax near the beginning and the introduction in the middle and...I can't explain it any better than that, so I won't attempt to.Instead, I will speak about the third topic of discussion, probably the most debated online right now: the linearity.  I want to point out for the record that despite what anyone tells you, this game IS linear.  However, it's no more linear than Final Fantasy X or Final Fantasy X-2.  In fact, the map navigation is almost identical to Final Fantasy X in that you have a single path from which you cannot deviate (and no, walking backwards does not count).  Now, I don't know if this decision came about from complaints from users after the debacle that was Final Fantasy XII; I'm not sure.  If you don't know, that game was wide open as it got, allowing you to walk anywhere and do anything you wanted, virtually.  In any event, the linearity is both a blessing and a curse: It's a good thing as it keeps you focused on the story (and focus is desperately needed, given the story is so confusing), but it's a bad thing as those who like to explore will feel suffocated for sure.  Speaking strictly as a fan of Dragon Quest VIII, probably the most wide open traditional RPG there ever has been, I definitely felt restricted and not in control of my quest.There are other points, but rather than go into detail, I'll just keep with tradition.=-= What Final Fantasy XIII Does RIGHT =-=- The graphics, obviously.  The detail of things blowing up and crumbling as you navigate is something to behold, especially if you're a fan of Mass Effect 2.  The majority of the transitions between gameplay and CGI cutscene are transparent and makes you feel like part of what's going on even more so.  The cutscene graphics at time are so detailed as to feel like you're watching a movie. If you ever saw Final Fantasy: Advent Children on Blu-ray?  Yeah, like that.- I have to give Square Enix credit for trying something new after all of this time, with the battle engine.  It's turn-based, yet ATB (Active Time Battle) is on, meaning you can still get your tail handed to you.  It requires quick thinking and wit.  Some have criticized the Autobattle option as a button mash; what they don't realize is that you really aren't forced to use that option.  If you want to use strategy of your own, just use the battle options beneath (but see WRONG below).- I found Final Fantasy XII to be unwieldy and unnecessarily convoluted.  It was like they tried to throw everything possible into the game and in the end, some liked it, but I couldn't stand the game.  Final Fantasy XIII, though advanced far beyond its predecessors, is easy to get into and used to the battle engine and general flow of the game, with a very low learning curve (but see WRONG below).- The voice actors did a good job on this game, even on Sazh, which surprised me for obvious reasons.=-= What Final Fantasy XIII Does WRONG =-=- The depth of everything else is so shallow that you feel at times that Square Enix banked on the graphics to skyrocket this game into superstardom...and honestly, it will go down as one of the best looking games on any system.  The problem with that is the same as with human beings: supermodels only look good for so long, but someone will always look better than the person before it.  It's temporary, which means you need to rely on your other talents to keep you at the top.- Characters are introduced haphazardly and without any backstory.  The flow of the game basically compels you to play for extensive periods before you even really get to know any of the characters you're dealing with.  It's like reading the middle of the book before you read the beginning.- Very limited armor customization options.  It's pretty much a single accessory and little else.- I wasn't a big fan of the music.  It's not bad, but nowhere near as epic as that found on Dragon Quest VIII, Star Ocean: The Last Hope, or even Infinite Undiscovery.  Of that list, Dragon Quest VIII still holds the trophy in terms of truly memorable music, so I know Square Enix can do better.- Some people have said there are no towns.  This isn't true; there are towns, but no shops and no adhoc conversations.  Star Ocean, for example, emphasized this with the Private Action system (which was subsequently ruined in Star Ocean: The Last Hope, BTW), and when you think of towns, you think of basically ever Final Fantasy that came before this one, even Final Fantasy XI, as well as Dragon Quest VIII, Infinite Undiscovery, Last Remnant, pretty much every single RPG that was not created in the US has this concept of visiting towns, talking to townsfolk, visiting merchants and buying items, weapons and armor, etc.  Final Fantasy XIII blew this away completely and instead merged it with a system similar to the one found in Final Fantasy: Crisis Core, where you basically are buying items from some unknown machine at the save point.  Some might not mind this; I do.  It feels disjointed having to wait for that machine to get updated with better gear and the items I need.- The Paradigm Shift is a novel idea that fails in practice.  This is because of the behaviors of certain Paradigms.  The Medic, for example, will just constantly heal over and over, even if the character's energy is full.  Since there are no MP, this isn't a big deal, but it's a waste of valuable turns.  Also, when you do unlock magic, you'll find your characters will no longer use the same attacks they did before you got magic.  Vanille, for example, finds a weapon that has retracting chains...the weapon gets to strike three times, and when you use her, she'll dish more damage than Lightning's basic attacks.  When Vanille gains magic, she'll constantly use that and never attack with her weapon, even if her magic (Aero, for example) hits the enemy for pathetic damage.  Nothing I did seemed to change this behavior and it's annoying - it's the reason I like to control all of my characters, so I make sure they do what I need them to do.  Reminds me of the NES version of Dragon Warrior IV - and that's not a good memory.- The Crystarium is Final Fantasy XIII's version of the Sphere Grid, but done poorly.  Instead of having total control over what traits you get, you're forced to follow a linear path of updates, similar to those found in games like Crimson Gem Saga and Final Fantasy X-2 with the Dress Spheres.  While I understand why they did this, it's still annoying.So...do I recommend it?  Yes...I do.  It's not a terrible game.  It's one of those \"Love it or hate it\" games, honestly.  Not everyone will like it, but I can say that if you enjoyed Final Fantasy X's linearity, this game's linearity will be quite familiar and welcome, and if you enjoyed Legend of Legaia's battle engine, this one's battle engine will be right up your alley.  If you like confusing, complex stories like Last Remnant, this one won't disappoint, and if you like games that are simple to get into, you need to give this one a whirl.Just don't go in expecting a Final Fantasy game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2010"}
{"product_name":"B003O6EATE","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Great Hardware That Would Be Better With Great Software","reviewText":"Let's rewind the clocks back for a moment.  In 2005, Sony released the PSP.  At the time it was the most powerful handheld on the market.  It did some incredible things.  The specs were on part with the PS2, it could play music and movies... and yet for quite some time we could only talk about the &#34;potential&#34; it had for video games.  As time waned on many of the PSPs best games were either ports from the PS2 or games that were ported to the PS2 (Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories).  As a device it was fantastic.  But as a gaming system it took a lot longer than it should have to take off.  Eventually we did get some good, worthwhile software.  Despite selling moderately well and being a great piece of hardware, Sony just didn't seem all that crazy about pushing the gameplay experiences you could have with the device.And now history is repeating itself.The Playstation Vita is by far one of the greatest handheld gaming devices that you can find.  The hardware in and of itself is pretty impressive.  The graphical presentation of games is fantastic, but more than that... the user interface is pretty amazing as well.  It's almost like carrying around a Playstation 3 from time to time.  The user interface ditches the XMB used by the PSP and PS3 in favor of icons similar to apps on a smartphone menu.  Tap one and you can launch apps, games or your internet browser.  You can also sign in to the PSN and look at your trophies (on either PS3 or Vita).  You can also use your Vita for remote play on your PS3 or PS4.  It's a fascinating device.There are four face buttons (the classic square, triangle, circle and cross buttons) and a D-Pad.  But the nice little addition here is the inclusion of two analog sticks for your gaming pleasure.  Considering the kind of games the Vita can handle, having two will make a great deal of gaming experiences pretty simple (especially with rotating cameras).  There is an L and R buttons as well.  The other thing that makes the hardware pretty nice is the use of touch screens.  On the front the screen is also a touch screen.  So you can always tap on icons to utilize them as well.  Just the same, this function is also used in some games, though it isn't always to the benefit of the game you're playing.  Going beyond that there is also a touch panel on the back.  Again, this can also be used in gameplay, and again, not always to the benefit of the game.  But it's still a good idea if a developer ever makes good use of it.The Vita makes for a pretty decent portable entertainment center all on its own.  There are a multitude of apps you can download for the device.  If you're interested in Netflix or Hulu, this will work out just fine for you as well.  The screen makes it so that everything is pretty crisp and clean.  The picture you get is very clear.  The speakers also work well.  There are a multitude of apps to download for the time being and so it's pretty clear that you can use the Vita for much more than just gaming needs.  You can also now play PSOne classics on it where the back panel acts as the L2 and R2 buttons.  The most perplexing drawback to the Vita is that there's not backwards compatibility for PSP games.  So if you've still got PSP games you enjoy you might want to consider holding onto your PSP before getting rid of it for a Vita.  You can download PSP games but there is hardly any point to paying money for the same game twice if your physical copy is still in fine working order.  At least downloading PSP games isn't terribly expensive in the event you find yourself in need to do so.On the other hand this brings about the Vita's most aggravating flaw.  The fact that the memory cards are quite expensive and if you go the route of downloading games (or utilizing it for everything you can) you'll find it can eat up memory fast.  Even after the price drop, memory cards for the Vita can still be expensive.  Especially if you're looking for a lot of space.  Lastly, the battery life may not be totally sufficient.  Because of everything the Vita is it can eat away at the battery pretty fast.  Expect to have to charge it often.All that aside the device itself is a great piece of hardware.  The only other problem is that it doesn't quite have the software to support the hardware in question.  Going back to the PSP for a minute, we spent quite a bit of time wondering where are the games.  The Vita is in a similar boat.  It's had enough time to find its footing, but it seems that there are still not a lot of good games for the Vita just yet.  It's great to have the bells and whistles, but at the end of the day I already have devices that can do the things the Vita can already do.  If you've got a smartphone or a tablet you'll find that there isn't much point to getting a Vita if you're looking for good gaming experiences.  You might find use if you travel a lot, but that's about it.  A lot of good Vita games are already on the PS3 or 360.  Want to play games like Mortal Kombat, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Rayman Legends or the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection?  Already readily available on the consoles.  The Vita doesn't have too many games it can call its own.  It's a fantastic piece of hardware... but I'm still waiting for a gaming experience to come out that can make the Vita more worthwhile.  I don't mind an entertainment center in my pocket (although you'll probably be investing in cases, screen protectors etc.) but I didn't buy a Vita JUST to have an entertainment center in my pocket.  I'd really like some great games to play and this is the area where the Vita seems to be lacking most severely.  It's hard to convince a gamer to buy a particular device (even a handheld one) if you can't provide the software for it.  They're often the bread and butter of what makes a gaming console or handheld so worthewhile to begin with.  All the other things my Vita does I have devices for and more.  But what those things wouldn't be able to do that my Vita can is provide a gaming experience I won't find on a tablet or a smartphone.  And with the hardware capabilities it also means that I could have an experience that a console might not be able to provide.All that being said, the Vita IS a great piece of hardware.  It is amazing just how much power will literally be in the palm of your hand.  If it had great software to accompany the great hardware it would be a fantastic device to have.  As it stands now, it's hard to recommend the portable device for those who are really looking for unique gaming experiences.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"Leohlyon","summary":"Worth more than it's $400.00 price-tag","reviewText":"It's very rare that anyone will hear me say a product is worth more to me than what I paid for it (it's usually the other way around). I'm not a fanboy by any stretch, so I'm not here to bash the X-Box One, or romanticize about how much better I think the PS4 is than any other console. The only console I'll be comparing it to is the PS3, which makes sense because that's it's predecessor.I'll start by highlighting some of the improvements I've noticed with the PS4, when compared to the PS3.-- The controller looks and feels different. The shoulder buttons, as well as the sticks are different. During heated gameplay, my thumbs would always slip off the sticks while using the PS3 controller. So far, that hasn't been an issue. The 'start' and 'select' buttons are now a thing of the past; they've been replaced with the 'share' and 'options' buttons. The share button allows you to broadcast live gameplay, or save a video / screen-shot to your PS4's hard drive, for future viewing. While playing a game, the options button works similarly to the old start button, but does give you other options while navigating the PS4 home page.-- The console itself has undergone quite a face lift, and looks pretty damn good. Here are a couple of changes that are HUGE for me, but may or may not matter to you. I really, really hated that the PS3 had to be turned on in order to charge my controller. This is no longer an issue because the PS4 can charge the controller while in standby mode! I used to plug in my controller and let it charge before going to bed. I'd wake up the next morning, and touch the back of my PS3 and notice it was hot to the touch, which is a by product of being on for 8 damn hours (I'm aware there's a setting that shuts down the PS3 after 2 hours, but we shouldn't have to do that). If you like to download movies from the PlayStation store, you'll be pleased to know that you can start watching your movie as soon as you start the download! This wasn't the case with the PS3 - If I didn't allow the movie to finish downloading, it would start buffering every other minute, and that's no fun. Oh, one more quick note. There's no longer an on / off button on the back.-- I've only owned my PS4 for about a month, but I've learned a lot of neat things about it. There's an app called 'Live on PlayStation', and you can watch other gamers play their games, in real time! I no longer need to rely on YouTube walkthroughs to help me decide if I want to buy a game or not. For example; I was very curious about Destiny, so I decided to visit Live on PlayStation and watch people play it. I ultimately decided it wasn't for me. There's nothing like being able to watch others play, and seeing how the game would look on your actual television. Cool, right? I don't want this review to drag on, but there are plenty of other things to do like Ustream, IGN channel, etc. I'm sure most people know this, but just in case you don't: If you have a PS4, but your buddy still has a PS3, not to worry because you can still communicate with each other via the PlayStation messaging system. Although the two consoles can talk to each other, you can't play PS3 games on the PS4.-- Of course, the PS4 isn't perfect (pretty damn close though). The only thing that gets on my nerves is the $50.00 per year PlayStation Plus fee, which is now required for online gaming. I think you can also pay a month to month fee, if you choose. Honestly, I no longer care about the fee because I'm really enjoying myself with this console. Even my wife has taken a liking to it, and she dislikes all things videogames. There's just so much to do; I feel like I could entertain myself for days without even playing a single game. Boys and girls, you can't put a price-tag on that type of entertainment.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0001ADAMO","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution. With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well. As if the technical edge wasn't enough of a reason to invest in the Xbox version, it's also Live Aware, and comes packaged with an exclusive multiplayer level (the Coliseum). Without the slightest hint of doubt, the Xbox version gets The Edge.Concept:Clean up the west as a merciless cowboy in this heavily influenced spaghetti western gameGraphics:The character models are not the most detailed, but the environments look nice and I love the cameraworkSound:A remarkable soundtrack lures players into the vibe of the westPlayability:Unnaturally short levels and satisfactory run and gun actionEntertainment:The stages should have been longer, but replay is abundant in the number of unlockables and enjoyable multiplayerReplay:ModerateRated:8 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:Buck up, cowpokes. All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"-- \"--\"","summary":"Taking aim at &quot;Red Dead Revolver&quot;. . .","reviewText":"If you're an avid fan of the western and a gamer to boot, then \"Red Dead Revolver\" is the only game in town that should get a tip of your hat. Western-themed games are rare to say the least, and good ones are rarer still. This is the latter kind, and its mature themes make it even more remarkable - it's as close as you'll ever get to playing through an old Clint Eastwood film.You're cast as Red, a bounty hunter who's seeking to avenge the murder of his parents. His quest takes him through many bizarre locations and pits him against a wide variety of murderous outlaws. It's his job to shoot first and ask questions later... then again, he doesn't really ask questions, he just shoots people and leaves it at that.The game's levels are usually brief affairs that revolve around one particular set piece or another and are jam-packed full of people to kill. Fortunately, all that killing is mighty satisfying. There's hardly a wide variety of weapons to help you along despite the designers' best efforts to bring variety to the period setting, but the weapons that exist are cool enough to compensate. Area specific damage and gouts of blood and gore keep things visceral and compelling. Red can fire from cover if things get too hectic, but it's generally not an essential tactic - even if it is a welcome option. He's also got a Max Payne-like ability called \"Dead Eye,\" which allows him to slow time and take steady aim at his opponents.You don't only play as Red during the course of the game. There are several other characters and storylines to delve into, and while they sometimes steer the focus of the game's story in the wrong direction, it's generally a welcome change of pace. Red's native cousin, Shadow Wolf, enjoys a particularly entertaining mission that encourages stealth and a fair aim with a bow and arrow. Some of the other character missions feel tacked on, though - such as the Buffalo Soldier's wagon ride back to town.What's a western-themed action game without the occasional duel? Drawing on opponents is handled like a sort of minigame that generally fits well into the scheme of things. Unfortunately, it's too frustrating, particularly later in the game. It's more a matter of a luck than skill, and certainly could have been handled with more flair.It's far from perfect, but \"Red Dead Revolver\" should provide hours of fairly mindless but addictive fun. With the lack of competition, it easily earns its place as the best western-themed game ever released. If this kind of thing rubs you the right way, go grab a copy.Final Score: B","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2004"}

The small kingdom of Dalmasca was one such neighbor, and it is here that our tale begins. \nIn a fight for freedom, fallen royalty and unlikely allies must struggle to liberate their homeland.","reviewerName":"EMAN NEP","summary":"FINAL VAGRANT TACTICS FANTASY 12","reviewText":"So, here's my take on Final Fantasy's latest. Is it the greatest? Read on and find out!BATTLE SYSTEM: Everything is in real-time, which any veteran FF gamer knows is not the way it used to be. Although it takes a while to get accustomed to this change I found the real-time battles a breath of fresh air--something this series is definitely going to need if we're ever to hope of seeing Final Fantasy 24 or so. It is so nice when the only transition screens you have are those that occur when going to menus, new locations or cut-scenes. Also, the ability to run for your life all the way across the map is really nice, especially in addition with the sounds of thousands of angry hooves and feet stamping after you!TRANSPORTATION: I don't know about you, but I LOVE flying airships on a world map! Sadly, in Final Fantasy 12 this is not possible. Very ironic, because this is the powerful Playstation 2 and the game itself sports alot of airships. There are Chocobos, but that is the only type of transportation you actually steer on your own. You can take teleport crystals to warp you almost anywhere and later your airship can \"fly\" you places.STORYLINE: I would disagree with anyone that says that this game has no storyline. But I would agree that there is so much leveling up/looting to be done between locations that when you reach your final destination you might forget your initial motive for going there. As a whole, FF12's storyline is not as prominent as other storylines, like FF6 and FF7. And of course part of what makes a good storyline are good . . .CHARACTERS: Since anyone can learn any weapon or magic, the only thing that makes them unique are their looks. Fran looks like she escaped from the Playboy mansion, Vaan looks like a younger brother to Ashley Riot from Vagrant Story and Balthier is something of a mix between Setzer and Locke, which is cool. Reddas is an interesting Auron-like person, but he appears too little, too late in the game. Ah yes, and if only Elza in Balfonheim Port were a playable character.ANTAGONISTS: Part of the reason I did not get drawn in by the storyline (what little there is of it) is because the antagonists were not very convincing. You won't find anyone as evil as Kefka or Sephiroth. For a good portion of the game I knew that the Empire was evil (obviously) but had no idea who exactly was the \"Boss\" and even more importantly, WHY? And it doesn't help either that the Empire's black-clad knights like Gabranth sound like Dark Helmet from Spaceballs. Or at least a very pathetic Darth Vader.MUSIC: I own several Final Fantasy game soundtracks and of course I think that Uematsu is brilliant in his work. But I also own the FF Tactics soundtrack and I was surprised how good it was. One of the two composers for the Tactics soundtrack did the music for this game. Unfortunately, by himself, he's not that good. Granted, there were no songs that felt out of place, but at the same time, there were no stellar tracks that captured the EMOTION OF THE MOMENT or had the genius of the work of Uematsu's earlier soundtracks. Considering that you will spend alot of time collecting loot/leveling up in different locations, expect to hear the same track over and over again. Also, the ending boss theme, sadly, is nothing spectacular. I'd even say it's forgettable.SUMMONS, SPELLS AND SIDEQUESTS: For perhaps the first time ever I found myself hardly ever using summons and magic. The summons are nice to look at, but die too easily and deal too little damage and sadly offensive magic is the same way (although Flare comes in handy at the end). Even sadder, to get alot of these spells and summons you have to go on sidequests that are voluntary, but end up feeling mandatory--or you could do the alternative and loot the land for 3 hours and search a whole world for the one shop that sells the magic/weapon/armor you need.GRAPHICS: To me, the least important, but they're definitely good. Although only the first and last few FMV scenes are worth watching twice and unlike FF10, you can't buy them.SOMETHING FUNNY: When Vaan is running around saying \"I'm Captain Basch fon Rosenburg\" I thought it would be funny if he also randomly said, \"I'm Rick James, b-tch!\"OVERALL: If you're a casual RPG gamer, this is clearly a solid RPG that is very well thought through in terms of game mechanics. And let's not forget, you can easily log in 80+ hours before beating the game, which is definitely getting your money's worth.If you're a veteran Final Fantasy gamer, one who's played since it's NES days (or at least its SNES days), then you'll see what a weak story and soundtrack this game has, which to me is below par for a Final Fantasy title.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Rex","summary":"Another Great X-Box, Halo Game...","reviewText":"The first Halo was very overrated in terms of gameplay because it just wasn't what people said it was. Halo 2 though, lived up to its excellence. It lived up to the hype. Even though I wasn't that excited about getting it, and if I didn't get it I didn't care, but now when I finally played it I realized how good it is.The first player game is great, but harder then the first one. Not that much improvements, except some new weapons like the SMG, but you can now hold two weapons at a time! I don't know why they didn't have that in the first game. The same old vehicles are still in it like the Ghost and the Warthog. A new cool weapon is the energy sword and the fact you can turn into an alien on the third level.But the first player has its flaws. It is extremely hard game if you aren't a Halo master. I had trouble beating the first level on Normal, but I beat Halo 1 on Legendary. Thats why co-op is the best in this game. Having another Master Cheif aside blasting away those retarded aliens really helps sometimes.This ganme goes to show you how everything doesn;t have to be a Playstation2 exclusive to be good. This is definatly an X-Box classic, which will never be on Ps2 (thank God) and reminds us of older shooters.

Wagstaff \"kirkwuk\"","summary":"Regrettably average","reviewText":"Absolution was a long wait for fans of the infamous Hitman series. Always known as a unique stealth third/first person simulator, the character Agent 47 just wasn&#8217;t as Hollywood as say, Sam Fisher or Solid Snake. 2012&#8217;s latest addition to the series, the first since 2006, popularises the concept into one which feels barely a fraction of Hitman, tied in with other mechanics of almost every other third-person game since yes, the previous instalment Blood Money. For one, I thought I&#8217;d never see cover mechanics, or object-illumination in a Hitman game &#8211; but I suppose these are the trends of the industry.But my main issue is the disguise system which feels as illogical and asinine as setting up a small company to count the moon every night.  Suspending your disbelief in Hitman has never been in question since the disguise system used to work. In Absolution, disguising feels more of a disadvantage and gives the impression it works AGAINST the player. This is because when you change your clothes, others wearing the same garb get suspicious by just looking at you. So on your first play-through, you may feel you have to eliminate several NPC&#8217;s to choose from an array of costumes to avoid being detected. Therefore, Absolution actually confuses the player into using cover-mechanics in addition to wearing a disguise. NPC&#8217;s actually disregard 47 visibly wall-hugging in broad daylight. The formula simply does not work and plagues Absolution&#8217;s 20-hour campaign. In modern gaming, 10-hours is the standard, so Absolution is generous by the fact a game hasn&#8217;t lasted this long since the early 00&#8217;s. Unfortunately, it instead tests your nerve and punctuality.The biggest change of all is Instinct, a limited, almost super-human like power. This ability allows you to see through walls and predict NPC&#8217;s paths. It feels overpowered but completely necessary in Absolution considering the nature of the (broken) mechanics, as once an opponent is on to you - loading the save game is mandatory if you want a good score. Strangely, the limited &#8220;juice&#8221; you get for using this increases when knocking out or killing opponents, which is ridiculous because everyone knows the best way to play Hitman is to remain a ghost, and cause no disturbance. Now, players are encouraged to incapacitate NPC&#8217;s&#8230; totally ridiculous. Even more so is the fact that if you&#8217;re approaching a suspicious person, you have to activate the &#8220;super-power&#8221; to simply hide your face. It feels awkward, stupid and broken.There&#8217;s also a mini-game which is actually part of the HUD. When walking past NPC&#8217;s who may be suspicious, an arrow appears in the HUD giving you an indication of who is staring at your face with suspicion. This arrow grows as the NPC comes to the realisation you&#8217;re Agent 47! This feels oddly awkward, like they just couldn&#8217;t be arsed representing the suspicions in character expression. In a couple of missions you&#8217;re required to walk through streets and &#8220;blend in&#8221; with crowds to prevent a suspicion from a mass of enemies. It feels like a mini-game rather than a brand new spanking game for a popular franchise.Other incredibly mundane and predictable modern trends Absolution follows is how doors magically lock behind 47 at checkpoints when the game wants to cache the next area. As a result, many of Absolution&#8217;s levels feel as linear as other modern FPS&#8217;s and just act as small area after small area.More differences to characters and plot occur in Absolution than ever before. Whereas the atmosphere used to be quaint and peaceful for the most part, with your character acting as a ghost effectively, in Absolution the storyline merely follows a regular video game plot where &#8220;bad guys&#8221; appear and do things only bad guys can like swearing and setting fire to buildings etc. There&#8217;s profanity, sexual dialogue, as well as plenty of explosions and general stupidity you see in Hollywood movies. 47 is no longer a secret and tends to make stupid mistakes in the story, underestimating and fearing the most clich&eacute;d &#8220;bad-guy&#8221; for some time. In a shock contrast, most of the missions are no longer hits and are simple &#8220;get from point A to point B&#8221; marathons. For the most part, these consist of using the cover function to dart from cover to cover, causing a diversion, before running for the exit and hoping no one sees.The Hitman formula has really changed, and sadly way too much and negatively to recommend to fans of the previous games. On it&#8217;s own, this would be an average or OK game as well. Things I did like about Absolution are the graphics, some of the levels are beautifully made and crafted, and of course the score is fantastic as well. The atmosphere remains dark and adult &#8211; as stupid as some of the characters really are in the story. The difficulty levels are excellent as well, being quite tough but more fun on your second play-through, once you get over the trial and error process of learning the maps. In the end though, Absolution feels like we lost a good friend in 47 by being very little of what he once was.5.5/10","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2013"}

It really is wonderful to see older games feel fresh and newly exciting again. That truly has been the case for one lucky plumber, Mario. Nintendo really has done a remarkable job of reintroducing Mario games to the Game Boy Advance audience. It has done very much wonders for a lot of people, who are now enjoying the feeling of the most groundbreaking entertainment that has ever brought games to the home. Nintendo did it originally with Super Mario Brothers, and their sequel was opposite any of the classic Mario stories that had ever been told.Super Mario Advance: Super Mario Brothers 2, is a restored version to the classic video game from the late 80's. The game features your option of one of four characters to control, Mario or Luigi, Toad or Princess Toadstool. The game is located through seven dream world stages and 20 different levels. The gameplay focuses in on a nightmare Mario has as he and his pals stop Wart and his henchmen including Birdo, Mouser, Fryguy and many shyguys from ruining the dream world Mario is stuck in. The game doesn't feature the traditional Super Mario gameplay, where instead you dig deep to pick up items to hurl at your opponents.Yet, with all the goodsides, there really are a few downsides to this game. The graphics do seem a little bit out of tune, unlike their original NES gameplay, or even the remastered gameplay from the 1993 Super Mario All-Stars compilation for the Super Nintendo. Another problem is the controls. They sometimes can make it very difficult for you to hurl bombs and vegetables when need ed at your foes. Sadly, that does bring unfortunate problems in gameplay at times.All in all, Super Mario Advance: Super Mario 2 is a great exciting twist to the original Super Mario Brothers saga. For anybody who hasn't tried this Mario game, it really just is worth it for the Game Boy Advance. It really is a surprise that just is a delight.Graphics: C+Sound: C+Control: B-Gameplay: B+Overall: B-","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000K9K9AC","description":"WarHawk Bundle with BlueTooth Headset PS3","reviewerName":"Impetigo","summary":"Mind blowing gaming experience","reviewText":"I've now had Warhawk for about 2 weeks now, and bottom line is that this is one f'ing awesome game.  I kept hearing about this game from friends and read the mostly positive reviews here and even though I've never been a big fan of first person shooters (well, technically this is a 3rd person shooter), I decided to try it out.  I bought it on ebay for $40 (game only version) and have been playing it non-stop since then.The Good:The gameplay is easily some of the best action multiplayer you have ever played.  The game is so smooth, even with up to 32 players in a single game.  Not once, even with a ton of players in the screen and crazy action going on, did the game slow down at all.  Incredible.  Tanks, jeeps, jets, gun/rocket turrets, machine gun stands, etc., make this game better than any other action/war game out there.  Jumping on the back of a jeep someone else is driving and commanding the machine gun, or popping up the hatch on a tank with a rocket launcher while someone else is driving and shooting the cannon is very fun.  This level of interactivity with other players makes this game much more fun and intersting than others.  Hovering a plane and giving air support by blasting enemies to support your allies on the ground is awesome and fun to watch as well when you are on the ground.Video is 720p/1080i, which is better than Halo 3, which is 680p resolution and if you've ever seen it in action, has alot of jaggies.  None in Warcraft.  The graphics are great and looks superb in terms of vehicles, environment, etc.  If you're sensitive to motion sickness with these kind of games, you probably won't with this one.  I couldn't even play Resistance for more than 5 minutes without becoming nauseated, but never had a problem with Warhawk.Audio is amazing.  You get 7.1 PCM audio that sounds great if you have a decent speaker setup.  I spent over $1500 on my speakers and receiver, and I can tell you that they did a great job with the audio.  Action games are of course ideal for surround sound, and it is incredible on Warhawk.  Great fly by effects as jets roar past you, excellent placement of explosions, gunfire, etc., all around you that makes the experience very intense if you pump up the volume.The BadNot much bad stuff really.  The learning curve is a bit steep for flying and hovering the planes, but the controls are intuitive and once you start to get a hang of it, it becomes highly enjoyable.  It's worth it when you start to get better at dogfighting and engaging in air to ground combat.  There is no offline campaign or story, unlike Resistance, but that is fine with me as online multiplayer gaming is the entire point of Warhawk.BottomlineAgain, Warhawk is a great game.  If you stick with it and learn how to control the hover planes, you will be happy you did.  The gameplay is nothing short of amazing and the experience of playing this on my projector with a 70-100\" image and audio blasting on a 7.1 speaker system is a great gaming experience.  The best game I ever bought for a console.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2007"}

Featuring detailed environments and complicated new battle mechanisms, this game demands a different kind of perspective than the first-person shooters from the original Halo series. You'll need to uncover the hidden strengths and weaknesses of each unit and play them to your tactical advantage, and that's just the beginning.UNSC: Be Part of a Legendary ConflictThe story opens with UNSC forces retaking the planet Harvest from the Covenant. At your disposal -- should you choose to take command of UNSC forces -- will be everything from a corps of highly-trained Marines to the Warthogs, Scorpions, and Hornets you'll need for air and land attacks. You'll take stock of the map and decide between holding your ground or advancing on enemy strongholds, all while trying to navigate the local terrain and outsmart Covenant forces. And when you need something extra to tip the tide in your favor, UNSC leaders can provide you with the ability to mobilize highly specialized units or call the Spirit of Fire vessel for support from above.Covenant: A Capable, Playable Enemy FactionThat's right, Covenant is playable in this corner of the Halo universe. This alliance of alien species has manipulated advanced technology, firepower, and tactical prowess into a powerful force that is engaged in a Genocidal war against human race, having branded humans as heretics. With the ability to play as these tough, alien fighters, you'll have advanced shield technology, the modular Citadel at the heart of Covenant's colonizing power, and, of course, the iconic Scarab attack vehicle at your disposal, adding a whole new dimension to your strategic warfare. The Scarab is a terrifying military vehicle crafted from heavy mining equipment. And with a mining laser that delivers massive damage across battlefields large and small, turrets for taking on air attacks, and the ability to clamber over any terrain, what's not to love about commanding Scarabs instead of fighting against them?Developed Exclusively for Xbox 360Most console RTS games are adapted from existing PC games, which can make their controls bulky or awkward, butHalo Warshas been developed for Xbox 360 from the ground up. This means the controls are sensitive, intuitive, and easy-to-operate in the midst of battle. And the UI is just as intuitive, so whether you're managing a unit of marines or a deadly machine, you can focus on creating a battle strategy instead of worrying about how to overcome a clumsy controller.No matter which faction you choose to play as, you can test your skills against those of other players in online skirmishes that allow up to six players with the New Xbox Experience through Xbox LIVE.","reviewerName":"Christopher Deweese","summary":"RTS for the Masses","reviewText":"Halo Wars, as many of you already know, is a real time strategy (RTS) game set in the Halo universe.  I've played several RTS's on consoles and PC (Command & Conquer, Age of Empires, Battle for Middle Earth 2, Supreme Commander, Dawn of War, Starcraft), so I've seen the good and bad in both formats.  A console RTS is a different breed.  Some purists will say you can't play an RTS on a console, you must play it on a PC with mouse and keyboard.  However, when done right, a console RTS can be just as entertaining as on a PC, but at a cost.Halo Wars has nicely detailed graphics.  You can't zoom in very much to see the details, but suffice it to say when your Warthog blows up, you can see the tires bouncing around.  Tread marks remain after your Scorpion rolls by.  That sort of thing.  Troops aren't all that detailed (unlike Dawn of War 2), but consoles have limits.  However, I must say the cut scenes look fantastic.  Dare I say they are cinema quality.Battle and base building has been simplified when compared with its PC brethren.  You can't build your base just anywhere.  You're given a set of \"pads\" where you can choose which structure to build on.  Each structure usually has one or two upgrades.  Controlling your army is very easy as you select all troops with the left bumper, move the camera where you want them to go, and press X (off they go).  You can garrison some of your troops in specific spots.  It's just not as versatile as a PC RTS.The story of Halo Wars is interesting if you're really into that sort of thing.  The game begins about 20 years before the original Halo FPS.  Most of the characters aren't particularly familiar.  The battles take place on the planet Harvest where the Covenant have overrun the UNSC's forces.  Most of the story involves you taking back various forts and strongholds.  Unfortunately, you only get to play as the UNSC.  There is no Covenant campaign.  You get to mess around as the Covenant in multiplayer, but every other RTS allows you to play multiple campaigns.I think Ensemble Studios did a fine job on Halo Wars.  It adds to the growing Halo universe in terms of story, characters, and game play.  It's nothing earth-shattering though.  As I said, with console RTS's, there are bound to be compromises.  A few details here and there might have made Halo Wars a pillar among console RTS's, but what you get is still good.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2009"}

Who said the days of the 2D platformer are dead?  With LittleBigPlanet, you take control of Sackboy (or Sackgirl), and guide him/her through some bizarre and wonderfully created worlds...jumping and grabbing your way through the end.  Scattered throughout each level are costumes, stickers, objects and other items that allow you to customize just about everything in the game.  And that's about the gist of it.  Pretty simple.  But despite this simplicity, this game delivers incredible challenges and a literally never-ending supply of levels for you to go through.  I can't remember the last time I had a game that I just couldn't wait to go play every day.The \"Story\" mode is your standard platforming game.  You move through the world map and try to get through each level collecting as much as you can.  Finishing one level will unlock the next, and hidden keys will unlock special challenge stages.  Certain areas of each level will require two players in order to get all the secrets, which is an ingenious addition to the common platformer.  Co-op mode is so much fun you'll end up losing several hours to it.Then there's the user-created content.  Oh my Lord.  This is by far the best aspect of this game.  You can create your own levels, and once you've perfected it, you can publish it to the PlayStation Network for others to play, rate and comment on.  This means that you will have an infinite amount of levels to play, making this game a fresh new experience every time you turn it on.  People have gotten so creative, you have to marvel at the designs you'll get to see.Your Sackboy or Sackgirl is completely customizable, and you can change his or her appearance at will, to just about anything.  You can also move his arms, head and hips as well as make him happy, sad, scared or angry.  This gives Sackboy so much personality you just want to pet him!Technically, the game is a masterpiece.  The graphics are some of the best I've seen...everything just seems to jump out of the screen.  The textures are rich and detailed.  The music is good, but at times the songs are brilliantly selected.  The only qualm is that at times the controls aren't as responsive as you would like, but that really doesn't detract from the game.If you own a PS3, buy this game at all costs.  If you don't have one, this is the reason to buy one.  This is THE definitive PS3 game, like Halo is to the Xbox and Mario to Nintendo.  This game is as close as you can get to perfection...great graphics, gameplay, multiplayer and of course, infinite replay value.  Enjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00BMFIXKQ","description":"","reviewerName":"korova","summary":"Notes from a newcomer to Assassin's Creed","reviewText":"Many people have already extensively discussed Assassin's Creed IV's story, features, and gameplay in earlier reviews, so I'm just going to talk about a few things I've noticed as a long-time fan of the Hitman series, Red Dead Redemption, The Saboteur, and other open-world \"sandbox\" games.*I like the large variety of story missions, side quests, and random events. You never get the feeling you're on rails or that exploring an area will be a waste of time.*The controls are easy to learn and quickly become intuitive. Also, the HUD is very good about keeping you informed about which controller buttons are relevant at any particular time.*Graphics are good but not great on the PS3. While the graphics are fine during gameplay because you're focused on doing stuff, the weaknesses are very noticeable during cutscenes. Facial animations are especially unrealistic and wooden.*Assassin's Creed has less focus on the actual mechanics of carrying out a hit than Hitman. In Hitman, you spend a lot of time and effort trying to flawlessly execute (pun intended) the maneuvers required to carry out your objectives. AC, on the other hand, places more emphasis on reconnaissance, getting close to your target, and making a clean getaway. Actually taking out a character is relatively easy compared to Hitman.*AC has a fun climbing and rooftop travel dynamic similar to The Saboteur. Who doesn't like jumping from building to building or deliberately falling several hundred feet and safely landing in a haycart? Whoo hoo!!!!*As a newcomer, I feel AC IV assumes a fair amount of prior knowledge of the series' story lines. A lot of what goes on in the early levels of the game doesn't make much sense until later if you haven't played any of the previous AC games.*If you own a tablet, Ubisoft has a free app that allows your tablet to act as a second screen while you play on your console. It's pretty cool, especially the real-time map that is synced to what you're seeing on your TV.I do have a couple of minor complaints. First, it is impossible to select the surround sound format from within the game. If you need to switch between DTS and Dolby, you have to mess around with your console's main settings. Second, installing the game requires inputting multiple access and promotional codes. No, neither of these things are showstoppers but they do detract from the overall experience...particularly given how unreliable the PSN online service has been recently.Bottom line: a fun, mostly well designed and written game. Four stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2013"}

This one has everything I wished the first Smackdown vs Raw had. You can defend or win a title without having to be in season mode. Although you have to unlock both world titles in season mode  in-order to use them in title mode. Anyway I hope they keep title mode in Smackdown vs Raw 2007. I mean what's the point in going through a season mode if you can't have your champ defend against whoever you want him to defend against. So I love title mode! and they better keep it in all the next Smackdown games in years to come.I also like GM mode where you can control a roster. However it's pretty damn hard to win GM mode and win the general manager trophy though. I don't like how you need to win a very hard challenge mode in-order to unlock the Million Dollar Man, the Hardcore belt and the Million dollar title. I doubt many people who have played the game have unlocked all that. Some of the challenges are way too hard to get through. So in the next game I hope you don't have to go through all that [...] to get a Legend and a belt again. Plus they should finally have 8 man tags so you can have 8 man elimation tags for once.They also have way too many wrestlers who were either fired or are still around and just not being used. I mean when was the last time you saw the Basham Brothers on tv. The game should've had Matt Hardy and M&M; instead of all the fired people. This is the full roster I'd love to see in the next game.

{"product_name":"B000ZKDOV2","reviewerName":"DAG","summary":"Fun but buggy","reviewText":"The game says I'm 45% complete. I own 7/11 cribs and lots of cars... I've messed around extensively with the customization of the character, the cars & cribs. Below is my current impression of the game.Pros:* Customization of the characters, cars, your gang, and the cribs are awesome, even more extensive than SR1.* Cruise control* All sorts of real-time facial expressions.* Peds aren't totally suicidal anymore (they don't readily jump into the street like SR1).* Now there are motorcycles, helicopters & planes... and many more interesting vehicles. One I like is the \"Bear\" which you can steal from the police ~ it's an armored vehicle with a powerful machine gun on the top, and you can customize it =)* Lots of fun things to do. Many of the old activities are still there, plus new ones.* There are lots of interiors. The scope of the city, inside & out is impressive.* Both a pro and a con ~ your character doesn't remove the body when killing someone and taking their car. Sometimes results in weird overlap... other times it just looks funny and realistic.Cons:* Cars disappear and appear right next you... so if you spot a car that you want to steal, don't take the camera view off of it, even if it's right next to you. SR1 also had psycho car pop in/out... and I was REALLY hoping they would fix that for this game, they didn't.* Customization is completely buggy, it often doesn't save or view properly. That goes for both the cars & the character (especially the character).* Physics in SR2, or should I say \"physics\" is terrible. Everything about it is unrealistic. Generally this doesn't affect the fun-factor, but it would be nice to have some realism.* Anybody can pull you out of your car, even if you're going 20mph and you're flooring it.* Car handling is like SR1 ~ unrealistic. For those that complained about GTA4's realistic driving, you'll be pleased with SR2's arcade style handling.* Car damage is as unrealistic as SR1.* I don't remember exactly, but I'm pretty sure the police work exactly the same way - they know where you are no matter what, they can warp instantly, their cars are ridiculously fast, and the stars are removed by simply killing time (or going to Forgive & Forget).* The game freezes (not often though). Save often.... and a whole host of other bugs I won't bother mentioning. Some of them are huge, most small.It's hard to compare this game to GTA4... I'd say it's more fun in the sense that there's more to do... but when it comes to technical issues this game is just sad. The thing that really bothers me is how cars disappear/appear so quickly and easily. That totally drives me nuts, especially when I spot a car that I want but I can't stop it immediately. Taking your eyes off of it means it's probably going to disappear.I would recommend waiting till the price drops. This game is good (and better than SR1) but not $60 USD good.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00005B8G1","description":"The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

At this point you tend to see many of the same names over and over again. Online play is free with the purchase of the game, but once the servers start hosting something else that's the end of it....Single player is short and uninteresting but the game is bug free (after patching) and fun enough. For the 5 or 10 bucks they are asking for it now you might just get your money's worth from the single player portion, despite its lackluster execution.Highs:- Online play is fast paced and fun thanks to plentiful vehicles, including jets and helicopters.- Upgrades, like drones and special weapons, are a cool feature- Large single player maps offer a degree of freedom- Uncomplicated, easy to learn and playLows:- Online participation dwindling as newer better shooters enter the market- The campaign portion is a brief  with practically no challenges of any kind, even on the hardest settings.- Unimpressive physics and effects","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2010"}

I believe Hori and PDP are the only licensed companies that's made screen protectors for the Wii U Gamepad so far. I've always read that Hori makes good ones. Don't usually hear a lot of good things about PDP's screen protectors. Glad I found this one. Easily applied in 4 easy steps. You remove tab 1 to expose a small square stick to the screen while centering it. Peel off tab 2 for the right side half (bottom of the screen protector) and tab 3 for the left side half. Finally peel off tab 4 to expose the top of the screen protector. Only takes a minute. I only had 3 small air bubbles. Using the bundled tiny cardboard, I easily swiped them away in a matter of seconds. Looks perfect. Price is about right because most of Hori's screen protectors for the portable system small screens while Wii U Gamepad's screen is a lot bigger. My only gripe is that since I pushed up the screen protector all the way up to the top of the screen while centering it, the very bottom is exposed by about a thickness of a dime (maybe a little less?). This may not seem like a big deal but I just fear dust or particles may creep in and I'd have to clean it out and reapply. Overall I'm satisfied and very happy with it.

You can switch who you want to work with time to time but make sure to not become enemies with other countries.A really fun part of this game is you get paid for completing objectives like stealing a North Korean missile truck, blowing up North Korean tanks, eliminate the Russian Mafia captains, blowing up pretty much anything (except civilians or AN troops), and more.While not on a mission, you can do side missions to earn extra cash and drive around to find a person from the deck of 52.  You can kill a member of the deck of 52 but you only get half the cash so bringing them alive is a lot better.Every car is \"steal-able\" and certain cars give you a certain disguise like a civilian, a North Korean, and as any of the other countries.You choose from three characters to play as through the whole game.

I had two 20GB versions and recently upgraded to this Elite model.  My first console died (RROD) and was promptly replaced by the retailer (Amazon).  My second console lasted fourteen months before it died (again, the dreaded RROD).  Microsoft repaired it free of charge.  However, it did not have HDMI output, so I sold it after Microsoft returned it to me.  I bought this Elite last month (October, 2008) to have the bigger drive, but more importantly, to be able to use HDMI.The XB360 offers a lot of entertainment.  I do not play first-person shooters, but I do enjoy Japanese-made games like Eternal Sonata and Soul Calibur IV.  I also purchase and download various digital content from the Marketplace.  Being a member of Netflix, I look forward to being able to stream video content directly to my XBox.  The latter feature will become available next week to users who have a Gold membership with XBox Live.  You have to purchase a Gold membership in order to be able to use this feature.  For me, this will be worth it.  I love movies and being able to stream the video to my console will be a blessing.  Just bear in mind that you need a FAST internet connection for this service to work for you.Why did I make the choice to pay extra for this bundle?  Because of the 120GB HD and the included HDMI cable.  The Pro and the Arcade packages do not include an HDMI cable.  I recommend this package to you if you purchase a lot of digital content from the Marketplace.  The extra hard drive space is a blessing.  The included HDMI cable also comes in handy if you have an HDTV.  Now, having said that, most people will probably be happy with the Pro bundle.  The Pro bundle is fine if all you want to do is save games and download movies (the movies \"expire\", so you will have no reason to keep it on your hard drive).  I don't really recommend the Arcade though, since it does not come with a hard drive.  In my view, you need that hard drive to fully enjoy what this console has to offer.The newest XBox consoles are being made with a new motherboard and chipset, called the Jasper.  Supposedly, this new design is less likely to suffer from the dreaded RROD (Red Ring of Death), which is basically the common term for hardware failure.  The Jaspers are designed to operate at a lower temperature and therefore, will have less tendency to overheat.  The Jaspers are also designed to be more energy efficient, using less power than the previous models.  And, I have read, that they are also quieter.  Perhaps the disc drive has been improved, and also because cooler operation means that the fans do not have to spin as fast.Unfortunately for me, my console came with the older Falcon chipset.  My console was manufactured back in February 2008!  Basically, my console was already 8-months old when it came to me, brand new!  My advice to you is to wait until the supply of the Falcon consoles have dried up before you purchase an XBox.  As you know by now, the XBox 360 is notorious for having one of the highest failure rates in a modern consumer electronics product.  If you were to purchase an XBox today, the chances are that you will get one with a Falcon chip, not the newer Jasper.  Jasper production supposedly started two months ago.  But as you know, most retailers will try to move out old inventory first (FIFO, in accounting terms for those of us who have taken an accounting class in college!).  If you want to be reasonably assured of a reliable console, my suggestion is to wait until Spring.  Also, you might increase your chances of getting a Jasper if you buy the other bundles (Pro and Arcade), as they seem to be selling faster than the Elite.  The faster an SKU is selling, the higher the likelihood that all of the Falcon units have been sold off.XBox 360 or PS3?  I recommend getting both.  If you are serious about playing video games, you really should have both.  I'm planning to get a Wii as soon as they become available here at Amazon.What if you could only have one, which should you get?The XBox, if you subscribe to Netflix, you don't mind paying for a Gold membership at XBox Live, and you have a fast internet connection.  Also, if you like first-person shooters.  The XBox has a bigger library of games at the moment, having had a one year head start on the PS3.The PS3, if you have an HDTV and would like to experience Blu-Ray.  By the way, Netflix do rent out DVDs in the Blu-Ray format if you like getting your movies through the mail.  The PS3, admittedly, is a more reliable console and not likely to suffer from hardware failure.  So if you do not have the patience to deal with tech support people, you might want to go with this route.I cannot comment on the Wii since I have no experience with it.  But it is selling like hot cakes.  Nintendo must be doing something right!In any case, I recommend the XBox 360 Elite to anyone who needs the hard drive space and HDMI connectivity.  Also, the all-black design helps the console blend in better with your typical audio/video set up, in terms of aesthetics.Update: 5/20/2011Yes, you guessed it!  The XBox died.  This time, instead of the RROD, it was an E74 error.  I sent it off to Microsoft this past Tuesday.  It is a shoddy product.  About what you would expect from Microsoft.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2008"}

Basically though, this is the last PS3 that is backwards compatible with PS2 games.  For now, anyway.  This bundle has just about all of the bells and whistles of the launch consoles.  It has not only backwards compatibility, but also the additional memory card slots and extra USB ports.The PS3 system is a terrific system!  The Blu-Ray player adds to the price of the unit but also makes the unit much more than a game console.  This unit would make a fine centerpiece to your home audio/video system.  You can download movies from the Playstation network or you can buy/rent Blu-Ray.  Either way you go, download or disk, this player will do a fine job of playing it for you.I am a member of Netflix.  I can rent my Blu-Ray movies from them, for a flat monthly fee.  This PS3 really comes in handy.  And the movies look stunning on my HDTV.  I would like to add that I also own the XBox 360 Elite console.  Both of these consoles together allow me to take advantage of all of the ways movie content can be legally distributed today.  Having said that, please keep in mind that you will need a very FAST internet connection to download movies.  For me, I still prefer having the actual, physical disk as opposed to digital downloads.I am very selective about the next-gen games that I buy.  They are much too expensive to buy on a whim.  My favorite games are RPGs and Fighting games.  Most of the games that I like are multi-platform, meaning that I can get them for either the PS3 or the XBox360.  It matters very little to me.  Both consoles give terrific gameplay and stunning graphics.  If there is a difference in graphics, your humble reviewer has not yet seen it.Unless you've been vacationing in Siberia for the last thirteen years, you are already aware of the Playstation brand and what it stands for.  One of the main cornerstones of the brand is that your games will retain their value.  That they will always be playable and never become obsolete.  This is an important concept to those collectors who have amassed a huge library of games for the Playstation and the Playstation 2.  There are actually games for the Playstation that have gone up in value.  For example, last year, I sold an original black-label Final Fantasy 7 for over $100!  I have no doubt that some PS2 games will appreciate in value over the years.  But a lot of that stems from the fact that Sony made a promise that those old games would never become obsolete.  That the current generation system will always be backwards compatible.  I bought into that promise and am a firm believer in backwards compatibility.  That is why I bought the last PS3 that is backwards compatible with the PS2.Should you pay an extra $100 for backwards compatibility?  If you are new to video games, probably not.  If you do not have a lot of PS2 games, probably not.  Most people will probably not care since they have a casual interest in games.  And, PS2 games will most likely be made available for downloads through the Playstation network.  In that case, you will be able to download them and play them on any PS3, whether the system is backwards compatible or not.  In this case, backwards compatibility, for the most part, means you can play the game through the PS2-format DVD.  But with downloads and software emulation, this type of backwards compatibility might not be needed in the near future.  But for now, if you want to play PS2 games on your PS3, you need this console.The PS3 operates flawlessly.  The slot-loading disk mechanism operates silently and smoothly.  The cooling fans are fairly quiet.  And the controller has that familiar Playstation feel.  Overall, I gave the console a five-star rating.  My PS2 is still good after almost eight years.  I hope this PS3 will serve me just as long.This bundle came with a copy of Metal Gear Solid 4.  I am not normally a fan of that franchise, but it does show off the graphics capability of the PS3.  The package does not include an HDMI cable.  Which means that to get full 1080P, you will need to upgrade and purchase an HDMI or a component cable.  But please keep in mind that you do need a good HDTV in order to notice the difference.  In any case, an HDMI cable can be had very cheaply.I recommend this particular PS3 package for those people to whom backwards compatibility is important.  If that is not important to you, then save $100 and buy one of the other packages.  The grey Kojima bundle looks terrific, if aesthetics is more important to you.  Any PS3 can make this holiday season more enjoyable for you and your family.  A new PS3 can certainly open new entertainment possibilities for you and your family.  It's the most versatile Blu-Ray player available!PS3 or XBox 360?My advice is to get both.  Both have great games coming out in 2009! However, for reasons that I will explain later, my advice is to get the PS3 now, and wait until Spring to get the XBox 360.What if you can only have one?Get the PS3 if you want to watch Blu-Ray and you have an HDTV.  The PS3, so far, has proven itself to be the more reliable hardware of the two.  And you also get a rudimentary internet browser as part of the console's function.  The PS3 is also cheaper to upgrade.  You can purchase a larger hard drive very cheaply. Movies are available for download from the Playstation store.  At this time, this PS3 version is hard to find.  There is a limited supply of this version left.  Most of the current stock will be the new version, which again does not play PS2 games.  However, I suspect that software emulation will eventually allow ALL models of the PS3 to be backwards compatible.Get the XBox 360 if you like the Gears of War franchise.  You can also stream movies directly to the console from Netflix if you have a very FAST internet connection and a Gold membership ($50 per year) with XBox live.  You also need a membership from Netflix.  The XBox 360 is notorious for being unreliable and prone to breaking down.  The popular term for this is RROD (basically hardware failure).  The latest version of the XBox went into production back in August.  This new design, called the Jasper, is much more reliable than the old design.  The Jasper is the one you should get.  Trouble is, they look the same.  And there are plenty of the older designs still available on retailer's shelves.  If you wait until Spring to buy, you increase your chances of getting a Jasper.  You see, retailers try to sell old inventory first (FIFO), First In, First Out.Update (12/31/2009)Most of the games that I play are available on both systems.  A good example is Soul Calibur 4.  Soul Calibur's graphics will be of comparable quality on either console.  However, I have discovered that games that are exclusive to the PS3 (games that were designed for PS3 from the start, like Uncharted) do have an advantage.  They have the best graphics out of any video games that are available today.  And this is where the superiority of the PS3 hardware really shines.  The Sony exclusives really do take advantage of the PS3's awesome hardware.  You will probably not find any XB360 exclusive that can compare in terms of graphics.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2008"}

I would just like to add to why you should buy this game...In a world of sequels, games based from movies, games that have been rehashed and rehased comes some wonderful gems that get lost.  Whether it's because they come out at bad times or because people would rather play Halo 2000 or similar game, actually creative and emotionally powerful games slip through the cracks.  This is one such game.I have been trying to get people to play this game for purely selfish reasons.  I've seen too many games that actually warrant sequels get halted because no one buys them.  This game has everything.  It has characters you care about, a story that is interesting and socially relevent, action that is constantly changing so that you are doing many different things, actually humorous scenes and dialogue, and graphics that are stunning in both their fluidity and art direction.  I remember loading this game, watching a beautiful cut scene that bled directly to the action and being surprised that I was actually playing.  I just assumed it was a cutscene, it was so fluid.I got this game at Christmas time a while back with a bunch of other games.  When I started playing this one, I couldn't put it down.  Normally, I'll switch between games if I have more than one.  Not so with this game, I had to keep playing, had to figure out what would happen next.It fills you with so much wonder and joy that you remember why it is you play games.

Now I have some fresh new junk to get addicted to.Why would I need Socom if I already have an online shooter that I'm addicted to? Because Socom is truly different. This is a team tactical shooter and CoD4 is run out into the map and kill as many people as you can shooter.The key to success (for me anyway) in Socom is \"stick together\".You play as either a Commando or a Mercenary. Once in a lobby you can switch teams and during intermissions the game will regularly switch your whole team back and forth from Mercenary to a Commando. You can create about 5 Mercenary profiles and 5 Commando profiles; and you can change the weapon loadouts in game.There are assault rifles, submachine guns, light machine guns, shotties, sniper rifles, and one extra rifle from a group of 5 that are available depending on whether you're in a clan and what clan you're in (Spain, France, Germany, UK or US).All of the rifles and the following gear and stuff are available to everyone; I don't think there's any unlocking or leveling up needed. Your rewards for quality play instead are status, medals & stars.The gear is kind of cool, but I'm pretty sure that the best loadout is the simple one: M67 frag grenades. The missile launchers are effective, but cumbersome. The claymores have to be detonated versus the CoD4 kind that blew up if an enemy walked near it. So for now, I'm sticking to the grenades.One thing to note is that each weapon needs to be equipped. In other words, there's not a dedicated button on the controller to throw a grenade or switch to a launcher. You need to bring your selected secondary weapons up on a display by pressing O. Once a secondary weapon is selected you can switch back and forth between it and a primary weapon by pressing L1 (no, L1 is not your sight button; sight is up on the D pad...and to get off your sight you must press down on the D pad). (You can custom configure the wireless controller to your own liking if you don't like the default or other presets.)The attachments for your weapons are plentiful: scopes, regular and laser sites, silencers, bipod and grenade launchers. Each attachment is not available on every weapon. And be careful, a laser sight will give away your position in night games.Oh yeah, night games...you'll need your nightvision goggles for those. Navigating the maps takes a little getting used to, but as I said earlier, you should be pretty much sticking together with your team...follow them and take a position. That's right...there's some camping to be done here...but be smart: stay in one place too long and you'll be dead faster than you can say WTF!And speaking of dead, I believe that you only get rewards by playing \"ranked\" matches. Friendly fire is on and there is no respawning. There are 4 v 4 matches, 8 v 8 and higher; so when you play Socom, in some matches you'll be atop the leaderboard with 2 kills. I personally have enjoyed the two smaller group matches, but that's a matter of preference.So communicate with your team! Someone on your team is probably familiar with the map. Ask where to go. There's no stupid or noob questions here; the players that I've met got more mad when their team members didn't communicate and use their mics than they did when someone says \"what should we do?\"Speaking of the mic, I bought theStand Aloneedition of Socom, because I have thePlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headsetand it works great. But if you want to take advantage of all of the perks (like on screen volume and stuff) that were in the PS3 2.5 firmware update, then you should probably go with this edition that includes the new official PS3 Headset.This game rocks. Some of the maps according to some of the folks that I've played with are carry-overs from past Socom games. That gives Socom vets a bit of an early advantage. But it won't be long before I'm navigating these maps on point instead of following my team.Buy Socom if you play online.Side note on initial game installation: If your PS3 is set to auto-start discs you might need to disable that the first time you plug in the disc. After you put the game in, you'll see two icons on the XMB for Socom; one installs the game, the other starts it. Install the game first. For some reason even after you run the installer, the game installer icon doesn't disappear; just be sure to start that game with start icon going forward. After the installation I got an error message that said my \"saved data\" was corrupted....so I deleted the Socom saved data from the XMB (NOT the \"game\" data...the \"saved\" data) and the error message disappeared.Another side note that made take away a star in the overall rating: As of this writing, there are major server issues. Load delays. Freezes. Choppy action and more. Slant 6 Games NEEDS to fix these. If you release a game that is online only, you should release it when you are ready to set the bar for online gaming...not be a work in progress.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2008"}

Why? I don't know. Star Ocean: TtEoT is the one of the biggest RPG disappointments I've played for the PS2.I stumbled upon Star Ocean and fondly remembered the Star Ocean for the SNES, a remarkable adventure, so I picked it up. At the beginning, I was amazed with the game's setting. It takes place in the distant future between federations of planets and insane technology, which you would think would lead to a good story and environments. Unfortunately, I spent 95% of the game in dungeons that seemed to come straight out of Diablo.Back to the beginning, I noticed one thing immediately: the characters are flat as cardboard. They are complete stereotypes of RPG's, and react the same exact way as their stereotype dictates. Don't expect any character development, you're looking at the wrong game. The game's story and dialogue is altogether amazingly cliche and lame, with the typical selfless teen hero and his girlfriend who hangs with him everywhere who need to save the world from a terrible force. Awfully familiar, isn't it? If you've ever played an RPG, you've played this game.What people consider the saving grace of Star Ocean is the battle system. In a nutshell, it's real time and you can switch between your characters as you attack the enemy. Unfortunately, you can't even see all the enemies on the map from one viewpoint, and the other is too far with the camera to properly battle. To add to the problem, the Comp controlled characters are iddiots and require almost nonstop attention to keep them from dying, because dying is permanent until you can get to a heal point.What really kills the game besides the story, the characters, the somewhat glazed graphics, the stupid AI, and the somewhat unpolished feel is the save system. There are not nearly enough save points. Probably about 2 for the entire game. The dungeons in this game are huge and unmapped, as in YOU explore them and YOU map them out. The dungeouns are huge and littered with enemies. Because of the difficult battles, huge dungeons, lack of save and healing points and unmapped dungeons, I had to run back to town often to save my characters from certain death and to get healing products. If they had just approached this like they did FFX, where the map is clear and linear right in front of you, and there are plenty of save points which also act as healing points, this game wouldn't have been nearly as frusturating, but after dying from the umpteenth time due to no save points, I completely lost interest.What could have and should have been a great game falls completely flat. Unchanging stereotypical characters, a terrible story, frusturatingly large dungeons and lack of saving/healing points, terrible AI and a general lack of polish relegate Star Ocean to a disgrace, a game not fit to carry its series' name similar to Final Fantasy 8 or Sword of Mana. I guess I'll have to wait Till the End of Time to play a good RPG.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2005"}

I really like how the plot developes and the characters interact.  At first, I found the voice acting to be a bit annoying, but got used to it rather quickly.  The humor is also pretty good, as well.  The maps are very large and leave for a lot of exploration.  Usually the rewards are special treasures (not includeing the \"map completion prizes.)  You'll be playing this game for a while, which is good!  It's fun and has great plot, character interactions and a nice battle system!For years I've been thinking that the game designers who make RPG's should change up the way they do combat.  Random encounters with a turn-based has really been getting old.  Fortunately this game has changed that!  If you're quick, you can usually avoid most encounters!  And the battles are realtime, so there's a bit more activity to partake in.  Very nicely done!There are a lot of characters to choose from.  Each one has his or her own weakenesses and strengths.  The main chracter, over all, is pretty balanced.  The designers have put a bit of thought into how you can increase your characters abilities and stats, which leaves some room for customization.  I'm sure there's an optimal way to play, but the game really doesn't force you to do it!In summary, this game is a blast, and should be part of any RPG fans collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2006"}

The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife.

Some people have complained the story is lacking and gameplay is repetitive and i suppose i agree with them.  But i didn't buy Far Cry 2 because i thought the story was going to move me and i came into it knowing that it was going to be me, a gun, a grenade, and an unending supply of bad guys in a jungle setting with vehicles.  That being said, this game is entertaining.  I really like the fire propagation even if it isn't entirely accurate, thats some fast spreading fire geez.  The fire adds a \"smoke em out\" strategy that i haven't seen in a game before.  Its a blast to pick a spot and start firing your flare gun into an enemy camp and watch them run in a panic as you mow them down with a silenced mp5.  I have to agree with the whole respawning thing, it is a bit ridiculous.  I also don't care for the malaria thing but it doesn't happen that often.

You basically run around and interact with people and do stupid little errands. In the regular \"action\" zones, it's somewhat reminiscent of later-gen Sonic games but the problem here is the camera never helps you. I find myself constantly having to re-adjust my view after even just taking a few steps.Also, there's little to no consistency or progression with difficulty. Meaning, some of the earlier missions will be really easy and some will take many retries. The same applies to all the later missions.Sonic does go fast in parts but nowhere near the blazing speed we're used to seeing as Sonic fans. Also, what's with the alternate character storylines? Do you really want to play through Shadow and Silver's missions after completing the Sonic storyline? Just so you know, they're even more boring and annoying than Sonic's.It's hard to believe Sega actually made this game. After playing through the first half, I remember checking my box to see if it was put out by another company. They have really lost their touch, at least with Sonic.

Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A fun Mario experience unfortunately hampered by some questionable aspects","reviewText":"Before you down-vote this review in a knee-jerk reaction to my rating, please lower your pitchforks for a moment and hear me out. Know that it hurts me to write this review. Whenever people bash Nintendo for releasing too many Mario games, I'm always one of the first to defend them and point out how there's more creativity and effort in a single Mario game than almost any other \"AAA\" title released in any given year. I love Mario games, and some of my fondest gaming memories are of playing theclassic Super Mario Bros. gamesat my grandma's house on her old NES. When it comes to New Super Mario Bros 2., there is a lot to love, truly, but sadly there are a few glaring issues that kind of bring the rest of the package down to me, especially when compared to other games in the series, even recent ones. To be fair to the game and to you, the reader, I'll try to be as detailed and informative as I can. I do not hate this game emotionally, but it is lacking in comparison to the other games in the \"New Super Mario Bros.\" series, without a doubt.Let's talk about positives first though, shall we?- It's a Mario game with the tried-and-true classical 2-D Mario gameplay all faithfully intact. Mario controls splendidly and the game does a wonderful job capturing that nostalgic NES Mario feeling (Once you beat the game, you can play as Luigi as well by holding the L and R buttons at the same time while loading your game. He controls no differently than Mario, however). What more needs to be said? All Mario bros. games are known for delivering the undeniable, jubilant joys of running and jumping, and New Super Mario Bros. 2 has nailed that core tenant wonderfully. Classic Mario power-ups like the fire flower and Super Star make a return of course, but I was most excited by the return of the Raccoon Leaf fromSuper Mario Bros. 3. What a nostalgic delight it was for me to play as Raccoon Mario again, flying through the sky, complete with Fox-ears and fluttering tail. This game is FUN to play, plain and simple, and what more can you ask for with a Mario Bros. game?- In a new twist on the traditional Mario formula, Nintendo decided to throw a big curveball regarding the way you approach the core mechanics. See, the game places a big emphasis on collecting coins and the way they designed the game makes coin hoarding not only a focus, but an addicting joy. New power-ups are introduced that are incredibly fun to use, such as a gold-flower that turns Mario into the Mushroom Kingdom's own version of Midus, where every shimmering gold fireball hurled turns all blocks and enemies into coins you can grab. Golden koopa shells spew coins in in its wake as it spins along the level. Green pipes shower the world in gold coins. It's definitely a unique appraoch to a Mario game, but it does have its drawbacks as well (more on that later). Overall, though, I really enjoyed the unique focus on coin collecting in this game. It was an old-school Mario gameplay element presented in a new and exciting light. That's great, and one of the more creative ideas the game has.- The visuals are quite beautiful and are actually as detailed and colorful as NSMBW, which looks awesome on the3DS(XL)'sscreens. Little details like mini-Mario blinking his little eyes just scream  attention to detail. As is expected from a Mario game, the visuals are vibrantly colorful, expressive, and super imaginative. That's all I ever expect or want from a Mario game. World themes are a little derivative, but have enough variety to keep the game from getting too stale, which is good. The 3-D effect, while being nonessential, is really cool and gives a genuine feeling of depth to the Mushroom Kingdom. It is worth noting that the higher up you have the 3-D slider, the more the background image becomes blurred on purpose to give a sense of depth. While it succeeds in that endeavor, it really eliminates details in the visuals. Personally, I played the game with the 3-D slider halfway up.If this all sounds great to you, it should. Mario games almost never fail to deliver the goods, and NSMB2 definitely does where it counts in these areas. However, there are some glaring issues with the game that simply restrict me from scoring the game higher. Here are some of the bigger ones:- The game is way too short. It took me 4 hours to beat the game... 4 hours to beat the game... 4 hours to beat... FOUR HOURS... Wow. Even for a Mario game, that's far too short.New Super Mario Bros. U(the best in the NSMB series, in my opinion), will take a player roughly nine or so hours just to get to the end. Four hours for this just seems inexcusable when compared to the much more substantial game length of literally every other NSMB game, especially at full price. What happened? If you go back and try to get many of the hidden star coins hidden in each level, you can probably pad out the length more, but seriously... the content volume in this game just feels paltry. When compared to other portable Mario games likeSuper Mario 3D Land, or the other entries in the NSMB series, NSMB2 definitely comes across as lacking in content and effort during development, sadly. Heck, evenDonkey Kong for the original Gameboy (one of the best games on the system in my opinion)has more variety and content than this. What gives?- As disappointing as the paltry length is, Nintendo's approach to fixing this issue by adding more content is even worse. If you want more content for this game, you have to pay even MORE money for dlc packs that add some new coin rush levels, the levels that most people don't care about anyway. What on earth are you thinking Nintendo?! Thankfully, they learned how to do DLC right after this game, as evidenced by what they did withFire Emblem: AwakeningandAnimal Crossing: New Leaf, but it's too late for NSMB2, sadly. The DLC in this game is, to be frank, unsubstantial, generic, and way over-priced for what it is. Much of it feels like it should be in the game you already payed full-price for and comes across as a rip-off. Bummer...- As fun as the focus on collecting coins is in this game, there's no real reward for doing so. You're constantly encouraged to try and collect one million coins cumulatively over time, with the promise of a great reward for doing so. What's the reward, you may ask? It's so lame, it's not even worth writing. What a disappointing carrot on a stick, and nothing more than a terrible way to pad out the game beyond its anemic length. Like I said while discussing the egregious DLC policy, there is a \"Coin Rush\" mode where smaller obstacle course are generated with the purpose of collecting as many coins as possible in a short amount of time. While this can add more incentive to play the game, it really feels like a tacked on feature more than anything. Being able to compete with other players via streetpass seems cool, and can add a lot of coins to your profile if you can beat their times in certain coin rush levels, but again, why bother? Like I said, there's no real reward for collecting coins, not even bragging rights really. Too bad.- There is a co-op mode in the game, which is really awesome in concept. What better idea could there be than a portable Mario game you can play wirelessly with a friend, using downloadable play so that you only need one cartridge between the two of you to play the game? Oh wait, they made it so you both have to have a copy to play co-op to force more people to buy the game? Yep, thanks for that Nintendo. You gave other games likeStar Fox 64 3Dand evenMario Party Island Tourdownload play, but not this game? What gives?! There are a few problems with co-op too. Both players are forced to have Player One's camera angle, so P2 had better be a good enough co-op gamer to stick around P1. How cool would it have been for each player to get their own view of the game being played together, so that they could explore and play the level at their own leisure. It just feels like a wasted opportunity for a 2-D Mario game where each player has their own screen, and because the 3DS screen is so small, it's incredibly frustrating to stick together so close.- Ultimately, my biggest problem with this game can be summed up by the one question I kept thinking to myself while playing this game: Where's the cream filling? For those confused by that, cream filling is basically code/lingo in the video game industry for \"effort\" (lol). In so many ways, this felt like more like an expensive expansion pack to New Super Mario Bros. Wii than a truly unique, new entry in the NSMB series, and it shows. All world themes are recycled from the Wii installment and there really aren't any genuinely creative levels in this game in terms of lay-out or design from a gameplay perspective, aside from a handful that make good use of the Midus Mushroom. The graphics, as pleasing as they are on a handheld, feel copied and pasted from NSMBWii. Much of the music is blatantly copied from that game too. There really aren't any new songs in this game, as most, if not all, are either copied or remixed from NSMBW. What a disappointment. As much as I love the Mario series, whether it's of the 2-D or 3-D persuasion, this one really felt phoned-in compared to Mario's history, and that's my biggest problem with the game. It pains me to say this, but this game feels quite lazy.The pros of this game are undeniably solid, but the cons really work to weaken the strong Mario foundation of the rest of the game, and it comes across as the weakest entry in the NSMB series, and even one of the weakest Mario efforts in years. Make no mistake, you will enjoy the time you spend playing this game. Mario games are like pizza; even when one isn't very good (which is super rare, I emphasize), it's still pretty good (lol), and that applies to this game. However, given the negatives I've discussed in this review, I just can't bring myself to give it any rating higher than 3-stars (which means \"It's OK\" by Amazon's standards). If you're a gamer looking for a good portable Mario game, or you're shopping for one to give to a friend/family member, then I'd recommend Super Mario 3D Land over NSMB2 any day of the week. Ultimately, it is the much better Mario game on the 3DS as of this review. In context of the NSM series, New Super Mario Bros. U is, without a doubt, a better game than this by leaps and bounds in every way. If you have a Wii-U, I'd recommend that game over this in terms of new 2-D Mario games. Thanks for taking the time to read the review. I hope you found to be helpful and enjoyable. If now, go ahead and take out your pitchforks and ready that \"unhelpful voting finger now. Either way, have a good day. Toodles. :)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2012"}

The buttons for channel, volume etc. are located on top of the tv, directly behind where the camera would be placed and I thought the stand would be sitting on top of the buttons.I tried every other option to mount the camera to the top of the tv, even searching the internet for ideas. I've tried blue-tack, industrial strength double sided tape for mounting, and even commercial grade velcro.  Every time the heat from the top of the tv would loosen the adhesive, or the weight of the cord would start to pull the camera off center and lift it up. I also tried the \"trick\" to let the camera hang from the weight of the cord, but I couldn't get it to stay aimed straight and not obstruct the top of the tv.  It's probably a bad idea to have the weight pull down on the wire's connection point into the camera anyway (a bad move for any electronic device).I finally ended up purchasing this clip and mounting my Wii light bar on top of the tv with the double sided tape.  This clip hangs over the Wii bar without obstructing either Infrared port and the back of the clip extends past the Bravia's buttons and creates a VERY secure platform for the Camera. I am very impressed and 100% satisfied. The clip has multiple angles, and clicks securely into each one.  The clip also has rubber padding which protects the top of my tv.  The way it clamps onto the camera also allows you to move the lens in any direction without actually moving the position.  I am sure that there are some very thin tvs for which this will not work, but if you check the measurements of the clip and visualize it on top of your tv I bet you can determine whether or not it will work for you.If you want to mount your eye camera on top of your Wii bar this IS the product for you to buy.Oh...and I contacted Sony and Nintendo who both stated that there would be no interference between the products.

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Talo","summary":"Here comes Jack!","reviewText":"While I liked the idea of seeing all the different Disney characters I realized something while playing this game.

{"product_name":"B0006I5I58","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Great Game","reviewText":"**UPDATE** Sad news from Lorne Lanning and Oddworld Inhabitants, the creators of this spectacular series.  Oddworld Inhabitants is closing its doors.  After creating 4 games in what was supposed to be a huge series and with 2 games already in development for next gen systems, they are closing up.  Chances are this will be the last game featuring the loveable creatures of Oddworld.  But fear not, Lanning believes he might be able to crack into the TV or movie business in order to have his property protected.  Keep an eye on them.  They are so talented, their studio might be the next Pixar.On to the review:I'm very disappointed in the mistreatment this game has been getting from the professional online reviewers like IGN, Gamespot and Gamespy.  When I was trying to figure out if this game was worth purchasing or not, I had to literally search the entire page at the Xbox branch of IGN just to find the review.  Normally, reviews get top billing; not the case with this beautifully unique game.A lot has been said about the \"gimmick\" of having live ammo.  Given the series of Oddworld (Abe's Oddysee and Exodus, Munch's Oddysee), how someone could label the live ammo as a gimmick is beyond me.  Oddworld is a world very different from our own.  Stranger's Wrath just heightened this oddity by giving you creatures to fire instead of finding ammo for your tripple-barrelled, shoots rockets and has a flame-thrower attached, shotgun.  And it fits in the universe perfectly.  Now, if this was a Halo game (for example), yes having live ammo would be a gimmick.  But, it fits in perfectly with the Oddworld mythos and provides a truly engaging experience.Another thing that I feared after reading the sorely mistaken (IMO) professional reviews was that it was virtually impossible to capture the bosses alive.  Being a bounty hunter, it is your mission to capture wanted villains either dead or alive.  By capturing them alive you get two or more times the money than capturing them dead.Now, if you were to read a lot of reviews from IGN etc, it would seem that you couldn't capture any of the bosses alive.  While I have been playing games all of my life and am better than the average gamer in some respects, I would definitely not consider myself a master of the FPS genre.  By any stretch.  And yet I was able to capture every single boss alive.  Now, there were a couple that made me very frustrated and it took me more than a handful of tries to do it, I was able to.  The game definitely makes you work to get that full bounty but it's not impossible.As far as the story goes, the developers once again created a uniquely different story involving Stranger and his past.  I will not reveal any story spoilers, but not is all what it seems and there will come a point where the way you look at the game changes in an exciting way.  And from that point on, the game ramps up the excitement to a wonderful climax.Graphically, the game is beautiful.  It makes me remember why I bought the Xbox.  Not only are the lush environments beautifully rendered, but the framerate moves swiftly.  Seeing Strange bound at a cheetah speed through these beautiful environments is striking.  There is some pop-up, especially in Mango (sp?) Valley where bushes will pop up in the distance.  But considering the speed and the graphics the game is pushing, it doesn't really bother me.As far as controls go, this game is well designed.  Switching between first person and third person is as easy as tapping the R3 button.  This change works really well, giving you the best of both worlds, the percision of first person shooting, and the fluidity and speed of moving in third person.  I have a couple complaints though.  Moving up and down rope is a pain.  The animation is kinda clunky and I don't see why you can't slide down rope, instead of hand over hand moving down it.  Hey, if the Prince can slide down rope, why can't Stranger?  But this is a minor quibble.As far as the sound goes, again Oddworld Inhabitants (the developers) did an excellent job.  Stranger's voice is a little silly to me, he talks in a slow drawl that seems to be a cross between Clint Eastwood and Forrest Gump.  But the other voices are remarkable, especially considering that most (if not all) are done in house with the Lead voicing most characters in all of the Oddworld games.My only real complaint is that the game isn't long enough.  It's longer than Halo 2 (which is a bonus), and I don't know exactly how many hours I clocked in on it, but it felt like it was over too fast.  I guess what disappointed me was that I was having so much fun exploring Oddworld again that no matter how long or short it was I would be sad to leave it.  The world is just so interesting.The level design is also very linear.  In today's world of GTA openness, people might have a problem with that, which is why I bring it up.  The levels have a set path.  That's not to say the gameplay is linear.  There are MANY different ways to tackle every situation.  The joy of having live ammo is that you are presented with a myriad of ways to take down the opposition, creating gameplay that allows you to experiment.  But if you're looking for a Deus Ex type of environment where there are multiple paths to get to the boss, you won't find it here.What the game does best is refresh video games.  From the opening CG cinema (which is Pixar quality) to all of the loveably strange and bizarre characters, this game oozes originality and charm.  You can tell the developers truly care about the artform of video games.  They love what they do and the game was a refreshing experience.To sum it up, I can't say enough about this game.  It is unique.  It is beautiful.  And it is fun.  Even after the 5th time trying to take down a boss alive, I didn't throw down the controller in anger.  It kept me wanting to play until I could take him down.  If you are tired of the same old save Earth from \"insert name of alien race here\", or similar I would definitely recommend this game.  It is hard, but it is easily one of the most enjoyable games I have played in ages.  And the jolt of energy the games gives you about half way through the game is enough for me to recommend buying this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2005"}

The greatest 3-D weapons-based fighter will provide non-stop action, excitement and surprises as you go one-on-one against your favorite challengers.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"When The Soul Burned the Brightest","reviewText":"In 1998, Namco released a fighting game into the Arcade that more or less redefined the genre.  Soul Calibur.  The game introduced the 8-Way Run system and furthered weapon based combat like no other game had before.  The emphasis became the weapons, and the game even worked hard to show characters behaving uniquely with those weapons.  They also put an emphasis on making sure players understood that weapons and range actually made a difference in the playstyle of the characters.  When the game came to the Dreamcast in 1999, it was released to universal praise.  Not only that, but it was actually better than the original Arcade version.  It offered up various art galleries and a couple of new gameplay modes.  The game pretty much breathed perfection.  There are still few games like it... except, of course, for other Soul Calibur games.So how do you follow up one of the most celebrated video game successes in history?  Very carefully.  Soul Calibur II came to the Arcade in 2002 and to home consoles in 2003.  Most of what Soul Calibur II did doesn't do much to change what the first game established.  We were introduced to more characters and slightly enhanced moves, but the core concept remained the same.  Upon it's release even the most ardent of critics said that Soul Calibur II only had one flaw... that it was too much like the original Soul Calibur.  I like to disagree.  To this day, Soul Calibur II remains the best in the series.  A refinement of the first?  Certainly so.  But there's nothing wrong with that.  It is more or less a polish on the perfection the first game established.Story has not been incredibly strong in Soul Calibur... but the characters and the relationships they have with other characters are.  In order to get the best out of the narrative Soul Calibur opts to weave, you'll need to be willing to read the bios of the characters and weave them together to form the narrative.  If you decide to do this, then Soul Calibur's story is actually rewarding.  Choose not to and it's just another fighting game where the motivations and relationships between characters are shrouded in mystery.  Their stories also come alive a little bit more through the Arcade mode.  Every character goes through eight stages where you fight various warriors.  The seventh battle is always a \"destined battle\" and the final one is always against Inferno.The conventions of gameplay haven't changed much at all.  As with the first you can engage in 8 way run.  This puts a bit of strategy to the test where you can side step certain attacks and perform a variety of moves otherwise.  There are a lot of moves you can pull off in Soul Calibur 2, but this doesn't mean you can't pull off combos or juggles or do some insanely flashy moves.  You can do all that.  There's a layer of strategy involved.  While button mashing will certainly help some Soul Calibur players, it has never been a good idea to play in this manner against a serious fighter who knows his or her character.  The only downside to the battling is that there are no consequences for holding up your guard.  There's no chipped damage and no guard breaks.  Againt the CPU in particular this might prove to make the Arcade a little too easy at times.  On the other hand, there are guard impacts here, which allow you to push back an opponents advance and make them stagger.  As with other Soul Calibur titles, the game is just more fun when you're playing with friends.  Especially because Soul Calibur II won't let you do a versus without a second controller plugged in.That shouldn't suggest that Soul Calibur II lacks a single player experience.  It doesn't.  It's breathing with tons of game modes to keep you going.  There is the typical Arcade mode, but there are also team battles and time attack modes to keep you going.  And as you compete in some of these modes you'll unlock new characters, new galleries, biographies of the characters and a bit of backstory on their respective levels and what they mean... it's fun stuff.  But the most amusing of all these modes is the weapon master mode.  By going here you'll have to tackle various missions.  They start off simple enough--a tutorial mainly.  On how to attack, guard and impact.  But once it really gets going you'll get to missions where the idea is to take down your opponent fast... or to land a certain number of hits.  But most will make you fight under certain conditions such as how the enemy might recover health with each strike they land.  Or you might have to contend with earthquakes or other environmental disasters.  These are thrown in as mixups.  It's a challenging mode, but it has it's rewards.  As you go through you'll be able to purchase new weapons for characters that each ahve their own different properties.  Some might increase your offense but lower you defense.  Others make you more vulnerable to impacts.  Some might heal you when you use the Soul Charge and some are just jokes to make you laugh.The weapons you acquire in Weapons Master Mode can be used beyond that, however.  You'll eventually unlock EXTRA modes.  Such as Extra Arcade, Extra Team Battle, Extra Time Attack etc.  These present a new challenge as the weapon you use can make the Arcade mode harder or easier depending on how you look at it.  But there's more to unlock.  Exhibition modes just to see your character show off their moves.  A battle theater where you can set up a match between two CPU characters if you like and plenty of galleries.  There's a lot to do in Soul Calibur and you'll find it'll take you hours just to unlock every character, stage, mode and weapon the game has to offer.On the other hand, it's a little unfair to say that Soul Calibur II is the same thing as Soul Calibur.  In nearly every area the game excels.  There are more characters here, but not all of them clones.  Cassandra may have similar moves to Sophitia, for example, but using the two characters proves to be a far different experience.  The announcer is back and somewhat cheesy, but now when you come to each level it'll announce who you are fighting.  The arenas are also larger and some of them feature walls so that it isn't too easy to be knocked out of the ring.  Some of the changes are small, but they amount to seeing the game as much more than just a refinement of the original.The animations in characters are more fluid and the models more detailed as well.  This is easily one of the greatest looking games of its generation.  It far exceeds the original Dreamcast in this department.  The music is also still really good to this day.  Offering true epic music to compliment each environment and fighter.  It doesn't always sound like the type of music you'd here in a fighting game (it's more orchestral and classical than most games) but it still evokes a fighting spirit.  The sound effects are also amazing.  What stands out most, like the original, are the weapons and how each character uses them uniquely.  It makes Soul Calibur II a lot of fun to experience and behold.Soul Calibur II may very well be one of the greatest fighting games ever made.  It still stands out, even to this day, as being among the best in the series among fans.  It doesn't throw too much in and it doesn't go overboard.  But more than that it just offers an experience you don't get in many fighters, especially as many of them (Soul Calibur V included) are more interested in taking the fight online rather than providing an illuminating experience.  Soul Calibur II is a testament to when the series was at its brightest and it shouldn't be missed by any fan of the genre.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2012"}

The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

The story is an epic, something Squaresoft is famous for, but the way it's told is not as good as it should have been, and that, is the most nagging part for me and it just brings down the game.  Also, the materia system which I grew to love as been destroyed and replaced with this stupid junction system.  I see it's good points but it's too confusing.  Even with the in-game tutorial, and even to this day, I don't fully understand it to my personal satisfaction but good enough to beat the game.  The graphics have been greatly improved.  The people look like real people.  They have hands instead of blocks, and don't have lethal looking hair (CLOUD).  The fighting is the same turn bassed action as before and some battles can take up to 10 minutes, not a good thing when you're in a hurry.  Another bad thing is how much you have to rely on the GFs (summons).  It's nearly immpossible to beat a boss with out using them and most of them take a long time to use.  The anamaters ovously had a lot of time on their hands and decided that summoning a simple summon like brothers will have to take a couple minutes instead of a quick 5 seconds.  Sure it's great for the first few times but after a while, it gets old.  The world is completely futuristic and has nothing to do with it's title &quot;FANTASY&quot;.  Sure it's not a big deal, but I'm just pointing it out.  The story is good, but the character development is terrible.  They have to make a game where you actually like the character you play and not one where you constantly yell at the screen calling him an idiot for doing something stupid or saying &quot;SHE LIKES YOU, CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?!&quot; because this games' story is based around love, yet the characters that are in &quot;love&quot; hardly show it, or at least the guy.  I still don't see what she sees in him.  The FMV is greatly improved and also the ingame graphics as I said before.  FF fanatics should get this game but just be warned, the story has a lot going for it, it's interesting, but the characters just make you want to scream.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2001"}

I have never liked Star Wars games, they are either to long and boring, they didn't feel like Star Wars, or are meant for dia hard gamers. I got this game as a gift from my brother who is the only person I know loves star wars games since the Nintendo games.Boy I was in for a pleasant and unexpected surprise. This game is very good. And you really feel you are part of the trilogy. Locations are great, graphics are good 5 channel sound I liked. Best of all gameplay is great. Although the flying parts of the missions are kind of difficult to learn if you are not familiar with other Rogue Squadron games or ones that require flying, they are a lot of fun.I already finished the regular missions, but I feel the need to get the medals to unlock the bonus missions, which are five, I already got three and have played the first one. I like the fact that you want to play more even when the main story is finished, not like other games that you are in an urge to beat them just to know the ending and get it over with.I like the fact that you can play not only with luke, but with Han, Wedge, Chewie driving an Imperial Walker and that bring us to another cool part, you get to drive different kind of vehicles and fly different ships in some missions you can choose which you want to fly.If you are a beginner you will enjoy it and if there are missions which are too difficult you can enter a passcode for unlimited lives or to unlock the different features, but you can't unlock the bonus missions. If you are a medium level gamer you can be challenged to get as many medals as you can to unlock as many or all the bonus missions and if you are a hardcore gamer this game will certainly be a challenge to get better times and scores to get all the bonus missions and unlock space ships like The Millenium Falcon, Slave 1 and tie fighters to name some.When you finish the regular missions with or without medals you get a documentary and also the Empire Strikes Back arcade game. And if you finish the first bonus mission you unlock the Star Wars arcade game. Both of them are not artistic master pieces compared to modern day technology but if you grew in the 80's its may bring good memories of the primitive stages of home computing and video gaming.Last BUT NOT LEAST. You can enjoy cutscenes taken out of the three movies, during the start, checkpoints and completion of the missions. Sort like the ones from Lord of the Ring games, with the difference that they don't transition from live images to digital ones. But still if you are a Star Wars fan you will enjoy them.If you like Star Wars this is the best one I have ever seen or played, and if you are a gamer most probably you'll like this one.I almost forgot the foot part of the missions are not as bad as people tell in the reviews I have read, still it has some problems especially in right angle corners, since the camera angle doesn't change until you have turned, but they are cool to play specially the recuing of princess Leia from A new hope.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00BGAA0SU","description":"","reviewerName":"Shaide","summary":"One of the better PS4 games out","reviewText":"I won't deny that this is a great game! In terms of graphics and sound and controls? This game is perfect, and I can't wait to see what future PS4 games are going to look like! If you have a PS4, you should get this game! However, while the game is great, it's not perfect!The game seemed really short, and maybe this is because I played it as much as I did. It just left me wanting more. Perhaps they held back, as they plan on extending it with DLC later on down the road? I don't know. There just should have been more to it.You start the game as a new player in the infamous series, so you don't really need to be too familiar with the previous games, although there are a few guest cameos for those who have played the game. Still, if this is your first time diving into an Infamous game, which unless you also owned a PS3, it most likely is, you won't feel like you are missing out on too much.Sadly the game is not as good as the previous titles. At least not in terms of story. While the story is &#34;Acceptable&#34;, it just didn't live up to expectations.Lastly, I was kind of disappointed that this game didn't support UGC like Infamous 2, and while i'm sure that most people didn't use it(Myself included), it was kind of a nice feature, and with some tweaking and enhancing it could have been a good addition to Second Son.The controls are very much like previous games, except for the &#34;Tagging&#34; which forces you to turn your gamepad awkwardly sideways and pretend it's a can of spraypaint. Very Gimicky, but that's to be expected in early console games. Companies like to use any and all gimicks at their disposal.Lastly, the game takes place in Seattle which is home to &#34;Real-Life Superhero&#34; Phoenix Jones. In honor of him, they have posters featuring him put up around town. There are also stores named after Cole from the previous games, and a lot of other easter eggs to find, just like in past Infamous games.Overall, I would recommend this to any PS4 gamer, especially the ones who aren't familiar with the past chapters of the game series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2014"}

This game's superior artificial intelligence, seamless graphics, and advanced multiplay features make it popular.","reviewerName":"J. JAGELLA","summary":"Half-Life Heresy","reviewText":"Most critics insist that Half-Life is the best game ever, but I must disagree.  I will say that it has perhaps the best gameplay of any shooter, but it does have its drawbacks.One of the best traits of half-life is that although it has much the same gameplay as any other shooter, it  seems to have done it exceptionally well.  Like most shooters you walk, run, climb, jump, crawl, and shoot, of course, but in Half-life it's so utterly engaging.  I'm not sure why, but I believe the great gameplay is a result of the intuitive nature of the puzzles and combat.  You can look around and say: &quot;Ah ha!  That's the way.&quot;  And in most cases you are right giving you a satisfying feeling of knowing that you used your brain well.  However, as another reviewer noted, in some cases you get nailed with a &quot;gotcha,&quot; you die, and it's time to gawk at the ol' loading screen.  Nevertheless, it's not that hard after you play the game for a while, and who doesn't want a challenge?The weapons are average and include the standard machine gun, shotgun, and pistols along with grenades and other weapons you pick up along the way.  You can also use guns set on turrets.  All your weapons pack a punch, and you shouldn't be dissatisfied with any of them.Enemies include monsters and &quot;grunts.&quot;  They're decent looking, and the grunts have good AI.  Some of the &quot;boss&quot; monsters need to be killed with special weapons that you fire from pressing a button on a wall.  It's very satisfying to see one of the big monsters finally go down.The sound is exceptional except for the voices of the NPCs.  I'm not sure why their voices are distorted.  It might be a bug.Speaking of bugs, this edition of Half-life has a bug that causes you to stick to some of the lifts which can be very annoying.  Sierra should have fixed this bug by now.  I used cheat codes to get around this problem, however.As for cheat codes, use them!  As difficult as this game can be, you can finish it using these codes, but try the game without them at first, of course.What really drags this game down is the graphics.  Although they aren't poor, they aren't that great either.  In some of the levels the design is so plain and smooth I feel like I'm in a tin can.  This problem gets in the way of Half-Life being a truly great game.To sum it up, I'd say Half-Life is a good, solid shooter.  It can be so absorbing, but it won't wow you either.  And such an opinion will get me in trouble with all those rabid Half-Life fans, no doubt!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2004"}

She played it on her PC (Radeon 7970) and it ran perfectly but I also ran it on my own (Radeon.. 6000 series something or another) and it ran fine.  Obviously I had to lower some of the settings for mine.My girlfriend wasn't interested at all in the games that came with the video card - this, sleeping dogs, or Hitman Absolution.  I begger her to at least Try one of them, and to my surprise she tried this one.She absolutely loved it.  She said it felt to her like a combination of Red Dead Redemption and Assassin's Creed 2. I don't know if I see that reference exactly, but it works.I just beat the game yesterday and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  I'm sure if I was more critical of games I'd probably give it a 4 instead cause .. I don't know, not enough characters with personality or not enough choices or something? But honestly I've learned to just play games for fun, and I had a ton here. The characters they do introduce are interesting and usually kind of funny in their own way.The gun-play is excellent in my opinion and very satisfying.  Feels a little better than Farcry 2 as I remember it.The story is actually a lot of fun. It's simple, similar to the recent Tomb Raider game with the whole -normal person to savage killer- type ... plot? But unlike tomb raider, your character does lose himself quite a bit throughout the story and that really does add some depth to it. The game even offers a slight choice at the end with 2 very different (but one very sucky) endings. You'll have to use Youtube to watch the second one (Autosave and all that won't let you go back and pick the other choice).I go back and forth from PC gaming to console gaming so I'm a bit more adaptive than my girlfriend who pretty exclusively does PC gaming (why she has the better PC). There are some quick time events that have you using your mouse clicks, Spacebar, W, and other buttons to progress scenes (not too many luckily).  That bothered her more than it bothered me, but I can vouch for the fact that those scenes would have been more comfortable on a controller or console. But, I never had to redo a single one, so they were still very doable.Also, the stupid game doesn't give you the option to set Crouch to Toggle or Hold. I hate that. If you put it on PC let the gamer customize things as they wish.  And if you're curious - the game forces you to use Crouch as a Toggle, which is more comfortable on a controller definitely... but I don't think it is for a keyboard/mouse.But those are my only complaints. I saw probably 2 glitches my whole time, including one cutscene where a machine gun kept floating around in circles while someone was talking to me. Nothing game breaking in my playthrough, very solid experience overall.Just to mention - I played this game through UPlay instead of Steam (it's how the bundle came with the video card).  I prefer Steam, but possibly UPlay supports the game a bit better since it's UbiSoft? I don't know.Girlfriends computer is a AMD fx-350 (8 core, 4ghz), 16gb memory, Radeon 7970Mine is a... AMD 4 core at 2.6ghz (don't remember the model, it's older), 4gb of memory, and a Radeon 6670 I Think. Whatever it is, it isn't exceptional anymore by any means.Both were running Windows 7 (64 bit).  She ran the game at 1920x1080 and I ran it at.. something closer to 1280x720 (had to goof around to make it fit perfectly).  She ran all the settings at Mad Ultimate, I ran them at Medium to High (kept Shadows and Reflections pretty low).We both had a grand old time.

{"product_name":"B00006F7S8","description":"It's hard to believe that creator Will Wright had trouble selling his originalSimCityconcept to publishers. That first game went on to fame, notoriety, and great praise--from critics, gamers, and even educators--and spawned countless imitators, not the least of which include Wright's own smaller-scaleThe Sims, which went on to become a phenomenon in its own right. Now on its fourth edition,SimCityreturns to our hard drives, and would-be city planners everywhere will be busy for a long, long time.SimCity 4functions much like its predecessors. You've got the power to zone land as residential (green), commercial (blue), and industrial (yellow). You control the budget. You decide where to place crucial services like police, fire, medical, and even utilities like power and water. You place schools, parks, roads, water towers, and scenery as you accede to the many demands of your Sim citizens. Do a good job and your city will grow and the money will flow into your coffers. Do a bad job and the people will pack up and move away, leaving your city treasury in horrific debt and landing you what the game cheekily considers to be a far easier job: senator. The game requires a balancing act that takes both planning and a persnickety nature. There are charts to read, reports to watch, and, above all, needs to juggle. It's rewarding when it all comes together, and frustrating when you fail, once again, to build anything worthwhile.That's why I wish the game came with a better manual. The included book glosses over most major information and then neglects important aspects, such as the RCI indicator (which explains zoning needs) and parts of the budget. At the very least, the manual should include tips on handling debt. There are two tutorials which cover the basics, but again, they won't help you get out of trouble once you get in too deep. You can find this information in thestrategy guide, which is sold separately, but you really shouldn't have to go that route.The graphics are amazing, showing a vibrant metropolis with scurrying traffic, wandering Sims, smoking chimneys, and sparkling lights when night falls. Fireworks reward each year of service. And wait until you see the cool disasters you can unleash if the mood strikes you--fire, lightning, tornado, volcano, and giant robot. Oddly, there's a significant performance hit even on fast systems. Thankfully, the stuttery scrolling and slow-to-respond zoom don't hurt the game too much since you can pause it at will or fast forward if you need to wait for your cash reserves to build. The most significant flaw is that the game only offers one save slot, which discourages experimentation.Despite minor imperfectionsSimCity 4is an awesome game. You can build several cities next to each other on the map and make them dependant on each other. (You can build the greater L.A. area, in other words.) You can even import your Sims fromThe Simsto live in your city. Such familiar characters can tell you a lot about what your city needs. Put simply, city planning has never been this fun, this challenging, or this deep.--Andrew S.

Not being able to see a 2 ton Worg about to swipe me out of existence can be a setback.2. Difficulty curve. I'm playing this on normal (I didn't want to breeze through it, but I didn't want to not get through the game either) and so far, I have lost my cool a few times. I want to call the difficulty curve merciless, but that's unfair. It is steep, though. This game will be quick to punish button mashers. There is an element of strategy in this game, having to switch around strategies according to enemies, cycling through combos, and cycling through shadow or light magic... it keeps you on your toes, and I would daresay that it is a characteristic missing from some of the titles that this game is compared to the most (such as GoW and DMC. This is just my opinion, maybe someone will argue that both franchises do have an element of strategy in their hack and slash, and I totally missed it. I welcome any disputes on the matter)Those are, to me, the only scratches in an otherwise polished game. And I hesitate to call them a real detraction from this game.This game is presumably a reboot of the franchise, which works for me, as I never had an attachment to the previously established canon. You are Gabriel Belmont (the name, taken from the hills from his childhood. Bel - mont. Had never put those two together) He was an orphan taken in by the Brotherhood of Light, and was married to Maria ( I forget the name now, I hope this is right). Maria was slain, so far in my playthrough, under mysterious circumstances, and so he set forth to exact revenge.The story set up, I will admit, is a bit shallow. But the game has been accused of being light on story telling. I would have to disagree. That the story telling was relegated to sequences at the beginning and end of each stage is not the most organic way to tell a story is true. But in this particular case, the way the story is woven, namely as a fairy tale of old, I think it works. There is much to be said of the voice acting and narrating on Patrick Stewart's part.  At first the story is a bit too ' in medias rex' , but soon enough the blanks are filled out, and the intrigue builds up. I keep hearing the ending is phenomenal. We shall see.The presentation, I will say, is not pushing any envelopes, but it is setting a mark for what action games can accomplish. The look of the game, albeit not groundbreaking, is simply awe inspiring. I had never seen a prettier snowy medieval landscape. The style and the aesthetic lends itself well to the sort of gothic undertone that always accompanied Castlevania games, but this time, in a grander fashion. The desolate, the desperate, the god forsaken aspect of some of the more European  settings is simply entrancing, whereas some of the more fantastic settings, such as enchanted forests, forgotten cities and crypts break up the monotony of just seeing castles and towers for 20 hours without seeming out of place.  The rain effects are some of the best I've ever seen in a game. The soundtrack is, I will say, among the best I've ever heard on a game. I don't know who Oscar Araujo is, or what he composed before this track, but he is now on my radar. It has a certain quality that aims for grandiose, while at the same time remaining memorable, and just works so well with the story telling. Fans of the series might be a bit disilussioned, because it's nothing like the Castlevania theme. I've read the original theme is hidden somewhere in the game. Haven't heard it yet.The voice acting is top notch. I thought Robert Carlyle was a bit of a strange choice for taciturn Gabriel Belmont, but he's grown on me. My main issue was the accent at first. I always thought he should have a French accent, or, I dunno. Mr. Carlyle makes it work though.  Patrick Stewart makes game text intended to narrate the bulk of the storyline sing. I have no idea how he does it. Some people are complaining that it's too similar to Oblivion. I don't see it. These samples of acting are better, in my opinion.  Jason Isaacs is in the game as well, but I haven't bumped into him yet.The gameplay itself is the strong suit of this game. The control scheme is one of the best and most intuitive I've yet to find on an action game. I wondered if they would do this thing where you can control the whip with one analog stick, but that would lend itself to disaster, in hindsight.  Mercurysteam made it simple: jump, area attack, direct attack, secondary weapon. Done. It seems restrictive, but I assure you...there's something about less is more, that just makes this set up wow you.  The camera will sometimes work against you (happens to me anyway) when trying to time a block for a parry, but other than that, the control is great, and the whip mechanics are pretty much near-perfect. The whip is a seriously underrated weapon in video games. Seriously.A lot of people are, again, comparing the action to GoW or to DMC. Back when Dante's Inferno came out, I played the demo first, and did not enjoy it, precisely because it felt like GoW: Renaissance style, and I couldn't shake that feeling that the game was so similar.  I will admit that there ARE similarities, but the way the similarities are implemented just keeps the game feeling fresh: in GoW, you will fight multitudes of enemies at once, or a reduced number of stronger enemies at the same time, and depend a lot on dodging out of the way, and blocking in time, and absolutely brutal chain combos. Kratos is just set up that way, with the ability to keep hitting enemies throughout hundreds of hits. The chains, even though in principle are whiplike, in a sense Gabriel however will be confronted more often than not against enemies that will require more reaction than proaction I think in a sense this sets it apart, a BIT, from GoW.  The platform actions of the game are somewhat less polished than the fighting, but the game never really veers into parkour action, and it is being compared more to Uncharted. I can see the similarities there, save for the presence of the whip which put Gabriel in far more  acrobatic situations than Nathan Drake. Eventually you start acquiring new  abilities (such as the ability to dash, and thus, do a long jump) which will break those similarities up somewhat.  Some of the boss fights are comparable to Shadow of the Colossus. These are very similar, I can't say that there's something that sets Castlevania apart, save for the use of the whip to scale up the titanic bosses, but the similarity is not a bad one, in my opinion: Shadow of the Colossus was a great game, and I don't think that its brand of action had ever been repeated to say that now that Castlevania made use of the similar sequences is cliche.Overall, this game might be a sum of other action games, and in a way, it's true. The parts that are being summed up into this game however, do not feel segmented (ie, I never felt \" oh, now I'm playing Uncharted, oh, now it's Shadow of the Colossus). It always feels like playing Castlevania, and the feeling is quite epic.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2010"}

{"product_name":"B007XVTR5S","description":"","reviewerName":"Da Jester","summary":"The First Call of Duty Where the Campaign is a Plus!","reviewText":"This review is mostly about the campaign and Zombie mode. It was played on Hardened difficulty.I was one of speculators whom after watching the first gameplay trailer immediately called out Treyarch was borrowing story ideas from the magnificent Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. However, when I read the words \"non-linear\" and \"multiple endings\" in the same reviews for a Call of Duty game, I had trouble believing it. Several positive reviews from non biased video game critic websites later, I decided to try this out and traded accessories and other games in for Call of Duty: Black Ops II.The campaign is exactly how they advertised it: chaotic and summer blockbuster fun. Yes, typical linear environments still exists probably due to the developers use of a game engine aging since the first Black Ops entry. Usually all of Call of Duty games are presented in first person with shaky cam moments and everybody yelling at the silent protagonist, IE you. These parts still exists in game or during missions. Out of game we actually get to see everybody, including the characters you play as. This is a very nice addition since this helps continue the story from the previous Black Ops entry. In the campaign, you will be presented with optional game activities like either using your aim and survival gun skills, or hack into a gun sentry and mow down enemies. I did find at least two ways of finishing a mission via area progression. Either follow your teammates the direct path, or flank from the side or snipe from a tower while they move up the middle. Also, a nice added feature is the ability to customize your weapon load out before each mission, much like how you would in multiplayer. Most notoriously and what probably helped this game shine for critics were the player choices that affect how your ending occurs. The six varying outcomes to this game actually will incite re playability, something that has always absent in any previous Call of Duty entry. My only dislike about this (SPOILER WARNING) was why did a team mate that I liked have to die to ensure the safety of another so I can get the best ending?The only huge drag to the campaign are the newly added Strike Force Missions. Adding RTS tactical command for ground troops would sound brilliant on paper, but when executed, it is a mess. The AI for your team is useless. The player will have to directly control a unit to get the mission done. It's almost as if Treyarch did this intentionally. One mission in particular I literally cursed at my TV because it was aggravating trying to capture nodes with terrible AI squadmates. Note that these missions are purely optional. However, there are two that have to be played successfully if you want to contribute to one of the better endings.Zombie mode is a mixed bag for me. I loved the first Black Ops's Zombie mode and how Treyarch released a dedicated DLC just for it. The ability to play 4 player splitscreen locally or 2 player splitscreen online is a VERY welcome addition. The only problem is the locations are not that great so far. I know that Zombie mode rewards with survival and exploration, but these areas are annoying with the fire everywhere. As soon as a zombie touches one of the many cracks of fire,..they explode.  Having to constantly jump over the fire obstacle can get annoyoing.  So far Tranzit mode is an interesting premise, but the characters you play as are not as interesting as Nickolai or Kennedy from the first entry. Also, when playing Tranzit mode, it's almost a must to have a way to talk to your online team mates. It can turn into a giant cluster-cuss fast!I'm hoping Treyarch will release something in the future that was just as cool as \"CALL OF THE DEAD.\"  I haven't tried out \"Grief\" mode, the 4 vs 4 vs zombies. It sounds like fun, but I'm still trying to get the hang of original zombie mode.I can really careless about multiplayer because it always varies on the player and its player base to determine if it's balanced or not. No matter what, I die a lot. So multiplayer is pretty much identical to previous entries except for a few minor changes. The unlock system is different and the same. It's different when anytime you level up you get unlock points allowing the player to choose what to unlock be it weapons, score-streaks, or perks. Wildcards are a new feature and they can help determine what class you will play as. Will you be perk heavy, a gun toting nut, or something in between? So far I prefer Black Ops II's version of class customization and how kill-streaks are now score-streaks. I don't know about you, but I like performing actions while killing to build up a score so I can help out my teammates. So far I feel more useful in this entry's multiplayer for my teammates sake than I have in the past Call of Duty games.To me, this is the first Call of Duty game that has impressed me since Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. I would have considered buying this for my PC instead since it does use Steam, but there are still no dedicated servers or mod support. I had a few minor game freeze ups after a multiplayer match and after a campaign mission. But after a patch later, no troubles yet. In my opinion, this is a Call of Duty game where the campaign is the star, something that I prefer more than yet more addicting multiplayer. It's probably arguable that it is not as good as the previous Black Ops, but it's still pretty damned good. I beleive that Treyarch needs to take over the Call of Duty franchise completely. There are the minor setbacks, but Black Ops II is a step in the right direction and a breath of fresh air for this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2012"}

As an Assassin, Aveline soon finds herself on an unforgettable journey that will take her from the crowded streets of New Orleans to voodoo-haunted swamps and ancient Mayan ruins. She will play a pivotal role in the turbulent birth of a new nation as she fights for freedom, not only for herself, but for her fellow citizens.","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Unafraid to be Different","reviewText":"Assassin's Creed III: Liberation is an entirely different game from the Assassin's Creed III that was released for the PC and Consoles.  It is also an entirely different approach to storytelling in many ways that makes it a true phenomenon.  Set in America's New Orleans during the time leading up to the American Revolutionary War, you play Aveline, a young mulatto woman of French/African heritage.  Aveline is in a household of placage, meaning she is part of a wealthy French family and is known as a woman of high standing by the localsHowever, Aveline has a very big secret:  as with the other Assassin's Creed games, she is part of a secret order of assassins who at this point in history are on the side of the American Revolution.  The portrayal of New Orleans really feels like a piece of history come alive, and Aveline moves through their society like a chameleon:  when not using her assassin's outfit, Aveline can disguise herself as a slave girl and move among the slave community.  She also has the ability to dress up and be 'The Lady', her high-standing persona with access to some of the finest locations the New Orleans wealthy have to offer.This is where the gameplay really goes out on a limb:  while some missions need to be done as one persona or the other, there are multiple points in the story where you can choose which to use to complete the mission.  There are some people who find moving around as The Lady to be boring:  she can't run, her fighting skills are limited, and most of what she does involves charming other men to protect her or bribing officials to let her into places a Lady shouldn't be without an escort.  This part of history to me seems well depicted:  when you walk through town into areas that are lower on the social ladder, without a guard or one of the high-society men with you people will stare, some will be rude because of your mixed race, and others will try to rob you.  In the slave girl disguise people will ignore you, you can climb and you can fight, but the guards will be much more suspicious of you and trouble won't be easy to shake.When it comes to the Vita, Liberation has the graphics of a PS3 title.  It makes use of the Vita hardware in little ways:  use the back touchscreen when pickpocketing, run your fingertips along the top of the Vita to open a letter--entertaining ways that think beyond sticks and buttons.  The gameplay is unbelievably smooth, as fluid as any of the Assassin's Creed titles when it comes to running along rooftops and climbing observation towers.  The music is entertaining, even though the sound effects are missing something.  The storyline leaves itself open to multiple replays as you can go back and try missions using a different disguise.  Probably the only time I have difficulty is in missions where you have to go undiscovered, be it by sneaking or through following someone:  sometimes the small screen makes it a bit more difficult to keep track of your movements and I misjudge the distance.  That said, the reload checkpoints have reduced the amount of replay for me, and I appreciate that.There is one bug that has been plaguing customers that you should be aware of:  at the time of this review there is still an issue that your savegames could be wiped out!  That's a major problem that has fortunately not hit me, but you can work around it simply by remembering to use the savegame backup utility on the Vita.  I use the Media Manager to back up all my game saves to my PC once a week.  I do expect this issue won't go unresolved, so just be aware of it and make backups.If you already like the Assassin's Creed series, you will love this console-quality title on the Vita.  If you are new to the series, Assassin's Creed III:  Liberation makes a strong point of entry for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2012"}

After the mammoth success of The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess, many Wii owners have been anxious for a new way to play around with Link and all his missions against the vulgarous Ganon.

But, there is a new add-on that can help you play around with Link for just a little while longer on the Wii, in a new way.The new Wii Zapper is a sleek and convient device that turns your Wii remote and nunchuck controller, into a new handy gun peripheral, something Nintendo hasn't delivered since the original NES Zapper for Duck Hunt. The Zapper is easy to setup for any Wii owner and is convient to use with the new Resident Evil title. You can also use this with Link's Crossbow Training, a simple way to shoot out your bows against foes in Hyrule. The game plays well, as you play through 19 different levels to try to shoot at your opponents from demons, and other opponents. The graphics stand well, but the gameplay is actually very addictive to gamers young and old. The control is very simple to use, as you guide your Wii nunchuck controls around ad launch your arrows with a blink of an eye. It also unlike games like Dance Dance Revolution and Rock Band is a lot cheaper to buy, but keeps the peripherals at a affordable price.All that I can say though is that I really am hoping the Wii Zapper doesn't fade into limited obscurity like other Nintendo add-ons like the DK Bongo Drums for Donkey Kong Jungle Beat from the Gamecube.

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed.

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"dancinhomer","summary":"It's a good survival horror FPS for casual gamers.","reviewText":"This is a solid FPS title.

The premise is simple: you can summon monsters to help you in battles.  You have a point and click interface using the stylus.  You basically select the characters and monsters you want, then have them move towards a spot or attack an enemy.  Sounds simple?It kind of is simple, yet there is a good amount of strategy involved.  Each monster class has a different elemental affinity and a different kind of attack.  There are three types: melee, ranged, and flying.  There is a rock paper scissors style to which unit type is stronger than the other.  So if the opponent has a lot of flying monsters, use some ranged type.  The elemental affinity is also key.  It doesn't make too much of a difference in battles with summoning circles, since you can just replenish your stock over time; but other battles without summoning circles are tougher since you can't revive your monsters, only the principal characters.The game is fun, and doesn't have a huge learning curve.  The story is suitable for young people but also has some fun moments that appeal to the grown up that I am.  It's still rather light in story.  It's a lot of fun to see the characters after the closing of FF12.  Vaan is a lot less whiny but even more nosy and gung-ho if you can believe it!The synthing system is not too deep yet is still fun to use.  Often the items you can synth are discovered in chests before you can synth them.  Setting up gambits is limited to one gambit per character, but you can issue commands to the main characters other then the gambits.  It requires some clicking over, especially for characters with multiple offensive spells.Overall a fun game, though not too difficult nor to deep.  I think FF Tactics A2 is a better strategy RPG, but they are both worthy of a purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2012"}

Start with a single character, then travel through the world, gathering a party of up to 10 different characters.","reviewerName":"bixodoido","summary":"Great fantasy RPG","reviewText":"I must admit, I bought this game because of the beautiful screenshots on the back.  Usually when I do this I'm disappointed with the game.  Not this time, though.  What I found was a story and game every bit as appealing as the graphics.  Dungeon Siege was definitely worth the money.This is your typical farm-boy-to-hero scheme.  Along the way, you find more weapons and encounter people willing to join you in your quest.  You develop the character the way YOU want to, and there's no restraint on the way you develop him (unlike Diablo).  This is a great aspect, because if you start a character and decide you don't like the way he's going, you don't have to start a new one--you just change gears and develop him another way.Another great part of this game is the enormous variety of weapons and spells.  There is always something new to discover as you mercilessly slaughter every monster imaginable.  Most notably are the summon spells, everything from a scorpion when you're weak to a drake or lava monster when you're strong.DS does very well in the single player department, and this because of its superb party control.  You can have up to 8 in your party--mages, archers, melee fighters--even a donkey to haul your stuff (if you're a pack-rat like me).  The first time you go through this game is incredible, and there's always the chance you can encounter (or hire) different characters the next time around.Multi-player is also great in DS.  In this mode you only control one character, but you can join a party with up to 8.  There are many bugs in MP, it is true (the foremost being that your game is paused every time a new player enters the game), but it is still very enjoyable.  There is a different world to explore, and a lot of big creatures to fight.Speaking of the big creatures, they are worth mentioning.  It is truly a lot of fun to go on a quest after one of these monsters.  My favorite is the fury, the great, hovering demon that strikes terror into the heart of the stoutest warrior.  The gigantic red dragon is also fun to defeat.So why 4 stars, why not 5?  Well, the game does have some flaws.  First, the single player campaign doesn't have a lot of replay ability.  Once you've gone through a couple of times, its pretty much old news.  Since the multi-player mode has only one other world (at least last I knew), it too can become a bore.  Quests in MP are almost non-existent, and the game is reduced to killing stuff.Don't get me wrong, I like killing stuff.  It's one of my favorite things to do in a fantasy game.  But MP mode would benefit from more quests.  Who knows, maybe in an expansion?All in all, this game is a must-have for anyone who loves RPGs.  Buy this game, and you'll find yourself more involved then you know!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2002"}

Well, the newest and latest edition to the Medal of Honor franchise is here and available on the Playstation 2. Of course it would be better than Frontline because it is a new and up to date game. But some things have changed and some things haven't. Of course EA would keep the game in first person mode, but there has been some slight alterations that have made this MOH unique. Like the fact that there are bonus/hidden objectives and that at the end of each mission you are graded on 3 different things: Hits Taken, Accuracy, and Bonus Objectives completed. All of these categories makes getting a medal a very tough and a challenging thing indeed. Also you can find certain items that will aid you later on in the game and make things much easier, but you have to look for these things.Now let's talk about the levels. Well to say the least, these levels are huge!! I'm not kidding. The Day of Infamy level (Pearl Harbor) is very well done and is fun to play over and over again. But most of the action takes place in the jungle (duhh! You're fighting the Japanese around the Philippine Islands) and the Japanese pop up in the most unlikely places and ambush you from behind. So watch your back. And like I said before, the levels are massive. There are so many different paths to take you could easily become confused, but they're fun all the same.Next we are going to discuss weapons. Well there is not a whole lot to talk about. There has not been that many changes. You will have the usual M1 Garand and the ever faithful Thompson SMG, and yes you have your Shotgun, and your Bazooka, and oh yes, your standard Mark II Frag Grenades to chuck at some holed up Japs.So now you want to talk about controler capabilities. Well let me say this, there has been a slight change since Frontline. The throw Grenade and Reload weapon capabilities have their own separate buttons which really uses up all the buttons on the controller and their are more controller layouts than Frontline had available.So there you have it. Medal of Honor: Rising Sun is yet another great game from Electronic Arts and if I have heard and seen correctly, there will be a sequel to this game (the first sequel for the Playstation MOH series) which continues this game's story.Bottom Line: Medal of Honor: Rising Sun is a really great game to open up a new theater of World War II.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2004"}

Namely when you want Mario to go somewhere, he goes where you want him to and when he lands, the landing is solid.  This feeling of solid game play has been absent for far too long in a Mario game.  The controller lets you to collect star bits, a new form of currency, and shaking it slightly releases a spin attack which is a wonderfully thought out addition to Mario's special moves.From Beginning to end I found myself stunned at the creativity and inventiveness in each level, some feel exploration based, some  skill, others present mind-bending perspective shifts that keep you on your toes and present great satisfaction when it's all done.The only downside to speak of is swimming. It still feels clunky and can be extremely frustrating.

Unless your playing on a stadium-size TV screen,  that should be more than enough.

I already own a GBA SP, but wanted to buy a DS for the following reasons:* Advanced graphics:  The 3D capabilities of this machine are AMAZING.  Mario64 DS looks better on a handheld than Mario 64 looked on the Nintendo 64 and a TV!* Great sound:  You can choose between surround sound, stereo, or headphones optimized.  It also includes a built-in headphone jack, something that was noticeably absent from the SP.* Backwards compatibility: It will play all GameBoy Advance games (though not original GB or GB Color), and can hold a DS game and a GameBoy Advance game at the same time.* Touch screen:  Gimmick or revolution?  I like how touch was integrated into Mario64 and  the Metroid Prime:Hunters demo that is included with the DS.  I think future games will bear out whether it will be a true success or just a niche idea.As it states in the product description, it comes with two screens, the bottom one being touch-sensitive.  To touch the bottom screen you can use one of the 2 styluses that comes with the product, or a thumb strap that has a plastic piece that can be used for certain types of games.Currently, the DS library is fairly limited (fewer than 20 games at present), but there are many games announced for the future.

Our hero stumbles across a race of part-animal, part-plant,  all-bizarre creatures he names Pikmin. Olimar has to learn how to lead the  Pikmin around the forest as he uses the abilities of the different-colored  Pikmin to overcome the many obstacles in his path.Learning when and how to make the best use of your Pikmins' skills and traits is  the essence of the game. You can control up to 100 Pikmin at a time while  figuring out which Pikmin are best suited for a particular task. Some are better  fighters, while others can survive in water or handle explosive bomb rocks.

Mills","summary":"Awesome for fans","reviewText":"If you enjoyed Batman the animated series as a kid, you'll enjoy this game.  kevin Conroy as Batman is great and Mark Hamill is fantastic.  Overall the art direction is great, and the 3-d effect of this new game is pretty neat for a little while.  Unfortunately the main thing I was looking foward to was the extra maps and they really arn't worth the extra amount for me, because they focus on the gameplay, and for me I was dissapointed in the pure gameplay.I waited to get the GOTY edition b/c I was put-off by the demo being almost too easiy, and the full game is the same.  I wish there was a feature to NOT have the exact buttons to push above peoples heads.  I litteraly stopped after half an hour and restarted on hard in hopes it would be more challangeing, I have never EVER done that before. And I wish it were possible to have a setting so that the game didn't tell me exactly what to do within seconds, robbing me of the chance to actually figure anything out on my own: \"I need to blow a hole in this wall\".  Maybe if I don't figure it out after 5 mintues but can you give me five seconds on my own before ou tell me exactly what to do Batman?Fortuantely the Riddle puzzles provide plenty o' brain teasers in the puzzle-solving department.  In genral there's alot of content in the box for this game, but for me the game really suffers from what I call \"Assasin's Creed Syndrom\" where it almsot plays itself.  If you didn't notice what I'm talkign about in that game or find VGs are often frustrating when you don't know exactly what to do all the tiime, you'll probbly love this game, but if your like me and find that new games are constantly getting easier and treat you like your compeltely inept then this game will frustrate you at times.However the story is great, art direction is splendid, voice-acting phenominal (though I wish they didn't taint it by making Kevin conroy say \"maybe I can follow this trail\" every five seconds)  and the 3-d is fun... works very well with \"detective mode\" whcih your in ALL the time...  following trails.You can download the other map packs for free of the PSN with 3-d added which is a nice thing to do for peopel who purchase the GOTY, but as I said before the additional content is not appealing for very long (for me) because it's mostly just battle arena and/or time trails which where not what I even liked about this game in the first place.If you like Batman this can be a great little game to pop in for a little bit before you get bored, but don't expect anything that will force you to strain yourself, or even leanfoward as you sit on the coach and coast through this one with those goofy (though the designs are cool) glasses on.At 50 bucks it may be a bit over-priced for most people, but its definately worth picking up for Batman fans","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2010"}

WTF. Achievement system  prettier but less functional and slower to access. Unlock an achievement and you wanna see what it was while you're playing, just don't because it takes you out of the game to a loading screen and then you have to click on the achievement to see it. Not as simple as the 360.  Game will be where you left it though. One of the big head scratchers for me is the controller won't give you a warning before the battery dies. Again WTF?  Caused me to crash my chopper. Probably would have crashed it anyway since I usually run my batteries dry before swapping out but a warning would at least let me know to have a pair on standby.  I wasn't sure if I would but I actually like kinect. I programmed the TV for it so when I walk into the room and say \"xbox on\" it turns on the TV and the xbox. It's like living in the future. It's worked pretty good for me with just voice commands, haven't used the hand gestures. During setup be sure to turn your TV up pretty loud so kinect works better with your voice. Can't stream music or movies from your Windows pc like you could with the 360, I've heard that will be fixed with an update, I've heard it's because the xbox one doesn't have a media player in it yet. Probably wasn't finished but they didn't want Sony to get a huge jump on them. The smart glass app is way better than the 360 version, can't wait to see how different games use it. Definitely should have a bigger hard drive considering battlefield 4 is taking up probably 40 gigs by itself. It's going to go quick because games are just going to get bigger and bigger.  Biggest thing I miss is my chatpad, I hope MS comes out with an adapter or a new version because smart glass isn't really a replacement. If I just want to  type a quick something I shouldn't have to grab my tablet, launch smart glass and then launch the remote section in smart glass just to type. A widget shortcut for Android would be nice. Battlefield 4 plays great and with 64 players it's amazing. Main reason I bought the One and my only complaints there would be with EA and their business practices and server issues but that didn't stop me from buying premium because I'm addicted. If you consider yourself a gamer get one, If you're on the edge then wait because it's only going to get better. I do suggest downloading your games instead of buying the disc just for convenience of not having to get up and change disc but if you have slow Internet buy that disc or it will take FOREVER to download just one game. Between dead rising 3 and Battlefield 4 it was probably 60 gigs I downloaded in one day, don't think I've ever done that before.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2013"}

The multiplayer battles are too much fun; fighting on a HUGE battlefield with 63 other people blowing each other to bits with explosives, guns, and various naval, air, and armored vehicles is irresistable.There are some flaws with the gameplay; the infantry combat isn't as polished as some other first person shooters, but believe it or not that really doesn't matter.  The focus here is on using vehicles and strategy rather than charging in with your guns blazing, as a rambo style approach will get you minced up in no time.  The use of vehicles really is the selling point for this game; they really make the game more fun and add complexity to the gameplay.  You can either bomb your enemy from above or fire artillery shells at their base from a distance; or you can sneak in by foot or jeep and go for their flag, it's really up to your preference.Single player is useless here however; if you're looking for a good WWII single player experience refer to Medal Of Honor: Allied Assault or Return To Castle Wolfenstein.  The learning curve for online play with those games is less steep than BF1942 as well, since this game requires you to learn to navigate a large battlefield which is much more complex than most maps from other online shooters.  While both of those titles also boast great multiplayer modes, they aren't quite as authentic as BF1942, nor are they as engrossing; there's just more freedom here and more methods for destruction.If you like playing games on the net, buy this now!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2002"}

It is a first person shooter which excels in, as the title suggests, the sniper segments.  I found it to be a bit slow in the beginning but it picked up as the game progressed.The graphics were okay but nothing special.  I did find that some of the scenes were too dark no matter what the TV brightness and contrast settings were.  The main problems I had were that you have very little choice in your weapons and whenever you don't have a sniper rifle of some type, the aim was off.  I did enjoy the stealth aspects of the game.  You are a soldier who has to infiltrate different military guerilla camps and compounds which often requires a great deal of sneaking and \"hiding in plain sight\".  That was definitely the most challenging part of the game.  The gameplay time is fairly short even for a relative novice like myself.  I finished the game in one day over a couple of different sessions.  It probably was a total of about 6 hours I think.

{"product_name":"Logitech G600 MMO Gaming Mouse, White","description":"","reviewerName":"Gearhead Mania","summary":"Takes some time getting used to it, but has great potential as a gaming mouse due to high level of customization for the buttons","reviewText":"Logitech G600 MMO MouseI've been using the Logitech G9X gaming mouse for a few years and have always appreciated the high quality construction, on-board profiles, and great ergonomics. Before I used the G600, I read multiple reviews complaining about the poor ergonomics of the G600.From my initial impressions, the G-shift button (the ring finger button or the right-most button) definitely gets in the way. I have to consciously remember to use the \"middle\" button for right-clicks. I don't mind the G7 and G8 buttons as they rarely get in the way, but the G9-G20 buttons are overkill!! If Audi and BMW made a modern mouse, the G600 would probably be it. The German automakers have a fetish for copious buttons and switches.It is easy to program each of the buttons to perform different commands, but it becomes difficult to remember each function let alone find it with the thumb. I opted to use the first row for back, forward, and reload and even then it was a lot slower than the 2 thumb buttons on the G9X or most modern trackballs and mice.There are no adjustable weights, but the G600 is pretty hefty as-is. The white textured casing is very appealing to use. It reminds me of a Stormtrooper or EVE from Wall-E: it has a clean and sterile post-modern sci-fi look to it. The colored LEDs for the G9-G20 buttons are what I consider to be a nice selling point for the mouse. Although the G9X has adjustable color profiles for the LEDs in that tiny display strip, the G600 has 12 buttons with LEDs that can accentuate a keyboard with colored LED keys. The G600 also has an automatic color changing mode for the buttons, which I use all the time. It shifts through the entire spectrum of colors on an automatic cycle, and I find that it is soothing to watch.After using the G600 for a few weeks, I have found myself quite attached to it. The G-shift button still feels out of place, and the 12 G-buttons on the thumb are cumbersome to use. However, with practice and familiarization, they are useful for games where macros can improve your gaming performance. The G9-G20 buttons tend to feel warm after awhile probably because of the LED backlighting.The wheel button is much softer than the G9X, which makes it easier to use for tabbed browsing or gaming. My biggest complaint about the G9X was the overly stiff wheel button.Like the G9X, the G600 can store on-board profiles with different DPI settings. Although the on-the-fly DPI adjustments on the G9X was better because of the LED visual display for the adjustments.Although the G9X is promoted more for FPS games, I'd say the G600 has great potential for FPS games due to the amount of customization possible with all of those buttons on the mouse.The mouse wire is thicker than the G9X, which made it hard to clip into the Razer Mouse Bungee channels.Logitech has the right idea with the G600. The shape is perfect, it fits my hand comfortably. I normally use the \"claw\" with the G9X and other mice, but the G600 allows me to use my entire hand. The only things I'd change in the future is use a slightly thinner cord, get rid of the G-shift button or relocate it, and reduce the number of buttons on the thumb side. I'd say 4-6 buttons that are medium sized would suffice.Overall: 4/5 stars, just the right amount of mass, comfortable to use - although the G9-G20 buttons can be cumbersome to use at first. Initially, I kept trying to use the G-shift key as the right mouse button. Has great potential for any type of gaming, not just MMO's - but there is a learning curve.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2012"}

This game deserve at least 4 stars!I got this game on July.Firstable I think wrong people bought this game. Some say that \"it feels like if you were driving on ice\"; I found that SlightlyMadStudios made it like that to make you \"feel\" the G force, at least feel that sensation. For me it's a great effect and the vibration of the controller at the same time makes it just amazing.About the game: this game is between arcade and simulation (65% more sim than arcade for me). I don't have steering wheel so I don't know how it is to play with, but even with the controller for me its the most immersive car game I never played! I'M THE PILOT! this is great!Now I completed 99,50% of the carrer mode, got 65% of the trophies (did not buyed yet the packs), played every car and own every car.So yes, every car is different, you have to find wich car is better for you to drive, but at the begining, I found all cars available easy to drive (I started with the Renault M&eacute;gane Sport RS). Then you upgrade your car, advance in the game, play different events, get rewards for lots of things like 3 basic achievements (lead for an entire lap, beat the time and secure a clean lap) then, you will find other rewards (corner mastering, track mastering, reward by driving like jenson Button Style (smooth) or Lewis Hamilton Style (agressive) etc...), by doing this you get XP and rise your pilot level. love that :) ... Well, then the second car I pick up was the Maseratti Gran Turismo. It was kind of difficult to drive (to reach the 1st place), so I buyed another one: The Lamborghini Gallardo LP560-4. Fantastic for any race! If you want a stable car that goes fast, try the Nissan GT-R R35 or the R34 great handling. Coming back to drifting I found the Lexus LFA great, but for beginners I recomend skip the drift mode and reach the Toyota Corrolla AE86 nfs team reward to come back to drifting tacks or if you don't want to wait, try the BMW M3. When you get familiar with this, you will have great time on drifting.About lags: When I started my carrer mode, I knew about the lags, So yes there are lags and things like that but ALMOST NEVER! Most of those happened to me by drifting (it's rare now to see lags), maybe patches solve that issue.Another thing that I loved is that in NFS Shift 2 Unleashed, mostly in hard difficulty, win means no mystake, so you have to stay focus to beat your rivals or to finish ahead by less than one second difference (sometimes). A crash means you lost! there is even an option to turn crash real (that means that the car wreaks and you can get out of the race if its too damaged). Then you can't play an incredibly fast car against lower cars. the game doesn't allow you doing that but advise you about that, the advantage you get is minimum (no problems here, really like that).Music concerns: You feel like you are the pilot, there's no music when you're playing and I guarantee the music here no match. Like I said before, you have to be focus on the race all the time, one mystake = defeat. Ohhhh like in real life.You wont regret it after play and win the FIA GT3 Europe championship and the FIA GT1 World Championship ...so exiting!Shift One is a great game and it deserves 5,5 stars because of the idea of immersion! GRID was an exelent race experience and is no comparable because of the years between them, GT5 is maybe the best car game (Did not played Forza on X-Box 360, only on X-Box; can't campare). So I put those 4 games in the top of the best racing experience games (PS3 platform)! now this one is an improvement, but not too much, that's why it deserves 4,5 stars no possible, so I give it 5.just in case: Sorry about my english.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2011"}

The sound effects are where the subtlety comes in.  From the footsteps across gravel and the radios of the police, to Aiden Pierce's labored breathing and heartbeats when he is wounded, everything fits together to create the vibrant city that is Chicago.GraphicsI won't say too much here, but the game has a gritty feel to it. I don't know too much about Chicago, so I cannot compare map-to-map, but the detailing in the city and the nooks & crannies really give you a lot of places to run and explore.  In short, the game is beautiful and has a lot of amazing scenery.GameplayIn your quest to find out who wronged you, you earn experience and skill points that can be used to gain access to new abilities and to expand upon existing ones. In many ways, it felt like \"Last of Us\" when it came to picking up items like \"electronics pieces\" and \"unstable chemical\"; both of which (as I am sure that you can surmise) can potentially be used for nefarious and/or distraction purposes). Also like \"LoU\" you will be spending a lot of time sneaking around, but where \"LoU\" leaves you at the mercy of the movements of the bad guys, Watch Dogs gives you a fun toy in your \"hacker/cell phone\".Are you running from the police and need a quick distraction? Pull out your cell phone and hone in on that stoplight. Hold down a button for a moment, and suddenly the light changes from red to green, and there is an accident, slowing the cops down and buying you time. If you are a bit more evil, your phone will pick up on shorts in transistors: you can blow them up, but you could risk killing someone, and that will keep the heat on you. And just like in other games like \"GTA\", if your Heat level is too high, you will find yourself locked out of the game's All-Knowing version of HAL, ctOS, and suddenly information about NPCs... your fellow citizens, will be cut off to you. All that you will be able to do is minor chaos.So sure, you can run around and drive like an idiot (boy does handling ANY vehicle suck, even with some skill points added), but you will pay for your chaos by losing some of your access at first. As the story progresses and you become more powerful and gain access to more useful \"hacker\" abilities, you will become more resourceful for those times when you can't get to ctOS, but losing ctOS truly leaves you feeling lost...ControlsIf there is anything about this game that left me a bit frustrated, it was the controls. While you use the right analog stick to alternate between hacking targets, it isn't a \"snap to\" situation. In many ways this function acts like a mouse, creating an annoying little cursor that you having to move around to find a \"hack spot\", like when you are learning to use a distraction device. A second complaint involves the lack of a pure \"jump\" button, rather than having to get close to something and hope that you can jump on it. Oh, and if you hit the wrong button when you are sneaking around, you'd better pray that you don't reveal yourself. An early example is in the stadium; I was trying to get past the guard and was sneaking from cover-to-cover (\"X\") button. I got to the end and rather than having a nice, easy way to jump up to the goal I had to move around until I got the prompt (\"O\" button) saying that I could jump there. Way to handhold us kiddies, Ubisoft.In The EndWith the frustrations with the controls aside, Watch Dogs is a fun title that has some nice abilities for the player to use in an urban environment that has consequences. With a smattering of GTA, a bit of Last of Us, some Metal Gear Solid for posterity, and a with healthy dose of its own originality, Watch Dogs brings a lot to the table and doesn't disappoint.This is a unique title that has a lot of different playing styles thrown in. There are objectives that you must accomplish as you play Aiden Pierce, but as long as the heat (read: police) isn't onto you, there is a beautifully detailed city that you can explore. Do you want to hack random people and steal their money? Or will you have some morals and leave the targets alone? It really is up to you, and those decisions will affect your \"Notoriety\" later on. All-in-all I have found myself drawn into the story of Mr. Pierce, enjoying the difficulty curve and exploring Chicago while experimenting with the \"powers\" that he has, and I cannot wait to see more.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2014"}

You interact with it via the coolest cell phone ever, which has the power to hack into other people's bank accounts and listen in on their conversations, or make an underground pipe explode just as pursuing cop cars drive over it. When you get into a tough spot, you can use hacking, stealth, weapons (guns, IEDs, etc.), or use all three in tandem. Variety is one of the game's strong points. Outside of the main story are some bizarre yet fun side missions called \"digital trips\" (perhaps inspired by the zaniness of \"FarCry 3: Blood Dragon\"). One has you speeding through a hellish version of the city overrun by zombies, trying to hit as many of 'em as you can. My favorite has you stealthily sneaking past roaming robots with big bright lights for eyes, who will detect you if you enter their field of vision. There are 4 \"trips\" total, and each has its own skill tree just as the main game does. Other side stuff include: mini hacking challenges (usually leading to a reward), investigations (human trafficking, missing persons), playing chess or completing mini chess challenges, gang hideouts and more. There's always something to do. The best part of the online portion is the \"Souls\" inspired invasions where you hack or tail another player, or desperately try to avoid it.

{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"Convoluted story and mind blowing gameplay","reviewText":"For those who don't know, Hideo Kojima, the creator of the Metal Gear Solid (MGS) series, is one of the best if not the best game directors out there. With creation of each new Metal Gear Solid game he has pushed the gaming experience to never before achieved heights. Metal Gear Solid 4, his latest game, will take you through an experience that you will never forget. So what is so spectacular about this game?THE CHEMO-SUIT: As you know MGS series has been greatly about stealth. In this game, you get to use an awesome new suit that will take stealth to the next level. With this suit you can merge with surroundings in a way that will practically shock you. It is just impossible not to fall in love with this new gadget.VARIETY IN GAMEPLAY: While stealth is a major element, it is NOT REQUIRED through out the game. Should you like you can just go around shooting your enemy on the whim. Now this will make the game a bit more challenging, but the good thing is the game allows you to have a choice. In this sense MGS separates itself from other stealth game such as Splinter Cell where stealth is absolute.WEAPON CUSTOMIZATION: In this game not only you get to use a whole wide variety of weapons, but you can also customize them according to your likings. This truly adds to the gameplay experience and makes the campaign more involved.AMAZING STORY: The great thing about Kojima's MGS games is he will set them in the current conflicts occurring in the world and relates them with the stories of individual characters in the most detailed way possible. The best part is he is really good at connecting dots. So as you progress through the story, he will make you curious about many events and towards the end, he will connect them and answer you questions in most satisfactory manner possible.VARIETY IN ENEMIES: Yep, you will be facing a great different types of enemies in this game and taking down or passing through them will require you to use different strategies. This prevents the game from being redundant like most games these days.RIDICULOUS BOSS BATTLES: I truly want to tell you how awesome the boss battles are; however, I don't want to spoil anything for you, so you will just have to play the game.VARIETY OF AREAS/LEVELS: You will be traveling through war-torn cities, woods, snowy mountain base and many more awesome places. Again really don't want to spoil much.AMAZING CHARACTERS: Revolver Ocelot, Raiden, Snake, Big Mama and many more (PLUS TWO SURPRISE CHARACTERS THAT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND). All of these characters fit into story very well and good voice actors for them make the game very cinematic, almost like a movie.MAJOR SUSPENSE: Again don't want to spoil.DECENT MULTIPLAYER: While it was not necessary, this game has a decent multiplayer. You will probably not like it as much as some other games these days, but it will still keep you busy for months if you get into it.GREAT REPLAYABILITY: Other than multiplayer, you can play campaign over and over again to unlock many different badges and concur many different difficulties.So now that this title is GREATEST HITS and selling for so cheap, if you haven't played it already, YOU MUST CHECK IT OUT.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2010"}

{"product_name":"B002BRZ6UE","description":"","reviewerName":"The Bigmac","summary":"Best 3D Title ever, and one of the most gorgeous game I've ever seen.","reviewText":"I had pretty high expectations for this game and it totally surpassed them. First off, the game is just gorgeous. I'm playing it in 3D on a 55 inch Sony LED and the experience is totally immersive. You feel that you're there. I also played the campaign mode of Call of Duty Black ops in 3D and it was OK. But as soon as I fired Crysis 2 and you get the suit and the HUD display on your helmet is activated, I was speechless. The info displayed by the helmet feels like it's literally right there in front of you, floating in mid air, and you can almost touch it. And further in your field of vision, you see your weapon, crystal clear and when you aim down the sights, it's just perfect. I wish black ops looked this good in 3d. The only game that comes close to the 3d experience Crysis offers in killzone 3.As for the story, it reminded me a lot of the convoluted metal gear story lines, but I enjoy that kind of thing. I also though it was pretty cool that you get to absorb the very thing that makes your enemies powerful (a type of alien virus) and assimilate it in the suit making you, more powerful. The suit powers are awesome and the gun play is a blast.My favorite thing is popping headshots using the Ranged Scar. A scoped weapon that when you aim and look down the sights, specially in 3D, and you put that thin crosshairs from a distance on the heads of you enemies, makes you feel like the freaking weapon is actually in your hands.And I loved that they kept the Call of Duty control scheme intact. From minute 1, I was able to crouch, melee, shoot and evade baddies effortlessly, without even thinking, and without having to get used to a whole new control scheme. COD Is the most popular shooter on the planet whether you like it or not. I hate it when games like killzone try to go all rebel and different on you just for the sake of it and switch how crouching or aiming work unnecessarily, just to go against the mainstream. Playing FPS games is like driving. Why do some developers like to make me learn how to drive all over again just to play their game? I applaud you Crytek for designing the game with my enjoyment in mind.This is a AAA title and you owe it to yourself to enjoy this masterpiece. Buy it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2011"}

First off.. This game is awesome! Of course there are the routine additions of more animations to make the game look smoother but it's a lot more than that. The animations are amazing! The presentation is amazing! The new mode additions are great as well! I know you all see that \"fine print\" under the 2K13 \"Executive Produced by Jay-Z\". Well.... That was a great idea! Having Jay-Z pick the soundtrack (among helping with other things) was top notch. Great classic songs, new songs and in between. We Major by Kanye West is one of my all time favs and seeing that in the game made me want it even more. Any Hip Hop fan should be happy with this soundtrack. It's not all hip hop though, they did add some rock/pop songs. Just the hip hop is the most dominant genre.Along with the audio, the visuals are amazing as well. The menus, pre-game, halftime and post-game highlights all look great. A lot of people dont like the menu system but I dont have a problem with that. The graphics dont differentiate too much from the graphics of 2K12 but thats not a bad thing. What did change was the how much the animations add into the gameplay value. Everything looks smoother, making for a more realistic feel to the game. When the point gaurd brings the ball up court, they no longer just srpint up the court. They do things you would usually see an NBA point guard do. You hit a clutch 3 pointer.. Your player with celebrate by putting their hands up. Small additions like this make the game very authentic to an NBA game.The new modes are nice. Well... New mode. The MyTeam mode is pretty much the Ultimate Team mode from various EA Sports games. It's not as in depth as the competitor but it gets the job done for those wanting this mode in a basketball game. The other new \"mode\" is the create a shoe mode. You can actually create your own show and get NikeID to create it in real life. Great addition but it wasnt needed. Therefore just making it a nice plus. My Player and Association are still there and the My Player mode has added some things. I also think with these animation upgrades allowing smoother gameplay makes the My Player mode better overall. They even added Twitter updates which is done better than the Madden 13 Twitter updates imo. I havent gotten to play the Online mode and I usually dont. So I wont bother to mis-inform anyone about this but from friends I do hear that its more stable than previous games.One pro that I feel should definetely be noted about this game is the passing. Last years passing pissed me off to the max. Im not the best player at 2k and I can admit that, but not every 2 to 3 passes should be intercepted. Well in NBA 2K13 has made this better. This has made me very happy! Making the gameplay a lot quicker and smoother overall. Also, the game has a lot of customizations. From the pre-game routines, to the arena music. 2K13 is really letting you do a lot with the game. I know this review isnt too in depth or long but I just wanted to point out some of the better things about the game. I'll update as I notice things about the game. I'd most definetely give this game about a 9.5 and would recommend this game to any basketball fan.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2012"}

Yet, there are just some classics that don't even come close to die. That does come through the case with Nintendo. They started revamping their classics from the Super Nintendo, and the original NES game systems recently, to a whole new audience, and a little thanks to the Game Boy Advance game system. Since they began in the 80's the Mario Brothers video games have never died down for a not, although there have been a few minor flaws, the whole lifeline of the most influential character from a video game, has never taken the wrong step away from the public.Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Brothers 3, is a remake among the classic 1990 video game Nintendo released from its original NES game system. Through it all, it works extremely well, as Mario goes through 8 different worlds, with over 80 different courses and stages, to go head-tohead with the menacing Bowser and his kids, Morton, Lemmy, Larry, Ludwig, Roy, Wendy and Iggy. The games works very well, as a new introduction to a whole new audience, since 1993, when it was issued on the classic compilation, Super Mario All-Stars for the Super NES system. This works very well, but there is a downside. The feeling of using the e-reader device here, to unlock levels, and to pay an extra amount of cash for the e-reader, and the extra e-reader cards for access to new levels for Super Mario Bros. 3 is not a very good idea. Still, you can't help but enjoy the original.It is just a great video game, and still remains as addictive as it was released over a decade ago. If you have played it before on the Super NES, as a part of the game Super Mario All-Stars, or the original release of it on the original NES, get this game.

Elite Beat Agents follows the exploits of three black suit wearing secret agents on a rescue mission.  And the only way to find success with your mission: dance to the rhythm!  Now I know what your thinking, that this game is something for acquired tastes and isn't for everyone.  While this may be true in some respects, Elite Beat Agents is surprisingly easy to get into and pick up and play.  The bizarre but wonderfully drawn cut scenes help reel you into the gameplay, as the soundtrack features a whole laundry list of older and more recent pop songs that are sure to grate on your nerves at some point or the other, but they all feel at home here as you use your stylus to keep the rhythm going.  What's really surprising is that how addictive the gameplay becomes once you really get into it.  This is easily one of the best games stylus-use wise for the DS, totally making excellent use of the touch screen as well.  There's some unlockables as well to help keep your interest, however the only real downpoint of Elite Beat Agents is that at times the game can get too challenging for it's own good.  There will be frustrating times aplenty, but the good obviously outweighs the bad here.  Even if games like Dance, Dance Revolution (which is one of the most easily comparable games to this) aren't your thing, if you have a DS you should really give Elite Beat Agents a try, I think you'll be pleasently surprised.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2006"}

You get a variety of terrain types - deserty mountains, snowy slopes, sandy dunes, tropical paradises, and much more. There are numerous models to choose from - four by fours, buggies, SUV styles, and other styles you can unlock as you go. You get all the colors of the rainbow to paint your vehicle.The sound is reasonably good - what do you really care in a racing game? It's a collection of upbeat rock songs, along with the squeal-crash-wrrrrrr of the trucks racing.The fantastic fun here is the actual racing. No, this isn't high end technical Indy car tuning. This is out and out fun, the kind where you have friends over for the afternoon and laugh yourselves silly with the moves you are making. You can play against friends, play with friends, or play on your own to get the longest jump, the most impressive crash, or any other of a number of stats.That's because this game isn't just about who makes it to the finish line first. You have to gather up enough stars to win, too. Stars are earned by doing outrageous feats. Do a flip in the air, crash in an impressive manner, go for a long distance slide.The courses make this fun to play and replay. There is lava rolling down at you, boulders crashing, landscapes changing before your eyes. These aren't courses you master in one pass. There's always something new to learn if you keep your eyes open.The game is definitely family-friendly - grandparents can play with their grandkids and both would enjoy it.Is there a downside? You could argue that the same is too \"silly\" - but that's its purpose. It isn't meant to be a serious racing game. Maybe the trucks are a little too shiny, but I find it hard to object. I think my biggest complaint is that you can only have two trucks in multi-player, and it's just head-to-head. It'd be cool if you had more than 2 players, or 2 players in a regular field with computer-controlled enemies, or co-op modes on the real courses.Still, these are minor complaints. The game is quite fun.Well recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2007"}

Benoit","summary":"Fun but way overpriced.","reviewText":"I have confirmed that this game is so totally not worth its retail price tag ($49.99 last time I was at Best Buy, I think it might be about $5.00 cheaper on Amazon). I guess I'll start with the negatives because those are easier to remember.-There are only 30 songs total, as opposed to the previous games' 58 tracks. There are no unlockable tracks that you can buy in the store. You get the set 30 and that's it.-Way too many obscure songs. I recognized most of the bands, but some of the songs they chose from certain bands are most definitely not their recognizable hits. Even some of the encores (which are supposed to be the super secret awesome songs that everybody knows and loves) were disappointing. Who the heck is Limozeen, anyway?-While it's great that they got master tracks for The Warrior and I Wanna Rock (two of the better songs on the game), the master tracks on those songs fade out. Live bands don't fade out. It kind of killed my Rock Star mood when I discovered those two songs faded out. Surely they could have managed decent covers of those two songs with creative endings to compensate for the fade-out.-Speaking of covers, I understand that the original version of Ballroom Blitz by Sweet did not come out in the 80s, but trying to throw in a cover of a crappy cover by freakin' Krokus was lame. They should have just picked a different song.-The extras are limited. As I said, there are no extra songs to buy in the store. All the guitars you can buy in the store are the same as the guitars you can buy in GH3, as are all the skins for those guitars. The only other thing you can buy in the stores besides guitars and skins is an extra character, the Grim Ripper. There are no extra styles or outfits to buy for the characters. They have one 80s style, and that's it.-While the playable characters were altered into 80s style clothing and hair, the stock band members were not. They all look the same as the previous GH games.-The venues are not noticeably different. The only main change I noticed was that the venue that was the Vans Warped Tour in previous games changed to something called Rock for Safety, or something like that.-The gameplay seems easier, which makes the lower levels somewhat boring. The only song I didn't 5-star on the first try was Seventeen by Winger on Medium, and that was more because I was distracted by something rather than the difficulty of the song. Perhaps Hard will still be difficult enough for me, but the way things have gone so far, I wouldn't be surprised if I actually try to play Expert.-Lack of songs with female vocalists, which may just be a testament to the state of rock bands in the 80s (or ever). But still, if I'm remembering correctly there were only 3 songs out of the 30 that had female vocalists.Now for the positives. Yeah, this list will probably be shorter, but the game is still good overall. It's just overpriced.-It's still fun. It's Guitar Hero. It's addictive and fun, and there is really only one song I dislike enough to only play in order to advance through the levels--Krokus's cover of Ballroom Blitz. I don't mind the other songs at all and would be fine playing them multiple times if I needed to in order to get 5 stars.-The 80s styles for the characters are pretty fun. I like the Grim Ripper's 3-D glasses. :opOkay, yeah, definitely a short list. The game is definitely worth playing. It's just not worth buying for $50. I would suggest renting it or if you absolutely must own it, wait until you can find a really cheap used copy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2008"}

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone. To help you maximize the potential of this setup, two-player online and offline co-op modes ensure that you have options when picking a partner.Steel yourself Against the Harsh Reality of KijujuAn advanced version of Capcom's proprietary MT Framework game engine brings groundbreaking graphics and effects to Kijuju, the highly-developed environment where this game's action takes place. New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"smullins","summary":"mmmmm brains","reviewText":"I've just completed Resident Evil 5 for the first time, a little over 12 hours I think. The game was a lot of fun to play and very intense. Unfortunately, the game has gotten a lot of negative press and reviews. I personally liked most of what the game had to offer and think at time reviewers could be a little less critical of good titles.There are some facts that come in to play with RE 5.Fact #1: This is not a survival horror game, like RE 0, 1, 2 etc. Its more Action, but very intense action. I'm a huge fan of the RE series and I still enjoyed the Action slant.Fact #2: Not pausing the game for inventory makes playing intense. I hear a lot of people complaining about this feature. I don't know why. When you have hordes of enemies coming at you and you're low on health and need to reload all your guns and you don't know if you have a grenade or if your partner's got it - I guarantee your heart will be pounding. Not getting to pause the game and instantly heal yourself, arrange your inventory, reload all your weapons - it goes a long way to create an intense playing experience.I for one loved getting chased my chainsaw wielding zombies while trying to limp far enough away to find a grenade to chuck at them.Fact #3: Capcom isn't racist. The scene is Africa, there are both modern and what I'll call tribal Africans in the game that you have to kill, maim, run away from. So why exactly is that racist? You have the ability to stomp on fallen zombies...just like you have in just about every other RE game. I really think people need to take a step back and consider that we're talking about a zombie game. A game about killing infected zombies. The fact that RE 5 was plagued with negative press for racism just seems ignorant and trite.Overall, the game is great. There's nothing like killing zombies, even ones that can wield rocket launchers. I got really annoyed with my AI partner, but I have to have something to yell at so it might as well have been Sheva. The replay value is there, with lots of goodies to unlock, weapons to upgrade, scores to reach, etc. And of course there's trophies! This is a great looking game that has a nice feel and some good quality game play. The puzzles are pretty light so I'm going back through the first RE on gamecube to get my fix. After that I'll probably go through RE 5 again :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"J.S. Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"\"Day One\" Might Not Always Be the Best Idea...","reviewText":"After preordering months in advance and waiting in a (comparitively short) line to receive my Day One console, I got home, installed the mandatory update, and then promptly learned that my unit was one of the handful affected with a non-functioning disc-drive.  To say I was &#34;upset&#34; would be an understatement.I will say however that the issue was dealt with swiftly.  After returning to the all-popular retail chain I bought it from, they had a new console ready for me by 3pm the following Saturday.  I'm looking to see if a friend can't print &#34;Day Two 2013&#34; on my extra controller at a local &#34;tech shop&#34; in the area.So now that I've vented, I'm going to review the console itself.The Xbox One, sad to say, is a giant, black, plastic brick.  It isn't appealing, it isn't sexy, it certainly isn't slim or light-weight, and it isn't in the slightest bit pretty.  45% of the top of the unit consists of slanted fins for escaping heat.  This makes the unit awkward to carry and setup as the plastic is flimsy and weaker on an entire side of the unit.  Most of each side of the console is also dedicated to heat dissipation.  Of course, it's hard to blame Microsoft, as one can only presume that they're desperate to prevent the overheating issues of the previous console.  Some 360 consoles were known to literally melt the solder off their own circuit boards.The front of the console houses the disc drive (which for your sake we'll hope works on arrival) on the left, while the right side consists of a thin piece of plastic behind which lights the simple white Xbox logo.  This panel ends at the top of the console - where the heat vents begin - creating a sharp, ugly, &#34;Made in China&#34; gap at the most visual edge of the console.  Both the eject and power buttons respond to a light touch, while the controller-sync button sits around the left side of the unit, and emits an unusual &#34;tock&#34; noise when physically depressed.  This however appears only to be needed when the Kinect unit isn't attached.The controllers - though very similar in overall appearance and size to the 360 controllers, feel very different under dedicated use.  The upper shoulder buttons are harder on the corners then their predecessors.  In addition, they have a very short range of motion and require much more force to &#34;click&#34;.  They also seem to protrude out just slightly further than the 360 controller.  In general these changes make the use of these buttons simply more awkward than the 360's.  Another common complaint online has been the location of the central Xbox button.  This button used to sit directly between the &#34;start&#34; and &#34;select&#34; buttons (which still sit in nearly the same place but have new names and icons).  On the new controller however, this button sits much further away from the player (and their hands) and generally requires a significant shifting of the hands to reach.  Those who have used the Xbox button as a general pause button on the 360 will notice the inconvenient placement rather quickly.The new triggers however are quite nice - especially the integrated-and-independent rumble feature built into them.  Racing games like Forza presents a new experience altogether, with your finger tips more tuned-in to what's happening on the screen.  The response isn't exactly foretelling, however - you're not sure if the rumble at your finger means the tires are slipping, shuttering, bouncing, etc.  They're just... ...vibrating.The new Kinect - and the apps that tie in with it - are the real gem of the new Xbox One.  Telling the Xbox to turn itself on is neat...  ...even though you still have to turn on the controller and TV (the xbox is allegedly able to turn on the latter, though I have yet to make this work.)  The Kinect is remarkebly able to recognize faces and can even log players into their account if it is able to see a controller in their hands (done so with IR lights tucked into the front edge of the new controllers.)  Old apps like Skype and new ones like Upload allow players to chat and share game footage right out of the box.  Kinect can also read QR codes which are now being added to *some* xbox live code cards, allowing players to eschew the tedium that is typing in a 25-character code with a D-pad...  This by the way is why your Xbox One cost more than your neighbor's PS4.  He has to buy his camera separate.The menus of the Xbox take some serious getting used to.  The new &#34;Snap&#34; feature allows you to sacrifice some real estate on your TV and do things like watch movies, browse the web, etc...  For the small handful of us who've set-up our gaming rooms with dual TV's, this might not be of much use.  Functions for things like using Xbox Live codes and changing log-in preferences are annoyingly hard to find (why do I have to browse games to access the code-entry function??)  Also, apps like Skype and Upload Studio (letting you edit your recorded game clips) are not installed at the factory - most of the them will require a brief download before using.There's other annoyances along the way.  Upon inserting the Forza disc into my (second) unit, I had to wait some 10 minutes before it installed enough content to actually play the disc.  As a gamer with a &#34;flip-on-and-play&#34; pinball machine in his game room, this time-delay is maddingly frustrating.  Alas, this is what the current generation of games demand.  We must play along, or find solace in bouncing a rubber ball against a wooden paddle...I believe over time we'll see even more capability out of the Xbox.  I for one am beginning to get sucked in to the concept of a &#34;all-in-one&#34; form of entertainment.  Maybe I can pull up a TV show on the side while my wife watches yet another crime drama.  Maybe I can Skype with the Xbox instead of going through a dozen steps on my laptop.  Maybe I can boss the console around without having to be glued to the controller.Sell me another broken console however, Microsoft, and all bets are off...","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

My wife can't work all of our remotes, so being able to say &#34;Xbox On&#34; to turn everything on was a big bonus; however, it doesn't work.I have the Dish Network Hopper DVR and running it through the XBO made it not work right. At first it worked some, but I couldn't find any voice commands, or even XBO controller buttons, for watching recorded shows. There are commands for selecting live channels, but I almost never watch live TV. The pause and other controls shown at the bottom of the screen didn't have any effect. So the separate remotes are still needed.I was disappointed to find out that I couldn't use hand motions to control TV watching. The Guide, like so many other things, doesn't work without Live Gold.Since I had at first allowed the XBO to select the control code for the Hopper, I went back to Settings and entered &#34;Hopper&#34; as the model. The XBO accepted that, but then I couldn't get anything to play, so I just took,the Hopper off the XBO.Unless you don't already have a Blu-Ray player, I don't see the point of using the Xbox as one. Not only are the controls just not as efficient to use, if you want to pause, chances are your controller has timed out and you first have to click it back on.Other things which won't work without Gold include Skype and Internet Explorer. I can see withholding something like &#34;Fitness&#34; which is an actual pay product, but Skype and IE are free on my PC, so it seems greedy of MS to be charging for such basic items. As a disclaimer: I don't play online, so I don't have much need for Gold.For controlling the XBO menu screens, Kinect does not work very well for me. For example, some pages have a &#34;back&#34; arrow at the upper-left corner of the screen, But control of the hand icon is so rough on my system that I can rarely get the back arrow to work. In contrast, the jet ski game (played without a controller, just hands) works very well.I know that the video resolution and the controllers are supposed to be better on the XBO, but so far neither one has just blown me away with how much better they are.The only reason I'm rating this as high as 3 stars is on faith that eventually some of these problems will be fixed.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}

Players begin their adventure as an angel-like guardian. In order to achieve a heavenly design players are sent to the world of mortals to retrieve the magical fruits of a sacred tree. These fruit have the power to grant wishes, but are also perilous, containing the unexpected power to transform those who eat of them into monsters. Together with up to three friends players must battle those transformed beings, and in the process improve their angelic skills and regain the heavenly fruit in order to gain their heavenly reward.CustomizationPlayers can create their own heroes, deciding how they would like their face, hair and clothing to look. As the story unfolds, players become stronger, smarter and more powerful, and can create custom companions to join their group as well. Players will also have fun discovering more than 900 pieces of clothing, armor, weapons and other items that will provide them with a unique appearance and special abilities. Even occupations can be customized and changed at any time. Players can take on one of a dozen different jobs with varying strengths, weaknesses, spells and skills.BattleFast-paced turn-based battles unfold as players decide what to do and then view cinematic action scenes. This format rewards careful thinking and strategy over quick reflexes. The more foes players defeat, the stronger their characters become.

These treasure maps allow players to find otherwise inaccessible dungeons called grottoes featuring special boss monsters and even rare items.Social Play AspectsOne of the most enticing things aboutSentinels of the Starry Skiesare its many social aspects built into its gameplay.

Special multiplayer modes let players share their adventure with others, allowing up to four players to team up via a local wireless connection and experience the fun of tackling challenging monsters and dungeons cooperatively with their own characters. Players can even leave the game active in their backpacks, pockets or purses and still interact with other players via an interactive Tag Mode. In addition, information about players' characters can be wirelessly transmitted to others. Also the game contains treasure maps that allow players to find otherwise inaccessible special dungeons called grottoes, which can contain rare items or enemies. In Tag mode, treasure maps and customized greetings can be exchanged automatically by players who come within range of one another. Finally, players with wireless broadband Internet access can visit an online shop to find new items or download additional quests. The selection of items changes daily.

{"product_name":"B002I0JIQW","description":"","reviewerName":"aka TRAP","summary":"I feel like a kid again.","reviewText":"Let me start off by first saying that....I. HATE. PUZZLES!!!!  I HATE THEM SO MUCH!!!!  I'm the type of person that thinks puzzles were created by Satan.  Not because I can't solve them, but because I'm a very impatient person.  So why did I even give Portal a chance?Well, for one, the original game I was able to get free during a weekend deal on Steam, so I figured \"Why not?  It's free\".  It's not everyday I get something for free and would have gladly paid money for it.  Portal 1 is an amazingly fun game.  The puzzles are challenging (Test Chamber 17 took me a while....I'm kidding; I cheated...sue me), the writing is clever and hilarious, and should be enjoyed by anyone with a nerdy/weird/broad sense of humor, and was all-around a very-well developed game.THEN Portal 2 was released.Portal 2 was actually on shelves for almost a year before I decided to pick it up through Steam, but I would have been a complete fool to not have downloaded it for $7.50 when it went on sale this past Christmas.  I decided to wait 'til I got back to my college dorm since their internet is 10mbps and mine's only 30% of that, and it only took about an hour to download.  But considering how much I love this game, ALMOST any amount of time is worth waiting to play this title.Without spoiling too much of the story, the very beginning puts you in a random room where you're greeted by Wheatley, a robot with a British accent that only helps to make him even funnier.  Long story short, Wheatley was programmed to make poor decisions, but you'll realize right off the bat that he isn't exactly the brightest of the bunch when it comes to anything else.  The story is even better than the first and it fills up a few loose ends.The gameplay is even better than the first one.  Using an Xbox 360 controller (I run the game off my laptop) works almost as well as a keyboard/mouse combo.  I feel the latter is more accurate, obviously, but besides that I find very little difference between them.  I actually ran through the game using my controller.  But either way you decide to play the game, you're going to enjoy some very responsive controls, which you'll need to solve some of the puzzles.  The last game started you off pretty easy and took a while to pick up, but when it did, it got pretty difficult fairly quickly.  This time around, the game gives you a few levels to get you warmed up and used to the controls, then says, \"OK, off you go!\" and plummets you into the campaign you really bought the game for.  The puzzles are challenging, frustrating, and very rewarding once you figure them out.  Some of them are actually more simple than they look at first glance, requiring you to really take a step back and think about the smartest solution to the puzzle....of course, in Portal 2, there are multiple ways to solve a puzzle.So to sum up Portal 2 without spoiling anything, the game features amazing level designs that surpass the first one the same way the visuals, characters (old and new) and writing have.  It's truly an amazing game and I can't say that enough.  If you want a challenging game that's also hilarious (assuming you have a weird/broad/nerdy sense of humor) and a change of pace from what you're used to seeing on the market, I don't understand why you even wasted your time reading this review.  Seriously, stop reading it and go buy the game.  You've already wasted precious time that could've been spent enjoying Portal 2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2012"}

There is little plot to speak of, but the monsters have interesting designs and the attacks based on what weapons you have equipped are quite amusing.Where DMC really falls down is the camera.

I will tell you, not in opinion, but in truth, what the PlayStation 2 is like.It is capable of handling games that have graphics that would normally crash some(but not all) computers, it has two USB ports on which you can plug in a headset(Note: a USB Headset that was built for it), an EyeToy, and other stuff that was built for it, it uses the same controller that the PSone used, you can plug in a Network Adapter and and HDD, and it has backwards compatability(can play PSone games on it).The PlayStation 2 also has it's share of problems as well, like it's short life span, it won't last very long. It also sometimes won't play discs well or even not at all. It being a console with a short life span, you would hope that it has a good warranty, but it's only good for 90 days. It also still has only two controller ports while the Xbox and Gamecube have four, meaning if you want to play a four player game offline, you will have to spend extra money on more controllers and a Multitap.All in all, the PlayStation 2 will have a good chance at making you very happy.

They have ranged from brilliant to mediocre like this latest installment. So I'm sure you're wondering where this game went wrong. Well, before I get in to all of that I'll start with the few positives about this game. There is a part of the game where the player can witness a murder in reverse; the game's main character can walk into the scene of a movie while it's playing,  additionally the last boss is interesting in design and battle. It is unfortunate though that these positives are overshadowed by all of the bad.The game begins harmless enough with the game's title being displayed across the screen then the cheese factor begins when a series of lame screams are played over and over again. Seriously, who thought that was a good idea? When the player gets tired of listening to these annoyingly lame screams and hits the start button to spare their eardrums they will find that they are confronted with even more screams.  This isn't scary in any way, it's actually very irritating.Once the gameplay begins the player immediately encounters some incredibly jarring lagging.  Yes, it is noticeable enough and frequent enough to be distracting.The monster designs are also uninspired save for the last boss which deserves some measure of praise. The other monsters range from an unstoppable red void (yawn), two prisoner types, dolls, screamers (which are basically female zombies) wall corpses, and something called a weeping bat (yes, it's as ridiculous looking as the name implies).These things compounded with a dull storyline, lack of atmosphere, boring characters, poor soundtrack , and the main character screaming like a little girl all of the time (which seems like a strange thing to have a prisoner who's been incarcerated for several years do unless he's a punk which seems 90% likely).Also the over abundance of puzzles doesn't help this game it actually hurts it.  Most of the puzzles are so random they seemed to have been tossed in to increase the game's length. This randomness with the puzzles pulls one out of the experience and reminds the player that they are playing a game, a bad game.All of these unfortunate elements make this game not scary in the least which is an insult to the Silent Hill name and the survivor horror genre. I can only hope this game doesn't represent the future of Silent Hill or this fan will have to move on.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2012"}

Wipeout 2048 is the first racing game I've bought since Mario Kart Wii, and man is it awesome! You get to ride a huge selection of different futuristic racing 'cars' on beautifully crafted and exciting courses. The graphics are amazing and really made me feel like I was getting a taste of the future of hand-held gaming. There is no frame rate lag and beside the slow load screens there are not technical flaws that I've found so far. The racing is intense and gets increasingly difficult, I love how challenging the game is without being overly unfair like some racing games. The great techno music really gets you pumped and the combat missions especially get really crazy.If you've just bought a Vita you cannot go wrong with this title. It supports online multiplayer as well as ad-hoc play so try it with your friends. One warning if you're buying this used, it does require an online pass to use multiplayer and I'm not entirely sure if it's a one-use thing or not, so you may want to check before you buy it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00005UNWB","description":"The publishers ofGrand Theft Auto IIIare back with another game  geared towards a mature audience. But fans ofGTA IIIshould note that  whileState of Emergencycontains adult themes and extremely violent  gameplay, that's pretty much where the similarities end. WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number  of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode,  but it's strictly one player. In spite of these flaws, the game remains  addictive and fun. It bears repeating that gamers looking for anotherGTA  IIIwill not find it here: this game provides an arcadelike experience  that's excellent, but in a very different way.

Do not expect SoE to play like GTA3. SoE is abeat'em'up game in the likes of Fighting Force(PSX) andDouble Dragon(NES/SNES) while GTA3 is mision basedaction game in the likes of Driver(multiplatform),Wreckless(XboX).SoE is the type of game that you will either loveor you will hate. Thats why I put it on 3 stars,for me its around 4 stars.There are two ways of playing this game. Kaos and Revolution.In revolution mode missions are you main agenda, weaponsyou get here are either given to you or you get from an enemy. Missionstypes are basic: kill someone get this, steal this from store,kill someone, blow this up etc etc.. of course you will finda lot of resistance along the way. There is this 3D arrowto guide you to your objective so you won't get lost.In Kaos mode you basically try to get the highest score possibleby causing trouble and in this mode weapons are just lying on thefloor almost everywhere, they also re-pop by themselves but itis different everytime they re-pop. You get points killing governmentenforcers and gang members as well as blowing up cars, breaking windowsbut of course there is a time limit. Every time you kill they will drop a healthand time replenisher so make sure you get em. On the upper right corner youwill see a \"bonus\", it changes all the time, it will say \"x2 Kill gangmembers\" or \"x5 breaking windows\" meaning if you do that youwill get times whatever the normal points are. The higher your pointsare meaner you opponents are (first agents then military guys andit goes on and on). This is why I liked this game, revolutionis just a bonus.All in all a well made beat em up game, seriously don'texpect it to be GTA3, yes both was published by Rockstar gamesbut they both had different developers.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2002"}

I been a fan of Battlefield series since Battlefield 1942. When EA announce Battlefield Bad company 1 and later 2 I wasn't excited much of it but did play them. To have Buildings Crumple to the ground made my mine up and bought them. Battlefield 3 was announce and heard they going to bring a Frostbite 2 engine and will have destruction I said \"first day buy\". leading to the release I couldn't wait. Once the game was release and I had the game in my hands. Once i Started the game I tried the story mode first. Sadly didn't finish it. Story mode wasn't as interested as what I thought. Well my friends also bought the game and we started playing online. Now online is the best part of this game. Like any other FPS this is the mode you will be playing the most and also similar to any other shooters. Battlefield 3 multiplayer is different to what other shooters are. In like other Shooters u run and gun battlefield is different. The Maps are bigger, there is vehicles(tanks, jeeps, Jets, helicopters, etc), and Buildings are destructible. All of this changes the game. By having to fight on air, land, and sometimes water your every move counts. the Weapons in battlefield range from 4 different classes, which is Assault, Engineer, Support and Recon. As you use this classes you unlock new weapons and as you level up you unlock weapons and camouflage. Battlefield is also connected to a website called Battlelog in where you could go and check all you Stats, unlocks, awards etc. You could also add friend and use it as a social website. At the end Battlefield as been one of the most played game for me this generation and will be playing it for months to come and maybe years. With new DLC coming out Battlefield will still be alive and bringing new players to play the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2012"}

The first thing you'll notice about the game are the spectacularly stylized graphics and presentation.  The black and white look of the game helps it achieve a brilliant look, and the game's art style is simply jaw-dropping.  They may not be the most technically proficient graphics you'll find on a console game, but it's the game's awesomely stylish animation that makes it look like a comic book come to life.  The violent and bloody action also leaves a lasting impression, but it's MadWorld's gameplay that is truly rewarding, which is an achievement in itself considering that the game at its heart is a pure beat 'em up.  That being said, there are some repetitive moments, but MadWorld offers up some epic boss battles, a great soundtrack, and plenty of fun.  The only downside of MadWorld is that it's Normal difficulty mode is short to play through, but there is a ridiculous Hard mode that is definitely worth playing once you beat it, and the two-player split-screen mode challenges are a blast.  All in all, MadWorld is a just plain awesome game that each and every Wii owner should own, and is an excellent example of just how wrong those are that think the Wii is a console that's just for kids.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2009"}

But in regards to linear storylines like Final Fantasy XIII or \"Good or Bad\" of Mass Effect 2, Heavy Rain is different in that is wants to make a storyline that constantly evolves where not everything will bring about the obvious results and there will be consequences for every action you make. While at times choice can come down to simply \"you either saw this or you didn't\", Quantic Dream loves to tell entirely story-driven games with quicktime events mainly and of course this can cause divisive opinions: a game that plays itself or a unique way to tell a story without having difficulty curves, hard bosses or combo systems. With dark subject matter, sex and nudity, violence and a film-noir tone not to mention a huge amount of hype, can Heavy Rain reach a wider audience than say, God of War 3? Hope it does since it'd be cool to see more of these kind of games. Game isn't flawless though and I kind of wish it was considering how well it does everything else.Story: My god the story, easily the best thing about the game. Great characters, way better directed than Indigo Prophecy (camera angle wise) and those of you who love murder mysteries will love this. Basically the story is about the Origami Killer, a serial killer whose MO involves kidnapping young boys who are then found roughly 3-4 days later with an orchid on their chest and an origami in their hand. You play as 4 characters, Ethan Mars, Madison Paige, Scott Shelby and Norman Jayden who all have their reasons for going after the Origami Killer. But depending on your actions, not everyone will live but you'll uncover more of the story if everyone's living so do your best to keep them alive.Graphics: Indigo Prophecy even on a PC had a weird grainy quality, graphics looked slightly fuzzy but it looked well enough. Well ho.lee.crap did Quantic Dream take a leap forward with Heavy Rain. Aside from the \"uncanny valley\" quality, the game quite frankly looks stunning and there's so much attention to detail especially in the sets that it seems they spent so much attention to make these places look like actual places and that can also apply to the characters such as the loading screens and even smaller touches such as the water dripping off a body after taking a shower and of course rain is constant outside which also has a great look. One weird minor thing was that a lower brightness made a really David Fincher-esque lighting where it looked incredibly moody yet it was hard to see yet higher brightness made everything looked even more awesome but lost the lighting atmosphere low brightness did. But that's me.Sound/Music: Also really pleasant is the music which can be haunting and almost tranquil with piano but then it can get really intense which really makes the more action-y set pieces even more energetic. But where it's going to divide people is in the voice acting which doesn't quite have the same quality the storyline demands. The voice actors can range from really well-done (Norman Jayden might be your new favorite character) whereas other characters kind of have a weird flat tone, almost as if what they say is disconnected from where they actually are. These are mainly found in the \"L2 choices\" where holding L2 brings up a list of things your character can think which at times can just not sound right. But there's a huge number of voice actors so you're going to see a whole range of good to great character voices.Gameplay: In one way, I can describe Heavy Rain as a hardcore gamer that casuals can play. While this isn't as banal or empty as most casual titles, you don't necessarily have to be a frequent gamer to play Heavy Rain. The bulk of the game is QTE-driven where you either do an analog motion with your right analog a la God of War, face buttons, Sixaxis movements or your shoulder buttons. For example, getting up out of bed might be Up, drying yourself off after a shower will require some controller shaking or using your hands can be shoulder buttons. Where it can get tricky is using a lot of these at a given time. For example, in one scene you have to tend to a baby in which you lift baby up with R1 and work on the diaper with the analog while still holding R1 and that doesn't even include some of the more complex uses. But they're a vast improvement over Indigo Prophecy where a Simon-Says type display was on screen and you had to use your analog sticks in a certain direction or your mouse which usually resulted in confusion as to which side required what action.The other part to Heavy Rain and unlike the quicktime events, something that wasn't fixed is the walking controls. Here you hold down R2 which makes you walk forward while the left analog controls the direction. For any who have played old school Resident Evil will find it's somewhat similar in that one button moves character forward while you steer but where it gets unwieldy is trying to navigate the environment only for your character to re-enter a room because you didn't properly steer them towards the other door. Be prepared for a lot of turning and re-turning in a specific spot trying to get the QTE prompt to show up. Also one thing people may not like is that there's no run. You walk the entire game in these scenes and unlike Indigo Prophecy where environments were at least a bit open, there's not a whole lot of room in this game to run anyway but to walk so slowly to where you need to go only for cutscene to activate and have character sprinting seems odd.One thing that I do like about the story (just to re-visit that for a minute) is that your decisions will not always bring about the most obvious outcome. Mass Effect 2 had a problem with this where regardless if a character was completely mean and anti-you, having a paragon choice completely turned a character around and he just walked away from you. One scene in Heavy Rain, there's a scene where as the detective Shelby, you're trying to get information from a prostitute about her son who was one of the Origami Killer's victims. One dialogue option makes Shelby be very tactless and very blunt about her indifferent attitude and she decides yeah, you're right, you do got a point and decides to open up. Another scene you decide to get on a convenience store clerk's good side but he throws it right in your face and completely calls you out on your BS which can result in not getting anywhere. This can set up added pressure where characters can be affected by the littlest things or biggest things. My only complaint is that this doesn't mean the game will wildly deviate with your choices. Like in the above convenience store example, a robber comes in intent on getting some cash. This can result in one of 3 scenarios: you sneak up on him and knock him out, you get caught only to then knock him out or convince him to leave the store. I did the last 2 and I still got the same result but in certain other scenarios you can do actions that will completely change the ending.How appropriate it is that Heavy Rain comes out within a month of the looooong yet linear Final Fantasy XIII and the short but linear God of War 3. Seems like a big month for the Playstation 3 and unlike those other 2 where you can be into that style or not, I'll wholeheartedly recommend Heavy Rain not only because you don't often play this type of game much but also because it helps support the whole \"sequelitis\" thing going on that lets unique games that become successful potentially inspires them to try new things too. But really you can be into this game by surprise or just not find it your style but definately play it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2010"}

I can hit him, but nothing I do seems to do much of anything.I am not the greatest gamer out there, but I can typically get through any game on at least normal difficulty with relative ease. This game started on normal and I had to dumb it all the way down to easy just to get to where I am not. It's frustrating and going to be a difficult game for me to get myself back into to finish.The achievements don't seem that difficult for the most part (some grinding required), but if I'm having this much trouble at 5% completion, I can't imagine what the end is going to be like. The issue isn't so much the difficulty. The issue is a lack of guidance to know whether or not you're doing the right thing to begin with.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2013"}

{"product_name":"B006YDPU48","description":"","reviewerName":"geertmatthys","summary":"a phantom of the original","reviewText":"Starts poor & never really finds it stride. (I have only played 10 hours, so maybe the stride kicks in after Fallen Giants) Not all that surprising, trying to copy&paste; one of the most intricately balanced games ever. And number 1 had its woes to begin with.GRAPHICS: Fraud, not as advertized, textures cartoonish, walls, boulders look bland, tons of artificial light that hurts eyes, framerate low 20's FPS & often choppy, character does not look better. It's basically DS with clothes physics & no atmosphere. Looks pretty bad.GAMEPLAY: they delayed time you can raise shield, parry-ing is pretty much gone now with equal delay, backstab removed due to minuscule window, you stagger for full 2 secs when hit with arrow or shield broken, all these tweeks are massive failures implemented to take control away from player & force cheap deaths on him. It's also implemented to 'balance' the multiplayer so kids can spam R1. I've done nothing then hack&slash; and lunging L2 jump attacks in this game so far.LEVELING: at a ***** in Manjula, not at bonfire, you have to sit through loading screen & listen to her crap.HEALING: the perfect Estus-system is gone, combo Estus and 'purchaseble' items now, also massive delay when using so more cheap deaths and more grinding required.ITEMS & SPELLS: I'm not finding crap, still running around with starters kit and Broadsword. Vendors and talking cats sell stuff you were so happy to find in Dark Souls like Evil Eye and Eagle Shield (now Dragon-something Shield) for a grind-amount of souls. I'd rather find it for free.CLASSES: in DS, you could do as you pleased around Firelink, here, you're gonna be stuck with your choice a lot longer. It sucks. I advise Knight, he looks least like moron.STORY: You have to make it to final boss and kill him. 4 sure.MULTIPLAYER: Seems to not work, I've only had 2 duels. Servers oversaturated perhaps? Or maybe it's not worth investing in dying console. Probably bothHUMAN FORM: Not as advertized, you'll still be rotting corpse entire game thus no co-op for you. You need Effigies instead of Humanities now. They're rare so I'm a zombie at half health. Another cheap trick to make players die more, make 'em perma-cursed in zombie form.CONCLUSION:Needs major patches to become half as good as originalUPDATE: bull**** at Lost Bastille, game definitely ends here, 3 Ruin Sentinels and 5 gargoyles at once with beginners gear and spells. Sure. Why not 6 and 12. Clearly Fromsoft crossed a line here, the human treshold 4 error is no longer there. So I advise to certainly not buying this junk, as you won't be able to continue at this point. At least some good comes off crap like this, I'm back out jogging and reading books. Hurry up Arkham knight!!!UPDATED UPDATE: The game gets progressively worse, every boss is either a mob of enemies to cheese by, or a roll- 1-hit-roll pony, so far i've killed a group of rats, a group of skeletons, a group of spiders; a quelaag-scorpion, a group of church-goers, a chariot gimmick pattern boss and a medusa. The creativity is very poor here, all these bosses seem to just be there to be done with, no awe-inspiring high reward fights at all.The story is just not there, we were told it would become clearer then the first game, but every environment is just random and bland. You go from a pirate ship to a cave of spiders to a cave of poison. It sounds exciting but it really isn't, complete nonsensical and detrimental to the lore is more like. Leveling is now an absolute impossibility, at lv 145 it pretty much ends. I want to reach lv 200 for all round build but it's not like it matters, 'cause EVERY WEAPON, EVERY SPELL IS JUNK. You might as well keep playing with a broken straight sword, everything takes forever to swing and is completely powerless, impossible to upgrade unless you want to fool around in NG+500, a dex build or a strenght build or a sorceror...all futile puny weapons and spells...it's just programmed for you to die and grapple with controls, mashing buttons while the char doesn't respond. I'm trying to grind out some levels co-op, but half the time it doesn't work. Been sitting here in Copse for hour afraid to move and no-one summons or i can't use my soapstone. The human effigy thing is ridiculous. People can't co-op or summon help or PvP because there is soo little of it, it's an absolute disgrace. A poor guy wasted probably his last 3 fighting the chariot with me, but he didn't know what to do.I also tried some duels but it is shambles, no-one can play because controls too slow and everyone out of stamina and staggering instantly. I only see R1-spam and Pyromancy-use, which as usual is OP and scrubby. i just roll dance around 'till i get dizzy and disconnect. Boring and worthless PvP. i'm gonna finish this stupid game, see if that king has something to say...he'll probably just go \"h&eacute; h&eacute; h&eacute;\" after some crap dialogue.VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION: HACKERS 100% CONFIRMED, fought 2 at Blood Covenant , files are out there. Hit detection is complete joke . The game goes back to store here for me. Strongly advise to play DS and forget about this fiasco game.CALIBRATION 1.06 UPDATE: In case you don't know what this games focus is: Making you die. All decent weapons and spells nerfed. Nothing more rewarding then upgrading a weapon and having an enemy kill you because there is always a sliver of his health left. Notice how npc's have different stamina consumption rules then you. If being a stooge and dying through underpoweredness is your thing, go ahead.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2014"}

Gameplay is broken down into missions,  each with objectives that must be unerringly completed before  progressing to the next mission. This is not your typical kill-anything-that-moves  game: putting a bullet in the wrong person, not keeping the  right one alive, or perforating a seemingly unimportant inanimate object  can often result in mission failure.WhilePerfect Dark's solo missions play out much like those inGoldenEye 007, the game's fantastic multiplayer options are  another matter entirely. Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy.

Do not buy this game if you are expecting a TRUE SEQUEL.The biggest disappointment is the lack of aerial fighting. It is very few and far between... and when you do start an aerial sequence it is too easy and very short lived. The planetary level is filled with puzzles and gimmics to advance to the next area. Many times you must visit previous levels to advance. Some of the puzzles are extremely aggrivating, even after the (attempt at giving) advice by your co-pilot. Many times I was stuck for 15-20 minutes just trying to figure out what I had to do next. Eventually I had to do an internet search for a walkthru which is annoying in itself.The fights with bad guys are overly simple... and like the aerial fighting... very few and far between.It took me about 48 hours playing time to complete this game... 90% of that time was filled with frustration.

First Person Shooter but a small selection of weapons.  You have the ability to carry med packs to regain a certain amount of health and pain pills to give that extra boost to get you to the safe house.  The grafix are not the gratest but the fun and replayability is awesome.  It doesnt matter what edition of the game you get becuase the contect that the Game of the Year has can be downloaded for free.  Since the news of Left 4 Dead 2, their have been several petions that Left 4 Dead 2 should not come out since it has only been a year.Single player:  Their are 4 missions and the object of the game is to get from point A to B to C to D and then E.  Every point their is a safe house where the zombies cannot get you.  In their their will be weapons, ammo and health to fix yourself up.  You then open the door and start heading to the next safe house until you get to the extraxtion point.  Then its mission over and thier is only 4 missions all together.  The Bots are not that smart and you should not play with them on the hardest setting.With the free download of survival, its like Gears 2 Horde mode or Halo ODST FireFight.  Wave after wave of zombies come at you while you kill them.  And their is also more DLC on the way.Multiplayer:  Its 4 vs. 4 to play on the campain maps.  You start as who ever you want to start as (Infected or survivor) and play through the regular campain but you which sides once the surviors get to the safe house.  When you play as the infected, its rendom so you cant pick who you want to be like smoker, hunter boomer or tank.  Each one has its advantages and disadvantages so you have to work as a team no matter which team your on.If you have not played this game yet then you need to play it.

Now, my research has led me to a similar incident in Vice City back in the 1980's, though on a much larger scale.Tommy Vercetti came to Vice City with nothing and ended up with everything. Whether he still controls Vice City to this day, I have no knowledge. I have read through the files concerning this, most notably the rise and fall of the old rule, the corruption of politicians, back end deals, explosions, and sheer chaos which forced the Vice City Police, FBI, and Army to seek Federal funds to restore order.Status: Case ClosedGrand Theft Auto 4 or Vice City, is an enormous game jam packed to the hilt with everything the PS2 is capable of doing. You take over the show as Tommy Vercetti (Ray Liotta) and wreak havoc in this place. there's no other way to describe it. Here's a few interesting points:1. You can buy mansions, strib clubs (and hang around for a couple of drinks if you want just to watch the show), dance clubs, taxi services, ice cream factories.2. The malls are large and explorable - to some extent.3. Mr. Vercetti, the business owner, wears a sharp suit or a casual suit. Tommy Vercetti, the street punk (one in the same)wears jeans and a weird tropical shirt.4. More weapons than the military5. More of everything -hey, this is set in the age of excess right?6. Take a street girl for a ride or pimp if you want.7. Motorcycles, boats, your own Helicopter, almost 200 vehicles, RC planes (used for certain missions -interesting)You can still do unique stunts but you also get to pop wheelies (in a car with two wheels on the ground) strut your stuff on a motorcycle or off road dirt bike.8. Work deals and once you start owning things, the city owes you. Create protection programs which generate cash and have your clubs make you rich...well, if you need some pocket money, there's plenty of unsuspecting citizens who fall down and give you cash. Heck, do an ODD job and get some more dough.9. Cast of celebrities doing voice-overs - Burt Reynolds, Jenna Jameson, and of course -Ray Liotta...Mr. Goodfellas. Plus a few more.The graphics are pretty decent and the controls are exceptional. You can't go into all the buildings, but there's quite a lot to visit. I could rattle on and on about this title because there's so much involved in the game and different ways to play it that I could write a hundred pages. To be honest, the first few dealings in Vice City are a little boring, but then it steam rolls you into power, control, corruption, backstabbing \"friends\" and sheer ruthless chaos that it leaves the first few missions behind.Watch out for one thing...or maybe this is a few things, but who cares. The police are not as simple in intelligence as they were in GTA3 - not knocking GTA3, just a fact. Your wanted rating is of prime importance to you. Here's a little info:Wanted rating:1 Regular Cops come after you, but you can shake them.2 Regular Cops become a relentless pursuer.3 Undercover Vice Cops join in plus a helicopter.4 Just like 3, only more intense5 Here come the FBI6 The Army, tanks, FBI, Vice, and every other law enforcement in reach is after you. And these guys don't give up (nor do the citizens performing \"Citizen Arrests.\"Rainy weather, hurricanes, slippery roads, half-nude women...and so forth.

The use of real actors for the main characters raises this game to a whole new level. It's excellently done (great acting and real drama)!

The missions and side &quot;jobs&quot; are really fun and tie into the whole theme seamlessly. There is something for everyone, with all kinds of levels of play and difficulty. And the premise of being able to explore at will in the city, just as one would in a real live setting, is delightful for us explorative types. This game is a must have, if any game is. Definitely a game for ADULTS ONLY, however. Even just walking aimlessly around the city and randomly bumbing into &quot;people&quot; will generate &quot;mature&quot; dialogue.

However, none of these games have been so good as the Batman series. There were a few that were flawed but most gave the player an immersive experience and that was no truer than Arkham series. Starting off with Arkham Asylum you were put in the role of Bruce Wayne trying to stop the Joker. Arkham City was another excellent entry in the series giving you a huge environment to explore. Now the third game in the series called Batman: Arkham Origins has made its way onto consoles but is this a game you should experience?Arkham Origins is a prequel taking place five years before the events unfold in Arkham Asylum. Set in a wintery Gotham the caped crusader has only been fighting crime for only two years. The police department has no idea whether or not it is a masked vigilante or some urban myth created by people on the street. On a very blustery Christmas eve Batman is being hunted down by eight killers who want to claim the bounty set on his head. The 50 million dollar bounty put in place by a figure only known as the Black Mask wants him dead. While taking care of the black mask's minions you will run into familiar faces such as the Joker and Penguin.Gameplay is similar to the first two games as you can take your opponents on in one of two ways. You can use stealth to your advantage as you can glide , grapple and sneak around the map to take your targets out quickly and quietly. You can also go in using a variety of gadgets at your disposal such as the batarang, explosive gel and smoke pellets. When you need to travel to a new location you can call upon the batwing to give you a much needed lift instead of going there on foot.Also included in this game for the first time is a multiplayer mode.  One of the modes is \"Invisible Predator Online\" in which you can choose from one of three sides. You can choose to play on the side of batman and robin or the gangs of Joker and Bane. The gangs get points by killing off each others reinforcements while batman and robin gain points by intimidating the gang members. Earn enough points and you can play either as Bane or the Joker.With a rich storyline, great voice acting and multiplayer modes it's clear that if you loved the first two games you need to pick this one up.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2013"}

The game has brilliant, fun stealth gameplay, mixed with shootouts and very tense horror. And when you get a chance to take a breath, you are rewarded with the best story telling to date in a video game. The game doesn't hold your hand all the way, there will; be difficult parts for you to get by, and you will feel a great sense of accomplishment getting through these areas alive. You will have to outsmart intelligent enemies, you will use your wits and your firepower equally.After you get through the brilliant single player, you may want to check out the multiplayer, which is ridiculously addictive and enjoyable in it's own right. You will choose which faction you want to be a part of, then you will have the task of building a clan of your own survivors you gain through completing objectives and doing well in matches. Let me tell you this is one of my all time favorite multiplayers I have ever played, it is not as fast as some games, but there is so much strategy involved. There is a slight learning curve to understand what's going on and what you need to do to survive matches, like collecting supplies and making equipment to use. You will find what works best for your style, and you will become part of a true team in these matches, instead of just running around by yourself mindlessly shooting, like in many other games.I can't say enough for this game, it is a marvelous experience and well worth the price of admission, it is my favorite game I have played this gen. I feel a true tragedy is that more people haven't played it, a game like this doesn't come around very often at all, and if you have the chance to get your hands on it, make sure you do!

Why is the story in the future?  Who was the original guy?  And how do you catch Deadly Scribbles?Who cares.  The game sure doesn't.  All you do is run around, jump about, slash at frog monsters made out of glowing ashes (and the occasional knight made of the same glowing ashes), and dig in the ground.  Sometimes it's a third-person brawler and sometimes it's a side-scrolling platformer and every once in a while the game's a shmup.  But mostly it's an excavation simulator, as if one of the developers was a repressed archaeologist.  Oh, will you ever dig in the ground.  Dig dig dig dig dig dig dig dig dig.  And then dig some more.  Because everyone in town's paying you to run around and dig things up instead of curing the Deadly Scribbles.Then the man finds a talking book named Grimoire Weiss that provides sensible, smartass commentary to the events of the game.  For example, when you're searching for a woman who's been missing for a week, Weiss points out there's no way she fought past all these monsters and is just camping out.  Spoiler!  Weiss is right: the woman, when found, is a corpse.Cool, right?  I mean, that's what we're all thinking already isn't it?  Haven't 25 years of modern games taught us that people gone from their homes more than two days are generally dead?  (See \"Persona 4\" for an even better example.)  Plus there's some chick in lingerie who cusses a lot, but she runs away and before you find her again, you're sent to go fishing.And that's where the game ends.  Seriously.  You're told what to catch and are handed a fishing pole and a lure.  Then you spend a few hours trying to decipher the controls and read GameFAQS and catch a lot of aquatic plants and rusty buckets and sometimes a sardine if you use bait but never the fish you need to advance the plot.Never.When you get to the heart of it, the last boss of the game is the Ocean.

Paslay","summary":"Should have been packed in with the system.","reviewText":"I bought this game at launch because one of the retailers was having a buy-one-get-one-half-off sale. Even after paying only $15 for this game I felt ripped off.Graphically the game is lacking. I understand it's a launch title but the design of the whole thing was so sterile and lackluster it's not even worth looking at. The 3D was well done, especially with the airplane. The inclusions of Miis was a disappointment to me. I know that this is an area where it's personal preference, but the Miis need an overhaul. They are so generic at this point, I really wish they would've updated them to be more detailed for the 3DS. The inclusion of your Mii in this game makes already dull scenery even worse.The controls are well done. Each type of aircraft has its own feel and controls are responsive and well mapped out.Gameplay is fun for about half an hour. Woohoo island is WAY too small and only helps the game lose its appeal faster. You can only fly around the same tiny island so many times before you're ready to take out the cartridge and put it back in the case. The meat of the game involves challenges with the different aircraft. Time trials, perfect landings and obstacle courses are what the bulk of the challenges consist of. Again, these are fun at first but with the size of the island and repetition involved it really fails to keep your attention.All in all, this is a free tech demo or a five dollar eShop purchase at best. Don't waste your time or money. I quickly sold my copy while I could still get premium for it and think I at least made my fifteen bucks back. With the library the 3DS is starting to amass, there are too many promising titles out there to even give this game a second glance.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2012"}

At that price I felt it was a worthwhile investment.Not only can we play games on it but also it acts as another DVD player and gives us our first Blu Ray player.  We can download game demos, movie trailers, and other things as well.  It even has limited community socilization features which is a nice touch.A few of the things we really like about the PS3 are the controllers which do not need batteries, they are wireless and you simply charge them.  They fit great in your hands and are pretty lightweight.It comes with WiFi as well which allowed us to connect online to our router with ease as our main TV room does not have an internet connection.  The connection it gets is solid and we have not seen any issues there at all.FREE to play online.  No issues here and I love that I am not having to pay an extra fee every month to go online.The menu system is very easy to use and straight forward.  I like that fact that you can be playing a game and still get to the menu without having to exit the game.A kool feature we recently found was an option for a smart turn off of the PS3.  So when I started to download a bunch of demos before going to bed, I simply told the PS3 to turn itself off after it was done.No heating issues at all.  Runs silent and cool even after playing all night.The Tech side I have read that the PS3 is only using a small fraction of what it is capable of, so in a sense the PS3 will go the distance and still provide a great console over the long haul.Overall just a great investment.

Garrelts","summary":"King of the Iron Fist","reviewText":"I've been playing Tekken games since my high school days. Back then, small arcade shops were still scattered about local malls and you could routinely find a small gathering of gamers clustered around the latest game-cabinet. From the moment I first played Tekken I was hooked; the controls for each limb were intuitive, the polygonal graphics impressive, and the gameplay tighter than Sega's Virtua Fighter. I dropped many a quarter into Tekken arcade cabinets in those days.Since then I've followed the Tekken series closely and have owned every Tekken on PlayStation consoles. That brings us to present day and Tekken 6. First, Namco-Bandai, the developer, is classifying T6 as a, \"RPG/Fighting Game\". That should tell you where Namco is taking Tekken. The ill-conceived \"Tekken Force\" game that initially appeared in Tekken 3 with variations in Tekken 4 and 5 is now \"Scenario Mode\" in Tekken 6 and is more prevalent than ever before. In fact, in order to unlock each of the fighter's prologues and ending cinematic-sequences you'll have to at least try Scenario Mode in order to unlock the \"Arena\".The same complaints that many Tekken fans have had since Tekken Force initially debuted are still plaguing Scenario Mode. Mainly, the camera and controls are horrible. The player has zero control over the camera and often times you'll find yourself cornered by enemies and the camera positioned poorly. Thanks to the ever-rotating camera, controls will switch on the fly. Each level of Scenario Mode will unlock a bit of the Tekken 6 storyline presented as either a dialogue sequence between your character and your partner Alysia, a journal entry or animated sequence. The story is a contrived mess that is mostly forgettable to all but the most hardcore Tekken fans. In short, Scenario Mode is a frustrating mess but one that you'll be compelled to suffer through because of the items you'll receive that are used to customize your character.Traditional game modes such as, Survival, Team, Arcade, and Online modes are present and intact thankfully. The online mode is for the most part enjoyable although the occasional hiccup in the form of lag is present.Graphics in Tekken 6 are a mixed bag. While not as sharp as you'd expect for the PS3, I suspect that Namco sacrificed overall quality for a better framerate. In fact, T6 runs at 60fps and features a real-time motion-blur system that is truly impressive. One glaring problem with the game, however, is the frequent loading screens. Every bit of the game requires a loading screen and it gets aggravating. Games like Uncharted have proven that careful, managed on the fly loading is possible on the PS3. It's as if Namco didn't even try. At least PS3 owners have the option to install Tekken 6 to the system hard-drive, which cuts down on load times significantly.It's sad to see Namco and former top-tier, flagship games such as Tekken and Ridge Racer fall to the waysides. While Tekken 6 is a decent fighter here's hoping that Namco refocuses on the meat of the fighting aspect rather than gimmicky add-ons like Scenario Mode in future Tekken games.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2011"}

Brawl.","reviewText":"When I was a kid, there was this game called Super Smash Bros. for the Nintendo 64. The premise was basically an off-beat fighting game pitting various Nintendo characters against each other on floating stages. The point was to beat the crap out of your opponents and sent them flying off the stages to their certain doom. It was kind of a wacky concept, and even at that age we realized it was a shameless form of fan service on the part of Nintendo. But the simple yet visceral control scheme provided a surprising amount of depth, and each character and stage varied so heavily as to make each match feel completely different from the last one played. Sure, it wasn't the greatest game, but we didn't care! We were having too much fun at the time and those sorts of things didn't cross our minds.A few years later came the Gamecube, and with it, came the release of the much awaited sequel: Super Smash Bros. Melee. The graphics were incredible for the time, and the roster of characters and stages were exponentially greater than its precursor. There were a slew of new game modes and options. Gameplay in this iteration was greatly sped up and the controls were given much more depth and fine tuning. It was an even greater success than the first.But there were a few issues that became evident with Melee. Action was too fast for its own good, although purists may disagree, the game suffered from hyper-responsive gameplay. Players found ways to exploit the game engine, making the game even more twitch-based. Another issue was that many characters on the rosters were \"clones\" of other characters, meaning they had the same move-set with slight tweaks, effectively making it seem like there was more variety in the roster than there actually was.Now we have Super Smash Brothers Brawl for the Wii. I am pleased to say, it has reached and exceeded all of my expectations.The basics are still the same, pick a Nintendo mascot and fight to knock opponents off the stage. But the roster of characters is now 35, and much fewer are clones like in Melee. There are also loads of stages (even a stage-editor so the possibilities are literally endless) and more options than I care to describe. The robustness of the package is mind boggling. With thousands of unlockables to find, you'll be spending a whole lot of time with this game before you see all there is to see.The combat has been slightly slowed down in this one compared to Melee. This was necessary for several reasons. First, many felt that melee was way too fast, and by slightly slowing down the action, the combat becomes much more enjoyable and fixes some of the balance issues that plagued Melee. Secondly, slightly slower action makes the combat much more accessible for newbies while not necessarily taking away any depth or meaningful gameplay mechanics for vets, thus it is a worthwhile trade-off. Third, combat had to be slowed down for the new online mode, which would not have been able to handle the lightning fast combat of Melee.That's right, I just said online mode. Now you can take Super Smash Brothers online with friends (or complete strangers). Unfortunately it is not seamless. You need to jump through a few hurdles to get into a desirable game and if you want to play with friends you have to get their friend codes, which is a hassle. Online matches are not always smooth but I've had the best luck when I've played with friends only. But to be honest, this is one of the few games I'd rather have people over for to play on a single screen. Local multiplayer is some of the most fun experiences you may have with a video game if you can hold your own with your friends. It's a blast at parties and never fails to entertain.Even though multiplayer has always been a strong aspect of Super Smash Bros. games, single player has never been something to get excited about. This time, there is a new mode called Subspace Emissary. It is an amusing diversion the first time you play it, but it is incredibly repetitive and lacks the competitive charm that the rest of the game has. You will want to complete it once to unlock characters and sit through some cool CGI cutscenes, but otherwise I'd leave this mode alone.So I mentioned some minor flaws to an otherwise spectacular game. I recommend this game to anyone with even a passing interest in fighting games or Nintendo games in general. It is one of the best games for the Wii, and in my opinion, one of the best games I've ever played.BUY IT. 5 stars out of 5.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2009"}

And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime.

With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Jody \"bigdumptruckdotcom\"","summary":"Feed Your Need To Crash Your Car","reviewText":"My family is new to the world of the XBOX 360, so I don't have any experience with prior versions of Burnout with which to compare Burnout Paradise.

{"product_name":"B0047TLIBU","description":"","reviewerName":"Adrian Jenkins \"southerndudeman\"","summary":"Immensely entertaining, immensely flawed...","reviewText":"...but ultimately satisfying as hell. I backed away from this game after a string of reviews comparing it unfavorably to Dragon Age: Origins. That's what I get for listening to the fanboys. Dragon Age II is an incredibly fun romp through the life of Garrett Hawke, as he rises from poverty in a new land to the height of power, but has to deal with so many costs along the way. I can't really say more - spoiling this story would be a shame (and it is a hell of a story). So, let me begin withTHE GOOD:1) Character interactions. RPGs aren't about stupid battle tactics, or graphics. A role-playing game is about...playing a role. And the role of Garrett Hawke is one heck of a role. The developers have done an outstanding job of creating a character that you can really get behind. I was concerned about the addition of voice in the main character. As it turns out, I should not have been. Be a wise-cracking rogue. Be a stalwart hero. Be a dour mage. Mix it up. The game adapts to your choices, and enhances the experience. Choose a smart-aleck comment long enough, and the game will make you a smart-aleck in cut scenes. People will react to you differently, and will know when you act out of character. It's an incredible accomplishment, and honestly, this is the best it's ever been done (on a console, at least).Add to this fantastic writing for the other characters, and you and your merry men (and women) will have a great time. Isabella cracks me up every time she speaks. I would put certain characters together to see how they would converse among themselves. At times, I would actually STOP TRAVELING to hear the banter. Aveline and Isabella have great exchanges. In fact, ANYONE and Isabella have great exchanges. But other character interactions are good as well. Put Anders and Merrill together, and hear their varying views on magic. Put Fenris and Varric together, and listen to the dwarf get under the goth elf's skin. In short, I can't believe that ANYONE would complain that the characters were bland. This is 1000x better than the tired interactions in Dragon Age: Origins.2) Main character development. Hawke is immensely customizable, with numerous armor and weapon options, most of which impact the appearance of the character. The ability trees are great. You won't get close to maxing out all of the available trees, so choices are relevant here. I personally played as a rogue who depended on stealth and backstab. Others might like bows. Or dual weapon. This is only for ONE class, mind you. You can also play as a warrior or a mage, with many other customizations. All in all, the main character is vastly more interesting here (perhaps because there is only one, as opposed to the 6 in DA:O).3) Combat. Combat has taken a beating from many reviewers. It's completely unfair. The idea that combat is no longer tactical is outrageous. Just go toe-to-toe against the high dragon without thinking through your character choices and your tactics. You'll get your lungs handed to you, even on Casual difficulty.I'm a button presser. I like pressing buttons. I pressed them constantly in DA:O, despite the fact that they didn't really do anything. Why wouldn't I enjoy actually having the attack button attack, each time I press it? What a concept.4) The story. Although the tale is a bit open-ended, the story in this game is excellent. There are great plot turns at every point. I can respect that some people found things a little too episodic, but I actually cared to see how Hawke would end up, or how players from previous tales would affect the storyline. And who in the world would have known that Anders would be an incredibly compelling character? I won't spoil any points, but suffice to say, this is a game that I am playing for a second time, immediately after finishing the first playthrough. That's the highest praise I can give story.THE BAD:1) Dearth of locales. OK, Bioware. You make this great main character, and put him into this exciting story. Why then can't you be bothered to make more environments? It's embarrassing that EVERY PERSON IN KIRKWALL LIVES IN THE SAME HOUSE. They even have the same paintings on the wall, and in storage. Orlesian nobles apparently have the same taste as Orzammar dwarves. Who knew?The fact is, this is unacceptable. You will travel through the same caves, the same open passages, for the ENTIRE GAME. Was it really that hard to create a different non-descript house? There's only one city in the game. You could at least make it more interesting.2) Open-endedness of story. OK - I really liked the story. Why not resolve it? We've already seen Bioware fail miserably to resolve open plot lines in the past (see \"Wtich Hunt,\" the single worst DLC I've seen for any game, ever). I can respect that the face of Thedas is changed by the actions of our heroes, and it probably is impossible to resolve this a few cutscenes. Could we at least see how the face of Kirkwall was changed? Or could we see how our heroes fare after the game? Even a little bit? The disappointing end sours an otherwise-great tale.3) Armor for supporting characters. There is a ton of armor in the game, each with different purpose. What a shame that supporting characters CAN'T EQUIP ANY OF IT. Seriously, you will find hundreds of different pieces of armor throughout the tale (I saved every one of them). The majority of it goes to waste completely. Each supporting character has his or her own armor, which can be (slightly) customized, but cannot be changed. Thus, this leaves Hawke to use every single piece of armor you pick up during the game. Many of the pieces can't even be used, since they are only for specific character classes. What's the point, then?THE UNFORGIVEABLE:1) Glitches. Oh, right, Bioware made this. Of COURSE it doesn't work. The game froze up within 5 minutes of me starting it. It proceeded to freeze at least a dozen more times as I played through it. Patches cure some ills, but cause others. Many questlines glitched on me (e.g. I saw the end of Merrill's character quest before I had actually done anything, which spoiled a lot). Some glitches are hilarious (I \"completed\" one quest 6 times before it finally registered as complete, by simply giving an item to a person over and over). Some are frustrating (wow - I was really annoyed when I didn't get my \"SUupplier\" trophy because of - you guessed it - a glitch). None are acceptable. I don't know what's wrong with this company, but this is the kind of crap that people care about in the long term. I would give an impassioned plea for more QC, but what's the point? It's clear that Bioware doesn't care. They are bad enough to drop the game two stars.But anyway, that's it. If you can put aside the glitches and your own (often irrational) love for the original, you will find an immensely entertaining sequel.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00006GSNY","reviewerName":"mdizzog","summary":"Alright, has it's fair share of problems somewhat.","reviewText":"I enjoy shooting stuff. Especially with a huge selection of guns. I like seeing the gun models too, it adds to the realism. Raven Shield or Ghost Recon? Which game is better? Raven shield focuses on close quarter combat, Ghost Recon, emphasizes stealth in huge urban environments with AI that don't always know you are there.I enjoy the fighting in this game somewhat. Against human players it is great, even and fair. The AI though, is terrible alot of the time.Planning missions is great. It is easy to set up the entire plan for a squad, sometimes they will be a bit stupid, and won't stop to kill a terrorist, but they get the job done. AI for your team is fine. The only problem I see is fighting. When your backup shoots at enemys, they look at you basically. I turned around to see where my partner was shooting, his gun was moving around crazily and I hear gunshots from it. You see, when the AIs in your group shoot at enemys and you look over in their direction, they want to turn to face you, so you cannot see where they are shooting, which does NOT help you locate the enemy AI's and sometimes gets you and your team killed.The environments are great. Multiplayer lets you play them over and over, and they are huge and detailed. Lot's of stuff, not much to interact with besides doors, windows, and some explosive tanks, but still it looks good. I however, prefer the huge outdoor enviroments of Ghost Recon.Graphics are great. Lots of gun models, Ghost Recon didn't show the gun models, which wasn't that cool. I like having the heavy artillery and such. Everyone dies from 2-3 hits basically. One can do the job. I prefer Ghost Recon's wounded and okay status thingy, because sometimes when my hud is off, I won't realize I am wounded until I notice that my guy limps.As for AI and such. Well, first let me tell you about moving around. When you sit up and down and lay, it is a little, difficult. Sometimes I get shot massively because my character takes forever to stand up, normally in life you could get up and run in an instant, yet the time it takes to move between laying and standing takes too long, and often exposes your back to terrorists. Your team AI will sometimes lay with you, facing the exact same way you are, which will in turn kill them all off from a bad guy behind them. Also sometimes guns dont shoot immediately, like the AK 74. It will pause for about .5 seconds, which sometimes gets me killed. Also gun stability. It takes forever to have the crosshair closed.  When you are walking or running or even crouching and walking, your crosshair goes out REALLY far. In real life, when you walk, your gun's ability to hit isn't affected. In this game they love making the cross hairs go out 5 miles when you move an inch. It is almost retarted that the creators decided to make it impossible to hit a guy 2 feet from you when you move.Ok now I will tell you about the enemy AI. Terrible. Ferocious too. Ok, you are standing and blam, your dead. Look, there is an AI a mile away in the dark. Huh? The AI doesn't need a scope or a night vision, your team is the same way, except your team seems to have crappier vision, and doesn't shoot a guy until he comes in about 15 feet. So darkness doesn't play a role, and stealth only works somewhat, most of the time you will be seen or heard. Sometimes the AI will shoot you while they are turning around. WTF? Yes it is true, sometimes I die from a guy who isn't even looking at me, and the Ai also can see all around them, so if you appear behind them, they see you. I hate how sometimes in cooperative online I will die from crappy AI and have to wait 5 minutes to play again.  Then there is the AI aiming. They always hit you basically. Even when they are walking, their gun never seems to miss. When they are standing and you are crouching behind a car, even if they are not looking at your legs, they can shoot you and kill you. Basically if you think crawling will help you get hit less, you are wrong donkey kong.Overall? I like shooting stuff, playing against human beings is fine. Although I hate the way heartbeat sensors work and hate how sometimes when I crouch, crawl, or stand they will show the exact same reading, humans are flimsy. Heartbeat pucks, jammers, or those other kinds of pucks can easily fool them. I have seen FAR less hackers on this game then counterstrike. Over my time playing online, I think I have encountered one hacker, who died constantly because he thought hacks made him invincible. So for a change of pace, this game is much better than counterstrike for online, has great environments, a planning system that lets a player describe the entire AI path(there are also pre-rendered ones for the campaign), and finally a game that has tons of weapons, so you won't ever get bored.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2003"}

I prefer adventure/rpg games and they are scarce for the Xbox, to say the least.  Unfortunately, the game was clearly written for the PS2 and then ported to the Xbox with little thought about gameplay.  This time Atari took a good game and definitely did not make it better.Let's do the good parts first, since Indigo Prophecy really is a good game on many levels.  The game's inner story is based on an actual legend associated with the change of Mayan eras.  Into this new era is supposed to be born an 'indigo' child who will come with a prophecy that will grant great power to those who would listen.  Add in a lot of human sacrifice and a dollop of paranoid plot to take over not just the world, but the universe, and you have Indigo Prophecy in a nutshell.Oracles use randomly chosen instruments to carry out sacrifices, and this is the story of Lucas Kane, who suddenly finds himself a murderer and must elude both the police and assassins from a secret clan long enough to find out what happened to him and why he suddenly has strange powers.  Pther key characters are Lucas' brother Marcus, and two police investigators, Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles.  The player get's to control all of these characters, often in the same episode.  The story is good, and the modern noir settings and sound are as well.  Where this game runs into trouble is in the action game play and artwork.Action is managed by to different operations, either following directional sequences displayed on the screen, or in rapid toggling of the two trigger keys.  On any of the typical Xbox controllers these operations are more irritating than challenging.  Accomplishing significant parts of this game involve being totally focus on the few square inches of screen where the progress of the challenge is displayed.  So there you are in the middle of an action sequence and you can actually miss most of the action.  It wasn't until I happened to look at my PS2 controller that I realized all this activity would have been much smoother if I had played the PS2 version of the game.Artwork is low detail even for a PS2 based game, and looks even weaker on an Xbox.  This is odd, considering that there isn't a lot of intricate action to eat up computer time that could have been dedicated to graphics.  Atari chose to make this game on a slim budget, and the story, while strong, isn't enough to make this a real winner.Overall, this is a three and a half star game on the Xbox, but a solid 4 on the PS2.  Good entertainment, but not particularly memorable.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2005"}

The controls which were decent for the old versions have been revamped to take advantage of the WiiMote and the nunchuck attachment.  Together (as the control stick controls your view, while the WiiMote controls your aim)they feel like a sort of Dual Stick set up except more intuitive and easier to use than the traditional Cstick method. There is a little weirdness as I somtimes do a 180 on accident while holding the RUN button (Z) too often, but reloading is actually fun with this setup. I am finding the game alot more fun and satisfying with the Wii controls all the great moments are still there (including the new Ada W. missions:) I just have more health and ammo with which to enjoy them.  This game is a loveletter to gamers especially fans of the horror-survival genre, and to miss out on this version is to deprive your Wii of the best title yet available.  A trigger (or knife) happy splatter fest, RE4 puts you in the middle of the action, and as nasty as it is its a hard place to leave.

While the game is fun in the fashion of \"Mortal Combat\" and the old arcade game \"Rampage\" it isn't something that I would classify as a must have.The combat in \"Godzilla Unleashed\" is a bit of a challenge. This is one game where the Wii remote only works marginally. It could be that I haven't put enough hours into the game to have it mastered, but it seems that I am able to do the correct move about 50% of the time.The story line... maybe I am too old (32) but I had no idea what the point is to the game. The only thing that I could figure out is that there are good monsters and bad monsters. At times the good monsters will help you at other times they will attack you. I think if I understood the plot a little better than game would be more enjoyable.My wife has concerns that the game is too violent and should rated stricter than \"T\", but \"Godzilla Unleashed\" does not show any blood nor does it use realistic types of weapons so I feel that the \"T' is probably correct.One area that would make the game much more enjoyable is if you were up against friends. Again, this would make the game more like \"Mortal Combat\" and less like Godzilla, but it could turn into a fun party game. If you happen to be a big fan of \"Godzilla\" games my guess is that you could follow the storyline and the game would be loads of fun!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2008"}
