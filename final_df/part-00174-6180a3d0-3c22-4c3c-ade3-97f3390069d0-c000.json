They added a lot of features that a lot of people would find amusing.. Konquest Mode, Puzzle Kombat. and Chess Kombat, to name the main elements. These are some of my many problems: The combos are seemingly impossible to me, the Konquest Mode was just ( to me ) seemingly a quick little throw-together to get this game out in stores. The onyl way to get characters is by playing konquest, and I am dead stuck at the beggining - in training! - And no- I am not a beginner to VideoGames even though I am only 14, In fact, I found a glitch in a video game for my first time when I was 6.. but getting back on topic, the game isnt fun. The clunky controls don't suit for me at all, but what I did like about this game was this: The Puzzle Kombat and Kinda the chess kombat. I just like sitting down to a game or two of one of those. I think i may be a little generous rating this game a 2 out of 5, but i'm not buying this game for you - I'm merely telling you what I THINK ABOUT IT.This to me is not worth ( the 50 or 60 dollars . Depending on if you buy the extra pack like me which includes the original Mortal Kombat ) the money. It's worth a rental. Nothing more, nothing less.I'm dissapointed in you, sadly, Midway, for these new generation Mortal Kombat games..Have fun! - - ( with the chess/puzzle kombat ) :)","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2005"}

Paul \"John doe\"","summary":"Mortal Kombat Deception review","reviewText":"I'm going to review the sequel to Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance Mortal Kombat Deception. This game was released 2 years after Deadly Alliance which brought Mortal Kombat back after the embarassments that were Mortal Kombat Mytholgies & Special Forces. Raiden, Scorpion, Sub Zero,  Lei Mei, Bo Rai Cho, Jade Sindel Kabal, Nightwolf Noob Saibot, Smoke who are now a tag team Noob Smoke for lack of a better term. Tanya some unknown force brought back Liu Kang & now he's ZOMBIE LIU KANG! Kenshi, Baraka Millena Ermac are back. We did get some new characters I'll get to them. The story is The Deadly Alliance won Johnny Cage, Jax, Sonya, & kitana were defeated Raiden managed his way through Mavado, Kano & the 2 Oni & he's going to fight Shang Tsung & Quan Chi both but you got to go back before hand in Konquest to the story of a young man named Shujinko who was trained by Bo Rai Cho who went on quest for who he thought was The Elder Gods & spent his entire life on this quest to find The Komidogu. He was used by The Dragon King he wants to shape the relms as he sees fit. He needs the amulet that Quan Chi has to complete this task. In Konquest mode you get to go from Earth Relm to The Netherrelm to The Chaos Relm to the Relm Of Order to Edina. You get introduced to the new character in Konquest. Ok now Shang Tsung & Quan Chi defeated Raiden but as believed by many fans The Deadly Alliance would not last & of course they betray each other. Quan Chi defeats Shang Tsung but then the true empor returns not Shao Kahn but Ongaga The Dragon King. Quan Chi tries to fight him but it's useless then somehow Raiden & Shang Tsung get back up Raiden even tries to sacrifice himself even blows the entire palce up. Yet it was all in vein there all dead except for The Dragon King of course & Raiden. However 1 of the new characters a guy from The Chaos Relm wants to bring Shao Kahn back he's named Havik he actually wants to eat his heart. The deceased Kabal is back he reforms The Black Dragon adding 2 of the new characters a girl named Kira who has no memory & a kickboxer named Kobra. They want power & will take it by any means necessary. Scopion is now being used by The Elder Gods to battle The Dragon King. 1 person that wasn't defeated was Sub Zero who was betrayed by Frost she tried to obtain some kind of power during Deadly Alliance but she was consumed by her own freezing ability Sub Zero buried her & obtained new armor & headed to Outworld while ther he joins with Kenshi who is hurt & there is this guy Hotaro & I hate this character & not in a good way he's 1 of the biggest Dou  c  he bags he's after Sub Zero cause he broke some kind of curfew he also arrested Shujinko for the same thing really a real annoying character I like these 2 other characters though Darrius & Dairou. Dairou is 1 of Hotaro's most most trusted officers but he was hired by Revolution Terrorist Darrius to steal The Seiden Constitution & kill Hotru Dairou also broke Shujinko out of jail. So I like Darrius & his MOTOWN look is the best. While this is going on Onaga knows he needs allies he bring all of the captured fighters serve him you also see Jax, Sonya & Johnny Cage in the Dark Prison stage. A cool thing is they bring in this 1 chick Ashra who is new to the series She was once in The Borhterhood Of Shadows that worshipped Shinnok she was banished into The Netherrelm she has this sword called The Kriss & each time she kills a demon it cleanes her of evil. She has a conflict with Ermac who is another returning character but she finds out about Noob Saibot. Ermac isn't her problem in fact you find out that he senses a greater power more than Onaga which of course leads into the next game so they sort of both have the same problem. Nightwolf who has recieeved dark visions & has now assumed the role of Sin Eater he has became corrupt but is doing it to save the relms. Ok now I'll admit that John Vogel came up with Onaga out of nowhwere but really it never told who was empor before. I love that they up'd the gore fatalities are more bloodier along with the death traps which you can end the fight in the middle of it which The Death Traps are more fun than they should be espically He l  l  s Foundary. Also opponents kill themeselves in a Hara Kiri move. This was like going from MK 1 to MK II. I like it more than Deadly Alliance my only problem is The Dragon King he feels more like he should be a sub boss than a the main guy. He's just your standard huge monster & that's about it. This game is on The PS2 X BOX & Gamecube The Gmaebube version allowed you to play as Shao Kahn & Goro which was cool.The gets of He  l  l open next ARMAGEDDON!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2011"}
{"product_name":"B006WQR3GA","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Fun, not a classic","reviewText":"The original XCom was a stone cold classic.  I played it when it came out, and via DOS emulators I still pick it up every now and again, the only old-school game I still play.  That said, the game is extremely dated in terms of graphics and interface, and has problems such as extremely repetitious missions, extremely repetitious base defenses, and having too many people to control.So I was really excited that this game came out and got good reviews.  It's a generally addictive game, with some small changes - some for the better, some for not.  The game has generally been \"dumbed down.\"  Squad size is limited to six people and has a more \"Gears of War\"-ish cover system, which to my surprise actually works very well (although I wish you could go to eight for the last few missions).  There's less time worrying about whether the crash site is sunny, there's less micro-managing engineering and science.  There's less useless items, & almost all scientific research has some use.  You're not constantly losing items when people drop them in battle or get killed.  Injuries are frequent, which force you to train people beyond a principle squad of six - it's fun levelling people up.However if that simplifies the game and makes it more console-friendly, it also shows a less ambitious game.  There's more of an arcade feel, where you're just running through missions.  These missions feel the same, and while they're extremely fun, they get repetitious.  The game keeps itself fairly short to avoid turning into a slog.  Maybe 10 hours to beat it.The largest problem is the low production values.  There's about seven battlefield phrases, and they're repeated over and over and over.  Playing the game means hearing \"adjusting sights\" and so forth approximately eight thousand times.  Battlefields all resemble each other too much - there's very little feel that a mission in a European city is actually in a European city, instead of an Asian city.  Graphics are slightly broken, you often find yourself able to apparently shoot through a wall or a rock.  A lot of the people sound like they were poorly miked, and then in the end-game sequence there's an alien taunting you in a very quiet raspy voice, he is almost impossible to understand.  Finally, even though I got the latest bug update, I was unable to finish the game because the game froze in the middle of the final mission, even if I loaded it and played the mission again.  I googled game breaking bugs for XCom, and learned that there's a whole lot of these.In conclusion, if you enjoyed the original XCom, or this genre of game, I still recommend this game.  However it's short and slight and not the classic the original XCom was.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2012"}

Young","summary":"OMGooooodness!!!!","reviewText":"I must start off by saying, I love this game so much. I purchased it on release day and then began reading a lot of negative reviews on Amazon. I went with all of the hype for COD Ghosts and purchased it, I was going to return BF4, something told me not to be too hasty. I went to my favorite YouTube Channel theRadBrad (he's the best for video games) and watched about an hour and a half of his gameplay for COD Ghosts; I was completely bored, he was playing the Campaign and I wasn't so sure the dog (forget his name) was such a good addition to an action-shooter, needless to say, COD Ghosts got returned and I kept BF4.  Anyway, I decided that I needed to watch the gameplay for BF4, I did and I was very impressed; it's like COD on steroids. I'm not too far into the Campaign yet, I'm on the third mission, but from the beginning of the game, it's been non-stop action. Your A.I. squad  actually helps you a lot, they listen very well,  it's weird but I feel like we are a very cohesive unit;  you tell them when to engage in battle by the click of the RB button. The enemies are plentiful and they're aggressive, with that being said there are plenty of weapons to acquire; the entire environment is destructible too. I haven't really played past the two hour mark but I'm super excited to finish the Campaign. I'm the first to admit, I like the single player Campaign's the most, but after I finish the Campaign, I plan to get into the Multiplayer. It's actually recommended that you play the single-player mode first to get the weapons and there upgrades before you play the Multiplayer. I was on this one website and they listed all of the achievements (for those of you that like getting them) for the game and most of then are acquired from the single-player Campaign.I have recommended this game to all of my co-workers, we all loved COD MW2 and MW3 the best from that series. Honestly I've shied away from COD BO1&2 and since Battlefield 2, I've been a fan. So from me this game comes highly recommended. I was going to wait until the next-gen systems to get it, but I'm glad I got it now. Another thing I should note, I'm one of those people that gets that \"motion sickness\" feeling from some FPS, I do with most of the COD games, I can play for about an hour and then I have to take a break. With the BF series, I don't get that \"motion sickness\" feeling and that's another reason I love this game. Please give this game a change, don't get caught up in all of the negative reviews like I almost did.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Gil","summary":"Not a bad system","reviewText":"I picked this system up a couple of days ago, expansion pack included, for 20 dollars.

The system itself is cheap to buy,and is as reliable as a newer PS2,the only issue that you have to be aware of is that some of the older Xbox's DVD drives are prone to partial or full failures,But if your buying a refurbished system then when it is sent in,the DVD drive will be replaced with a newer model one. If your buying one at EB games then it comes with a free 30 day warranty (that's 1/3 of the original 90 day warranty FYI) And for only $4 more you can get a FULL 1 year warranty,if there is anything wrong with the system it gets replaced no questions asked-NICENow,the downfall about buying a 'discontinued' system like the Gamecube or Xbox is the peripherals are very hard to find at your local EB games,I lucked out and found 2 Xbox controllers (1 Duke and one 3rd party) for $30 and found the DVD remote for $20 (I should have held off on it,but I was to excited to wait)Games themselves have hit rock bottom (just like the system) price wise,the MOST one game should cost used at EB/Gamestop would be $20,but most can be had for $14.99 (I'm talking about good ones) And if your lucky you can get some good games for under $10.

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming.

Now, I'll admit that I'm not the biggest Star Wars fan (read: I saw one movie when I was eight), but I am a huge RPG fan, and this game plummets far below my expectations. I will describe my experience with the game, and hopefully you will choose to pass it by and skip the agony I went through.At the start of the game, I was asked to choose my character's appearance, skill point allocation, and basic moveset. Sounds fun and cool, right? That's what I thought, too. Until I realized that every character model was blocky and pseudo-realistic (you know, that weird, pale, supposed-to-look-human-but-really-doesn't look), the skill-point system was convoluted and confusing to anyone who isn't a hardcore Dungeons and Dragons player, and choosing my moves was so difficult and frustrating that in the end, I didn't even know which ones I had. Creating the character took an hour, and I didn't feel at all satisfied after I finished.Once I started the actual game, things only got worse. I headed to my first battle, expecting a standard turn-based system at the least, and an innovative action/RPG blend at the most. I got neither. Instead, I was greeted a bizarre mess. In fact, this combat system was so strange and awkward that I don't think I could even describe it. All I know is that, first off, my character was somehow moving on its own, and second, the commands I entered didn't seem to effect what happened onscreen at all.After making my way through several battles, by way of random button mashing and liberal use of medpacks (that was the easiest way to do it, and seemed to have the same result as trying to concentrate and strategize), I met my first party member. What happened after that just plain scared me. First, the voiceovers made me want to both laugh and scream. Secondly, while the horrendous voice is grating your ears, you have to look at a disturbing close-up of the character's face as he's talking. And finally, THE FACE DOESN'T CHANGE. His expression stayed exactly the same throughout the entire conversation, and this happened with every single other character I talked to. Freaky.The final part of the game that I played through was the first city. It was big, with lots of people walking around, going about their lives. This would be cool, if I had known where to go in this massive maze. But did I? Nope. Although my horribly-voiced partner apparently knew the city well, I recieved no guidance from him. Instead, he followed me around, giving me no hints but the instruction to \"find Bastilla\". By the way, I knew nothing about what Bastilla looked like or where she might be.After twenty minutes of running around in the maze, talking to random, badly-voiced people, most of whom had mean things to say, I gave up. Maybe people who like Star Wars and D&D; will appreciate this, but I just can't. BioWare, quit pretending you're the next great RPG maker and go back to putting your characters in MTV music videos.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2005"}

{"product_name":"B003O6CBIG","description":"","reviewerName":"Sreenadh","summary":"Great Game but can be improved","reviewText":"While Call of Duty is often regarded as the epitome of the annualized, cynically produced, lazily constructed videogame franchise, I've always maintained that both Infinity Ward and Treyarch expended much more effort than they were ever given credit for.Whether it's the underestimated storytelling prowess of Modern Warfare or the noble efforts to revitalize the COD formula with Black Ops, the overwhelmingly popular series is far more cognizant of its own criticisms than many like to believe.My defense of the consistent quality of Call of Duty has certainly caught criticism of its own. Indeed, I am lauded as a hypocrite for daring to suggest that Modern Warfare 3 was not objectively, factually, a mediocre game. I still believe that, and I still have respect for Call of Duty as a series. However, I've always been mindful that the gravy train cannot last forever, and as &#34;military shooters&#34; are in 2013 what World War II shooters were in 2008, it's high time Call of Duty underwent another dramatic transformation, the likes of which gave us the original Modern Warfare.Black Ops II was a step forward in this regard, an earnest attempt to inject fresh life into a flagging idea. By comparison, Ghosts is not only a failure to capitalize on the goodwill Black Ops II earned, it's a disappointing step backward.While most fans consider their Call of Duty campaigns to be little more than additional fluff, tacked onto the multiplayer, I've always found them a compelling draw. The stories aren't the most engrossing, nor are they particularly deep, but they are at least energetic, explosive, and highly effective at drawing a reaction from the player, even if a few cheap tricks are employed the get it. Ghosts, by contrast, offers a startlingly lethargic solo experience, with a story lacking in character -- or indeed, characters -- and going through the expected motions with little evidenced enthusiasm.The campaign isn't exactly bad, but it is a banal shooting gallery without the remarkable setpieces or memorable moments to carry it. Very much a COD-by-numbers affair, players quickly blitz through the usual tasks with dutiful obligation. Indeed, &#34;obligation&#34; is a fitting word to use when talking about Ghosts' solo missions -- the obligatory bit where a temporary player character dies, the obligatory aircraft sequence, the obligatory escape while shooting things from the back of a vehicle, the obligatory sniping part, the obligatory chapter where you're walking quietly in grass. More than any other Call of Duty, there is an overwhelming sense of having been there many times, and having done that more than you can count.The combat is solid, but its solidarity is matched only by its tepidness. You move from small wall to small wall, shooting the enemies ducking behind their own walls, and avoiding their endless grenades. After the mission variety and unique optional objectives found in Black Ops II, it's difficult to go back to &#34;normal&#34; Call of Duty, which feels comparatively dry and plodding. Without an interesting story (the American invasion plot feels like a rehash of Modern Warfare 2), and without the usual explosive pace I've come to expect, there's really very little worth experiencing here.Ghosts' one big attempt to stand out is the inclusion of Riley, a dog. It's a dog. That's what it is. In missions where Riley accompanies you, you can press a button to make the dog attack an enemy. Every now and then, you might get to control the dog and let it sneak around in grass to attack people. That's about it. There's something about the game industry that compels it to market dogs as massive, game changing inclusions in games. They never have been, and if Ghosts is a continuation of a trend, they probably never will.Without a campaign of note, Call of Duty hinges on multiplayer more than ever and ... it's okay. As always, various tweaks and refinements have been added, but Ghosts' online efforts suffer in the same way its campaign has -- the previous installment added too much, and did too many things better, for this to be considered a worthy successor. While there are some new toys to play with, and you can even customize the look of your character (as well as play as a woman, finally), the core experience feels like business as usual, moreso since we've lost the near-future gadgets found in 2012's installment.A new mode, Squads, allows you to command your own team of characters in a multiplayer scenario, cooperating with friends and challenging others with AI-controlled teammates. I'll be honest, I don't really get the point. You're not commanding anybody, or doing much more than experiencing an official simulation of a multiplayer match with half a lobby full. Its presence isn't offensive, and it may be of use to total newcomers who aren't ready to jump into full competition, but it failed to really excite me.If one is to be diplomatic, one can say Ghosts is still better than a lot of cornball military shooter knock-offs, but formula and familiarity have won the day, as Infinity Ward finds itself too afraid to shake anything up in too dramatic a fashion. As with the campaign, a checklist of obligatory elements appears to have been steadily worked through, as the usual format of ranking, unlocking, and customization trundles along with methodical reliability.And don't get me wrong, it's as reliable as it's always been -- if all you've ever really wanted is the same Call of Duty every single year, then you're going to love this, because it's as Call of Duty as Call of Duty gets. A few cute modes help break up the usual stable of gametypes, such as Infected (one player slowly turns the others into zombie-like creatures) and Cranked (chaining kills makes you tougher, faster, and able to score more points). These modes can make things less monotonous, but they riff on ideas seen in many other shooters, and really aren't worth the buying the whole game for.Except players can also have dogs now. Dogs make everything good.While Treyarch has steadily gotten better and braver with each new game, Ghosts sees Infinity Ward step into the role of pretender, of flagging inferior, one that doesn't seem to care much about improving its status, not when it could churn out any old guff at this point and come out on top of the sales charts.To that end, Infinity Ward takes a page directly of Treyarch's book with Extinction, a wave-based cooperative mode that performs functionally similar to the ever popular Zombies mode. However, while Zombies always had a unique sense of humor and an amusing arcade quality, Extermination is a fairly bland slice of chaos, in which fairly uninteresting aliens are mowed through across blasted cities littered with quivering pustules.As aliens are killed, one earns cash, which can be spent on new weapons, while skill points unlock temporary items that support the team. As with everything else in Ghosts, it performs its job adequately, and is not a terrible experience. It's just not very exciting either, and yet again plays catch up to things done far better in previous installments.At the risk of sounding like a stuck record at this point, everything I've said can be said about the visuals as well -- they're not the worst, they're far from the best, and yet again they feel highly lacking off the back of Black Ops II, which at least had cool futuristic designs to play around with. Ghosts' vision of a not-quite-post-apocalyptic America is bourgeois at best, an unremarkable representation that could have been eerie and unsettling, if it were presented with anything more than sociopathic carelessness. Audio is the same way -- uninspired music, and the usual shooting noises, alongside bored voice actors.A few buggy elements rear their heads too, such the audio frequently cutting out during campaign loading screens, and guns failing to switch properly when they run out of ammo. I also had to restart a checkpoint due to an event not triggering as it should. Nothing game breaking, but at this point, one doesn't expect to see such silly little glitches in a game that's not done a whole lot to reinvent itself.Call of Duty may have picked up a reputation as one of the laziest, most callously developed cash cows in the business, but I've always believed that reputation was undeserved. Call of Duty: Ghosts, however, with its slapdash campaign and unambitious multiplayer, contains enough factory-standard cynicism to earn itself plenty of scorn. Nothing Ghosts does is especially bad, but nothing Ghosts does is worth paying any attention to. It exists to exist, a stopgap bit of filler spat out as the industry transitions from one generation of consoles to another.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2013"}

It works well, but as a woman with normal woman-sized hands, this remote doesn't feel comfortable to hold.  Reaching the L1 and R1 keys required me to stretch my index fingers more than with the PS3 controller. With the regular PS3 remote, I am better able to maneuver these buttons in conjunction with the other controller elements.I also didn't like the feel of the grips.  It seemed like the rough surface of the grips could cause calluses with prolonged use and it also irritated my hands.  I wish the entire controller consisted of the smooth plastic that covers all the other parts of the controller.I liked the general placement of the buttons on this remote compared to the PS3 remote.  It's really a matter of taste more than anything though.  I thought it would be difficult to get used to, but I adapted quicker than I imagined.Overall, I would recommend this remote for men.

Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces.

{"product_name":"B00000I1BR","description":"Let me go on record and say that I was never a fan of the original Crash Bandicoot. Even though Crash was disarmingly cute and fuzzy, and even though the game's graphics were just about as good as they got in those days, the frustrating design of the game made playing it such a painful experience that I still have flashbacks when I see small marsupials on the Discovery Channel. But just one short year after his debut, Crash is back in a sequel that is so far superior to the original that I'm willing to forget the mistakes of the past.The new storyline is simple: A very gullible Crash is corralled into collecting crystals for the evil Dr. Cortex and gems for the terrible N. Brio. There are 25 levels in all; each level contains an easy-to-find crystal and hard-to-earn gems. Instead of being forced to approach the game in a strictly linear fashion, you progress through a series of five warp rooms. Each warp room contains five levels, which you are free to tackle in any order. After you have found the crystals in each level, you can progress to the next warp room. This system of warp rooms is a great innovation; it's clear how to progress in the game, and yet you have the option of moving to a different level if you're hopelessly frustrated with one area. Best of all, you can save your game in the warp room at any time (a big improvement over the original game's horrific save system).A lot of variety is packed inside this game. You'll navigate through simple run-and-jump areas, try to outrun a very mad polar bear, work your way through sewer systems, and even fly around with a jet pack. Within each level, the basic gameplay is similar to the original Crash: Running, jumping, and spinning are still the order of the day. Even though most levels are set in a semi-3D environment, Crash Bandicoot 2 is a platform game, plain and simple. The graphics are in a league of their own among PlayStation games, and the music couldn't be better. Unlike the original, Crash 2 is rarely frustrating enough to make you want to throw your controller at the TV. In fact, some expert gamers might find Crash to be a little on the easy side.There are only two real problems with Crash Bandicoot 2. First, the semi-3D setup is sometimes hard to navigate, and you'll find yourself missing jumps because you're unable to judge distances properly. Secondly, the game is just plain cheap at times; in some areas you must sacrifice many lives until you memorize a level's layout.In any event, these problems are balanced out by the game's excellent gameplay and intelligent design. Crash Bandicoot 2 is a topnotch platform game. If you're a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to check this title out. -- John Broady--Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

N","summary":"A classic that's classically annoying...","reviewText":"When it comes to Crash Bandicoot I'll be the first to admit playing the three main games on the PS1 in reverse order was probably a bad idea. The thing is Warped was the only one I had on hand when the urge to play these titles struck, and well, it completely spoiled me. I'm sure people are probably sick of me gushing over it but Warped was an excellent product and it was refined to the point of near perfection that I honestly wouldn't hesitate to give it a ten out of ten in conversation or review.The problem with Cortex Strikes Back is it isn't as polished as you'd expect. I don't mean this in a superficial way like graphic fidelity (which is superb for when it was released) but a \"streamline all the cheap-shots out of the experience\" way. The level of cheapness ingrained in Crash 2's gameplay is simply astounding and it comes from a variety of places. Things like the hit detection on the belly flop are in dire need of work and the bonus areas are usually the furthest thing from fun when that's the exact opposite of what they should be. Worse yet are the game's hidden paths which are essentially sorry excuses to throw everything but the kitchen sink at the player. The kicker to is just when you think you're done and your guard is down - that's when they throw the kitchen sink at you.The above situation is a real shame because when you get right down to it Cortex Strikes Back is a beautiful game. The level design and music are excellent as are the graphics which I feel even give Nintendo 64 games a run for their money. But every time the game turns a corner and those memories of the game's stubbornness start to fade something (again, there is always something) shows up and makes it take center stage once again. Compounding the situation is the fact there really isn't enough variety in the levels. Seriously, if I see another level with the words \"Crash\" or \"Bear\" in it I am going to scream and the same goes for the jet pack levels.Annoyances aside, if your a fan of the PlayStation having the three main Naughty Dog-developed Crash titles in your library is a no-brainer. If you haven't played them and want to do yourself a huge favor and play them in order so you'll be able to appreciate the improvements each sequel brings with it. Unlike some franchises the first three Crash games get better and bolder with each step. As for the game being discussed here, Crash 2 leaves a lot to be desired to in my book but then I can't really say I dislike it either. I do wish it was a little better (polished) than where it stands now but then that probably a part of why Warped is so good.

Not only are the graphics top-notch, the system requirements are fairly low and can even play on most netbooks. I play mine on an HP mini with graphics almost at full and have a very enjoyable experience. The dungeons and enemies are interesting, and all three characters have interesting abilities that keep getting better as you level up.It has skill trees like World of warcraft, so as you level you can shape the course of your character. If you like pets, you can buff that ability. More a melee fighter? There's a tree for that. I have gotten a good 50+ hours of game play out of this little game, and only for 20.00??

Newcomers engage old favorites in interactive, multileveled arenas. New strategies in fighting are introduced with the addition of walls, terrain effects, position changes, and enhanced side-stepping. Expanded game modes such as training, team battle, and the new Tekken Force provide the player with a deeper gameplay experience.","reviewerName":"Pat O'Donnell","summary":"A much needed evolution of the Tekken series","reviewText":"Tekken 4 is almost here. Some people will say it is the same old Tekken, just a prettier Tekken 3. This is simply not the case. Tekken 4 has evolved more than any Tekken to date. Perhaps only us Tekken veterans will notice, but the fact remains, Tekken 4 brings some major changes and enhancements over previous games in the series. Tekken 4 is the result of a lot of years of tweaking into something quite polished.First, the visuals.  Tekken 4 looks extremely good. If you played PS2's VF4, you'd notice the rough visuals as far as textures and jaggies.  Tekken4's visuals puts PS2's VF4 to shame with no jaggies of shimmering and detailed textures with very expansive backgrounds.  The characters arent quite as detailed as VF4 but the animation seems a bit better.  Easily the best looking fighter on the PS2. Tekken 4 is also the first progressive scan compatible game for PS2.  Lets hope this trend continues.  There is also an option to flick on/off the flicker filter of the game.  Put it on and the game has no jaggies or shimmering and everything has a smooth look.  Turn it off& everything will be really sharp but there will be some shimmer.  Either way, the game is beautiful if not a little barren in a couple stages.  But the reflections and water in the mall arena, from the glass in the windows, or the floor, or the gold lining in the shops, I've been heartily impressed.  The smoothness and detail of the statues, its surprising how much it imitates the real sculpture's attention to human skin.  The little details like the hatch being open to airplane, or \"Geken\" playing at the movie theater in Shinjuku...the game just looks amazingly clear and sharp.O.k, the gameplay; Christie is a great improvement over the odiously cheap Eddy, and the game benefits greatly from a much improved attention to balance.  Ling Xiaoyu has been improved into one of my favorite fighters now, I was surprised how much I had in learning her.  Meanwhile, Steve Fox is a bright edition to the line-up, his evasion moves and inability to kick bring back memories of playing Street Fighter Turbo...and I think he's managed to be a very interesting and fresh character.  Hwoarang is definitely my favorite of the bunch, though, great design, excellent attention to his moves, it feels like he was drafted from Soul Calibur into Tekken!  While, yes, the game still has repeat characters, that's a Namco fighter for you.  Plus, the different heights, 3D movement, breakable elements, wall hits and position/turn-partner moves really do add a lot to the gameplay and has evolved the Tekken series immensely.  Its really advanced over what I was used too and the character line-up may be the best yet.  (It just needs Kunimitsu!)I've had a lot of fun playing through Story Mode and Tekken Force through the past two weeks and I think I'm going to end liking this one as much as Tekken 2, which was something of a favorite back in the PSX era.  Too bad there's no Kunimitsu though and Marduk needs to crawl back into the womb of whatever cockroach conceived him.  The endings, despite their acting and the narrator sounding like gentle psychiatrist, rock in a way Tekken endings haven't for quite a while now.  I'll often just watch them a few times over, I especially like Law and Xiaoyu's endings.  Also, Steve's ending was kind of Shokku!  I didn't expect that, but I guess should have.  Its cool, because the Tekken storyline is actually pretty noteable compared to the weak stuff you see in most fighters, the characters and story are what attracted me to the series in the first place.  Of course, Tekken still isn't as deep a game as VF, but with 4 it finally has the goods to be comparable.  Oh and the music!  Currently, as I type the Airport music is stuck in my head.  The ending song is also top rate, as is the impossibly cool edition of the Tekken 2 remixes.  Namco Sound Team are very talented with electronica/techno/whatever Americans call it, I like their Pac Man club remixes, they're hilarious!Another cool thing about PS2's Tekken 4 is that Namco also included some Tekken 1 and Tekken 2 music for nostalgia's sake.  Lei's, Jack's, Heihachi's, Kazuya's, Nina's, Paul's, and Law's TK2 BGMs are all in there.  Then there's a bunch of tracks from TK1, probably more than what's there from TK2.  The 'statue' stage plays a number of Tekken 2 arcade music (not arranged).  The ones I've heard so far are Lei's, Jack-2's (I think) and the sub-boss music. The training mode is actually pretty good. I like how you can record moves, there are some recommended combos to show beginners possible linking techniques, and the playback demonstration is there (though not in training, wonder why).  For some reason, I've gotten madly addicted to getting as fast a time as I can going through the 20 moves on training mode, its just gets me in zen mode.  So far, my fastest time is 28 seconds with Steve Fox.All in all, Tekken 4 sports enough gameplay improvments and additions that the series desperately needed and has come together wonderfully. If you're a Tekken fan, you'll need this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2002"}

Consider what you've dealt with up until now. The only real good game so far was Code Veronica. Even that one was definitely not without its flaws. Outbreak files 1 and 2, unless you're into online gaming, were really a waste of time. You can buy the PS1 games, if you're able to get your hands on them. Essentially, you're still waiting for the ultimate RE experience.RE4 has answered a lot of prayers and demands. The controls are a breath of fresh air (how they should be). The graphics are dramatically improved. There's more of a variety of things to battle. It's a lot longer than its predecessors, which means a lot more gameplay and replay time. It's definitely not easy. I've owned the game for close to a month and haven't beaten it yet on the initial difficulty setting (note, most games I solve in week or less).That was the praise. Now for the complaints. It's not much, though. I did give it 4 stars.The main complaint is that it's just not as scary as the others. There aren't even true zombies. They came up with the idea to make the new regular (non-boss) enemies not actually dead (or undead, for you pc fanatics). They were infected by something that made them be controlled, like puppets. There are 2 types, the villagers and the zealots. They're smarter now and they can actually throw things at you and wield weapons like crossbows and chainsaws. It's all well and good, but the zombies added that essential creepiness that this game is lacking. My only other complaint is that the Merchant (the guy that you can buy supplies from) never sells ammo.Overall, I think this game is an evolution for the franchise and is a must for all fans. For RE5, maybe they'll reintroduce the zombies on a newer, scarier level.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000R3BNHE","reviewerName":"J.M.","summary":"A Night-Mare","reviewText":"Nights: Journey of Dreams is a dissapointment in many ways.  I've never played Nights into Dreams Before, so I'm new to the series.  There are two stories you can play in: Will's dream and Helen's dream.  Both of them are pretty much the same.  I hated both of them.  Nights is a strange character who flies around in circles.  All of the characters, especially Nights, had terrible voice covers.Graphics: Don't be fooled by the pictures on the back of the box (the cutscene graphics)!  At first you are introduced to beautiful, jaw-dropping graphics, but as soon as the cutscenes are over, the game takes a turn for the worse.  The graphics in the gameplay aren't impressive at all.  The graphics look like they'd be bad even for the Gamecube.  That is unacceptable for a Wii game.  Sometimes the game is blury.  Sure, there are bright colors, but that is not enough.Gameplay: Overall, the gameplay just wasn't set up well.  I'm sure it wouldn't be as bad if the camera angle was better.  The camera should have been from the back of Nights, instead of the side of her.  Probably the worst part of the gameplay is the repetitiveness.  Flying around in circles as Nights is very boring, and who wants to spend their time chasing birds around in circles anyway?  The boss battles are frusturating and are much harder than they need to be.  I had no idea what to do on many of them.  You also have a time limit on all of the levels and boss battles, which stinks.  If you fail a boss stage, then you need to start the whole level over again! Lame!Controls: THe game gives you the option to choose from four control options (nunchuk, remote, Gcube controller, and classic controller).  In a way this is good because you can choose which one you like the best, but I thought they were all confusing.  Nights is harder to control than she should be.To sum it up, Nights is a boring game that wasn't thought out very well with a dumb storyline and sloppy controls.  I've never played the original Nights before, but I'm sure this must be a dissapointment.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2008"}

I generally use a standard 5-button mouse for most games but for MMO's and FPS' I prefer a mouse with more buttons to better customize my play style. So when I saw this mouse I thought it would be the perfect item to test out and review. Here are my thoughts on the Logitech G500s Laser Gaming Mouse with Adjustable Weight Tuning;Pros+ 12 different weights (six 1.7 gram, six 4.5 gram) which can be easily added to the onboard ejectable weight tray.+ Patterned textures on the side of the mouse makes gripping easier.+ Left flange allows your thumb to guide the mouse movement easily.+ Internal memory allows you to store your button layout profile.+ Middle mouse button can be used to click left and right. Scroll wheel can also be switched to silent (no clicking while scrolling).+ Quick and easy installation.+ Instantly adjust your DPI.+ 10 programmable buttons.+ 3 year warranty.+ Great ergonomic design.+ Smooth glide movement.+ Lengthy braided nylon USB cable.+ Sleek and simple look.Cons- Not really designed for ambidextrous use. Sorry lefties!- May be a bit too heavy for some users, even with no weights added.- Only one button layout profile may be saved.- Nylon braided USB cord may be too rigid for some users.- Poorly detailed instruction manual.The \"Logitech G500s Laser Gaming Mouse with Adjustable Weight Tuning\" is a solid and well thought out gaming mouse aimed toward MMO and FPS players but usable by all. This mouse has quickly become another favorite gaming mouse. Its sturdy construction, excellent ergonomic shape, numerous button layouts and incredible accuracy make this mouse easy to recommend.

{"product_name":"B001CRM3YQ","reviewerName":"DanD","summary":"There's nothing like killing a few Nazis...","reviewText":"I grew up with \"Wolfenstein;\" I remember playing the demo for the original over and over as a kid, wishing my parents would splurge and buy the actual game.  Then, a few years ago, I picked up the PC version of \"Return to Castle Wolfenstein\" at a garage sale; I hadn't played video games much in the years between (just a select few PC games; I haven't owned a game system since Super NES back in grade school), but I knew I had to try \"Return.\"  I bought it and was blown away by the graphics and sheer fun.So, when I recently bought a PS3 to help cure my boredom (God forbid I should do something productive instead), I knew I had to pick up the latest incarnation of \"Wolfenstein,\" aptly titled \"Wolfenstein.\"  I was, yet again, blown away.  Now, I know these aren't the most fantastic graphics out there; I also bought \"Batman: Arkam Asylum,\" and those graphics blow \"Wolfenstein\" out of the water.  But to discredit \"Wolfenstein\" for sub-par graphics in today's age of \"seen it all played it all\" is just splitting hairs.  The graphics are good; the graphics are damned good.  Playability is fairly easy, though I kept throwing grenades when I wanted to look through my gun sights (my bad); like I said, I haven't used a game controller since Super NES over a decade ago, and I took to it like a fish to water (albeit bullet-filled water).But you're probably already a gamer of sorts, so let's get to the game itself: The story is so-so.  Not bad, could be better. Several levels remind me of \"Return\" quite a bit (a dig site, some of the house layouts), and the enemy AI isn't all that great.  Also, the game ends fairly quickly--I did not know I was playing the final boss until the credits rolled after I beat him.Still, I highly recommend \"Wolfenstein\" for anyone who grew up with the game, or anyone who just enjoys a nice, supernatural-fueled first-person shooter.  The graphics are good for the genre, and the Veil is a nice additional touch here; it's not the greatest thing since sliced bread, and God knows I'd trade it for a pair of .45 pistols and a Tommy gun, but it's enjoyable nonetheless.  Take it for what it is: a thrill ride full of Nazis, beasties, and a suspenseful fight on a zeppelin.  Yes, a zeppelin.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2009"}

With each Fable game released, many bold promises were made as to the gameplay and the features...many of which were nowhere to be found.  Admittedly though, some of the promises of prior games find their way into the sequel, so it's not all bad.  Here we have Fable III now, and it is a vast improvement over what Fable II had to offer.  Unfortunately, it also suffers from a few problems...This game takes place approximately 50 years after the events of Fable II.  You are the son or daughter of the hero from the second game...prince or princess of Albion.  Your older brother is the current king, and he is not well-liked.  From the beginning, King Logan is presented as a tyrant and overall monster of a ruler.  You are immediately given a heart-wrenching choice that will pretty much assure that you as the player will come to loathe Logan as much as the citizens of Albion do.  From here it is up to you to gather an army and overthrow the king, then take his place as the ruler of the kingdom.  The premise of the game is simply great, and you the adventure that follows, more-or-less satisfying.  I'll actually say that aside from some odd pacing it's not a bad game at all.  Looking back, however, I really wish the game had more to it.  First off, the main adventure is really short for an RPG.  You can get through the game EASILY in 8 hours.  That's assuming you play only the storyline and not partake in any sidequests or any Sims-esque family moments (more on this later).  The main story has you traveling to a handful of locations to help the local citizens.  Once they get what they want they ask you to promise to better their town and will join your army.  Some will ask you to find an item or kill a monster, others simply want you to do a certain number of sidequests.  The problem is that the quests you must undertake are brief, underdeveloped and not challenging in any way.  The actual rebellion is one of the most anticlimactic moments in recent video game history.  You begin that mission at the end of the battle, and only need to walk down a couple of streets to the castle.  This is pretty much a perfect description of most of this game.  Once you become king, you're given \"365 days\" to raise a monumental amount of gold in order to fund an army to defend against an impending invasion.  However, after the first \"day\", your count goes down to around 329.  After the next, it's around 250...then 120...then the final battle begins.  Your time as king can be completed in little more than an hour.  And the activities while you're king involve listening to two proposals on various social issues and deciding which one you like best.  Occasionally, a short fetch quest is introduced as well.  The biggest problem with all this is that none of the missions...not a one...is fleshed out enough to feel as though you're accomplishing anything.  They're all over in minutes and the resulting victory feels empty.  By the way, death in this game means nothing, as you'll immediately respawn right where you died, and the \"punishment\" for dying is completely insignificant.As Fable is famous for, you can indulge in a variety of activities apart from the main adventure.  You can woo a townsperson, marry them and have children.  Or you could just go around annoying every person you run across.  This is all done with a new system of interaction.  In Fable II, you would open a sort of \"expression wheel\" and choose whether you wanted to whistle, dance, fart or make chicken noises, for example.  In Fable III, this has been done away with.  Instead you press A to go into \"interaction mode\".  Then, you're given only two choices: a sociable gesture or an obnoxious one.  Exactly what gesture you're allowed to do is chosen completely at random, thus taking away a lot of the fun of socializing with the locals.  This lack of choice is evident throughout the entire infrastructure of the game.  In Fable II, certain actions were mapped to the D-pad and could be accessed whenever you liked.  In Fable III, these options seem to only be available whenever the game feels like offering them to you.  Also, Fable III has completely done away with inventory management.  You'll collect potions and other knick-knacks, but you can't ever see them or select them.  Potions are usable only when you're prompted to do so.  You can gift other items, but quite frankly I never figured out how.  This is because there are virtually no menus in Fable III.  The only aspect that has menus are saving your game, loading your game and adjusting the game settings.  Everything else is done via The Sanctuary.  By pressing the Start button at any time, you're whisked away to a room that has a map in the center (for viewing the map) and several rooms at the end.  There's a room to change your attire, a room to equip weapons and magic, a room for your finances and a room for multiplayer.  To do any of these things, you need to physically walk your character to the room, up to the wall to select what you want and then move on.  While it's not all bad (and it does add a certain charm), it can get a bit tedious.  Also, since there are no menus or anything, it's hard to figure out how to do certain things.  There's definitely a learning curve involved, though once you know it, it's not so bad.Also, this game is buggy!  Graphical glitches abound, with clipping, tons of texture pop-in and some of the worst slowdown and framerate drops I've seen this gaming generation.  Even when movement on the screen is minimal, the game will slow down to a crawl.  This is especially frustrating when you're doing one of the local jobs which require you to press buttons in a timed sequence.  It makes these jobs flat-out unplayable.  The glowing sparkly trail that tells you where to go is also erratically inconsistent.  It'll appear and disappear seemingly at will, and sometimes lead you into walls.  At one point it disappeared on me permanently.  In order to avoid wandering aimlessly for hours, I had to reboot the game.  However, as far as graphics are concerned, they're generally pretty good aside from the glitches.  Albion has never looked better.  The character models have thankfully been updated and look less awkward as well.  The pre-rendered cutscenes, however, look awful!  They're so compressed that they'd look at home on a last-generation console, as they move slowly and look blurrier than the actual game.Overall, however, one can't really ignore the absolute charm this game has.  The humor is awesome...much better-written than Fable II.  In fact, just about every aspect other than the menu situation is better than Fable II.  Wandering around Albion is just fun, and even though the game is mechanically flawed, there's still a fun time to be had here.  I just wish there was more to the adventure...enough to live up to the grandeur that this game implies.  Albion itself just feels smaller, and the game suffers because of it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2010"}

While ostensibly about coming to power and ruling a kingdom, the shallow delivery and simplified gameplay make it less complex and interesting than it needs to be.Like previous games, Fable 3 puts the player in the role of a \"Hero\", who can be customized and affected by various aspects of their character, such as their combat style and moral standing. In this game, the \"hero\" is a prince or princess rebelling against their corrupt and evil brother. The goal of the game is to claim the throne for one's own, although this eventually turns out to be the same linear quest-line that the other Fable games have used - there's no opportunity to recruit allies on your own, you just get what the plot provides for you.In previous games, advancement was done by spending EXP that you earned by doing different task types. In this game, you get \"guild seals\" through combat, interaction, and quests, which you use to unlock new abilities on the \"Road to Rule\". The RtR is a linear path that opens up as you progress through the game, meaning that you can only go so far at one time before you need to do more plot/story stuff. This extends to a bunch of side-activities, like making friends and buying property - as in, these things can only be unlocked once you've gone far enough in the game, which seems like a cheap attempt to force people to move along the main path.The combat of Fable 3 is based on three approaches: \"Strength\" (melee), \"Skill\" (ranged), and \"Will\" (magic). This has been simplified from previous games. For one thing, your weapons are now automatically upgraded as you progress through the game. There are some non-standard weapons, but these require large amounts of investment to upgrade (one gun has \"kill 500 undead\" as an upgrade qualification, when it's possible to only kill roughly that many enemies of all different kinds across the entire game). The only neat feature of the weapons is that your \"main\" weapons change shape based on how you progress in the game; hidden achievements will shape your weapon's appearance, such as a bone handle for killing the undead or a pearly one for using the \"shock\" spell frequently.Magic has been simplified, as well. In Fable 1, there was a \"mana\"-style limitation on how many spells you could cast. In Fable 2, this was removed in favor of charging times to cast different spells. In Fable 3, spells like \"slow time\" and \"summon creature\" have been made into potions, and the only spells that can be cast are direct attack spells like fireball or lightning bolt. This simplification was clearly intended to make the game flow better, but instead it just makes it so there's really no drama to any battle - you just do the same thing, over and over, for a hundred different battles.One thing that Fable 3 attempted was to get rid of the heads-up display almost entirely. Health is no longer measured, but regenerates after a while - the only indication of its existence is the fact that as you get hit the screen gets a little bit redder. The \"emote wheel\" of previous games has been dropped; instead, you interact with people and use a predetermined \"nice\" or \"mean\" emote. Oddly, the first \"nice\" option is always dancing - even though this is for a complete stranger, and there's a perfectly serviceable \"shake hands\" option that doesn't show up until you've already done a few other actions. In addition, for someone to go from an \"acquaintance\" to a \"friend\", you have to do an annoying little fetch quest for them - and you'll have to do this for everyone you want to make into a friend, which means that apart from getting you more \"guild seals\" it's barely worth it.The main menu has been replaced, too, with an in-game location: the sanctuary. This is probably the most obvious and annoying change, as rather than simply pausing the game to look at your inventory, status, and so on, you have to literally teleport to a different location, which sort of messes up any sense of continuity when you can be in the middle of a fight, hit start, and be instantly teleported to your safe-house to change clothes and weapons. One very important aspect of this is that there is no longer a map that you can use without teleporting back to your sanctuary - and the map in the sanctuary is basically only usable for buying property in towns, which means there's no \"actual\" map of the various wilderness areas you have to travel through.As mentioned, the actual draw of Fable - the ability to do things other than the main quest - has been played down, in a way. You can't do a bunch of things until you unlock the ability to do so by going through the main quest, and the world itself is pretty boring and drab. There's a few attempts to make different towns and locales, unlike in Fable 2 (there's an industrial town, a gypsy-like town, a hippie commune, and so on), but it's all pretty dull. You can get married (heterosexually or homosexually), but the interactions are so shallow that it's even less worth it than it was in previous games. The one potentially-neat thing about the game is the cooperative gameplay, which is far more fleshed out than in Fable 2. In Fable 3, not only can you have another hero in your game, but heroes can get married and even have kids (or adopt). Still, cooperative play is usually good to begin with, so this isn't really in Fable 3's favor, per se.Overall, Fable 3 is a disappointment. There are a lot of places where it seems like they could have actually done something good, but the need to simplify and streamline everything held both the story and the gameplay back. It doesn't feel like there's that much content - interaction is boring, combat is boring, and the actual development of your character isn't that much of a big deal. Overall, Fable 3 gets a 4/10; the production values are decent (if a bit buggy), but in terms of inspiration it's a pretty bad game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2010"}
{"product_name":"B006W41W82","description":"","reviewerName":"Bart Motes","summary":"Almost perfect","reviewText":"The XP300 is a fantastic headset that gets almost everything right.Pros:* Immersive high quality sound, comparable to the X12.* Mobile phone bluetooth integration works perfectly. When you receive a call,* Set up is painless.* Chat audio quality is excellent.* Battery life is decent--should get you through all but the longest sessions. Best to recharge every night, though.Cons:* Chat bluetooth turns itself off too frequently.* Difficult to tell if you have chat bluetooth activated/on until you go five minutes without hearing anyone speak.Tweaks/Other issues:* I played Mass Effect 3 entirely using this headset. At first my heart sank because the dialogue was utterly incomprehensible. A press of the \"sound field\" button made the voices sound perfect. Whew.* Turning the bluetooth on the controller on before turning on the headset appears to give a more consistent connection.* Be careful of leaving your headset on, walking away and answering a phone call on your paired mobile! The range is spectacular. Your phone will default to the paired headset if it is on.* You can get away with a few sessions without recharging the headset, but its better move to plug it in every night.* If you are connecting your xbox to your tv via HDMI, you probably need an analog work around to get sound to your headset.Here's Mike's original post (located here, if you want to mark helpful:Hdmi Cable and Adapter for Xbox 360)on how to do this:\"The cable that came with my xbox would block the hdmi port when plugged in, so I couldn't plug both an hdmi cable and digital audio in at the same time (my receiver doesn't have hdmi). However, it is a fairly easy process to remove the plastiic casing around the cable with the digital audio and then both will fit - and it works like a charm.Just take a flat edge screwdriver to the crease in the side of the casing, give it a light tap with a hammer if necessary, and the plastic casing will pop off. Once this is done, both cables fit without a problem. You may want to wrap with electrical tape once the casing is removed.\"Overall, I am very pleased with the xp300. It provides excellent sound quality while eliminating tethering wires. The design decision to have chat bluetooth turn off with inactivity in order to save battery life was not a good one by Turtle Beach, but overall this headset is as good as it gets.Highly Recommended. Less one star for the bluetooth chat issue, otherwise perfect.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2012"}

I decided to give the game a shot at a friend's house, and I found myself completely glued to the TV for three hours, missing Thanksgiving dinner which is arguably the best meal of the year, depending on your family and their cooking skills. It was on Thanksgiving I finally decided it was time for me to buy a PS2 and lose myself in a sea of Metal Gear Solid. After two agonizing weeks of waiting for PS2s to actually be in stock anywhere, I finally had the system and game in hand. No one heard from me for the next three days.As you may already know, Snake Eater takes place in the 1960s, in the age of the Cold War and Cuban missile crisis, and you do not play as the same Snake from the series' previous games. I could go into detail about the story and the game's characters and talk for ages, but I won't. Metal Gear Solid, despite its failings in Sons of Liberty, has always been about a cinematic engrossing storyline, and Snake Eater is no exception. That said, the less you know about the story before you play, the better. Rest assured the classic Metal Gear trappings are all here and there are many surprises, twists, and revelations that put this a step above the other games. Don't take the fact that I'm refusing to go into the story the wrong way; I just have to ask you to take my word for it when I say that when the curtain finally closed, I found the story to be one of the most well-written and memorable I've ever encountered, videogames and otherwise. The amount of character development squeezed into the last half hour alone make this game well worth the price.There are many new gameplay elements that will be foreign to even a Metal Gear veteran, and the first thing that's noticeably different in this edition of MGS is the emphasis on stealth. While the game has always been about stealth, your ability to blend in and stay out of sight is more focused and important in Snake Eater. You're exposed to the importance of stealth early on, and you'll spend as much time hiding in the grass as you will running and gunning. There are different camouflage outfits and face paints to find and wear, and these all affect how easily the enemy can spot you, ranging from spotting you across the play area to walking right past you without them even glancing in your direction. You're given a Camo Index to help show you just how well hidden you are, and while it's not necessary and fairly obvious which camo suits do the best job in a given area, it does help in picking out an outfit at certain points. To accent these new elements, your trusty radar is absent and you will have to rely on sight and sounds to detect enemies before they detect you, and act accordingly. This tends to slow down the pace of the game, but tuning in to the game's environments and essentially hunting foes down can be unexpectedly tense and very fun. While the constant overhead view can lead some to frustration in not being able to see ahead of yourself, it really encourages you to be more cautious and it was only minutes after complaining about it that I wound up not really minding.The additions don't stop at the new focus on remaining hidden at all times. You also have to monitor your health and any injuries you take. To handle this, you are given a Cure option in your menu, and you treat and heal wounds using items you would use in real life like bandages, ointments, stitches, and splints; all of which you'll come across in the field. On paper, it's a fine idea, but the ability to do this any time you like (say, in the middle of a boss fight as soon as you take a hit) turns it into more of a chore than an element of realism, and when you're in the middle of an intense firefight or battle, pausing to cure yourself of bullet wounds or cuts is a drag and pulls you out of the intensity of the fight. Unfortunately, this aspect is not optional.To make sure you keep track of your injuries and treat them accordingly, the way your health bar works has been changed as well. Your health steadily recharges over time, depending on your stamina, which is shown underneath your health and will decrease over time.. At full stamina, you recover health at a rather speedy pace, and with no stamina, you recover none. Injuries will also impede your health recharging, but the meat of the health bar is your stamina level, which you keep up by eating animals you catch in the wild. Snakes, elk, birds, crabs, and fish are all on the menu, among other things. Some food will give you more stamina than others, and as you catch and try out the different foods, you'll learn what to stay away from and what to stock up on. It's easy to forget about this element, especially later in the game, and if you aren't careful, you'll end up at a difficult area with no stamina, which will make it harder to aim correctly and such. While it's certainly possible to get through such a situation without stamina, recovering health automatically is the only way to recover health, so if you don't have any food you're out of luck.Controlling Snake is pretty much as it was in Sons of Liberty and Twin Snakes. The game makes use of the Dual Shock's analog buttons, which is great since I haven't seen much use of them outside of racing games and jumping height. The sneaking, fighting, and shooting elements are all essentially the same aside from a few alterations and additions. The gameplay can feel a little dated at times, and while other series are reinventing themselves like Resident Evil, Snake Eater sticks to the tried and true methods of its predecessors, which isn't that big of a deal since it goes above and beyond in its other aspects, such as environmental detail and storytelling.Speaking of the game's environments, Snake Eater really pushes things on the PS2 as far as they can go in this generation of games. The soft blur over the entire game gives it a realistic touch, and everything from the grass glowing in the sun to character models look great. Face models are especially impressive, and the level of detail in the facial work is worthy of commendation. The wide range of realistic expressions all the characters show is one of those things missing in many games. A character with the same static expression or maybe two or three of them keeps you grounded in the fact that you are playing a game. But Snake Eater is full of subtle and not so subtle touches like this (in and out of gameplay) that really help you get lost in it, and much like the story, are best to be seen for yourself instead of just listening to me ramble about them and how great they are.Rounding out the game's huge environments is the sound and music, two areas the MGS series has always excelled at. The sound effects are all very realistic aside from a few humorous touches thrown in to lighten the mood at points. The music, done by Harry Gregson-Williams, is on par with that of a big budget Hollywood film. No matter what situation Snake is in, the music fits with it perfectly and does a lot towards heightening the mood and action. I even ended up liking the game's main theme song I initially hated, and its use in a few moments of gameplay wound up feeling right. And of course, who could forget the voice acting. Again, following in the footsteps of the first two MGS games, the game's characters are voiced by top-notch performers. David Hayter is back as Snake, and all the newcomers do a good job with their roles, particularly the stars of the show.Now, before I go off on a tangent for the next few paragraphs about how much I love the game, I will go into the problems I have with it. First of all, there's the codec transmissions. More specifically, the people on them. Characters like Major Zero and Paramedic aren't as interesting to talk to and identify with as in, say, MGS1. In the first MGS, Campell and Naomi were not only helpful, but important elements of the story. Indeed, Zero and Paramedic are both involved in the big picture, but I ran into no character development while talking to them and hardly ever felt like contacting them, as opposed to MGS1 where I would call my contacts all the time to hear what they had to say.There are also some parts where the gameplay drags a bit. While each area is certainly beautiful and interesting, some of the indoor sections really magnify the game's quirks, some of which people may find unforgivable. Considering how polished the outdoor environments are and how it requires a completely different strategy that you've spent hours fine-tuning, being back inside a building was a complete switch from laying on the ground in the grass, and it really put me off.Another issue I had was the boss fights. While the fights themselves were all different and fairly interesting, only one of them really stood out in my mind, which is the sniper battle against The End. It's clearly a love it or hate it situation, considering it's a very long game of cat and mouse. This was one of the times where hunting the enemy approached a zen attitude, where patience and clever thinking pay off. The other fights are all fine and good, but not nearly as memorable. None of the Cobra Unit bosses got very much development either, which led to you becoming detached from the fight and not really caring about it or outcome. While that isn't a lot of complaining, these few things really did bother me during the game, and continue to in retrospect.Snake Eater has a good amount of replayability, mainly because there's so much to do in the game. There are a dozen of ways to take down an enemy, and over two dozen ways to approach it. Experimenting with different items in your inventory and the environment, when coupled with your imagination, created an endless amount of possibilities, and that's easily the best part about the gameplay. The forest is your sandbox, and you're free to tool around in it however you please. Want to sneak by everyone undetected? Go for it. What about just running into the open, guns blazing? A little blunt, but it works. You could also find a different way to dispatch every enemy in the game, whether it's blowing them up, tranquilizing them, slicing their neck, knocking them out, holding them up, sending a swarm of bees after them, tossing a poisonous snake in their direction, distracting them with a book, surprise the lot of them by manning a gun turret, or just shoot them until they stay down. You've got a lot of freedom in the game, and its top notch presentation makes any decision seem like the best one.So, since I've mentioned the storytelling so much, let's actually get into it. This is truly where every aspect of Snake Eater shines, from its graphics and sound to the choreography, motion capture, and voice acting. The main draw of the game (and to some, what makes them shirk away) is really the story being told, and the game's beautiful cinemas rival that of a Hollywood production. While there are times when it feels like you're watching more than playing (and often it's true), it helps that the story is so good, and sometimes that will even be the motivating factor of getting through an area. MGS has always felt like an interactive movie, and Snake Eater accomplishes this in spades. That may be a turn-off to some people, but it isn't for me. The story is rich with intrigue, interesting characters, over-the-top action, and great design overall.Literally every aspect of Snake Eater comes together and works in unison for its massive (and perhaps a bit overdrawn) finale, brimming with confrontational battles, character development, emotion, and a sense of closure that was missing from the previous games. Never before has a game overloaded me with so much in every department all at once, and perhaps I'm a little star-struck by it all, but I loved every minute of it. There are boss fights that make the game well worth your hard earned cash, and that's not even considering the final hour or so, which is well beyond anything previously seen in the game or the two before it.When all is said and done, Snake Eater achieves what no other game can on such a level: complete immersion into an action-driven interactive movie. I loved the story and the main characters, I loved sneaking around in the woods ambushing baddies, experimenting with different ways of using my items and the environment, and I loved just staring at the game's gorgeous visuals. While other games like Katamari Damacy (I know, we're obsessed with that game; but with good reason) may be more 'fun,' no other game in 2004 toyed with my imagination and emotions more than Snake Eater did. It had a death grip on me for it's entire 18-hour adventure, and even now I'm reliving a few favorite moments from the ending in my head. Even with its shortcomings and slightly aged gameplay, I enjoyed every minute, enough to call this my personal Game of the Year for 2004. Consider this for a moment: I bought a PS2 specifically for this game. So, I essentially paid over $200 for Snake Eater, and am completely satisfied. That's got to be worth something.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2006"}

It' takes away the fun of playing the game. The japanese need to learn from western type rpg's and not \"over complicate the game play\" as games like Fable and Mass Effect have already figured out and are now doing.Ok now, let me put the brakes on the bitchin for a moment... does this mean that I hate final fantasy? No. I own 9 of these games with FF12 being my personal favorite out of the series. Does this mean that I think the gameplay should be dumbed down? No. I dont think the gameplay should be dumbed down to just simple \"button mashing\" so that a person with the attention span of a pineapple can enjoy playing it. What I do mean is this... I just wish that what I see on screen isn't blocked by too much \"words & numbers.\" Visually, I wanna appreciate what I see on' screen without words and numbers getting in the way. I also didin't like the fact that I have to spend hours and hours leveling up the characters, upgrading weapons & assembling them together with dumb items to make them stronger, and getting eidolons (those mighty pokemon type giant magical thing-a-ma-jiggy's that look really cool and are supposed to help you out in battle) but in truth, are useless and weak as wet cardboard. The camera in FF13 also moved around way too much during battle, I had no significant control over it, and I hated this while I was playing the game. Oh, and if anyone is wondering, yes, I did beat the game, and also, all 64 of the marks, or super bosses if you wanna call them this.Are jrpg's a dying breed? No, I don't think so. But I do think that the problem with most jrpg's is that what was fresh and exciting when they all first came out 10 or 20 years ago, has now been eclips by other rpg advancements in a gaming industry that quickly evolves. Instead of keeping' pace or leading the pack, jrpg's seems all too happy to just continue to say, \"if it aint broke, why fix it?\" and linger in the shadows' of other games, such as mmorpg's, fps, and platformers.

I loved it, so fun, difficult, beautiful and fun. Now this 1, is not the original. This 1 is longer, brighter and way HARDER. However, this isn't a bad thing, because it's still DKC for all intensive purposes. The environments are so gorgeous and lush. I have not beat it, hopefully I will, my game is progressing slowly because it's hard. Man, I have cussed outloud while playing this. The levels where you ride on a barrel are SO frustrating! My fingers just can't work fast enough. I'm an older player though. Now, if I was 10 again and playing this I might whirl right through it. Other folks are saying they find it to be hard too, so I'm not alone. This takes a lot of influences from Mario games. The bosses are actually easier then some levels...so far!

I mean, isn't the point of FPS games shooting? Well, not here folks. Always sneaking around shooting lights out... I screamed bloody murder when I tried sneaking up behind a guard so I could grab him only to find that the character simply punched the guard! Not what I wanted to do.... Controls feel a bit sluggish in this game too. It doesn't help that my manual is in French so I've had a hell of a time trying to figure out HOW he can do this or that... Fortunately, I played the original and I still think the original is better. The graphics are excellent and his movements are good, not great... I've shot guards in the head 4-5 times only to have them shoot me and kill me... Hmmmmm... They must have thick skulls... What really bugs me is that when I push the fire button, there's a slight delay before he actually shoots or, when he slugs a guard, he pauses before he swings again. I don't like that... too damned slow... all in all it's a better than average game.

Now they plow through, attack with whatever they have, push off zombies, and stay by your side as much as they can. Also the time mechanic is not so bad.

Well the game started out pretty good the levels were very challenging it seemed like every level was harder than the last (then again I was playing on brutal settings.). The game seemed to be pretty good, I like the idea of being a mercenary and going back and forth through the menu options (armory,cantina) But every now and then I wished the game was more gritty or be dark per say. What really drew my attention to starcraft 1 was the terrifying cut-scenes the gore the aggressive sounds of the zerg attacking your base, or the oh so funny sounds of the units after you click on them 5 or 6 times and overall dark soundtrack. I didn't really see that in Starcraft II.Starcraft II has these features but they just arnt as lively or \"matched up\" as the first one. Everything as far as being like the first one was kind of not there.The ending kind of felt like a previous level and didnt really pack a punch. So its hard to rate this game, I guess there was alot I expected for waiting 10 years and telling myself \"its alright man they are just taking longer because they want to perfect their art, dont worry it will be here soon.\"But alot of it was good, but pretty short and the ending leaves you hanging.

Even my cousin and his friends holds weekly tournaments with linked up Xboxes. He's visiting now so he brought his Xbox and I rented this game just to see the fuss. Well now I can see what they were talking about, if only for a few hiccups.Story: Probably the biggest bad ass since Dante from Devil May Cry, Master Chief finds himself in a struggle against the Covenant, who are using a massive structure called Halo to wipe out life on Earth. On Halo is an actual environment you can walk around. On this, is a strange alien race that also wants to use Halo.Sound/Music: Like Halo 2, this game has great music you can't help getting pumped at. It's like the perfect music to kick ass with. Voice acting is nice with the still hilarious Grunts providing their battle cries. Weapons obviously sound like weapons but there's not a lot to hear besides your footsteps.Gameplay: Since I played Halo 2 first, I missed having some things. The option to duel wield is nowhere to be found and I only found myself driving a Warthog and a Ghost and a Banshee. What got annoying during play was when you get shot and your health severely goes down forcing you to recharge your shield. Unfortunately, this thing is so bad that if you were to get shot during this, it stops the recharging which is really slow giving the tension that happens in battle. I died more on this one than Halo 2, which I guess means that one's easier.The level design is seriously crappy. In one stage, I went through a room, then down a lift, to the same damn room, down a corridor, down another lift, through the same room again! And this happened very often. Even when I thought it was done, there was STILL this same thing(you'll notice the arrows and the circular rooms, these rooms will repeat a lot). The other noticeable complaint is the lack of a map. I wandered around so many times hoping to find out where I'm going but Nav points, helpful indicators only happen so often, which means barely.Again, can't comment on multiplayer but I hear it's fun so I'm sure that's fun too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2005"}

They all said that it does not live up to the hype...THEY WERE SO WRONG. I mean, how much a game could hype up to be?Halo is a supreme game, a must-have for any Xbox owner or FPS/action fan. A true next-gen game for the true next-gen game console. It will definitely keep its title of &quot;Best Xbox Game&quot; for a while.Halo's game play is unparalleled, complete with out-of-this-world weapons and vehicles, state-of-the-art AI, and huge open environments, very well detailed and filled with all kinds of features like never before seen in any FPS game.No game is perfect, so Halo does have some issues of its own. They are quite minor and some might not even find them while playing. First, the multi-player levels could have been a lot better. Most of them are quite basic and there are very few of them, but I found the ones with vehicles and a few others to be an addictive next-gen multi-player experience.I would like to also add that there is not enough variety in the Covenant troops, you will encounter all of them in the third level of the game, but thanks to enemy vehicles you will have to face and other enemies you will later see in the last levels (no spoilers - you will find out who they are if you play the game), the variety of your foes is I must say...excellent...mostly, because they always use different tactics. Second, some indoor parts of the game are uninspired and repetitive, annoying, but rarely. Last, the savegame feature is old - you can only start playing a previously played level from scratch once you beat it. This is bad because Halo has some very long levels.On the plus side, it is the GRAPHICS. It will be a shame not to mention the stunning visuals of this brilliant game. Maybe on the first level (you only fight indoors there) your &quot;WOW factor&quot; is not going to be on overload, but your eyes will pop out and you won't be able to catch a breath when you explore the eye candy on the second level (results may vary though, if this does not happen to you when you play it, you need to get a better TV for your XBOX, chump). Second, it is needless to say that Halo's vehicles are amazing, and ally and enemy AI make it even better than amazing. Your allies and enemies react to your every action, allies will be cheering after you made a nice shot or used great tactics and took down lots of enemies, or they might even have some envy if you are doing better than them and kill enemies that they could have easily defeated, and they would work together to help you by providing cover fire, hop into the vehicles you manage to use, giving you important surveillance info, and much much more. Your enemies are just as impressive, they are very hard to outsmart and you might even recognize them by their intelligence. They will try to dodge bullets and grenades, use their vehicles with lots of skill, work together to kill you and your allies, flank you, surround you, weaken your opposition by destroying your allies if they do not succeed to kill you after many attempts, and they will even make you laugh! You will see a bunch of interaction between the marines on your side and the covenant enemies, and their tactics are never the same, so that means that you get much replay value. Both your allies and enemies have tons of taunts and phrases that they will say, like marines would have dialogs with each other, and the enemies would be wondering where you disappeared, and then try to get attention of their allies after they spot you again, they will be screaming if you threw a grenade at them or if they the odds of them winning a fire fight with you are quite low. There is a lot more about AI that I didn't mention - YOU HAVE TO see it for yourself! Like weapons, there are two types of vehicles you can have the time of your life on - Covenant and human. All of the weapons can be used to do a melee attack. On the human side, you have a jeep with a very nice minigun mounted on the back of it, and you have a big-a$$ tank (once you get your hands on it you will never want to let go of it). Alien Covenant has a banshee, an aircraft that is equally fun to both pilot and watch it and its pilot go down as you destroy it, and a ghost, a fast and maneuverable hovercraft-like vehicle. All the vehicles listed have their own weapons and the human ones can even have passengers. For some reason they make human vehicles invulnerable to destruction, while all levels can be conquered by foot without them. Weapons are great too, they are very well balanced and look and sound outstanding. I already mentioned that there are two types of weapons, but there are also two types of grenades. Human ones detonate quickly - no mercy here, while alien plasma grenades detonate after a few seconds after they are thrown, so those aliens have some time to escape, but the plasma grenades can stick to them (and make them go crazy) and detonate right on them - no mercy here also.Halo is a story-driven game, which includes some helpful cut scenes and a nice plot.Xbox controller is just awesome with this game; I even was once thinking that it was made exclusive for Halo. I don't care what people say about the Xbox controller, but it is perfect for Halo and other games I play on my Xbox. You also get lots of tweaks for the controller, you can even invert flight control when you pilot a banshee.Multiplayer aspect is super. You get numerous game mods and even co-op play. For now, multiplayer is great using the xbox system link (item # B00005R6YW, sold separately), so if you have a buddy who owns Halo like you, you will have even more fun with Halo together in multiplayer, especially in co-op play. In multiplayer, you can modify every game type to your own liking, it is a great addition, but there is quite a small number of maps, and quite a few of them are lacking. Multiplayer supports up to 16 players and LAN play, as well as about 20 customizable game types.Gameplay: 9/10Graphics and Sound: 10/10 Playability: 9.5/10Fun Factor: 10/10Overall: 9.6/10Pros: great graphics, sound, gameplay, replay value, plot, etc.Some really minor cons: not enough multiplayer levels, not a very balanced level design in the game (most levels are jaw-dropping, others are just plain great, few are not very good; some offer overwhelming variety, but few have repetitive gameplay like in any other today's shooter, like Wolfenstein, for example)In conclusion, Halo really stands out from all of the launch games. Those of you who do not see it, you need to wake up and open your eyes, Halo is the greatest. Xbox is nothing without Halo. It is not until Spring 2002 when you will see something that compares itself with Halo...It will be Unreal Championship...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2001"}

However, never owning an original Xbox, instead having both a PlayStation 2 and a GameCube, I figured it would be best to start off with the first game of the series.  So, I recently purchased Halo: Combat Evolved for the Xbox.  The game plays quite well on the Xbox 360, with the exception of minor frame-rate drops everytime multiple enemies occupy the screen at one time.  This is a minor problem, but the frame-rate is still smooth enough to allow for fluid gameplay.The story is quite compelling, and quite unique as well, and does a great job of grabbing the players' attention.  The story takes place in the distant future where space travel and planet colonization is standard practice by humans.  Humans have colonized a planet known as \"Reach\" and use this planet to genetically alter humans into cyborgs known as \"Spartans\".  This practice has infuriated an alien race known as The Covenant.  The Covenant has begun attacking the planet Reach and destroying Spartans and humans.  One ship manages to escape with a Spartan on board.  The ship is known as the Autumn Pillar, and the Spartan is Master Chief Petty Office John-117, better known as simply Master Chief.  Covenant begin boarding the Autumn Pillar, and leave Captain Keyes with no choice but to release Master Chief and other Marines in escape pods.  Before launching the pods, Master Chief picks up the central control of the ship, known as Cortana, and fuses her connection to his own cybernetic suit.  The two crash land and must find and gather any humans who have survived.  The two must then go on to rescue Captain Keyes, who has been captured by The Covenant and imprisoned on their ship.  Keyes issues a command to Master Chief to locate the control panel of the Covenant's main weapon, Halo.  Halo is a giant ring-like structure that contains massive energy and could cause serious extermination if activated.  Along the way to the control panel, Master Chief discovers that the Covenant have woken a dormant alien race known as the Flood.  Now the fight between humanity includes a new enemy, as the Flood continue to spread rapidly.  Master Chief is left facing some difficult decisions as the story progresses further.The gameplay consists of run and gun shooting that occurs at a fast pace.  Enemies are very intelligent on the higher difficulty levels, and even the inclusion of an automatically regenerating shield is sometimes not enough to survive the enemy onslaught.  The lands are very detailed, but sometimes can become extremely repetitive.  Many of the levels consist of the same room design repeated over and over again, making it feel like you aren't really getting anywhere and are simply running in circles.  Some levels become tedious at times, and the feeling of \"repetition\" begins to grow as the level progresses.  This rule definitely applies to the later levels where it feels as if you are simply re-entering the same two rooms over and over again in some sort of infinite loop, each time the rooms contain the same enemies as well, making the level feel even more repetitive.  Stages that aren't so repetitive are quite compelling and fun to play in, but these are limited to the first few stages, as the game progresses the level designs lose their luster, becoming mundane and boring.  The graphics hold up quite nicely for a last gen game, and the gameplay is smooth and addictive.  The weapons the player picks up from the enemies are very effective and with enemies appearing by massive quantities, it's always easy to find another weapon to replace your current one upon running out of ammunition.Another complaint I have regarding the original Halo: Combat Evolved is in regards to the controls of the vehicles.  Some vehicles such as the Ghost and Banshee pilot beautifully, giving the player amazing control over the vehicles.  However, the Warthog can be unruly and almost impossible to control and navigate, especially in tight corridors where obstacles are abundant.  This is what makes the last level of the game almost impossible to beat since the Warthog has such a hard time maneuvering properly without hitting obstacles.  The steering of the Warthog has greatly been corrected in the later games though, but in Combat Evolved it is a vehicle I like to try to avoid driving.Co-op is a great mode, and adding multiple users really makes the game even more exciting, especially on the higher difficulty levels.  The ability of players to \"re-spawn\" their allies when not in combat allows you to continue the level without excess dying.  Had the levels been more unique, and less repetitive, I would have given this game a perfect score, but with the repeating rooms, and lengthy stages, this game's flaws are too drastic to go unnoticed.  I enjoyed the game, and I can definitely see why people love this franchise.  The game is not as good as its sequels, due to poor level design, awkward Warthog steering, and fewer weapons, but it truly innovated shooters on many levels and has quickly become one of my favorite franchises ever.  If you want to follow the complete Halo storyline then you should start with Combat Evolved, but if you want to simply get the feel for Halo for the first time, I say skip Combat Evolved and start with Halo 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2010"}

The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow.

This will be the last game I buy from EA until this is stopped.Beyond that the game itself is pretty lame and lacking. Nothing you really do seems to effect the creature you create beyond the way you make it look and that gets kind of boring after the first 100 times you do it. I do not know, perhaps I am missing something but spending hours on end pulling tugging pushing on body parts to change then and paint a creature just isn't that exciting to me. I was expecting more involvement from the creatures in the world around you. Here all you do is befriend them which consist of you pushing a \"sing\", \"charm\" or \"pose\" button to mimic the other creature until it likes you. There is no other real interaction beyond that. On the other hand if you choose not to befriend them then you can kill off another species which is almost as lame a befriending them with its interaction. This game is pretty lacking in general when it comes to the level of interaction with the world/worlds. Even within you own species there is little to no interaction. I just don't get it. Again the only real point I see to the game at all is designing and painting a creature and the novelty of that wears of after the couple of hours.Save your money on this one and just download the creature creator if your so hell bent on making your own little creature as this game is pretty much a waste of money.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2008"}

Whatever your reasons are, I bought it for one reason and one reason only; to enjoy viewing of amazing scenery, beautiful graphics, and best of all, DOA girls. I'm pretty sure many people who played this game, whether it be from renting or owning, got it on their hands for the same reason that I bought it for. I'm sure there are some exceptions such as people who had to play for reviewing, got it as a present, or got it in any way without spending any money, but that doesn't change the fact that most of us are perverts and are fascinated by any sex related topics. However, many people are saying that they got it to play a volleyball game, but I find that hard to believe. Just think about this; why do you think that Tecmo developed a game like this? Because they know that most men are perverts and would get this so called \"game\" even when it's actually more of a soft porn rather than an actual game.Basically, my point is that it's really funny to see that many of you guys are saying that this game sucks when it's real purpose isn't even to be played but rather, drooled at. It's just too ironic that people rent or buy this game knowing what kind of \"game\" (or in my case, porn) this is, only to end up bashing about it. Ultimately, it would be better if everyone just admit that they bought it for different reasons than to play it and just enjoy this sexually welcomed and fantasized game. Lastly, I prefer paying $20 for a \"game\" (which can be played for hours )and porn put in one rather than an actual porn that only lasts a few hours. Besides, if your mother catches you playing this porn, you can pass it off as a game. Can you do that with an actual porn?For those who were forced to play or got this game for free, you ratings are perfectly reasonable. But then, once again, it wouldn't hurt to keep it in the shelves and pull it out every once in a while when you are in need of sexual desires. :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2008"}

Be warned, this game is not for everybody.  I'll give you the bad news before I give you the good.This game is way, way, WAYYYY too painfully short.  I read reviews proclaiming this very point and simply didn't believe them, convinced that only big nerds were writing them without the common player in mind.  I now humbly stand corrected.  It is stigmatizing how short this game is.  There simply is not enough content in this game.  The monsters are too few and too weak, especially when you consider that Rygar is wielding a weapon as potent as the diskarmor.  Most of the enemies simply roll over and die without putting up even a minimal fight, even the bosses.There isn't enough of a hunt and seek type feel to this game either.  Most of the items you need for your quest turn up along the path; you just follow along to the next objective and pick up whatever you need along the way.  For an adventure styled game, that just doesn't quite cut it; especially when you consider that Rygar's ancestor for the NES frontiered that type of play.On a minor note, the voice acting and dialogue is absolutely horrifying and unconvincing.  This makes it a little more difficult to get into the story.Now, on to the good.  The visuals in this game are brilliant and stunning. Simply put, they are some of the best on the PS2 for the moment.  The level Arcadia, the floating city, is quite a spectacle, the backgrounds are amazing and is truly something to behold.  The animation is sometimes a little wierd, granted, but overall the backgrounds, the enemies exploding after being beaten sensless by the diskarmor, and the models themselves are all gorgeous.Beyond the cosmetic qualities comes the diskarmor itself.  This for me was the best part of the game.  The diskarmor is awesome.  It's one of the coolest weapons I've ever seen any character sport in a video game in a long time, and the combos and attack sequences are really cool and fun to use.  You can beat up on enemies in so many ways it's rediculous, from swinging them around as a whip against other enemies to juggling them sensless in the air.  The diskarmor was a unique idea that I really was impressed with, I just wish they'd have given you opportunity to use it more.The soundtrack is AMAZING!  The moscow symphony did an entire original score for the game, and it truly must be heard to be believed.  It's masterful; if it was released on cd for purchase I'd definetely but it, and I rarely buy soundtracks from games even when they are good.The general story of the game is pretty cool too.  It's not the best in the world and at times it's more than a little cheesy (dialogue is TERRIBLE), but overall it's a fun plot.Overall, this game has moderate replay value and is actually much better through once you get to the harder difficulty settings; otherwise it's just too flippin easy.  If you're a casual gamer it may be right up your alley, but more hardcore players may be left half-empty after playing this. ... However, if you're looking for a more serene, beautiful game with great visuals, a stunning soundtrack, and good character design, look no further than this game.  I really enjoyed playing this game and will likely play it again, I just wish there would have been more of it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2003"}

It follows Zack, who you see a reference to near the middle of the events in FFVII, and also introduces many of the major hitters in FFVII.Unlike how FFVII plays (Traditional JRPG), Crisis Core is an Action RPG.  The game is a lot more linear than FFVII, mostly due to the limitations of the PSP vs. the PS.  This does not mean you can't go back to previous places to talk to NPC's and get Missions, which are critical to fully developing Zack and getting Materia/Equipment that can't be obtained through any other means in the game.

Boasting new difficulty levels and a massive number of new action-packed missions to complete, and colossal amounts of special bonus features including content from both Hurricane Packs 1&2, the new Ninja Gaiden: BLACK is the must have game for all action lovers from casual to hardcore. Hidden unlockables including the original arcade version of Ninja Gaiden,Ninja Ryukenden, available for the first time on a video game console","reviewerName":"Abhilash.R \"The Sagittarian\"","summary":"The Experience...........","reviewText":"Ever since Team Ninja's mercurial Tomonobu Ithagaki stated that Ninja Gaiden would be the greatest and most challenging action game ever, his remarks were often scoffed as a desperate attempt to garner a few pages of publicity. However, once Ninja Gaiden was unleashed on the unsuspecting public, only one question keeps popping up - \"Just how in God's name has Tecmo come up with this blinder ? Seriously, I wanna know !\"The answer lies somewhere in between. Team Ninja boasts frightening talent and has created fanatically popular action titles. They've had some pretty average stuff like DOA:Beach Volleyball so speculation was expected. But Ninja Gaiden was not some average franchise.If ever the classic 2D game was to be revitalised, it had to be done so in all its 3D visual glory, coupled with never before seen action. At the helm of this impossible hope was Ithagaki. In the course of developing the game, he had only one command. 'Quality'.And quality it certainly was. Ninja Gaiden, simply put, is the most visceral, frenetic and challenging action game made to date. Coupled with spectacular graphics and an eclectic soundtrack, gamers around the world just couldn't get enough of Ryu Hayabusa. But Tecmo didn't create a game that was accessible to all. Hell no. If you are a casual gamer, you'll get roasted. The AI of your adversaries is spectacular, to say the least. Even at Normal mode, Ninja Gaiden makes sure that you put in your best effort to earn those well deserved rewards. Nothing is easy. Team Ninja took great risk in making the game overtly challenging. Despite the high production values that force most studios to play safe, they held to their principle of forcing the player to fight every inch of the way. And the risk paid off as Gaiden garnered critical acclaim and spawned an entire community of fanatical gaming freaks. And don't let me start about the full motion videos that get unlocked as you progress. They are of unmatched, unrivalled quality. Ninja Gaiden truly is an amazing accomplishment.And after a year of gasping breath, Tecmo has unleashed its greatest game edition called Ninja Gaiden Black. And for a price of 29.99$, the more pertinent question to be asked is, \"Is it worth it?\". The answer, is an absolute YES!.Black has the same content of the original and much more. Apart from the identical story progression, Black has four extra unique standouts - Ninja Dog difficulty, Costume unlocks, Hurricane Packs and the Mission mode. Ninja Gaiden was criticed as being too tough for casual players, even on Normal mode. Ninja Dog mode bridges that problem but it isn't accessible directly. After a set number of successive deaths in Normal mode, the game asks you if you'd want to play on a lesser difficulty. If accepted, you'd have to face the igonimy of wearing a pink armband as a sign of submission to Ayane(another character from the DOA and NG universe). This is an amusing insult to your ego but at least you'll find the game much easier to complete. Completing the game in Normal or Dog mode will unlock higher difficulty modes that, safe to say, are just that....tough!. So refine those rusty moves of yours!.As I mentioned above, costumes also get unlocked and there are around five of them, and all look great while the standout (Ashtar) is immensely cool. The ubiquitous Hurricane Packs, that originally could be downloaded through XBox Live, is now available directly from the menu. The unique Lunar staff is now freely available at the beginning of the game and the ultra cool Kitetsu is upgradeable and it doesn't drain your life either. The famous Intercept technique, that was introduced in the HPs, is now toned down to challenge the gamer a lot more. So that makes HPs, Hard and Very Hard difficulty much harder than the original. But hold on. If you thought that HP2 was tough, you haven't played Master Ninja mode. It seems that only one developer in Tecmo could complete it, albeit after many deaths, screams and a few broken controllers. And I can see why. The first section itself taught me humility. It is the toughest setting of this generation and even hardcore players (myself included) will be brought to their knees. I am in no mental or physical (read button-mashing) shape to play this difficulty, yet. But I will. It's my holy grail to perfection.However, the highlight of the entire package is the Mission mode, which gets unlocked after the Very Hard mode (I believe). This is the real killer App in the game, wherein you get to face hordes of fiends displaced over 50 different scenarios. Each mission puts you in a unique locale with limited potions and weapons. Some either have just dozens of fiends feasting on you while others force you to complete the level with a particular weapon(s) only. The various locals from the original story form the setting for these missions so you'd naturally feel familiar with the environment if you played the game. But I wont say the same for the adversaries who are brutal, tough and fast. The levels progressively get harder and some have over 3 bosses (with minions) at the same time!. Talk about mercilessness by Tecmo. But that's what brings such fantastic replayability to Ninja Gaiden. You always improve. And just like in the HPs, you can upload your scores and get to boast at you less skilled brethren. Amen.Along with the above mentioned additions, you are also treated to some more of the sensational minimatics that Tecmo is so good at. There is some story progression in these vids, but I wouldn't say much. It's glorious eye-candy, for sure. And coming to the graphics, do we really need to get to the specifics ?. Ninja Gaiden, being a year old, is still one of the best looking console games. Black simply refines the visuals by adding more polygons and sharpening the animation and body texture. The environments have been lovingly rendered and you'll always find subtle touches to each level that amplify their beauty. Level design is as always, brilliant. Next gen titles surely would look to the Gaiden franchise for inspiration. Gameplay is just as amazingly fluid and I find very little slow down even in the most intense battles. The combat also boasts the tightest response from your controller and it is real joy. The camera that got fixed in the HPs is the same here and w.r.t the blazingly fast combat, it does just fine. No complaints. The soundtrack is just as eclectic and it works really well as you progress deeper into the Gaiden universe. Overall, this is one complete game.I can go on indefinitely, but you really must savour what this edition has brought forth yourself. Astonishingly, Ninja Gaiden Black seems to improve over the original in almost every way. Tecmo did not sit on their laurels and instead, gave us a game that will raise them to the pantheons of perfection. Ninja Gaiden Black IS perfect, in every conceivable way, right down to its price. No gamer worth his salt should forgo this experience. It is a game that is hard to replicate and even harder to master. But Tecmo has proven it can do both and the ultimate winner here is you and I. If you were overwhelmed by the original, turn around and buy this one. You will finally understand what makes Ninja Gaiden so special. I will sign off by saying that if there is any game that has redefined perfection, it is Ninja Gaiden Black. Enjoy and have a nice day.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2005"}

Featuring detailed environments and complicated new battle mechanisms, this game demands a different kind of perspective than the first-person shooters from the original Halo series. You'll need to uncover the hidden strengths and weaknesses of each unit and play them to your tactical advantage, and that's just the beginning.UNSC: Be Part of a Legendary ConflictThe story opens with UNSC forces retaking the planet Harvest from the Covenant. At your disposal -- should you choose to take command of UNSC forces -- will be everything from a corps of highly-trained Marines to the Warthogs, Scorpions, and Hornets you'll need for air and land attacks. You'll take stock of the map and decide between holding your ground or advancing on enemy strongholds, all while trying to navigate the local terrain and outsmart Covenant forces. And when you need something extra to tip the tide in your favor, UNSC leaders can provide you with the ability to mobilize highly specialized units or call the Spirit of Fire vessel for support from above.Covenant: A Capable, Playable Enemy FactionThat's right, Covenant is playable in this corner of the Halo universe. This alliance of alien species has manipulated advanced technology, firepower, and tactical prowess into a powerful force that is engaged in a Genocidal war against human race, having branded humans as heretics. With the ability to play as these tough, alien fighters, you'll have advanced shield technology, the modular Citadel at the heart of Covenant's colonizing power, and, of course, the iconic Scarab attack vehicle at your disposal, adding a whole new dimension to your strategic warfare. The Scarab is a terrifying military vehicle crafted from heavy mining equipment. And with a mining laser that delivers massive damage across battlefields large and small, turrets for taking on air attacks, and the ability to clamber over any terrain, what's not to love about commanding Scarabs instead of fighting against them?Developed Exclusively for Xbox 360Most console RTS games are adapted from existing PC games, which can make their controls bulky or awkward, butHalo Warshas been developed for Xbox 360 from the ground up. This means the controls are sensitive, intuitive, and easy-to-operate in the midst of battle. And the UI is just as intuitive, so whether you're managing a unit of marines or a deadly machine, you can focus on creating a battle strategy instead of worrying about how to overcome a clumsy controller.No matter which faction you choose to play as, you can test your skills against those of other players in online skirmishes that allow up to six players with the New Xbox Experience through Xbox LIVE.","reviewerName":"J.S. Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"One GLARING omission...","reviewText":"I'm an RTS junkie.  I have nearly every RTS game on the Xbox.  That of coruse doesn't mean I PLAY a lot of RTS games on the Xbox, because most of them are terrible, crash, lag like crazy, etc.Here's the goods and bads of Halo WarsThe graphics are simple, but they work.  There's really nice lighting effects, shading, dimension, etc.  It works.  It won't win awards, but it works.The game is SOLID - no lagging, no crashing, even in HUGE conflicts with multiple units running around.  I've never had a single problem, and that's a FIRST for a console RTS.The controls are easy.  I've never seen a shorter learning curve on a console RTS.  The options stay in the same place with every building or unit.  You quickly get to the point where you can point, click, flick-click and exit out of the menu, and have 100% confidence that what you wanted, you'll get.Now, the bad stuff...Halo Wars left out the most important part of an RTS game - the ability to create groups.  A lot of times you end up with critical units - units that MUST survive - for whatever reason.  But you have no way to select just that unit, or MORE IMPORTANTLY, select every unit BUT that unit.  One of my favorite ways to play RTS games is to build fleets of identical size and unit counts.  Each fleet will have everything from infantry to assault vehicles.  I then flank my enemy from multiple directions with these fleets, stretching their resources thin until my three fleets effectively reach \"the middle,\" and wipe out the bad guys.This strategy simply isn't possible with Halo Wars.  You can do it once - the initial attack.  You'll have to group your fleets in common areas, select the area and issue the command.  Once the groups have begun to spread or mingle with each other, you can't separate them anymore.  How in the world you can build an RTS without the grouping feature is beyond me.The units are pretty weak - they die easily.  The unit counts are low - too low to support defense strategies with any more than 2 or 3 bases.  The bases themselves are a total dissapointment.  As another reviewer commented, they're \"cookie cutter\" bases.  Each base consists of a central \"hub\" with anywhere from 3 to 7 \"pods\" around it, and you can selet what you want in each pod.  There's no feeling of \"home\" with any base - no pride in your design - and that kills it.Halo Wars is a flawless interface with a sub-par RTS game.  It's not bad, but it certainly isn't great.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2009"}

Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"Makes Rock Band 1 look like \"Suck\"","reviewText":"Eh, maybe not my most creative review title...I won't say much here.  Rock Band 2 took Rock Band 1's flaws and did away with them.Rock Band 1 was a great game, but fell flat on it's face if you didn't have a lot of friends who lived nearby.  I'm almost 30 years old.  I don't have a lot of friends who have time or interest in coming to my house to play video games.  So when I couldn't progress in Rock Band 1 because it requires two or more players to progress through the \"World Tour,\" I was literally FORCED to stop playing.No more!!!  Rock Band 2 not only let's you progress through World Tour by yourSELF, but also allows you to jump online and be joined by friends as \"stand-in\" players.  The best part - your friends continue to earn money and achievements for playing with you.  It may not progress THEIR band, but you can alway take turns swapping bands to help each other out.  The difference this makes is absolutely remarkable, and it gives the game incredible depth.Other than that, RB2 is essentially identical.  The playability feels the same, the characters are pretty similar, etc.  I'd really like to see a deeper character customization, but in reality, you never see your own character that much - you're reading notes.  A replay mode would be cool maybe - where you could just watch your band rock out, but how long would that really be entertaining?Yes, some better songs would be great.  I don't know who picks some of this stuff.  But the truth remains that you'll never make everyone happy, and though there are probably a dozen songs I could live without, there are also a few dozen that I can just play over and over and over again.  It's really not Harmonix's fault - the music biz is a nightmare when it comes to licensing, rights, etc.  Believe me - I used to WORK in it.Rock Band 2 is 100 times more fun than Rock Band 1 simply by taking emphasis off of the \"band\" and yet making band play that much easier.  I'm also really glad to see that my instruments from RB1 still work (and still work well.)Rock on.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2009"}

Set 2,000 years prior to the self-titled first game in theSacredseries,Fallen Angelis prequel to the events and quests of earlier RPG hit, that drops players in the midst of an epic struggle for control of elemental power on the grandest of scale.Caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Sacred 2: Fallen AngelPlayers:Offline 1-4; Online 1-4Other:Co-op multiplayer; HDTV 480p, 720p, 1080i; 16:9 widescreen; In-game Dolby Digital sound.6 stunning character classes.View larger.Battle using brute force &amp; steel.View larger.A massive weapons inventory.View larger.Master the lore of the ancients.View larger.Classic RPG character leveling.View larger.The StoryT-Energy has been flowing through Ancaria since time immemorial. This mysterious power forms the beginning of all life, is the source of all magic and the origin of all thought. For eons the angelic Seraphim watched over the T-Energy and therefore over the fate of the entire world. But eventually tiring of their burden, they passed their knowledge on to the High Elves. T-Energy helped the realm of the High Elves to experience an unimaginable boost of prosperity, making it the reigning culture in Ancaria. But a force as powerful as T-Energy carries great dangers. Not taught how to deal with this, no sooner did the Elves take control, then a heated dispute erupted among them as to how and to what purpose the T-Energy was to be used. Dispute morphed into irresolvable conflict, then rift and eventually to a civil war among the High Elves, where all participants were losers. Their realm collapsed and with it the entire power structure of Anacaria. In the turmoil all the peoples of Anacaria coveted the right, either openly or in secret, to wield the power of T-Energy and in the end, unmanaged, the T-Energy raged out of control warping creature and lands alike. Can anyone regain control over the T-Energy. And if so, will he/she strive to prevent the world from lapsing into final chaos, or deepen it?GameplayGameplay inSacred 2: Fallen Angelin divided into two campaign paths: Light and Dark. As the game begins players choose and customize their character and choose the path they will follow. This choice determines the ultimate goal and intentions of their character, and as the game progresses through literally hundreds of quests and side quests, the paths of different characters intersect at different junctions. Choose one way and you may be tasked to defend a town and its people, while another path could result in you attacking the same town. The choice is yours and the fate of the world and your well-being are at stake.Key Game Features:A massive, seamless and dynamic world delivering hundreds of hours of freeform exploration.Two deep campaigns: play as the 'Light' or 'Shadow' side, complete with distinct skills, rewards and story-elements tailored to the chosen path.Six exceptional, playable characters, each with a distinct look, capabilities and in-game motivation.Modifiable combat arts: change, upgrade and link together your alter ego's combat skills to match your playing style.Fight effectively from the back of a number of mounts under your control; equip and upgrade your character's unlockable special mount.Deities offer unique combat disciplines and unlock additional quests.Seamless transition between single and multiplayer gaming modes via Xbox LIVE.Captivating online modes of play challenge gamers in cooperative, PvP and PvE play.Extraordinary, cutting-edge graphics and Dolby 5.1 channel surround sound utilize the latest technologies for a truly immersive experience.Character ClassesInSacred 2: Fallen Angelplayers assume the role of one of six characters -- five of which are new to the franchise -- and delve into a thrilling story full of side quests and secrets that you will have to unravel. Breathtaking combat arts and sophisticated spells are waiting to be learned. A multitude of weapons and items will be available, and you will choose which of your character's attributes you will enhance with these items in order to create a unique and distinct hero.SeraphimOften referred to as 'Fallen Angels,' these mystical and angelic creatures are the oldest inhabitants of Ancaria. Fast, elegant and acrobatic warriors from a technological future they fight with light to medium weapons and, if required, with massive technological support. Players can assume the role of a Seraphim and protect the world from chaos.Shadow WarriorShadow Warriors were originally humans trained as elite soldiers in service to the High Elves. Upon their death their souls were stolen by an Elven general, bound to lifeless bodies and imbued with T-Energy. Now free, they travel between this world and the next as undead beings with only the desire to return to the peace of the golden halls of Elysium.High ElfThe best student at the ancient academy of magic in Thylysium, the High Elf character lives and breathes magic. Her hunger for adventure and her insatiable desire to increase her personal knowledge and the influence of her once-powerful house are the driving forces as she sets off into an Ancaria boiling over with turmoil.DryadMasters of the hunt and akin to the Elves, The Dryad are in tune with nature and are equipped with the strength of the forests. The most powerful and the strongest among them are knowledgeable of the dark art of voodoo and were chosen in order to save their peoples from extinction. All are expert with the bow, traps, poisons and lore of the forest.InquisitorThe Inquisitors are the High Priests of the High Elves. Arrogant and deadly, they are only committed to themselves and their ultimate goal of assume control over the T-Energy. Proficient in close combat and able to gain increasing power as damage is taken, their manipulative spells make them powerful fighters from the shadows.Temple GuardianSince the beginning of time the purpose of Temple Guardians were to maintain and protect the Great Machine, so that it could keep the world in balance. Neither fully flesh or mechanical, they are half human and half machine. Propelled by T-Energy and devoted to protecting it, they are part of the Great Machine and so able to use the T-Energy for their purposes.A Wide Variety of MountsAcross Ancaria you will find many horse dealers. They offer all kinds of animals, from the simple nag up to a real war horse. You can equip a war horse with bridle, saddle and even special armor. These special items can be found in the game just like player items, ranging in quality from regular to rare and even unique items. In addition, every character also has a unique mount created specifically for their character class. This mount not only fits the personality of the character, but also complements the various aspects of the character's playing style perfectly. All character classes can fight from a mounted position using a variety of tactics that the player chooses depending on the terrain and battle conditions.","reviewerName":"Benjamin S. Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"For action rpg fans Sacred 2 is a perfect score! For everyone else? Read this review with a grain of objectivity.","reviewText":"It's hard doing a proper review for Sacred 2. The map is HUGE and with 600 missions and  6 classes there's a lot to be uncovered. Be that as it may, there's a certain rhythm and pattern prevalent throughout. At its' heart Sacred 2 is a hack n slash loot collector's wet dream come true!There are those rpgs that try to wow you with a sweeping epic story and highly polished graphical eye candy orgasms. Sadly, if you're expecting that with Sacred 2 you maybe let down a bit. The graphics while decent enough are nothing spectacular.The plot of high elves abusing a mystic blue goop called \"T-energy\" which is leaking out of pipes as it blights the land is thinly layered to give you a driving goal beyond fetching teddy bears for little girls, delivering worms to fishermen, and avenging the smashed carts of vegetable vendors. Be that as it may, I thought the subtle nod to environmentalism and \"steam punk\" was well implemented. It kind of made me reminisce about Final Fantasy 7. After all, T-energy has many parallels with mako energy!The thing that awes me about Sacred 2 most of all is the sheer size and meticulous detail of its' world. While the detail of the characters is only a notch above passable the caves, rivers, swamps, towns, plains, graveyards, crypts, and occasional odd technological ruins are all very much \"alive\". Grass sways in the wind, T-energy glows with an eerie blue luminance, skeletons grumpily slam shut their own coffins after they've been opened by careless grave robbers, and  people go about their daily lives of farming, patrolling, fishing, and singing. I've always been a gamer who will gladly take a hit to the visuals department if the realm I'm exploring is \"massive\" with lots to do in it. Fortunately that is where Sacred 2 delivers in droves!Sacred 2's game play is straightforward. You can assign potions to the arrows on your directional pad and weapons (as well as magic & combat arts) are assigned to your X,Y,A, and B buttons. Keep in mind a shield can be linked to the same designation as a sword, mace, axe, or war hammer. The \"Right trigger\" and \"Left trigger\" can be used for additional functionalities as well. Navigating menus is done by pressing RB and LB talks to townsfolk or opens chests. \"Junk items\" can be scrapped in exchange for gold and all your special techniques and attributes can be upgraded as you level up. Pressing \"select\" will bring up the full map and if you want to save you can access that option any time by hitting the start button. The only fundamental \"flaw' is there is no true \"pause\" feature. If you want to sort through your treasure and assign stat points when not under duress, going into a town is your best bet!Sacred 2 offers a few deeper layers to this typical formula. Blacksmiths can assign jewels, pearls, rings, and skulls  into weapon slots to give them more power. \"Combat runes\" can fuse multiple buffs, special attacks, and spells into one action, allowing you to unleash a fury of destruction with a single button press! Luckily Sacred 2 doesn't penalize gamers for neglecting these more complex nuances. Compared to other games of its' genre it is more forgiving and if you really want a challenge, higher difficulty levels beyond \"bronze\" are available.Measuring up Sacred 2 to Sacred Gold is perplexing. I love both games and they each have their ups and downs. For example Sacred 2 has less classes but it makes up for it with \"special mounts\" each protagonist can quest for. Sacred Gold allowed players to decapitate heads, severe limbs, and really lay out the buckets of blood whereas Sacred 2 is far less violent (Even with the gore option on) yet it added funny lines of dialogue enemies mutter when they're slain. Sacred 2 has more varied camera control and is truly \"3D\" but Sacred Gold looked really impressive for its' time whereas its' sequel in the present cannot aesthetically measure up to rpgs like Witcher 2, Mass Effect 2, Deus Ex Human Revolution, or Divinity 2: Dragon Knight Saga. Sacred Gold took itself much more seriously whereas Sacred 2 outrageously breaks the 4th wall and pokes fun of itself at every opportunity. Both are wonderful hack n slash adventures. Which Sacred you'll become more fond of will boil down to personal preferences as opposed to one actually being better than the other one. As the saying goes, \"Apples and oranges\"!In the end you will know if Sacred 2 is \"your thing\". If you enjoyed games like Diablo 2, Titan's Quest, and Torch-light this is a no brainer.  If however you prefer rpgs with deep stories, lovable multi-layered comrades that trounce around by your side, the possibility for erotic romance, and choices hinged on moral dilemmas that decide your destiny, Sacred 2 may seem a tad \"uncultured\" due to its' blatant refusal to reinvent the wheel or steep itself in blockbuster melodrama.Pros+ Great sound track+Staggering number of side quests+ 6 classes with a diverse set of combat arts and magical arts+Interesting take on \"Steam punk\", especially with the Temple Guardian!+Each protagonist has a unique \"home base\" and origin.+Special mounts that are a treat to find. Tired of horses? How about a giant monitor lizard, cute sky drake, gigantic spider, mechanical mono-wheel, hell hound, or Saber-tooth tiger?! That's \"epic\"!+ Blind Guardian does a concert \"in game\" if you do their particular side quest to retrieve their instruments for them. How \"Metal\" is that?! Very!+ Huge world. Yeah, even bigger than Skyrim!+Difficulty curve is just right.+Varied array of weapons, charms, and armor sets to find.+Combo rune system returns from the previous Sacred!+ The enemy bestiary becomes very robust as you keep playing.+ Huge boss creatures+Good sense of humor throughout that is mirthfully self aware!+ The seraphim, dryad, and high elf are all \"hawt\". Normally I'd omit this as a merit but if you are going to sink 100+ hours into a game it helps to have a \"banging booty\" to stare at!+It's appreciated that Sacred 2 still clings to the age old tradition of \"showing off\" different armors, weapons, and accessories on your protagonist of choice as you equip him or her accordingly.+ You can adjust the ratio of \"nabbing loot\" to be more picky about what dropped goods you'll stash away in your inventory. Believe me, this can be helpful because there are A LOT of item drops in this game!Cons-Controls maybe difficult to understand for those not well versed in the first Sacred or pc gaming in general. (Angry Joe mentions this in his you-tube review but personally I took to the game-play like a fish to water!)-Sacred 2 was reputedly \"buggy\" when it first released but I haven't had any problems yet. This could be because I picked it up after there was a patch.-If you prefer rpgs that are more story and character driven Sacred 2 may disappoint.-Camera stays zooms out in 2 player local co-op. I understand why the choice was made but it kinda sucks for those of us that want a closer look at the action!-Less overall character classes available than in Sacred Gold. (I miss the female daemon and vampiress knight in particular)- Text can be small and \"almost\" illegible at times. You get used to it but it's very apparent the interface was made for HD televisions. I wouldn't call it \"game breaking\" but it is annoying.-You can easily compare items you've already picked up but unfortunately you cannot compare an item still on the ground to one in your inventory. Sometimes ditching something you've already collected \"just to make room\" for a newer addition is a gamble. Will it be better or will it be worse? Luckily, this problem can be remedied by adjusting your settings to be pickier about what treasure you will salvage and what treasure you`ll automatically leave behind.-No pause button. (Derp!)For you ifIf Hack N Slash loot-fest rpgs have not lost their luster for you over the years Sacred 2 is a steal at the present price! I'd rank it as one of the better examples of its' genre and the presence of Blind Guardian certainly sweetens the deal for us Heavy Metal fans!Sacred 2 likewise integrates original ideas we've rarely seen in this genre. The Temple Guardian in particular is a type of class you'll never see repeated anywhere else. A dog-headed or dragon-headed robot with a \"gun arm\" cannot help but to stick out! Based upon the context of Ancaria's \"technological revolution\" such a character manages to still fit in with the setting.If you're searching for some couch co-op or Xbox live camaraderie this game offers a good excuse to get together with your friends, spouse, or intelligent talking pet!The map of Ancaria is enormous so those willing to explore off the beaten path can easily reap 100 hours out of this massive steam-punk fantasy harvest!Not for you ifFor many gamers a \"good story\" is a key component to the rpg experience. While I wouldn't say Sacred 2's plot is \"awful\" it's also not that compelling either. It throws in a few unique and intriguing concepts yet is too scatter brained to build upon any of them with sufficient poise.In addition Sacred 2 isn't the prettiest beau in her class. (She's a cute lass though! Aka she's not a hideous retina melting abomination or anything)There may also be those of you who preferred the more serious Diablo-esque tone and wider selection of character classes from Sacred Gold.If you cannot help but to be an unabashed graphics snob or if you are one of those obsessive compulsive fans who sabotages the chance of a sequel being better than the original predecessor in your addled mind,  it's suggested to give this one a pass.Lastly, Sacred 2 is better for people with idle days coming up on their schedule. If you're still busy at work or at school you should save Sacred 2 for a lengthy vacation!Bias opinionIn an alternate universe where I bought Sacred 2 at launch while having to deal with its' initial bugs it probably got a few points docked off from its' over all score. Be that as it may, in \"this reality\" I got it after the patch thus I didn't have to deal with corrupt save data, weird glitches, or any other \"gremlins\" running around in the system. I still wouldn't be surprised to find coding flaws in a game with this massive scope later on but it hasn't happened yet. (According to a friend, Star Ocean Last Hope was buggy as heck too but I was so lucky that I blissfully skipped around its' shortcomings while being none the wiser!)Believe it or not, there is apart of me that's a well written narration junky and a part of me that revels in making pivotal fate altering decisions as I try to woo the socks off all my female party members. Aka Dragon-age Origins and Persona 4 are two of my favorite rpgs!Yet I also like a game that gives me a chance to go anywhere and carve out my own path of destiny. I love hacking and slashing at hundreds of unique enemy types while hearing that satisfying jingle of treasure dropping off corpses. I don't always require an entourage of celebrity voiced automatons following me nor do I always need a game trying to appeal to my tastes in anime, my tastes in movies, and my tastes in literature.If a game is fun I'll take notice, even if it wasn't done on the biggest budget. Sacred 2 is simply loads of enjoyment for a reasonable price. It's no Skyrim but I don't think it was attempting to be Elder Scrolls to begin with. Later people may compare Sacred 2 to Diablo 3 but frankly at least for me the Sacred series as a whole is leagues more rewarding than Diablo 1 and 2 ever were. Sure, Diablo did the whole action rpg/treasure looting/dungeon exploration hybrid jazz first but I think the people who still claim it does it the best are wearing foggy nostalgia goggles.Look, if you covet games akin to Diablo, Titan Quest, Loki, Torch Light, and Gauntlet Legends Sacred 2 and Sacred Gold will rock your socks off! It may not end up being your absolute favorite series in this genre as it is for me but it will definitely sate a craving and fill a void until Diablo 3 comes out!For this reason both Sacred 2 and Sacred Gold get my highest recommendations!Broken's miscellaneous tip of the dayHealing potions work on people you are escorting to safety as well. Even if the local wolves and ill tempered kobolds are not damaging you directly, it's highly recommended that you swig a red elixir every once in awhile to keep your companions alive!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2011"}

There's a general graphical dullness to the giant world you explore.  For example, you wont see lots of glow and lighting effects that one might see in virtually any other console game.  And the controls and menus are complicated at first and you _really_ _really_ need to spend some time learning what everything does in the game. Almost every button has at least 2 different functions.But then I really started to enjoy what the game has to offer.  The attack controls start to make sense (you point the stick in the direction of the enemy and then choose the type of attack from the buttons).  The graphics are good and quite varied, though it has to be said as a point of comparison, the graphics in a game like Fable 2 blow away anything we'll ever see in Sacred 2.Some have complained of a low framerate, but so far this has not been a game breaker.  You can tell the developers took some shortcuts to keep the framerate as high as possible.  The camera hugs closer to your character than one might expect.  You can go to a birds eye view or behind the shoulder, but both viewpoints seem too close. I suspect the developers did this in order to keep the framerate up.  It is something that doesnt break the game but you _will_ notice it while playing.  Archers might find it a little annoying that one cannot always see on the screen what they want to shoot at, but then again that's what \"area of effect\" spells are for!There's some other small gripes too.  I usually dont care about voice acting but whoa is it bad in this game.  I would rather hear the original German but there's no option for that that I can see.  And the game has a lot of jokes in it but they just aren't funny. The quests are standard quests that one would expect and nothing remotely special.  This is where Diablo 2 shows its superiority.  Diablo 2 had some great memorable enemies and quests.So, its a Diablo clone with a truly giant varied world to explore and a pretty good one, with lots of replay value and some strategic depth to it.  Should you buy it?  If you're a Diablo fan, I would say yes.  Anyone else might want to wait for a demo and for the price to come down.  The company that made this game just went bankrupt and the price of the game will likely come down. Its not clear how much support there will be for this game now, considering the bankruptcy but the game is playable so I wouldnt worry too much about that.Addendum:  I've been playing the Dark campaign with a Shadow Warrior for almost 20 hours now and I like the game even more than when first writing this review.  It still has plenty of quirks but I like that the difficulty level ramps up nicely (dont play at too-easy bronze level! start at silver).

Blood Edward Island won't give up its secrets easily, so you'll have to trace the clues to find the truth.","reviewerName":"Stephen M. Sturgeon","summary":"Fun but short.","reviewText":"This is a non-combat puzzle game in the same vein as Myst. In fact, if you like Myst, you should have fun with Trace Memory.Trace Memory is very innovative. It uses all of the DS's abilities in clever ways. It uses the touch screen, the mic and even uses the sleep mode as ways of solving puzzles.It'll take you a while to figure things out the first time through, yet it's not overly difficult. If you keep at it, you'll have no problem making your way through.It's such a fun game, I really wanted to give it five stars. However there are two flaws that really kill this game.For one thing, it's short. I finished it within a couple days playing time. That's pretty short in my book.The other flaw is that once you do finish it, there's not much incentive to play again. You have a slightly different ending the second time around, but all and all, not enough to bother going through it again. At most, you'll go through the game twice, get bored with it and then stash it on the shelf.So while this game is clever and great fun to play, the length and lack of replay value takes it down a notch. You may want to wait till it comes down in price or find it used. It's worth owning, but not at what it's selling for right now.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2005"}

After the mammoth success of puzzle and mind games like Big Brain Academy, and Brain Age and its sequel, there have been many games that have been knockoffs that just haven't shined as vividly. Nevertheless, that hasn't stopped the people who've developed Brain Age, Touch Generations, from expanding the gameplay that Brain Age that appears to be strong to the eyes. Well, they've done it again, and it shows how fast can your sight be in your mind to catch it.Flash Focus: Vision Training In Minutes A Day, brings the success of Brain Age, in a more visual sense. The game includes many training exercises that focus in on accuracy and timing, rather than how much your brain weighs and age. There are many mini-game exercises here that work to the test, including sports games like table tennis, soccer, baseball and football. But, it isn't just about sports at all alone here, the game also shows how fast you can memorize patterns, and sight. The graphics look good but the gameplay is just as addictive as we've seen before. Sadly, the game doesn't do enough to seperate itself from others, with a lack of multiplayer gameplay, but the game does test your sight well.All in all, Flash Focus: Vision Training In Minutes A Day isn't a bad purchase for the Nintendo DS. The gameplay is a test of how well wew see things and observe more than meets the eye. If you've played Brain Age, you'll definitely want to add Flash Focus in as a part of your video game library.Graphics: BSound: C+Control: B 1/2+Fun & Enjoyment: B-Overall: B 1/2-","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0002CHJAA","reviewerName":"Veil_Lord","summary":"Not Quite As Good As The First","reviewText":"I just finished playing the second in game in the Xenosaga trilogy.  Someone described it to me as \"a little slow to get going\", which isn't an entirely bad way to describe it, though I was entertained even early on.The game is still a turn-based RPG where you run around on the map in real time until you run into an enemy.  However, the combat system has changed somewhat.  You're able to now move behind enemies, though more often they move behind you, and do greater damage against characters' backs.  The game also puts great emphasis on \"breaking\" opponents.  You have to hit a certain attack area in the right sequence, usually by boosting another character, to \"break\" the enemy's defense and cause increased damage.  Done properly, you can decimate enemies.  If you can't figure it out you can mostly just level grind up and manage pretty well, though you kind of need to have it down for some bosses.You will fight Albedo again.  Look up a guide.  If you don't, you'll be pretty likely to rage-quit the series.  Once you know the trick he's not too bad, but until then he's nearly impossible.  The same holds true for several other ones.  If something kicks your rear repeatedly, you're probably missing the trick.The skill system is needlessly complicated.  You have levels, classes, and skills.  If you pick too many lower classes and don't choose all skills within them, you can end up with no way to get the higher level skills.  A lot of the higher level ones are obtained from those doors you have to decode.  Overall, you can get by in most of the game with only the healing, memory (not strictly speaking necessary but tremendously useful), and Revert (revive).  I would have enjoyed things better had I not been too terrified to pick any other skills until after I'd started disc 2.I had quite a bit of fun with the game and finished it in about 25 hours (game time), probably 30+ real time.  Considering I paid less than the cost of a Big Mac meal for the game and I can even play some epilogue missions yet, I'd say I'm happy with my purchase.If this is irrelevant to you, then skip this last paragraph, but the female characters aren't as attractive as in the first game.  It's not a huge deal, but the short skirts are replaced by pants or shorts and KOSMOS isn't really showing any skin at all anymore.  Shion changes into capri pants and a low cut top a short ways into the game.  I missed her glasses.  Also, you won't play as any female character until well past the start of the game.  Again, ignore all this if you don't care.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2012"}

A few days later I learned about toggling the meter to find the \"sweet spot\".  Still a 3D picture, just different levels of intensity for all viewing possibilities.  Taking the plunge, I bought one today and found the spot right away and have been playing with no headache.The system, so far, is well worth the money.  Off the bat, the charging cradle is a great idea as far too often have the charge ports come loose on products after several charges.The AR cards are tons of fun.  Nintendo, adding this feature and a few more, make this more than just the cartridge games that are 3D.The release library of games isn't the most exciting, but Super Street Fighter 4 is amazing.  The main reason I switched was because it can play all DS games as well, of course as the new ones and bringing back Zelda and Starfox, won me over.  Nintendo hit a home run.Just a precautionary notice for everyone, register at Club Nintendo when you buy this because they give you an extended warranty and my coworker and a few I've met have had to already ship theirs back but Nintendo fully covered them and gave them an extra year warranty for free.

{"product_name":"B003VJNPPE","description":"In BriefThe second instalment in the RPG saga about the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia, features a thoroughly engrossing, mature storyline defining new standards for thought-provoking, non-linear game narration. In addition to an epic story, the game features an original, brutal combat system that uniquely combines tactical elements with dynamic action. A new, modern game engine, responsible both for beautiful visuals and sophisticated game mechanics puts players in the most lively and believable world ever created in an RPG game. A captivating story, dynamic combat system, beautiful graphics, and everything else that made the original Witcher such a great game are now executed in a much more advanced and sophisticated way.DEVELOPER: CD Projekt REDBrief Story DescriptionAfter helping to stop the rebellion undertaken by the Order of the Flaming Rose and saving King Foltest&rsquo;s life, Geralt became one of the central figures of political turmoil in the Kingdom of Temeria. Geralt continues to protect the King in the monarch&rsquo;s mission to bring peace to his state. The last bastions of the Order yielded to the royal army. The only remaining task is to pacify the rebellious castle of Baroness La Valette, who announced separation from the Kingdom. It&rsquo;s been a month since the attempted assassination of the king, when his army arrives at the gates of Baroness La Valette&rsquo;s fortress in preparation for the final battle. In the meantime, Geralt, stuck with Foltest, cannot begin his personal quest - to discover the origin and identity of the mysterious witcher-like assassin responsible for the attempt on the king&rsquo;s life - a quest that would answer many questions...Key FeaturesA truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative events are dependent on the player&rsquo;s choices and lead to multiple different game endings and several additional plot forks. This time gameplay time will be shorter than The Witcher 1, but more intense and packed with events.A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter seldom seen in other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and attractive to contemporary gamers. We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt&rsquo;s personal theme, in which he&rsquo;s looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to play.Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski&rsquo;s book series and The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues sequences, thanks to a new game engine.New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in which we observe the link between our past choices with current actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.Sex and eroticism will be introduced in a much more realistic, involving and mature way, thanks to which sexual relationships are presented more credibly than in TW1.Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide an incredible, believable story-driven experience.Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further actions in the game.Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine create a cohesive, fully accessible world!Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a wider range of new tactical options. Geralt will surmount barriers, jump over fences, scale walls and ascend rock formations.Premium Edition ContentsGAME DVDThe Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings game DVD.MAKING-OF DVDAll the cinematic materials related to game - trailers, dev diaries, gameplay footage, interviews and making-of exclusive video.OST CDAudio-CD with in-game music.ETUIBox with all the contents of The Witcher 2 Premium Edition.WORLD MAPA map of the game's world.GAME GUIDEThe Witcher 2 strategy guide for both novice and experienced role-playing fans.GAME MANUALA rulebook and interface explanation to help you get started.PAMPHLET AND COINA physical representation of one of the in-game items.PAPERCRAFTSTwo papercraft dolls - Geralt and one random character for collectors.DLCExtra in-game feature for download: The Ultimate Swordsman SuitSystem RequirementsMinimal Requirements:CPU: Dual-Core, 2,2 GHz.RAM: 1 GB (Windows XP), 2 GB (Windows Vista / Windows 7)GPU: nVidia GeForce 8800 / 512 MBOS: Windows XP / Windows Vista / Windows 7","summary":"A rarity....","reviewText":"I'm not going to get into what this game entails, what it's about, how it plays, its presentation, or any of that.  All of that can be found in the numerous other reviews on here and around the net, and I don't feel the need to reiterate what many have already stated many times over.  I'll just say that you can be assured you're in for one HELL of a good RPG experience, easily the best in years.I'll get right to the point: this title deserves all the support it can get.  In all my 28 years of gaming, I've rarely seen such care and dedication put into a game.  When I received my box in the mail, I thought Amazon had messed up my order as the box was 1 1/2 inches thick and weighed as much as a decent sized novel.  It's a beautifully put together package which not only comes with the game, but also a 100 page game guide, a \"making of\" DVD with forty minutes of footage + trailers, soundtrack CD (a real treat as the in-game music is incredible), a map, an oren coin (game currency), a foldout of some sort with a monster description (mine was of a troll, not sure if each is different), and a papercraft.  All of this for $49 bucks!!  Simply unbelievable.  In a day and age where games come with simply the disc in a flimsy DVD case with a 3 page manual (if that, now it's usually readme files) for often ten bucks more, this is a real treat.CD Project is also treating us like respectable consumers and not criminals.  They themselves have said that they despise DRM as much as us gamers do, and have entirely removed it with the first patch release (which is automatically applied during installation......no hassle).  Do as many installs as you like, no activations, none of it.  PRAISE THE GODS!  They are also addressing the bugs and incompatibility issues, and are offering free DLC to boot among other things.  Did you get a damaged head sculpture that came with the Collector's Edition?  They'll replace it for free until the end of June with a free gift thrown in for the trouble.  Japanese gamer?  They're working on a translation and finding a publisher.  Go read the community section on thewitcher.com to see.  Their technical support was fast and helpful.  I mean, how much more can you ask for?  Honestly?  For what you pay, this game is more like a gift and truly feel like a steal.  I'd have easily paid twice as much.Which I have actually.  I bought two copies of this so far, one on GoG, this one, and will eventually be picking up the collector's edition at some point.  I will absolutely support such a stellar effort like this as much as I possibly can.  We need to vote with our wallets when developers take such a large step in the right direction, and this is a prime opportunity.  Not only does the game deserve its due accord, but CD Project deserves a hell of a lot of credit for taking the more difficult road less travelled and are doing things that aren't even needed but are much appreciated.  They have skyrocketed to the top of my favorite developers list, and as long as they keep this up they will remain there.  I just very much hope they are not bought out and inevitably go down the drain as so many others have.Anyone who pirates this sickens me and should be ashamed of themselves.  It is so blatantly apparent this is a labor of love and hard work, and they are so far standing firm behind their product and its customers.  For that, they deserve all we can give.  If anything is worth your dime, it's this.  Not only is it an incredible game by itself, its approach is a massive step in the right direction towards a DRM-free future and an overall much more fulfilling and engrossing PC gaming experience.Dzikuj, CD Project, dzikuj!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2011"}

Essentially what Super Street Fighter IV is to Street Fighter IV, UMvC3 throws in some additional fighters like Ghost Rider, Phoenix Wright, Frank West, Nemesis, Doctor Strange, Nova, and more besides (plus the two downloadable content characters, Shuma Gorath and Jill Valentine).  There's also the ability to play as Galactus in Arcade mode, some new special moves, backgrounds, and extras.  The real star here besides the new fighter additions is that there have been some slight revamps to the fighting engine.

I can wear these for hours and my ears feel comfortable and don'teven get that hot. They kind of fit over my ears, and it first I kept read justing them, but then I just let it alone and everything felt fine! So far I have used this with my XBOX, PS3, iPhone and iPAD, and have had no problem with it at all. Battery life is excellent, and it charges relatively quickly.....which brings me to my one annoyance. At this price level, there should be an AC adapter, too. I'm not a fan of USB charging....but this is so good that I still  leave it at 5 stars. Sounds quality is very good. Bass is a little weak for such a high end headset.Pairing is easy, I had no problems and everyone could hear me fine with no echos! It doesn't look like a high-end head set, but it feels like one. There's nothing like a good sounding headset, I have a couple....but wireless! That's a completely different experience! I love it, and while my other headsets have better bass, the wireless is hands-down a no brainer.Surround sound is good. It has nothing on my home theater, but for headsets, this is more than acceptable and offers a GREAT gaming experience if you don't have the space for a full HT or if you do not live alone. ;)I can highly recommend the XP510!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2013"}

Rhodes","summary":"Combining the Best of the Old With the Best of New.  A Tribute to Everything Final Fantasy Was.","reviewText":"Final Fantasy IX was a pretty big release during it's time.  Coming out after the ultra success of Final Fantasy VII and VIII it had some pretty big shoes to fill.  Final Fantasy IX ended up being a throwback of sorts.  It tried it's hardest to mix the best of the old with the best of the new.  If you go into Final Fantasy IX understanding the old school appeal and that the plot, in jokes and cliches are all intentional, then Final Fantasy IX is going to wow you in all sorts of ways.  If, however, you aren't prepared for this... if you don't understand that Final Fantasy IX was meant to be a tribute to the series up until this point (and many younger Final Fantasy fans typically don't) then you might be scratching your head as to what Final Fantasy IX was actually about.Final Fantasy IX has a fairly simple story.  It's not quite as far reaching as other Final Fantasy.  Instead Final Fantasy IX has tones things down, going more for breathing some old school goodness into some of it.  A group of thieves known as Tantalus are on their way to Alexandria to kidnap Princess Garnet.  Zidane and his allies are put to the task.  The pesky, overprotective Steiner gets in the way.  As this is going on, a Black Mage named Vivi is running through town trying to see the play &#34;I Want to Be Your Canary.&#34;  These three sets begin Final Fantasy IX.  And at the climax of the play they all come together where certain questions come about.  It turns out Garnet wants to be kidnapped because she wants to know what her mother, the Queen, is up to.  Steiner joins because he has sworn to protect the Princess.  Vivi gets mixed up into things, but soon begins to question his origins and where he came from.Final Fantasy IX has a good story, but the pacing of the story in and of itself is very slow.  What helps the pacing along is that the characters are actually quite well developed.  They each have their own distinctive personalities.  More than that, however, Final Fantasy IX puts a lot of effort into the characters by introducing the idea of Active Time Events (ATE).  When wondering around town you can sometimes press the select button to see what your other characters are doing.  Sometimes this impacts events that happen (for instance a character might get an item in an ATE).  But really, what helps this out is that we begin to learn more about the characters.Final Fantasy IX has other things that make the story pace a lot slower than the previous Final Fantasy games before it (most notably Final Fantasy VI, VII and VIII).  There will be times when, upon paying tribute to older Final Fantasy titles (most notably I, II and III) there will be moments where you may need to go and perform certain tasks for absolutely no reason at all.  Or because you have to find one particular item to get through.  There are moments in Final Fantasy IX when doing some of these things will add absolutely nothing to the story whatsoever.  Or moments where certain things will feel like a chore.  At one point with Zidane you are tasked with running around a city to find three potions to help change the form of someone back into a human.  Upon getting the three potions (which may or may not take you some time depending on if you know exactly where they are or not) it doesn't work.  It's time spent away from the story and time spent away from pressing things forward.  The tribute to the old school nature of 80's RPGs can work (just look at Dragon Quest VIII) but there are moments in Final Fantasy IX where even for the most old school fan it can be far fetched.There are lots of twist and turns in the story of Final Fantasy IX.  It's simple, but there are surprises.  Again, from an old school standpoint some of them are going to be... strange to younger fans (particularly those who started with VII) as you'll feel like some twists and turns will come out of no where.  And while Final Fantasy IX always manages to somehow bring it together, you'll never get the sense that it was done in a logical way.Again, this is because much of what Final Fantasy IX does is paying tribute to the franchise.  There will be many a moment in Final Fantasy IX's story where you'll see a twist coming a mile away.  But these moments are intentional.  To this day even some older Final Fantasy fans can't seem to figure out why Final Fantasy IX has so many cliches or obvious moments.  It has caused Final Fantasy IX to be one of the most loved and most hated Final Fantasy titles as a result (though when we were finally able to get our hands on all the Final Fantasy games it became clear that the attitudes toward Final Fantasy IX have shifted to being far more positive).  The story, overall, is good, but if your first foray into Final Fantasy was the seventh installment and you didn't bother to play any game before the fifth one, many of Final Fantasy IX's references, jokes and tributes will fly right over your head and be lost on you.At the very least the humor holds up.  One of the best parts about Final Fantasy IX is how emotionally investing the story can be.  Since the release of Final Fantasy VII, the dark, mysterious and brooding character has been a trope favorite within the JRPG genre.  So it's actually kind of nice to see Final Fantasy IX have a more lighthearted cast.  The ensemble cast here is certainly better to get along with than Final Fantasy VII or VIII before it.  Despite that there are MANY emotional moments in Final Fantasy IX.  The lighthearted characters doesn't exactly equate to a light hearted plot.  Final Fantasy IX is easily one of the darkest in the series.Everything about the story aside, the gameplay of Final Fantasy IX is pretty straightforward.  Like previous games, it utilizes the ATB battle system.  Every character has a gauge that, when full, allows them to select an attack and then watch their actions perform.  As with everything else about Final Fantasy IX, it's much more simplified than the three or four games that came before it.  This is also true when one considers the abilities.Final Fantasy VII and VIII had some particularly interesting systems at play.  Final Fantasy VII had the materia system which allowed some really unique customization.  And Final Fantasy VIII had the junction system in which you could tailor any character to be exactly what you wanted them to be.  Both systems were complex enough that there were whole tutorials in each one built to help the player grasp them.  Final Fantasy IX opts for a far more simple ability system.  Each character falls into a clear &#34;job&#34; in the similar vane that they did in Final Fantasy VI.  Zidane is obviously a thief, Garnet is obviously a white mage, Vivi is a black mage, etc.  And the game makes it very clear just who is what (Steiner is dressed as a knight... I wonder what his &#34;job&#34; is...).  Every character dresses as their trope.  It's so obvious what they should be doing in battle.  Similar to Final Fantasy VI, each character has something they can call their own in battle.Learning other abilities is also simplistic.  Each time you change up your equipment they each come with abilities.  Your weapons, armor and accessories all teach you abilities for characters to use.  For instance, a Flame Staff will allow Vivi to learn Fira.  If you keep it equipped long enough, Vivi will master Fira and be able to use it without having to equip the staff.  Each character has a set amount of abilities they can equip which increases with their level.  This means that, unlike previous Final Fantasy titles, Final Fantasy IX makes it much harder to have a ridiculously overpowered party.  If you're the type that doesn't like grinding, Final Fantasy IX will (eventually) put you in the position where you'll have to.  You need to leave certain weapons and armor equipped to learn some abilities that may protect you from statuses or learn new spells.  Not every character grows equally, though.  A character might take 20 AP to learn one ability while the other will need 40 for that same ability.It's not a unique or engaging system in any way, but it will keep you busy and grinding from time to time.  You can buy weapons, armor and accessories in shops, but you can also synthesize them to create better and more powerful weapons as well.  Final Fantasy IX doesn't make it easy to get an overpowered party in quite the same manner that VI, VII and VIII did.  Final Fantasy IX is going to make you work just a little harder for that.  On the other hand, it does make each character stand out in some way.Where as Final Fantasy VII and VIII had limit breaks, Final Fantasy IX does away with that and instead puts in the idea of &#34;Trance.&#34;  When characters take enough damage they will go into a trance state where their abilities are enhanced and they deal more damage (and take less).  At first this is an interesting system, but you'll quickly lose interest in it.  While it's pretty cool the first few times some things about it will annoy you.  The first and most obvious is that Trance activates automatically.  You have no control over that.  And yes, there will be plenty of battles (normal battles) where it's wasted and you might not get to actually utilize it.  If you go into a trance state and the battle ends your meter will start at 0.  It's no where near as interesting as the limit breaks from Final Fantasy VII and VIII or as useful as the desperation attacks from VI.There's little wrong with Final Fantasy IX's battle system.  The only real downside to it is the amount of grinding that must be done.  It not always fun to have to equip lesser armor and weapons just for the sake of learning an ability.  Final Fantasy IX has a story that will take it's time moving from point A to point B.  It's a shame that at times the player will also have to slow down to get through it.  Final Fantasy IX is rarely (if ever) in a hurry.  This is actually not always a bad thing.  It allows for more character development and interaction and allows the story to focus much more strongly on its characters.From a production standpoint Final Fantasy IX is one of the best looking Playstation games around.  Again, paying tribute the character models evoke more of the style of sprites than they do more human like models.  This means characters have some pretty big heads and they appear shorter than you might expect.  Games like Final Fantasy VIII, Vagrant Story and Chrono Cross were more concerned about making their characters look as humanlike as possible on the Playstation, but Final Fantasy IX settles for a more &#34;cute&#34; look.  It's nostalgic and nice.Where Final Fantasy IX really shines, however, is the music.  It is unquestionably one of the greatest compositions that series composer Nobuo Uematsu has done.  The themes are great and the emotional attachment they show can't be matched by much else.  Final Fantasy IX will show you just why Nobuo Uematsu is a master at what he does.  There's a lot of charm here that helps compliment the tone Final Fantasy IX presents.As a child I recall not being very fond of Final Fantasy IX (at the time I had only played VI, VII and VIII before it) and I suppose you could say I didn't &#34;get it.&#34;  As an adult, however, I have found Final Fantasy IX to be a nice little trip.  The story is a little slow at times, and much of it is going to be sillier than the games before it.  However, the characters and world around it are pretty good.  They make the journey worth it.  And now, having experienced every Final Fantasy before IX, it was easier to understand why it was done in the manner which it was.  There are certain little problems I have with it, but nothing so serious that it ruins the enjoyment or fun of what is easily one of the best Final Fantasy titles in the series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2000"}

It combines elements from many different game genres. There is the stealth factor: Using Stealth to your advantage is essential to make any progress in the game and is very well executed - this is likely due to the fact that the game was created by Ubi, the developers of the ground breaking series of stealth action games - Splinter Cell.  There is the action/fighting aspect in which you punish your enemies with Jade's Dai-Jo Staff techniques and tag team combo moves with the help of your friends Pey'j and Double H.  This is somewhat reminiscent of Prince of Persia's fighting system, well done and very intuitive.  Also on the list of features is the camera system; throughout the game Jade must use her trusty camera to capture intelligence for the Allied Resistance, this not only gives your allies info to work with in order to help you further, it also gets you paid so you can get supplies and upgrades.  The graphics are not the very greatest you have ever seen but are well executed and work well with the style of the game.Beyond Good & Evil is a truly fantastic game that you should certainly hunt down and play when there is a lapse in your list of must buy new releases.

You will still be shooting in the other direction for a moment until your body catches up.  It's just not responsive enough.What really drew me into Halo was the online part.  Me and a friend tried Brute Force on XBConnect.com using the System Link part, and just couldn't get it too work.  I still play AT LEAST 10 hours of Halo online per week, so I know it's set up correctly.  Why they came out with XBox Live I'll never know.  They still are not supporting a lot of their OWN games with it.  Even though we couldn't get it to work, they had a good idea with it.  You can have a person join up through System Link and play through the campaign.  I love that idea.  You can have up to 4 players playing through the story mode, one for each character.  We went ahead and played just against ourselves in a 1on 1, and it's still not Halo.  Small levels with no inspiration.  Players are not evenly matched so you know you won because you were the better shot, not just because you had more armor to begin with.Knowing what I do now, I would've waited until the price dropped down on this title a little.

My real complaint lies within the gameplay though. While it takes your typical amount of time to gain stats in the first two games, it takes forever in this game in comparison, and fighting the enemies are a complete chore, because the same stupid shield appears on the enemies that you fight over and over again, not to mention that you can get killed extremely easily by even the weakest of the enemies. The soundtrack is not very good at all, and I especially find the battle theme of the game incredibly bland compared to many other RPGS I have played. The characters can also become quite an annoyance at times with one of the characters later in the game posing half-way to the ground after battle with her finger up, which gets annoying really, really quickly. Overall, I find it extremely difficult to like this game, and I have tried to like it, but have given up trying to like it after trying to play this five years on and off.

Speaking as a guy who spent so much time running amok in Vice City and San Andreas that I practically had to file tax returns there, I have been consistently surprised by the depth of play in GTA IV.  Yes, it's true that the character modeling and some of the action moves are a little choppy, but most of the game looks great.  Far more interesting, however, is the fact that this is not a video game per se - it borders on an interactive movie.  The crime and violence in fuzzy-lit, pastel colored Vice City is practically cartoonish compared to the gritty reality of life in Liberty City in GTA IV.  You're not just a thug with a bat trying to decide which car to lift, you're an immigrant with plenty of emotional baggage, forced into a series of moral quandries the outcomes of which carry implications throughout the entire game.  Things you do even turn up later on the in-game radio stations!Every generation of game console, some game is proclaimed the next coming, be it of graphics, or gameplay, or some other measurable category.  GTA IV is different.  You can wallow in the muck of street violence and prostitution as always, but there's a deeper moral play going on that feels unlike anything else I've encountered not only in GTA, but in video games in general.  Rockstar Games may have finally located that most ephemeral of experiences - one equal parts game and cinema, without belonging entirely to either.  It's going to be interesting to see how many critics and politicians seize on only the overt, adult content, without grasping how far more creative and artistic this \"game\" is than your average deadening FPS or racing game.

And the boss battle music will get your attention, no??The brand new weaponry that Samus will acquire are Super Missiles, Morph Ball Jump, Super Bomb, and even the death defying Grappling Hook.  You will need ALL of it to advance to -- you guessed it -- the return of the nefarious Mother Brain.  As in other Metroid titles, going to Tourian is usually my favorite part of the game.  So once again you will need to freeze those pesky Metroids and fire either 5 Missiles or 1 Super Missile to destroy them.  And after you reach Mother Brain's lair, it's time to fire even MORE Missiles at her cage!But wait -- just when you think you've destroyed her for good the second time around -- she arises again, and transforms into a completely new body!

The controller is poorly developed that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone at any price. The first thing that needs to be known about this controller is its awkward design. It does not fit comfortably in your hand at all. The rear button springs take a bit of effort to push in as you can't exactly just tap them. They are so stiff that you can actually hear the springs. The two analog sticks are extremely close together. You'll be rubbing your thumbs together more than anything else... and aside from all this the worse feature is the location of the attachment cord. It is always in the way since it faces you. This controller is the worst design I have ever used in over 20 years of gaming. The original nintendo controller with its square and jagged shape that cut into your hands after hours of play was better than this.When the classic controller PRO was released I felt relieved and it should have been made sooner. If you need a classic controller skip this and get the latest version it's worlds apart and all the features I just mentioned have been changed. The new controller features softer trigger button springs so now you can gently tap buttons as you play. The center analog sticks are further apart so your thumbs have space now. The best part of all is that the cord is in the back where it belongs! Out of your way and off your lap. My favorite part about the CCpro is that it has palm handles and it feels so comfortable to use. The Classic controller shown here is nintendo's mistake. Make the right choice and get the improvement with the classic controller pro.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0009S4UOA","reviewerName":"Alex \"47\"","summary":"Excellent 360 Launch Title.","reviewText":"Call of Duty 2 has been arguably the most popular World War II gaming franchise ever, and it's impossible to dissagree, this is an amazing game. Here is my review for Call of Duty 2.Graphics: 9/10. Obviously the graphics are a million notches above past consoles, but I was strikingly suprised at how great the graphics were just for a launch title. ( Since usually graphics on a console get better as its life progresses. ) The soldiers look life-like, and the enviroments look fantastic. The only real problems graphically, are that the smoke grenades in buildings go through the walls, and there are occasional blurs, that's about it. Amazing graphics.Sound: 10/10. You won't believe your ears. This is one of the best sounding games I've ever played. The explosions are great, the guns are great, everything's great, but what really makes you feel into the game is the fact that your infantry men talk to you, and when they do, it's actually useful. You know how in past games guys would randomly say things that weren't true? In this game it is. \"German's coming from the South West.\" He's right. Brilliant sound, it really immerses you into the game.Control: 9.5/10. Most anyone can pick up the controller and know how to play. I can honestly say I NEVER played an Xbox, but I picked this game up first day and right after the Training for this game I knew exactly what to do. Great controls that are very easy to use, yet effective.Fun: 9/10. I'm on the last mission on single player currently, and I must say, this is an unbelievable game. The whole single player is in a way repetetive, but then again, that's what war is. But with the fantastic action going on ALL THE TIME, it really doesn't matter if you're doing tedious tasks over and over again. This is a great game on single player, and even a blast online. Online is good, but hard, because \" No matter how good you are at one thing, there's always about a million people better. \". So basically, you will keep getting shot dead in the back online. However, the hit detection is spot on; unlike games like Halo, Halo 2, and SOCOM 2 and 3 for the PS2. The multiplayer is also good, but nothing like single player. Single player is just hands down constant intense action, while split-screen is just laid back, find and kill the other guy. The biggest thing that I didn't like about this game, was the fact that there was no 2-player campaign mode; now anyone could agree that'd be sweet. 27 missions, and single player's over, then you can go through it again. ( Which is still great. ) But I reccomend online play. Call Of Duty 2 simply has the best single player I've ever played in any shooting game; maybe ever. This is a must buy for a 360 owner.9.3/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2006"}

This one is a classic, hands down.  And I am kind of late to the game, I have played Gears of War and Rainbox Six but then go Call of Duty.  I am going to go on record and say that Call of Dut 2 beats both of those.  I am sorry, I had to say it.  COD2 felt a little more than a game; I loved standing behind the troops as they were getting gunned down as I was trying to advance to the second story of a building.  Or when the enemy may spot several enemy while I flank on the far side, but I might get caught by some hiding enemy character.  Flanking in Rainbox six is this; there are two doors, you go in the left and your squad does in the right door (how lame).Oh yea, getting gunned down in COD is a different experience then getting gunned down  Gears of War.  Nothing can spoil a party more than that heavy chaingun, may start out with 8 members of your team and they will be gone in an instant.I put this in my modern best game ever list, alongside; Ninja Gaiden, Rainbox Six and Halo 2.Only Cons:1. Graphics could be a little grimmer, add more blood and gore (see Gears of War)2. I loved the friendly ai and quantity of troops out there.  I wish we could have our own squad.

{"product_name":"B000JJRV90","description":"For the best picture possible for your Wii experience, connect your console to your television using a Component Video Cable. The Component Video Cable signal will display a richer and cleaner picture than what is obtained using a Stereo AV Cable.","reviewerName":"B. Cooper","summary":"Better Colors and Sharper Resolution, but Some Horizontal Lines Using 480P on HDTVs (*Skyward Sword Update)","reviewText":"Component Cables are Red/Blue/Green = Video; White/Red = AudioStandard AV Cables are Yellow = Video; White/Red = AudioWhen using the Component Cables I noticed an immediate difference in the brightness, color and resolution of multiple Wii games. It isn't quite the difference between something like Standard AV to HDMI with a system such as the PS3 or Xbox360, but enough that it will make games more enjoyable. Backgrounds include more noticeable detail, a wider variety of colors and hues, and sharper contrasts between onscreen images.HOWEVER, I have also noticed that when using Component cables many games (but not all) have slight horizontal lines across the screen that are NOT present with the Standard Wii AV cable. Does anyone else notice the same problem? At first I thought it was an issue with my individual Wii, so I contacted Nintendo. They didn't know what I was talking about and offered no explanation. I thereafter conducted a series of tests with multiple games and alternating between component cables (on EDTV 480p) and the regular AV (standard 480i).Please note that to switch between the progressive and interlaced resolutions, you must switch the Wii Menu settings. 480i is the setting for standard definition using AV cables and 480p is the \"enhanced\" resolution using the Wii component cables for an EDTV or HDTV.  The Wii does not support an actual HD setting, just \"enhanced.\"  This was the precursor to HD resolutions (between HD and Standard).Hopefully I haven't lost you yet.  I read one review that says that it is difficult to turn on the system and access the menu when you switch out the cables.  That isn't true.  When you change cables, just turn the system off and then back on.  The system will start and display the menu regardless of what cable you have in.  If you have standard AV cables, it will just put itself back into 480i (interlaced) standard display.  If you have component, it will leave itself in 480i unless you have switched it to 480p (progressive).  Once you have switched it to progressive it will stay there until you switch out the Component cables or manually turn the setting back to Standard 480i.I found that Smash Bros., Metroid Collection, Sin and Punishment, Punch-Out!, Okami, Mario Kart, Zack and Wiki and Warioware had absolutely perfect resolution without horizontal lines using both cords on both settings. Therefore the component cable was better due to slightly enhanced definition and color. However, on Zelda: Twilight Princess, Link's Crossbow, Tiger Woods Golf 2010 and New Super Mario Bros. I noticed the faint horizontal lines only when using component cables. It is mildly distracting, but the images and colors are still much better than standard cables. On a few games such as Dead Space: Extraction and Goldeneye I noticed the horizontal lines no matter which cables I used. However, the picture was much more difficult to see in darker areas using the standard AV cables.There is nothing wrong with the cable. When I first noticed the issue I returned my Official Nintendo Component Cable and bought the Monster Cable (I thought it was a shielding issue at first). However, I had all of the exact same problems and experienced all of the exact same results. After once again contacting Nintendo I was told that if I continued to use the Monster Cable and experienced any type of problem with the Wii itself, I would void all warranty because I was using a third party cable. I sold the Monster Cable and repurchased the Official Nintendo cable. I experienced the exact same results once again. Therefore, the problem does not lie within the cable. In addition, because some of the games look perfect (Okami/Smash Bros) when using the component cables, I do not believe there is anything wrong with my Wii system. I have the Wii connected to a Sony Bravia XBR4 32\" 1080p HDTV. Anyone able to guess what the problem is? Anyone else see these same lines appear on the screen? If it was my TV, I don't understand why I only see it on some games and not all of them. My only conclusion is that some games were not designed to be used with a component cable connection, even though I do not really understand how apparent interlacing issues would present themselves when using one type of cable from another.So overall, the Official Nintendo Component Cable will definitely give you better colors and sharper contrasts.  However, it comes at a cost in that some games \"may\" have faint horizontal lines in the background.  It seems pretty hit or miss on which games have the problem. Okami had no problems, Dead Space: Extraction and Goldeneye had problems with both cables, and Zelda: Twilight Princess only had the problem with the Component Cable.  One might ask, if you don't see the lines on as many games when using the regular cables...why even bother using the component cables?  The truth is that even with the lines on some games you will notice many many more details and better visuals using the Component Cables.  It would be too much of a hassle to switch out the cord between different games. So is it worth the $20-25?  I'd say yes.  Go with Official Nintendo brand to keep your warranty.  However, be aware that this is far from perfect.I am pretty shocked to see nobody has mentioned the issue with horizontal lines anywhere at all. Any help or comments would be appreciated.________________________________________________________**Update 4/7/11**Even though Wii sales are in decline and not as many people will be reading this post, I felt it imperative to insert one more comment in regards to the \"horizontal lines\" noted in my review.After some more research I found that when the Wii is connected to HDTVs using component cables, the tv will use its scaler to alter the 480p display to match the native resolution (number of dots and lines onscreen) of the tv.  In the case of my Sony Bravia XBR4 this output is 1,366 dots by 768 lines.What this means is that when some games are encoded with different numbers of lines at lower resolutions the tv scaler will \"fill in\" some of the lines to to match the native resolution of that individual tv.  Therefore, some Wii games played on certain tvs will ALWAYS have those annoying lines when using the component cables.If you're LUCKY, you just might own a HDtv that will properly scale problematic games.  This is why some people see resolution issues whereas others will not.Nintendo built the Wii with HD as an afterthought which makes graphical differences much more noticeable today than they were in 2006.I would rate these cables higher than a 3/5 if Nintendo sought fit to release a software update that could address some transparency issues.________________________________________________________**Update 5/5/11**I just purchased a Sharp Aquos 32\" tv with Vyper drive and these lines are much less visible. When quickly panning left to right the image is slightly distored (you can see a semblance of these lines), but otherwise colors are bright and vivid without as much distortion.  Therefore the problem is LIKELY what I had previously assumed: the limitations of the Wii hardware (transparency issues) together with your individual tv's scaler will affect the clarity of your games. The type of HDTV you own determine whether or not these cables will be a wise purchase.**Update 11/21/11** Regarding Skyward Sword and NEW Wii systemAs I had previously mentioned, Twilight Princess was the most problematic game for both of my tvs (highly visible horizontal lines using component cables).  I tried contacting Nintendo about the problem once again, and this time they really tried to determine the source of the problem.  After sending in both the game and system, they ended up replacing my original Wii with a BRAND NEW system (original, vertical standing backwards compatible model).  I was ecstatic, and thought Nintendo had found a problem with some of the hardware regarding transparency issues.However, I was soon disappointed to learn that all of my games looked exactly the same.  As a test, I left widescreen enabled and switched back to 480i.  The game was slightly blurry, but ALL visible horizontal lines were gone.  This finally gave me definitive proof that the problem is with the tv scaler and Wii transparency issues.  480i looks exactly as it should.  Progressive scan adds lines to match the tv's native resolution.I decided to purchase Skyward Sword on release day (yesterday) because I love the Zelda games.  I also felt a lot more respect for Nintendo after they went to such great lengths to attempt to rectify the issue I described to them. Unfortunately, Skyward Sword DOES suffer slightly from the same problem as many other Wii games.  Skyloft has horizontal lines across clouds, and also running through the text bars at the bottom of the screen.  I have a 32\" tv, so sitting about 10 ft away makes them difficult to see.  However, I wish I could say that all of the problems were resolved with Nintendo's newest game.  IGN has a multitude of complaints about these lines on their forums:[...]As you can see, the HDtv you own will determine the extent of the problem.  Fortunately Skyward Sword is much brighter than Twilight Princess with far less lines.  I wish I could say it looked perfect using component, but on my tv it does not.  All in all, I just wanted to point out the validity of my previous assumptions and that neither new cables, new hardware nor any system updates will rectify the issue if the scaler in your HDtv will not properly upscale 480p.My 3/5 star review stands based on the facts above.  Buying these cables is like rolling some dice.  Depending on the tv you own they will either greatly improve your experience, or enhance it slightly with a few caveats.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2010"}

So once we found out a trivia game was coming out on PS3, we knew we had to buy it.  After a week of playing it, I can say that Buzz is a very fun game and is a great option for home entertainment.A few comments:- I really like that you can create and download free quizzes off their website.  I've already created a couple of quizzes and it's very easy.- The online version does contain glitches.  We were kicked out once, even though our network connection is very strong.  Also, we've only played 5 online matches and have already received repeat questions.  That is pretty annoying.- I wish you could create your own characters, but the ones built-in are somewhat entertaining.- The sound quality is very good in a 5.1 surround system.- There are different games within the online version and the home version.  For example, online has \"All That Apply\", where you can choose multiple answers for one question.  Home version does not offer this.  And the home version includes games that the online version does not.  I'm not really sure why.- Game is not that fun with just 2 people. You really need 3 or 4 to make it a blast.- The wireless buzzers are actually pretty large and of good quality.- Even people who don't normally play video games will enjoy this game.  However, there is one thing to be aware of.  Many of the rounds reward the first person to buzz in.  Therefore, those who play video games often and therefore have faster reflexes have a big advantage.- Overall, I would say the questions tend to be on the easy side (especially for those that play bar trivia).  I wish they were a little more challenging, especially since it's all multiple choice.  For example, there is a Final Jeopardy style game where you can wager a certain amount after viewing the category.  Everyone tends to wager the highest amount possible since the questions are easy.In this economy, it's important to stretch your entertainment dollar.  This game will provide many hours of fun times at a good price.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00008KUA3","reviewerName":"Matthew Warner","summary":"Staggering Originality","reviewText":"When this game was first released in the Japanese marketplace (bearing the more-awkward title &quot;Made in Wario&quot;) it created a bit of a stir for being odd, even by Japanese standards; this from the marketplace that brought you a game about nosehair fighting. However, it also quickly gained a reputation for being one of the most original, stylistic, and addictive little games ever released by Nintendo. The gist was that Wario -- a greedy, arrogant mirror-world counterpart to the better known Mario -- set about to break into the newly lucrative video game market by making THE next game to have.Of course, when you're Wario, you're also as lazy as can be, a trait that isn't exactly productive to the time-consuming process of making a great game.Quickly, Wario hatches a plan: Why not recruit all his friends and have everyone churn out as many games as possible in the shortest amount of time? No need to make them deep, just make lots of them!So, what the game becomes in practice is a devilishly simple concept that, nonetheless, is so new and refreshing that it's impossible to put down. Players are confronted with an ever more rapid stream of &quot;Microgames&quot; and given about five seconds to react to (and solve) each one. All the games use only the Directional pad and the &quot;A&quot; button, sometimes even less, and are usually simple enough that it becomes clear WHAT you're supposed to do, even if you're not sure WHY you're doing it.For example, in one scene the player is confronted with a 2D view of a monochrome Ninja standing on the ground a given the command &quot;sidestep!&quot; Then, a series of arrows fly in from the background. It's pretty clear what you're supposed to do, and the trick becomes reacting fast enough to do it. Then it's on to the next microgame, and they start to come faster and faster until the player finally fails four of them.While this premise is good enough to make the game stand on it's own, what really makes this an A-list title is the sheer amount of polish and fine tuning that's evident in every aspect of gameplay. The art style is so gleefully insane that even the most bizzare games fit in perfectly (and there are plenty of  jaw-droppingly bizzare microgames, don't worry.) Half the fun becomes simply seeing what the game is going to throw at you next. It's so unpredictable the first time through that it's hard to believe what you're playing half the time. Of course, the games are over so fast that you'll probably find youself, at one point or another, saying &quot;Did I just...Nah, I didn't see that right.&quot;To further make the game worth the time and effort, Nintendo has packed more unlockables into one cart than you'd have thought possible. As you continue to rack up high scores, more and more of the game begins to unfold, and hardly any milestone the player reaches goes unrewarded. For example, a full version of the NES classic &quot;Dr. Mario&quot; (here renamed Dr. Wario, but still the same exact game) is included in the cart for those willing to work for it. Depending on your gaming habits, that alone may make the game worth the money.What will probably strike most people about this game is simply the fact that it exists at all. This is an idea that, in the wrong hands, would have been instantly banished to the bargain-bin as an incredibly sub-par package deal. Leave to Nintendo, tongue firmly in cheek, to take an insane idea and turn it into a must-have, style-loaded, unforgettable title.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2003"}

{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"PS2 Bruce","summary":"Excellent!","reviewText":"This is one of the few games I would say, buy a console for (whichever you prefer). A couple of things to be aware of though: (1) This game is NOT for children. (2)The violence is more real. The people are much less \"cartoony\" and if you're not really a \"thug\" but even a little sensitive, you might be disturbed, at first. For example, I had failed a mission like 5 times in a row, and some girl walked past me and said something nasty to me; I was in a bad mood, pulled my pistol and shot her. WHen you shoot people now, you can see where the bullet hits, they grab the area, and show pain on their face; they will try to get away, fall down, etc. I actually felt bad, and decided to shoot only in self defense (for awhile anyway). Hitting people with cars is more real, too.Since I first wrote this review, I have been able to spend a few more hours in the game, and while I do agree there are the small problems (for me) that other people have pointed out, this is still one of the best games in my library and I will be playing it a long time to come. Some things I found out:(1) Driving is, indeed \"more realistic\", and therfore more difficult. This is behind a lot of complaints about the \"poor driving controls,\" vis. if you take a corner too fast, you will miss it. If you accelerate to fast into a turn you will fishtail, you will skid when a \"real\" car would skid, etc. I do agree that passenger cars flip over more than they probably would. I have been getting better at driving by practicing; I think in this game as you drive more, use weapons more, etc, you DO get better; it just doesn't note that for you like San Andreas did. As far as controls, I WOULD have preferred to keep the old GTA type button scheme for driving, but you can get used to R trigger instead of \"A\", etc. Besides, I think you can remap the controls, if you want to.One thing that I don't like, and that some other users have pointed out, is that Nico is SLOWER when taking cars. If the door is locked, he breaks the window, \"hot wires\" it, and takes off; this can take what feels like half a minute sometimes, not a good thing if a cop sees. And remember, if you jack a car, kill a random person for no reason, etc, in this game, THE COPS DONT HAVE TO SEE IT. NPC'S WILL CALL 911 ON YOU! So you may THINK you're about to get away with whatever, but \"ping\" 2 stars, wanted circle, augh! This messes up some fun.Next, be careful what you crash into. If you hit somethings like concrete posts, guardrails, etc, Nico will go thru the windshield and be ejected from the car (lol). Again, not a good thing if you are being chased, it seems like it takes FOREVER for him, to get back up, get back in the car, and go. IF there's a cop close to you, you WILL get busted.Last tip: If you are cornered by the cops and there is no way out, get killed, not busted-in this game if you DIE, you lose a bit of money but not all your weapons (yay, finally, thank you Saints' Row), BUT, if you are BUSTED, you lose all your weapons.My favorite thing so far is multiplayer. The whole city is open, there are usually no cops, you can go around and wreak havoc with the NPC's, or if you are in a \"ranked\" mode there will be other people on, trying to kill you and each other etc. One really cool thing-in mutliplayer, find a helicopter, (right trigger throttle, left stick collective) bumpers tail rotor), take off, and fly around, and MARVEL at the city; it is AMAZING. The center island, evidntly is supposed to be manhattan, and you can see landmarks like central park, etc. I flew all the way to Jersey (or whatever it's called in the game) and back to Brooklyn (or whatever its called in the game.Don't miss this game. If you have a 360 or PS3, you MUST play it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2008"}

Fans of the series will enjoy more madcap action that previous games have delivered, buffed up with improved graphics and physics courtesy of the PS3.The gameplay handles well, and hasn't changed from previous Ratchet and Clank games in any significant ways. The normal gameplay is third-person action platforming, using a wide variety of weapons. The weapons differ from traditional action games - there's no standard \"machine guns\" or \"shotguns\" or \"rocket launchers\"; instead, weapons include things like \"electro-whips\", \"tornado summoner\", and \"plasma-beast dispenser\". Even the basic \"shoot at enemies\" weapon is still somewhat unusual - it's like a machine gun, but it's not as fast, and it shoots fire that bounces when it hits enemies. The weapons are fun to use, and even the standard weapons are still enjoyable after a while.The weapons can be upgraded in two ways - either automatically through use, or more specifically by spending \"Raritanium\" (an element acquired in certain special areas) on upgrades. Upgrades made with Raritanium follow a pattern - like the Sphere Grid in FFX, you must buy some upgrades to unlock upgrades further along. These upgrades range from damage to range to firing speed to the amount of bolts (currency) generated by defeated enemies with that weapon. Each weapon also has a different path of upgrades to follow, as well.Besides weapons, the other category of usable items are \"devices\" - more expensive items usable for only one use per purchase that can't be replenished by finding ammo around the stages. These devices have more spectacular effects than regular weapons, ranging from confusing enemies to leeching health from enemies to stunning enemies in a large radius. They are more \"support items\" than actual weapons, but can help out in a tough situation. There is also a wide range of inventory items like jetpacks and magnetic boots, but these tend to be more passive and automatic, simply augmenting your normal movement commands (instead of having to switch them in and out). Weapons are aimed either by shooting while looking in a direction, or an over-the-shoulder mode for more accurate aiming.Other than the normal gameplay, there are also some different segments as well. In some parts, there's rail-grinding sequences, or sequences where you're falling from a great height and must avoid traffic or missiles by moving the Sixaxis controller around. These segments occur reasonably rarely and are short enough that they're fun without being laborious or repetitive. As a whole, the game is very smooth and intuitive, though some of the maneuvers aren't explained very well, despite the pop-up tutorials - in my own case, I didn't trigger the pop-up tutorial for long jumping until I had figured it out myself and was about to do it, despite having unsuccessfully jumped over the same ledge five or six times while trying to figure it out. However, once you figure it out, the game is fun and enjoyable to play.The graphics are well done, maintaining an over-the-top cartoonish style without being burdened by effects like cel-shading or the overusage of lighting and bloom. Everything is crisp and viewing is easy on the eyes, unlike a lot of PS3 games where due to the lighting and reflections it actually becomes hard to see in many circumstances. The animation is smooth and I didn't experience any slowdown even with a huge number of objects on the screen. The sound is about average - it's all right to listen to, but nothing really stood out in terms of music or voice acting.Overall, the game is fun and enjoyable. Fans of the series will find more of the stuff they liked - platforming and destruction, with no fancy add-ons or series-breaking additions. The only real problem is that it's all the same as every other R+C game, but in this case it works for the better.8/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2008"}

I am actually reviewing 3 games total, which are Diablo, Diablo 2, and Diablo 2: Lord Of Destruction. When the first Diablo was released everyone was so happy many copies of the game were sold and it was a hallmark in gaming because it has brought so many ideas, though this game is a hallmark its \"magic touch\" has went away and it kind if rapidly gets boring, the thing that is best about it is the story and the characters you can interact with there are plenty of them, but my favorite part of the game is definetly the the many different types of monsters, for when it was made the monsters were amazing. Now the Diablo 2 review. When Diablo 2 was created in 1999 it was amazing and I am glad to say that it still has its \"magic touch.\" It has an amazing selection of monsters to choose from. It has a good warriors to choose from. In the first Diablo when you got something like a magic weapon when you wear it wouldn't show anything except a normal weapon, but now in Diablo 2 you can see difference like the color or even the look. The graphics are even better then Diablo and amazing for its time. It is much more longer than Diablo, and has a great story behind. Somehow it kind of is violent, for example dead bodies of mutilated people and people exploding. This game has is amazing and will remain amazing. Now Diablo 2 LOD (Lord Of Destrucion.) This game isn't much different from Diablo 2, except for that you have 2 more character classes, a new part in the story, and a little more armor and stuff. WARNING: If you have beat Diablo 2 and you are thinking that you can use your file from Diablo 2 On LOD then you cannot do this. It is recommended that you just play LOD instead of normal Diablo 2, because of the extra content. I forgot to mention probably the best part of the game, Battle Net it works on all 3 games and it makes these game even more fun, it lets you play online sort of like a MMO like game and lets you play with friends and beat the game with them. These hallmarks in gaming are great and shouldn't be missed, if you don't have these games now, it is highly recommended that you buy the games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2006"}

Seriously, Naughy Dog's Jak and Daxter handily bests the Crash games in every way. With responsive contros and quest design blatantly lifted from super mario 64. J and D won't win the most original award, but if you're gonna yoink from someone, take from the best. The game does break some new ground in the realm of disc loading times, specifically, the lack thereof. All of the game's many stages flow smoothly together with no breaks. You can even stand on high vistas and look out to see several areas far in the distance impressive stuff. Those views sure are pretty, thanks to lush, attractive graphics that rival the system's best. Subtle touches, like a continuous, gradual dat to night cycle and realistic looking snow flurries add to the game's visual charm. Aural pleasures take the back seat to graphics. Music is sparse and forgettable, but the bountiful dialog will keep you away from the mute button. Also, unlike some modern action games that are over in a flash, J&amp;D is so obviously inspired by Mario 64, i do feel obliged to dock it a few points for creativity. In fact, one of its biggest flaws, a serious shortage of bosses, is a direct holdover from Nintendo's classic. But overall, it's an impressive effort. No other Play Station 2 platformer comes close this holiday season.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2001"}

It's not unprecedented, though; there have been several Resident Evil rail shooter games before in the form of the \"Resident Evil: Survivor\" sub-series.Umbrella Chronicles goes back to various points in the series - from Resident Evil Zero to Resident Evil 3 - revisiting scenes with established characters. The characters that can be used are dependent on what section of the story is being played. For example, in the early sections based on Resident Evil Zero, the characters from that game (Rebecca Chambers and Billy Coen) can be chosen. However, the actual characters chosen don't have a huge impact on the game, since the entire thing is done from a first-person perspective; the only attack that lets you see your character is the \"counterattack\", which is unique for each character and briefly zooms out the camera to play a short cinematic before getting back to the first-person action.The gameplay itself should be familiar to any rail shooter fan. Basically, it's a first person shooter minus the use of your legs - your character moves around automatically, and you, the player, are only responsible for shooting the things in their way. Using either the Wii remote or the Zapper accessory, the player moves the reticule around and targets enemies on the screen. There are a few different weapons in the game; the infinite-ammo handgun, the powerful but slow shotgun, the high-speed submachine gun, and the explosive grenade launcher are but some of the game's weapon types. In addition, there are two non-gun weapon types: the knife, which strikes quickly at close-range enemies, and grenades, which are limited in supply but do large amounts of damage to enemies in a wide range.Dodging enemy attacks is done through quicktime events or, in most cases, simply shooting the monster before they can get their attack off. On-screen prompts will tell to press a button or wave the Wii remote for certain types of attacks (boss attacks, enemy grapples), but most of them simply cannot be dodged unless you shoot the enemy before they can attack.Environments can be interacted with in a limited fashion. Shooting open crates will reveal items that can be picked up - weapons, ammo, health, or files. There are two kinds of health - herbs, which give immediate revival, and first-aid sprays, which act as extra lives, taking effect automatically if the player is reduced to zero health. The last interactive part of the game is doors. Some doors can be shot open to reveal alternate paths; these doors will highlight when moused over, but generally they're discovered accidentally - there's no big indicator saying \"Secret door over here.\" Alternate paths have different items and monsters, so in some cases finding a secret door can be a big help.The gameplay handling is okay, but not great. There is a big discrepancy between basic zombies and other monsters that tend to have armored points and unblockable techniques. The former can be easily dispatched with a few headshots; the latter tend to require reflexes faster than actual reloading can allow for in a lot of cases. Furthermore, with the rareness of checkpoints in levels, dying can be a major setback and source of frustration.The game does feature co-op gameplay, though, which adds to its old-school appeal. Not all modes and levels support co-op, though there is an unlockable form of co-op that expands the range of levels that can be played with 2 players.The graphics and sound are hardly worth noting; neither has really improved from Gamecube incarnations of the series like Resident Evil 4 or Resident Evil Zero. They're not bad, just not particularly impressive, either. There's no really noteworthy music, and the voice acting is as hammy and overplayed as it usually is. If you don't take it seriously, the voice acting isn't too bad.As a whole, the game is kind of an annoyance to play. Despite the old-school roots, Umbrella Chronicles screws too much up to really be fun. The inclusion of co-op is nice, but there's not that much substance to the game overall. If you're an old-school rail-shooter fan, then it's all right; otherwise, there's not a lot that's new or inventive about it.6/10.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2008"}

Lang \"Chris L.\"","summary":"Preliminary review of a very good game.  Not a modern classic, but still very good.","reviewText":"Being both an RPG and FPS fan, I've seen games like Mass Effect do it VERY successfully.  I ordered this game upon hearing it was being built on the Oblivion engine...one of my favorite games of all time.Fallout 3 does some things very well, and others poorly.  In all, the good outweighs the bad.The good:-HUGE game world.  If you can see it, you can go to it.-The concept of VATS is fun, and will likely become more effective as the game goes on.-Humor...one of the highlights of speaking with NPCs in Oblivion-Scavenging, repairing, bartering, etc.-Weapon creation (schematics + bench = fun weaponry)-Human/human combat (marauders, raiders, mercenaries, etc.)-A few \"made you jump\" moments with enemies surprising around dimly lit corners, etc.The bad:-VATS is limited (as it would be too easy if it wasn't), but non-VATS combat feels a bit wonky.-Tedious (albeit creative) intro tutorial (you'll see what I mean).-Limited variety as far as enemies.-Pip-Boy is difficult to read and/or navigate (as opposed to the \"scrolls\" system of Oblivion).-Pip-Boy illumination makes it difficult to navigate underground/nighttime.In all, I would call this a \"very good\" game, and state that it was well worth my money.However, the flaws keep it from being considered a modern classic.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0000DJX7I","description":"Praised for brilliant scripts and open-ended gameplay, vilified for unapologetic violence and mature themes,Grand Theft Autohas deservedly become one of the most popular game franchises in history. This double pack contains the full versions of bothGrand Theft Auto IIIandGrand Theft Auto III: Vice City, enhanced for Xbox. Xbox gamers can rejoice that the grand king of video games--The Sopranoswith a gamepad--is finally available on the big black box.Grand Theft AutoWithGrand Theft Auto IIIRockstar proves that not all developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games. This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking more structure can embark on dozens of missions driven by a genuinely interesting crime-story plot or steal cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and you can go on vigilante missions. Grab a cab and you can play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi. Take a fire truck and you can earn money putting out fires. The minigames are a good way to unwind after a particularly difficult mission. With so much to do, the game just never gets boring.As you'd expect, there are consequences for criminality. As your random acts of mayhem mount up the police start hounding you, eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic, pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing. Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerGrand Theft Auto III: Vice CityHow big is this game? Even publicists for other games end up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto IIInever dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action. InVice Citythis is--to use a clich&#xE9; that is for once apropos--taken to a whole new level.--David StoeszPros:Open-ended gameplay; player can chose to be relatively law-abiding or engage in wanton virtual destructionVaried missionsBrilliant scripts with Hollywood voice actingRocking sound track (also available in our Music store)Xbox-enhanced graphicsCons:As theThe Sopranosof games,GTA 3draws unwanted attention from overzealous legislatorsNo multiplayer","reviewerName":"Brasington \"johnsan50\"","summary":"KILLL MUST KILLLLLLLL","reviewText":"This is a beautiful version of these games.

Fire upSoul Calibur, and instantly you'll appreciate that the graphics and gameplay are even better than in the arcade version. AndSonic Adventure, with its light-speed gameplay, is sure to wow even the most jaded gamer.It's amazing that such a small machine (it's about the size of your mouse pad) can deliver such incredible performance. Chalk it up to superior engineering. Dreamcast's only downside is that it comes with only one controller and a demo disc. In order to truly take advantage of Dreamcast's capabilities, we recommend outfitting the controller with a Jump Pack and a Visual Memory Unit. Getting one or more extra controllers is also a good idea, because some of the best Dreamcast games support up to four players at once.Why it's so cool:Ultramodern components:Custom-made video, audio, and processor technology blows away the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation and puts Dreamcast in the same league as PS2 and XBox.Integrated modem:In another video-game first, Dreamcast comes with a 56K modem. Use your regular Internet service provider and the separately sold keyboard to access e-mail, shopping, and the World Wide Web. Not only can you upload high scores, participate in chat discussions, and download updates and enhancements for your games, but, through a membership to the SegaNet Internet service provider, you can playQuake III Arena,NFL 2K1, and other games against Dreamcast owners over the Internet.The Visual Memory Unit (VMU):More than just a memory card, the VMU is a miniature portable game system that fits inside a controller--so its LCD screen is easily seen by you but hidden from your opponent.All-in-one entertainment:It plays games. It plays audio CDs. It connects to the Internet and lets you browse the Web or e-mail friends. Our note to the cost-conscious: If you have a Dreamcast system, you just don't need a separate CD player or a separate computer. Dreamcast does it all, and does it well.--Mike Fehlauer","reviewerName":"Jonathan","summary":"Great system, bad timing","reviewText":"The Dreamcast, when it came out, was the best system available. Even today, it can still hold its own against most consoles. The problem that doomed the Dreamcast was timing.Usually, and we see it even today, consoles come out in groups - SNES/Genesis, PlayStation/N64, the PS2/Gamecube/XBox, PS3/Wii/XBox 360. The Dreamcast came between the PS1/N64 wave and the PS2/GC/XBox wave. Casual gamers had just shelled out money for the previous generation, and the more savvy ones were saving up for the next. Developers held off making Dreamcast games, so when the next generation did come out the Dreamcast had a lack of titles and less-advanced tech, dooming it.That said, the Dreamcast is a good console. The controllers look weird but actually sit well in the hands, and I like that the DC has four ports off the shelf. The console is also fairly compact. Plus, for its lack of titles, it had some really good ones: the original Soul Calibur, Shenmue, Skies of Arcadia and Grandia II come to mind.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00005NZ1K","description":"The power-packing Xbox hardware delivers the third Oddworld title in one of the most brilliantly realized settings to grace any gaming system. Blending unique gameplay, humorous characters and interactions, and the aforementioned graphics,Munch's Oddyseesimply feels unlike any other game in the 2001 console gaming lineup. Players control two characters in the game: Munch, a wheelchair-bound hero, and Abe, a character some gamers will recognize from previous Oddworld games. Their goal is to find and free the Mudokon queen, keeper of the remaining eggs of an endangered species.Both characters feature unique talents that, via a tag-team style of play, propel the player through the game. For instance, Abe can climb and jump to reach new areas, as well as temporarily possess an enemy's soul via a chant. The web-footed Munch can swim to new areas and, when on the roll in his wheelchair, use his sonar plug to control machinery remotely. Saving an entire race also requires a coordinated effort on everyone's part. To get the job done quickly, players can deliver verbal commands to kinsmen. They'll gladly greet you (in a witty manner), then gang up on a mean-spirited enemy or accomplish difficult tasks for you. As with the rest of the game world, the finely detailed characters and environments, as well as a refreshing charm, draw you into an experience with the quality of a Pixar film.

{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube. For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"RE perfected at last.","reviewText":"Capcom has finally achieved what I believe they have been trying to do all along with Resident Evil as a series. Many elements of the game have been in need of a serious update for the longest time, and thankfully the vast majority of complaints that I have had with the title have been addresses.I never completed the original. Although I found the story intriguing the horrible graphics, cheesy dialogue, and horrid voice acting put me off. I have finished every Resident Evil game since then and was desperate to find out exactly how the events of the original unfolded, but was not willing to suffer through the original. (RE 2 was the fist game that I had played of this series.)When Capcom announced yet another version of RE 1 I rolled my eyes. I had been suckered into buying several different versions of RE 1 and 2 in an attempt to get the \"definitive version\". I was expecting another port with minimal improvements. However when the first screen shots came out I was blown away. I couldn't believe that a game could look this good, even on GameCube. I thought for sure that Eternal Darkness would be the pinnacle of graphics for the system. I was wrong, but that is not a bad thing as this game offers better graphics than any game on any system and proves that GCN is capable of quite a lot more than many anticipated. The game does not play in progressive scan, which is sad because this game would look great on a 16X9 screen, and does not support Dolby Pro Logic II, which would have been nice too, but it still offers the most stunning graphics of all time, and has great sound to go with it. While the music is sparse, it is moody and atmospheric, and while RE 2 and Code Veronica offer a better sound track, this one helps set the mood and tension. There are plenty of moments where your own shadow will be used against you... or is it your shadow? Sometimes it's not what you see that will spook you, but what you hear. Many new game play elements have been added, such as having to dispose of the bodies to prevent Zombies from being reanimated. A reanimated zombies ad tension... and drains ammo.The only problem with the game is that the RE control set up is still intact. Capcom really needs to use the Devil May Cry engine more often. It couldn't hurt to be able to run away from those blasted Hunters more easily. But once you get used to it isn't that big of a deal. I killed Yawn without taking a hit. Using the C-stick I was able to dodge every attempt at a strike. Players can get good enough to go through this game without taking a hit.The game is about 70% changed from the original, but enough of it is intact that MOST puzzles will be solvable on their own, which is good. However, many of the solutions, or the items you get for solving them are entirely different. If you've played through the original, even to the end, this game is still a must own for any GameCube owner.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2002"}

Despite the excellent gunplay, top-tier plot and phenomenal set pieces, it felt like it was lacking the depth and realism found in titles like \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare\" (not one of my favorite games, but still a well-produced piece of interactive entertainment). But upon Insomniac's latest  release in the franchise, I've come to see that the third time is, indeed, the charm. \"Resistance 3\" comes bursting forth onto the marketplace with guns a-blazing, and boy, are those guns ever flashy.Following the events of \"Resistance 2\", original protagonist Nathan Hale has been killed by James Capelli, who takes the role of the player-character in \"R3.\" Now a black sheep for killing the military's greatest hero, Capelli lives on the run with a group of citizens, along with his wife and sickly son. However, a startling new revelation forces the man to finish what Hale started, lest the Earth fall into another Ice Age from a wormhole opened up by the Chimera. Leaving behind all that he cares about, Capelli travels with returning character Dr. Malikov to put an end to the oppressive invaders once and for all. The narrative in this game takes on not only a universal tone like the previous games, but introduces a character who doesn't feel like a logical military man. Capelli is, for all intends and purposes, a more compelling protagonist simply because he feels more human. It's fascinating to see the overblown story we've become accustomed get balanced out with a heavy emotional component, and makes for a more interesting plot as a whole.The gameplay is easily accessible for players of the previous games, as well as newcomers, but it also is somewhat of a departure from what we've come to expect. Gone are the set pieces that are beautiful yet still; never before in the series have the environments been so surprisingly unstable. Expect things to collapse and be altered at a moment's notice by every action the enemy takes. Speaking of enemies, the baddies in \"R3\" are the most intelligent in the series. While you will experience the occasional idling Chimera, they for the most part react the way a real opponent would on the battlefield. They are quick, cunning and ready to annihilate you with a few shots. I wasn't ever able to simply sink into a comfortable alien-killing routine, because the aliens were gaining more intelligence as I ventured onward.This makes killing them with the excellent arsenal of weapons all the more satisfying. I have always stood by my opinion that \"Resistance\"'s weapon list equaled that of \"Halo\", but with this entry I've began to think that it has now surpassed that level. Whether it be the Magnum with explosive capability in every slug, or the heat-seaking assault rifle, secondary fire has never felt so fleshed out in the franchise. It no longer feels like an afterthought, and instead serves a very important role in battle strategies. Annihilating your foes doesn't feel like an obligation, and is now a \"Bulletstorm\"-like pleasure. Adding to this is the significant increase in blood and dismemberment in this entry, making every kill exciting and new.Aiding the immersion in \"R3\"'s shattered world are the beautiful graphics, which rival that of the OTHER PS3 juggernaut franchise, \"Uncharted.\" Every crack in the ground, every shard of shrapnel, every explosion... it feels like it pulls you further into the vicious war. Your enemies move with disgusting fluidity, with smooth animation that complements their revolting features. Each new level is cutscene-caliber, especially the St. Louis segments. Also helping is the ever-reliable orchestral score and professional voice acting, which is without a doubt the best we've seen from this franchise so far.Multiplayer is a blast, but is also a rather standard affair. You've got your Deathmatch, your Team Deathmatch, your Capture the Flag, etc. This time around, there's a somewhat robust level progression system, but it feels, like many FPS progression systems nowadays, like a mock-up of \"CoD:MW\"'s system than it's own original thing. This isn't too much of a gripe on my part, though, because the fact remains that this game offers both a fun and visceral online experience that promises to last for ages to come.\"Resistance 3\" sets not only a new standard for the series, but a new standard for first-person shooters as a whole. An alien invasion has always seemed like a premise hard to relate to in a game, because storytellers have tended to focus more on the big picture than on the individual lives being affected. With Insomniac's brilliant game, we get to see a reinvigorating kick in the collective ass to conventional alien stories, a kick that should send other studios back to the drawing board when it comes to how they craft their games. Until they do that, \"Resistance 3\" will take over the special place in my heart that \"Halo 3\" held for so long: the spot of my favorite console shooter. Inventive, intense and downright exhilarating, this is game that every PS3 owner should own, and if you don't own a PS3, then I daresay that this game is one to buy it for.Story: A+Graphics: A+Sound: A+Gameplay: A+Multiplayer: A+Overall: A+","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2011"}

The game is great, better that GTA4.  Slightly up there with Fallout 3.  But like Fallout 3, the game-play has deteriorated.  Not by having to do the same thing over and over again.  I'm taking about glitches.  These glitches are caused by cheating or any other outside effects that modified the game.  No.  These glitches have been occurring more than usual.  After an hour of play, the game-play either froze or becomes unplayable.  Meaning that controlling the main character in the game, not in multi-player, was impossible.  The only way to continue is through only two ways.  Rebooting the system or, and only if its possible, reload a save point.Rent this game or wait until the price goes down based on shelf time or returned/exchanged.  Paying full prices is outright stupid.Also, Rockstar's decision to downgrade the xps in there multi-player makes the whole process and fun a downgrade as well.  Sure some people are \"farming\" for points, but how is this an issue when these actions are available to the rest of the players.  No one is cheating.  If these actions isn't what they wanted, then they should have never put it in.  If this nitpicking, tough.  This is Rockstar, and it seems that they've been losing their longevity in there current consoles games.

Join Mario as he ushers in a new era of video games, defying gravity across all the planets in the galaxy. When some creature escapes into space with Princess Peach, Mario gives chase, exploring bizarre planets all across the galaxy. Since he's in space, Mario can perform mind-bending jumps unlike anything he&#x2019;s done before. He'll also have a wealth of new moves that are all based around tilting, pointing and shaking the Wii Remote.","reviewerName":"Nona","summary":"Classic Mario fun with a twist!","reviewText":"This game is the latest entry in the great line of Mario titles in video game history.  It's similar to Super Mario Sunshine (but better) and Super Mario 64, and as much fun as the best Mario games of the past.The central conceit of this game is that Mario journeys through many small \"worlds\" each with its own gravity.  As a result, there's a lot of strange, disorienting gameplay, but it never gets frustrating and is always fun.  The controls are intuitive and responsive, and the gameplay is polished to the high standard that we expect from Mario games.  Although the game starts out fairly easy, some of the levels are quite challenging, even for veteran gamers.  Fortunately, it's not necessary to beat every level to finish the game, so newer players will be able to enjoy this game as well, while still having challenges to tackle.The structure of the game is similar to previous Mario titles, with Mario adventuring through various worlds trying to find stars.  After obtaining a certain number of stars, the final level is unlocked and if Mario beats Bowser you can see the ending.  However, there is a tremendous amount of content to do even after seeing the ending.  There's the challenge of getting all 120 stars, and even after you've done that there's a pleasant surprise which greatly extends the length of the game...The music and graphics in Super Mario Galaxy really deserve to be commended.  While the Wii is not nearly as powerful as the PS3 or Xbox 360, this game proves that you don't need the strongest technical specs to have great graphics.  The game is a bit cartoony, but in a beautiful and aesthetically pleasing way.  The music is also superb, which is slightly surprising for a game which does not have a tremendous amount of plot or narration.If you're a veteran gamer, you won't be disappointed by Super Mario Galaxy.  If you're new to games (as many owners of the Wii are), pick up this title to see why Mario is so popular.  This is one of the best games to come out on the current generation of consoles and will not disappoint.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2009"}

I also love the increased phasing with this expansion.  Flying in Azeroth really gives the game a whole new feel also.  Flying over all the zones we have been confined to ride through since WoW's release is cool by itself.  There are a few minor bugs right now but that is expected with the release of a major expansion.  I have faith that Blizzard will clean a few things up in a timely fashion.  I was skeptical of how \"epic\" this xpac would be but it did not let me down.  Of course there is the same type of kill/collect quests but there is some new fun type of quests also.

It's like playing a really fun and interesting movie.Foot Combat - at first a little weird, but once you get the hang of it, it's exceptionally fun. Something you'll find your self looking forward to.Graphics - a few texture pop-ins and rare and non-problematic frame rate issues. Overall just great.Driving/combat with the Mako tank - the tank portions sucked, and drug the game down. Your F***ing torret doesn't move up and down while your fighting enemies on various levels, you you have to physically be on the same level, though they can shoot you from where they are.- The reticle seems to be the exact same color as the back ground.- 5 hits and your dead. Yeah, you can heal your tank, but like once, and even then you have sit there imobile by while dudes wail on you.- You'll be fighting hordes of enimies you can't see until after they've hit you three or four times.- When you die, and you will die often. You have to watch the same UNINTERUBTIBLE F***ing cinematics instead of just being thrown back in.Just note, the tank is a small portion of the game. But one so frustrating it'll make you want to throw your controller.Bottom LineIt's a great, beautiful looking game.

Instead of axes attached to chains, you wield this very large sword, which looks pretty good, and gets stronger as you move along in the game.

{"product_name":"B002I0H79C","description":"Gears of War 3","reviewerName":"Parrish C. Moore \"RvngoftheNERD\"","summary":"Most complete Gears yet!","reviewText":"This is the most COMPLETE game I have ever played. I honestly can't see myself thinking \"hmmm. I wish they had this on this game!\" Everything is here. Great campaign!Including that it is 4 player co-op online and 2 player split screen offline. Things like that make this game accessible no matter what. Which is why I love it. Played the campaign for about 3 hours and everything is set perfectly. Same great characters plus more, great action and everything is balanced to not give you the feeling that you're getting bored or doing too much. With all that said, I dont want any spoilers so I'll stop there.Arcade Mode- I believe this is another great addition. If you've play Call of Duty 4:Modern Warfare. You'll remember their Arcade Mode. I loved seeing the points pop up as if I was at an arcade or even playing the multiplayer. I just loved that aspect of it and it also adds a level of competitiveness with friends. Thats about all this mode offers though, but still great fun.Horde 2.0- If you're a fan of killing, killing and more killing. You'll love Horde 2.0. Horde 2.0 adds more depth to the previous games Horde. I remember my cousin playing with me and using the shield to block off Locust. I wondered why I didnt think of that myself? Guess I'm just not as creative. lol, but now with kills and downs. You earn money to by things such as: weapons, barricades, decoys and bases. All of these things add a whole new level to the Horde. Making it so that now you and your friends can literally create a base and blockade to defend yourselves through the endless amounts of hordes. (actually i think the last level is 50 but it feels endless lol.) I can see Horde 2.0 adding a lot of replay hours to this game seeing as how fun it is.Beast Mode- I only played the first 12 levels of this on casual to get the idea of what it was. You can pick which Locust you want to be but you have to pay for it. So the points you earn killing go to the beast you are. The catch is you only get a minute to kill the however many survivors and you gain more time as you go on killing them and destroying their turrets and machines. I found this mode fun since I always wanted to know what it was like to be on the Locust side of the Horde. My only problem was that I found myself going back to certain Locust with guns since that's what I was comfortable with. I think that's only me though and others will have great fun with this mode.Multiplayer- Yes Multiplayer. What everyones been waiting for. Honestly Im not going to spend much time of this review on it. Its everything thats been talked about or from Gears of War 2. I believe they added more modes (ie Deathmatch). Though from playing the matches that I have so far. It's smooth and responsive and I think thats most important. The guns are amazing. I truly think that they are balanced and you just have to find your match. I prefer the Lancer and Gnasher but others differ of course. The characters are better than ever. I say that because there is more of a variety of characters to choose from and unlock. As well as gun skins, badges and ribbons. This all gives the game much more replay value.To end this off. This game honestly gives you your $60 worth! There are some \"extras\" (mainly gun skins) that you have to pay real money for. But they arent taking away from the game by any means. This game gives you great modes for however you feel and offers online and offline gameplay even with bots. Making it feel as if you are always connected and never missing out on more fun. Also the graphics are amazing just as any other Gears of War game. I would highly suggest this to any shooter fan seeing as this is the most complete shooter out there at the moment.Update 9/25/2011- Hey guys. Just wanted to update the review a bit. After playing this game for countless hours and getting some feedback in the comments section, I felt it would be good to update you on more of the details. I've played more into the campaign, Horde Mode and multiplayer. As another reviewer said the Beast mode is only 12 levels. Which is a real let down honestly. At one point it leaves you wanting more and another may make you happy that it's over. Once you unlock more Beasts and Locusts it gets easier if you have the money to spend. The Berserker is supposed to be blind but I found myself find enemies perfectly and destroying them with one hit. You start of with a minute to kill every survivor and there are more notable Gears characters that you have to kill as well. Along with the challenges, there will be more to bring you back to at least finish those out. Other than that this mode isnt as appealing as the others.Horde 2.0 is crazy fun with friends. Having up to five players in the party stealing kills, setting up blockades and upgrading everything is a blast. Teamwork is needed to survive, this is no cakewalk. 50 hordes of enemies until the end takes a couple of hours, loads of patience and good teamwork as I stated. The more you level up your turrets, barricades, sentry guns and even a huge gorilla suit. You'll upgrade enough to where they cost less and defend better. You'll want these things to distract and protect you from the locust since in later waves (every 10 to be exact) Locust will gain 2x health, 2x accuracy and you take 2x damage. But this mode is great fun and adds a ton of replay value compared to the Beast mode.Multiplayer- I believe the multiplayer is very unique compared to other shooters. Specifially what caught my eye with this game is that if you arent good they arent necessarily trying to make it so that you are better or equal the playing field if that makes any sense. If you arent that great at this game, it's going to show. Unlike say Call of Duty where they give you perks and other tools to somewhat equal the playing field. Not to say they dont give you the tools to get better. As I state above, you can play with bots on or offline and at any of the 4 difficulties. So you can practice all you need to with certain weapsons, levels or difficulties all you need to before you jump right into the online world of Xbox Live. ANOTHER thing is that these bots arent aimbots. They actually feel more so as if you're playing human players. Just not as great becuase I have seen some great guys on xbl. Along with that, there are dedicated servers and you wont run into lag as much depending on your own connection. This is great. Matches run smooth making you want to play this multiplayer more. Also there are a ton of unlocks! Ribbons, Medals, Mutators, Characters. As you level up through all of the modes, you will gain these. Gaining them all is no easy task but its fun in the process and will be very very time consuming.I didnt want to get too much in the campaign before but I have to note a few things. The 4 player co-op runs so amazing! I havent had any hiccups or disconnects with it and Im in Germany playing with 3 friends from all around the United States. The story is so much better than I expected. No spoilers for the people who have yet to play but this is a great follow up and and ending to such a great series. Im on Act 4 now and its about 5 acts. It's said that the campaign is about 10 hours and I've been playing on Hardcore for about 8 so I see the end coming soon. I just cant believe how much fun I've had though. They've fixed alot from previous games and the beta and it shows. Some things still dont work as need but I can see patches roll out to fix some of these. My biggest gripe is when you want to retro lancer someone and you charge at them. You have to charge from about 20 feet away. I guess that only makes sense to gain the momentum but I would like something other than to do just bump into them. But thanks to the other reviewers Stephen and Snake for the feedback as well. :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2011"}

That is one of the most exhilerating moments while playing.The students are defined in 1 of 4 levels, basically mapping to the 3 face buttons and both L1/R1 I believe depending on your boost level and then combining that with some direction on your analog stick. This results in quite a few combination *technically*, but actually being fast enough or coordinated enough to pull of a face-button and 1 of 8 directions differently each time is a lot tricker than you think, especially since pre-loading your jump (pushing down then flicking up right as you crest a jump to throw yourself into the air) already positions your hands and fingers in a certain feel - coming out of a preload and immediately into the opposite motion, like down and triangle is pretty tricky.I found myself pulling off the *same* stunts per-level over and over again (which give you less and less boost as you keep repeating stunts) just because it was the most natural feel to me when I frantically tried to pull something off before hitting the ground.The game is fairly forgiving, I readily lost some races and readily won others... I couldn't detect any rediculous \"rubber banding\" that is a stable in the Need for Speed series and some other racers, it was a very natural feel of either \"I'm loosing\", \"I'm catching up\" or \"I'm winning\"... and in some cases \"I'm destroying them!\".The amount of polish in this game is evident from the get-go and never really lets go... it's a really safe buy if you like racers and just a lot of simple and accessible fun with great graphics and excellent track design.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2008"}

This time around, Echoes takes on a much darker appearance, even in the light world.  things just seem gloomier,and in some spots creepier.  but this is definitely not a bad thing.  fans of Prime will love Echoes, just as i do.there are still numerous things to scan and you are awarded with nifty and interesting bonuses and secrets depending on how much you get scanned.  the weapons in this game are as cool as Prime's, but this time around, two of the four beams you get have limited ammo.  killing foes with the light beam awards dark ammo, and killing foes with the dark beam awards light ammo.  it's not too hard to understand.the light and dark worlds are all well designed and never feel repetitive.  in the light world, the only way you take damage from a really hard fall, or from enemy attacks.  in the dark world, you take damage just from walking around outside the cool-looking light orbs.  but by standing in them, you can slowly gain your life back.  you become quite dependant on the little bubbles of light and fear not being able to find one in the next room.  and you really begin to dread the dark world, not because it's no fun to play, but because if you're not careful, you will get stomped into the ground by the dark side's super aggressive inhabitants.  but strategy will always when.  if you are outnumbered, try and find a good light orb to stand in and circle-strafe while targeting foes.  because if they step into the light, they will take damage.  most enemies have projectiles in both worlds, so you're going to have to get used to dodging them from multiple angles at once.the only real 'complaint' i have with this game is the fact that sometimes i just had no freakin' idea where the hell i was supposed to go.  i wish Retro would have made the objectives a little more obvious.  but that's only a minor complaint, as the world you must trek through is quite a sight to see.  the game's environments seem much more open this time, even though they are more closed in.  not every area has walls surrounding it.  there are lots of cliffs and beautiful scenery.  cloth blows in the wind and the perticle effects are awesome.  beams look really cool and the enemies, as well as Samus, are well detailed and hail as some of the best graphics for any system.some might comlain about this game's lack of story.  sure, there are little dialogue bits here and there (as well as some actual voice-overs, but they are just usually evil laughter or a blurb somewhere.  though in one part people were actually talking to eachother, but other than that, there is just reading.)  and again, your main goal is to locate a bunch of keys.  but who cares?  most of the classic games in history have little to no story.  the first metroid:  landed on planet, kill things until game is complete.  Doom:  landed on planet, kill things until game is complete.  so who cares if a game nowadays has a barely there story?  as long as the gameplay kicks ass, story doesn't really matter to me.and the gameplay does kick ass.  fighting enemies is easy and fun, thanks to the lock-on function and strafing.  switching through weapons and visors is fast and simple.  swinging around with your grapple beam is always a pleasure.  the bosses, while some can be quite a pain, are all well designed and fun to fight.  and jumping from here to there has never been more of a breeze.  never once did i miss a jump do to the fact that i couldn't really tell where my feet were.  i always felt safe leaping over large gaps of nasty phazon or bottomless pits.so all in all, this is an excellent sequel to a ground-breaking game.  buy it if you're a fan of Prime, just be aware that the difficulty has been ramped up a bit.  so this one's a bit of a challenge at times, and is riddled with...well...riddles.  some of them are hard, while other a blind baby could figure out.  i still haven't gotten the chance to play the multiplayer, but i've heard it's not all that special.  so buy this game now and get ready to fear the dark side.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2004"}
{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"K. Geddings","summary":"Worth the 60 bucks....need i say more?","reviewText":"Lets just say right now that for the money this is a game that will not shortchange you on content.  Unlike the previous guild wars this is a true MMO (but with some nice twists).  Guild Wars 1 felt more like a single player game with multiplayer \"hubs\" as only the towns had players in it. the rest of the world (other then the pvp zones) were instanced and with being able to have npc party members a lot of people like myself simply avoided other players all together and just ran out into the world using npc buddies sure the game felt \"alive\" in towns but once you got into the main world areas it was just you and your team which did not feel like a true MMO.Guild Wars 2 changes all that, and at first thoughth the idea of losing the option of having a NPC party might seem a bit sad for some, but honestly with the extreame ease of grouping up in GW2 you really wont miss it much. In most other MMOs in order to obtain rewards or do much you have to find a group for a \"quest\" all members had to have that quest in the group in order to gain stuff from it you couldnt just run up to a group of players fighting something and join in and hope you get the rewards because you may not have the quest they have and then you would also have to fight over loot drops etc. This to me always made grouping up frustrating, as often you would have to either find someone in chat, or stand around towns hoping to find some people to group up with.  Also if you were doing a quest and having trouble with it a lot of people near you might be able to help but would have no reason to do so if they did not have the same quest.  In Guild Wars 2 they change all of this by the dynamic event system if you or anyone near you are near an area when an event is trigged all players in that area will be alerted to that event and in joining each person who helps out will gain rewards from it.This makes it so you can join a group without \"actually having to join a group\" I.e you can litterly run up to a group of players fighting a horde of invaders in a town and join in with the fighting and reap the rewards without any chat and without any bickering over loot.but the nice thing about Guild Wars 2 if you want to group up in the traditional since you have more reasons then ever to do so.  For instance, the problem with most MMOs is that each area is set to a level range, this is no diffrent in Guild Wars 2, however, while in other games once you out level an area you have no real reason to go back other then perhaps to complete some quests etc..., in Guild Wars 2 if you are say level 80 and run back to a level 1-10 zone you will automatically scale down to the lower level while still using your gear and abilities, this means even if you reach max level, you can go back to any other area you have been, take on quests, and complete events with others without overpowering everyone and causing greif.  This also means that a level 1 player who has a friend who is level 80 can join in the game and the level 80 player can run around with the lower level player and still both enjoy things.  Everquest 2 has this to a point but i think in Guild Wars 2 this is done more easily.Also while dungeons will offer unique rewards the gear you get is no more powerful then the gear you would get elsewhere for some that may seem like meh....but for others like me it means you dont have to worry about running all the dungeons over and over and over and over to get the \"best gear\". its about skills its about exploring the world and its about having fun. and unlike other MMOs where you can easily be standing in an area have no idea where the real quests are dont feel like dragging up a wiki to find them ...or the quests you are given you cant quite do so well or ) all you have to do is just stand around for a while and usually something will happen nearby that you can join in, this makes for a more interesting way to level and exploreYou are also given a lot more insensitive to explore the world vs other games as while there are no mounts, with the numerous waypoints (over 200 i think) in the game you have an easy to use instant travel system that anyone can use regardless of class for a few coin more MMOs should have this as it can be difficult to sometimes navigate back and forth, back and forth between areas. World of Warcraft has this problem the world is huge but even with flying mounts and ships/flying taxis it still can be a chore to really get around fast even at max level with Guild Wars 2 i imagine at max level and having a lot of waypoints open it is very easy to travel around.The graphics i find are very nice.  You wont get the level of say crysis 2 or skyrim but the art and graphics are still very good,  One gripe that is easily fixed with a settings change is the bloom however this was the case i think with the original game and the case with Guild Wars 2, the bloom is just way too much even on \"low\" settings so i find it best to just turn off post processing even on a higher computer, you still get very nice graphics but everything doesnt look over glowly that you might miss some of the finer details :-)the music and sound are also great as well and overall a very nice production value, the world is huge even just the little bit i have seen so farand one cool feature is in other games like WoW and EverQuest 2, your faction you chose limits you to what main cities you can go to, in WoW if you try to go to the inside of the Undercity as a Alliance player you are most likely going to be killed  which means you are sort of locked out of seeing a few sites based on what faction you are.In Guild Wars 2 there are 5 large starting areas/cities for each of the 5 races and any of the races can visit any of the other cities (actually quite near the start after you enter your main race's city there is a portlal to a \"neutral city so to speak that lets you access the other 4 cities too which is nice and for PVPs out there they are 4 large maps /areas for world vs world PVP which is nice as well! (i think you can access that area from level one too). what sets PVP apart from other games is that in other games as in the dungeons its all about your gear the more you are in dungeons and the more you PVP you get better gear but that puts newcomers at a disadvantage in Guild Wars 2 all players in PVP have simular gear stats in PVP and so it does not matter what matters is your skill in how you use it in battle.  So it makes it more skill based rather then gearscore based.Overall i find the game very fun what little i have played and the features and vast world really give you your moneys worth, considering you get 5 races who each have there own starter area and story as well as 8 classes and varations with them as your weapon you chose also changes part of your skillsI also like that unlike other games like Wow where you could have 50 skilsets and a hotbar that can be full of just in my opinion way too many skill things to keep up with ,  in GW2 you have at max at one time 10 skills, 5 weapon skills and 5 other skills you chose , this simplifies things a bit but ..the options still are vast in customizing your character and playstyleOverall dont listen to the low scores here, Guild Wars 2 is one of the most interesting MMOs out in years and unlike the other MMOs with no monthly fees i think this is the first true MMO without a monthy fee that does not feel crippled in most all other MMO games that are \"free to play\" they still have a subscription based service and the free to play users are usually capped with certain things such as items, gold etc in Guild Wars 2 you have no such caps there is a in game item store you can get with real money however all the items in it (other then some account services and a choice to upgrade to the digital deluxe items from the base game) are not going to give you any more advantage over other players (other then maybe some temp stat boosters and such and you have the option to use in game money to convert to the store currency so that you do not have to pay any extra money too) but this is a nice option because it allows the devs to still make money from the game even after it comes out while not having a monthly fee.Hopefully they will also come out with expansions down the road that will add to the game world too!if theres any MMO out there thats worth the price of buying it this would have to be it, while in WoW for those starting out who do not have the base game at all it would end up costing you about this much to get all the addons and such you pay 60 bucks for GW2 and you dont pay any more monthy fees or anything that alone i think is worth the price right there I think more game companies should consider this type of model it blends free to play with pay to play. You still have to pay for the base game, but after that its free!and unlike some other free to play games Guild Wars 2 Feels like a real full MMO not a watered down game that has multiplayer and \"calls itself a MMO\" when its really not or it feels limited..  You wont run out of things to do for quite some time and even if you do you can always go back and help out newcomers too!for those like me with plenty of time on their hands but who hate the grindy \"ok now what what do i do next?\" feel of most MMos this is the game for you!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2012"}

Well, at first I didn't really get into it, but after a while I couldn't stop playing. Now, even as I write this review, I want to play it! Only thing I don't like is the cycle of songs they play. The demo has this awesome track, that I've yet to come across. I just keep hearing this song saying \"Here we go\", or \"Slave girl\" or something. It's basically getting old hearing the same songs, but I guess you could mute it.Other thing is that this game is nonstop. I usually push pause when I get tired. Then continue to beat my high score. The world block feature doesn't work for me for some reason. I thought maybe I was too late or something, but one time the world block wasn't erased and I still couldn't add my score. They should have made it easier to use that feature.Now that I think about it, I guess you can make your own playlist, but I just like playing the campaign. The more I play the better I get. I didn't mind the price, but I noticed that people are mentioning it. Yes, I also think it's high for what you get in the game. Frankly you're not getting a lot.

Does Bond ever age? Does he ever get a vacation without it turning into a firefight? How many mysterious foreign chicks does he need to bang before he realizes he should retire and get married already? Seriously, no one will be as good as Sean Connery and Daniel Craig can't even pull off Bond to save his life. This dude is a serious joke, but thankfully you won't even care when you play this stupid, yet fun, game. This is one of those sleeper hits that has a retarded story and game play yet you still finish the whole thing because it's just stupid fun. Kind of like bathroom jokes; they don't do any harm, or good, yet they are still fun to say and laugh about over and over again. Quantum of Solace is like the bathroom joke of sleeper hit FPS's; you have your basic follow up and the punchline is what keeps you laughing. While you can completely forget about the retarded story about Bond and some terrorists dudes who are doing this and that I have no freaking clue and I didn't care. Daniel Craig has bit parts of his voice in the game and his model has one expression and never seems to change.While this game is seriously flawed there are a lot of good things to keep you playing (RENT IT ONLY!) The game looks really good, while not superb, it can pass off as an above average next-gen game which is a plus. Secondly, the game has super awesome guns and they all feel really powerful. While they has more acronyms than a NASA space launch you have your pistols, silenced pistols, sub machine guns, sniper rifles etc etc yada yada. While they aren't anything new they look cool, feel powerful, and sound cool and they all go BOOM! You also have grenades which are kind of retarded since you only get to carry ONE GRENADE AT A TIME!!! The game actually has a semi-useful cover system that is both great and flawed at the same time. While you can sprint around and stuff you can hit A to dash into cover (think Gears of War) and you have your typical blind firing, and all that covering crap. The flawed part is that when you get hit by a grenade you suddenly stand up, also if you aim to far to your sides Bond tends to stick his head out and you can easily get killed this way.Basically, the gun play is your typical standard FPS stuff with retarded AI to boot. You'll have swarms of guys coming after you and they just stand there and let you blow them apart. Speaking of blowing apart the game has an \"environmental damage\" system where you can shoot flashing objects to damage enemies (like we haven't seen that before!) This actually does help when you have seven guys under a wooden platform full of explosive barrels. Shooting those support beams is just oh-so-awesome. The game is full of adrenaline pumping sequences like your OMG!! button pressing cut scenes (which are actually fun) and this is where you really feel like Bond so that's always a plus on the cinematic side. Since this is a Bond game you can use stealth in a lot of the levels, but it's very shallow and not implemented well. It really feels like an old PlayStation or N64 game where you just hide behind a wall, dodge this camera's spotlight, disable that camera, and shoot that guard. The cameras don't even notice when you pop some lead into a guys head right in the camera's view. I don't know what the developers were trying to prove except for the fact that using old mechanics in 2008 doesn't work too well.A lot of times you'll not know what to do and you'll blow your cover due to trial and error (again a 10 year old thing) and you have to restart all over again (if you want to stay stealthy). So, you can sneak around, but it feels really old and doesn't really work out too well. Of course you have to have some Bond moves to perform and this is done by pressing the L stick and pushing the on screen button and watching a 2-3 hit instant kill! While this is cool the animations get repetitive, when the camera pulls back into first person mode you get disoriented since sometimes the game will flip you around, and it's too easy to do. It's cool sneaking up behind a guy and pulling off a Bond move, but after about twenty times you'll get sick of it. Another thing I didn't like is there were no driving sequences. What's a Bond game with no DRIVING!!?!?! There is, however, a cool train sequence that is pretty cool with you decoupling cars, jumping from decoupled cars, and just all that cool Bond stuff. While that's the basic game play you can see there is a lot missing that should have been in here.With the mechanics feeling about 10 years old this really drags the experience down and after awhile the game feels more like a chore that you're forced to play. Thankfully, the game isn't very long at all since you can beat it in about 6-7 hours. The multiplayer is OK, but nothing super special just your standard FPS online action and you won't be coming back for this often since the mechanics are somewhat flawed. I really loved this game though since there was a lot of explosions, shooting, sneaking, Bond moves, and cool locales. If you want an awesome weekend rental pick this up and you'll have a blast.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

This game pisses me off because it's obviously high regarded and loved by all, yet I cant find out why.  Gamespot gave it a 9.5. I can't seem to figure out what I'm missing. Just sheer size, mass and freedom of a game does not make it fun to play (to me). You will walk around this huge world and encounter only a handful of enemies, all very weak.  The enemies difficulties do not seem to change depending on where you are on the map either.  You can investigate caves, but there are only a few weak enemies in them, very little treasure, and nothing exciting happens, ever!  The battle controls are clunky, he seems to swing the sword so slow and delayed.  You can heal but it doesn't seem to do anything.  And gaining experience depends on using the skills that you attribute in the beginning of the game, not fighting enemies like traditional RPG's. Yes you can steal and virtual do anything you want, but that gets old after a while.  The fact that you can travel from virtually any point in the map automatically, takes away from the game big time, traveling is a huge part of RPG's for me. Also, If the action gets too tough for you just go into the menu and slide the difficulty meter to easy, WTF is that?!?Having played about 20 hours, it just wasn't fun for me (needless to say).  I am not a deviant, usually when games have such ridiculously positive ratings like this one, I end up loving them like everyone else, which is why I'm so vexed!The graphics are indeed very good with a real-time environment,the sun sets and the moon comes out etc, and all the NPC's do their own thing. This game does not play out like a typical RPG for me, it seemed more like a virtual reality game, a Sims game.I love the FF series, exploring caves, fighting monsters, buying and selling weapons and armor, which is all in this game, although a huge problem for me is that it lacks incentive.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2008"}

Starting life as Black Lotus, a new original IP from United Front Games, it starred a female protagonist and had a lot of potential. Then Activision came in and basically said, \"Hey, United Front Games, we have this IP called True Crime, so why not take the core parts of Black Lotus and turn it into a True Crime game?\", and thus, True Crime: Hong Kong was born. Showing a ton of potential, True Crime: Hong Kong came out swinging with positive press and gamer reactions, then Activision suddenly canceled it out of nowhere, because they said it couldn't compete with other games in the genre, couldn't sell as many units as they wanted, couldn't crack a specific Metacritic rating, and didn't meet the standard for Activision games, even though they put out Prototype 2 this year, which isn't nearly as good as Sleeping Dogs in any category. Activision has also put out games like Blood Drive and has a new mediocre Nascar game in the pipeline. Needless to say, Activision was making up a bunch of excuses, as if their whole catalog is some masterful thing, but they only have two games out of many which are selling well, and those are Call of Duty and Skylanders. Like Tony Hawk and Guitar Hero, Activision will drive those into the ground, if they haven't already. Anyways, after a bunch of upset gamers voiced their concerns on the internet, Square Enix came to save the day, which was the greatest thing to ever happen, as described by one Sleeping Dogs developer. Square Enix allowed the game to get more polish, better publicity via game trailers and commercials, and have shown the game respect, whereas Activision probably would've just let it out into the wild and let it fend for itself. Square Enix has really shown their desire to succeed in the western game market with fantastic titles like Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Sleeping Dogs, and the upcoming Hitman: Absolution and Tomb Raider reboot.Now onto the actual game.Story, Voice Acting, Characters - Sleeping Dogs has a lot of talent, all lending to the story, voice acting, and the cast of characters. In many pre-release trailers and previews, they pointed out Hollywood talent like Emma Stone, but just about everyone here contributes their voice talents to make the story and characters interesting and fully realized. While the story isn't original, it's done so well that originality isn't necessary. This is a game that knows what it wants to be and completely succeeds at it. This is a top notch production from beginning to end.Graphics, Atmosphere - Without a doubt, Sleeping Dogs is my favorite looking game of this kind. To compare, you have Grand Theft Auto IV and the Saints Row games, and I believe Sleeping Dogs is the most impressive looking of the bunch. While the map is smaller and surely allows for more details, it's those details that make the world feel like it's living and breathing, which adds to the overall atmosphere of this beautiful world that is yours to explore and discover all of the little secrets it has packed within it.Driving, Shooting, Melee, Parkour - The core gameplay in Sleeping Dogs offers a lot of variety. The driving is fun and arcade-like, so the handling is simple and intuitive, but it offers depth, like ramming your enemies off of the road or jumping from your car to another car and jacking it. The shooting is basic, so it doesn't offer much depth, but there is a bullet-time feature, a la Max Payne, which makes gun combat really fun, though it must be noted that gun combat is not the focus of the game. Now onto melee, which is the focus of the game, is similar to the combat in Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City, meaning it's a ton of fun and pretty stylish. In addition, you can use context-sensitive environmental attacks, allowing you to shove an enemy's head in a fan, throw him in a dumpster, impale him on swordfish, etc. It's all handled pretty gracefully and flows together nicely. Now onto the parkour, which is a real blast. Your character can climb, jump, leap, etc., so your character has real agility and makes you feel like you can get away from any bad situation or chase after those who are trying to escape you.If you can't already tell, I love Sleeping Dogs. There's some minor draw-in or pop-in when driving at fast speeds, and there may be some tiny little issues like any other game of this scale, but every single thing that's important to the game is spot-on. This is a finely crafted world with a story to keep you interested and the gameplay to keep you having fun. Don't let this dog sleep, get Sleeping Dogs ASAP.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2012"}

In Frozen Throne, also, the voices are of equal quality as in the first Warcraft 3 installment, which is to say, perfect.The game is still quite playable, and introduces a new race and several new units for different races.  Also, the graphics maintain the same high standard of excellence.  And as always, Blizzard has inserted a number of surprises for those enterprising enough to seek them out.  The missions tell more of the story, and further divide the races of the Warcraft World from 5 into an almost innumerable number, in preperation for the World of Warcraft.But it's not the missions I'll be spending the most time on.  It's the world editor.With the addition of new creatures and character models to the Warcraft mix, the world editor it uses to allow gamers to make their own levels has become even MORE all-encompassing and powerful.  Now, it is possible to make virtually any style of game you desire with relitively little effort.  Took me under a month to learn the whole thing, and that's mostly because I had a tough time finding tutorials.In other words, Warcraft 3 is, overall, the RTS game I spend the most time with, and as such, it's probably the best choice if you only buy one.  But if you buy one and an expansion, be sure to get this.  It's worth it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2004"}
{"product_name":"B0009VXAM0","reviewerName":"DB \"aspiring part time free lance consultant\"","summary":"Doomed?","reviewText":"What is happening to the PS3 reminds me a lot of what happened to the original Xbox.  When the original Xbox came out it was the most advanced system but the PS2 had the games.  Many developers didn't even bother to develop games for the original Xbox just because it came out so late in the last gen cycle.  Microsoft realized they would never catch the PS2 despite having the better system.The games are what sell the system.  Microsoft realized this and were determined to get the jump on the next gen even if it only meant a small jump over their own Xbox.  The difference between the PS3 and the PS2 is huge.  The difference between the Xbox 360 and the Xbox is a lot smaller. The PS3 is more advanced than the Xbox 360.Now word comes out that some game developers have pulled out of developing games for the PS3.  Some were supposed to be exclusives.  This coupled with the fact that developing games for the PS3 is harder than developing games for the Xbox 360, which means it costs more to develop games for the PS3, has caused a downward spiral that the PS3 may never recover from.  Blu-Ray seems to have pulled slightly ahead of HD-DVD but this race is also still to early to call and doesn't warrant purchasing a PS3 for that alone, not since the price of some of the Blu-Ray players has come down to less than the PS3.The new price drop of the PS3 came not long after some of the game developers pulled out so Sony understands that the only way to get these game developers back is to put the systems in people's homes.  Is the $100 price drop enough?  I don't think it is even close.  It is still the most expensive core system.  What price is going to put the PS3 in the most homes?  Honestly, I think they have to come under $300 and they better do it fast.  I think Sony is banking on one of the small number of exclusive games, about to come out, to be a system seller.  The under $300 price would also put a lot of Blu-Ray players in homes and would be a big boost for Sony in the Blu-Ray Vs. HD-DVD battle.Sony thought they had a system seller in Resistance:Fall of Man.  They thought it would sell the PS3 like Grand Theft Auto 3 sold the PS2.  Grand Theft Auto 3 was really not like any game that had come before and was a giant leap in gaming.  Resistance is at best, just a good game in an already crowded genre.  I don't know if it is possible to make a new game that virtually creates a new genre any more, but things like that were said before GTA3.I think Sony needs to bite the bullet fast, get the PS3 to under $300 fast, preferably before Christmas, get the systems in homes and get those developers and those exclusives back in development.  Because even if they do drop the price to under $300 it will still take time to get those game developers back and getting new games to the consumer. If Sony waits to long it may be to late. I'm not sure if there will ever be one game anymore that sells a system, what sells a next gen system now is how many games they have. I want the PS3 to succeed.  I own two PS2s and over a hundred games.I previously had recommended the purchase of a PS3 but after the news of some game developers pulling out and a good possibility of more to follow I can no longer recommend the purchase of a PS3, at least not right now.  If the price dropped to under $300, within the next year, I would change my opinion to a recommended buy because the game developers would come back.  There are supposed to be some PS3 exclusives out before Christmas and I also would not be surprised to see another price drop in the next 6 to 8 months.(Felt the need to comment on something that has become quickly apparent after writing my review)It really is sad to see how many 5 star reviews are written by people who only have one review.  When you read a review and see the person has only written the one review you should take their opinion with a grain of salt, they are likely to just be Sony shills.  Sony has used unscrupulous tactics in regards to any negative reviews that involve their system and some of those negative reviews have come from gaming magazines and sites.  My review should not be viewed as negative, I am suggesting a wait and see.(Wanted to add another comment, sorry.) :)One thing I have noticed with the recent consoles is how it appears that we have reached a point where advanced graphics AND games are no longer what is selling a system. And in the past there was a distinct separation in graphics that caused people to move to a new system. Price and the number of games are what sell systems now. When you look at the first 25 years of consoles the advances were predominantly in how the games looked. Now only a few consider graphics as to what system they buy and most don't take the graphics into consideration at all. Its about price, the games and the number of them.There appears to be more of a blurring of generations now. I would suggest that many consumers are still happy with their last gen and have not moved on yet. I continue to play PS2 games.  The PS2 graphics do not detract from my enjoyment even after playing PS3 games. People are still buying PS2 games.  There are still games being made for the PS2. I believe Nintendo realized this and is why the Wii is a relatively minor advance in graphics.  Could we be approaching a time where the consoles now have a shelf life of 10, 15 even 20 years?  I think there is distinct possibility this may happen with the current generation of consoles.This is why it is extremely important that Sony get those game developers back on board fast.  Xbox 360 currently leads in the number of games, but the Xbox 360 is still predominantly for hard core gamers because of the price. The Wii is very affordable and this appeals to the masses. You can expect to see a large jump in the number of games the Wii has to offer in 2008 because of how fast they are putting systems in people's homes. There is a chance that the Wii catches the Xbox 360 in the number of games they have to offer in 2008. Game developers develop games for the systems are in the most homes and that have the chance of selling the most games for them. Ultimately it will come down to which system has the most game developers developing games for them.  This will translate in to which system has the most games people want to play. This is why the PS3 needs a significant price drop that Microsoft would be reluctant to match as long as they have the lead. Microsoft will match relatively small price drops and subsequently keep their lead in the number of games. The PS3 needs to be in the $300/Wii price range and quickly. If Sony drags their feet they will never catch up. The better graphics will not matter.Sony can be stubborn and refuse to accept when they made a mistake.  Betamax anyone?(Edited 3/26/2008)I am now changing my recommendation back to a buy, having previously recommended buying a different version, only to change to a wait and see after the pullout of many developers.I know, this is where you think I'm going to eat crow. There is a nice selection of games available that make the system worth buying.  The long term prospects for the PS3 look good largely in part to Blu-Ray coming out on top.  Whatever kickbacks Sony paid to the movie studios to back the Blu-Ray exclusively it wasn't enough.  I hope the studios are getting a percentage of PS3 sales.

The difficulty in this game comes from the platforming elements and not from the combat. You will die 10 times from falling for every 1 from the hands of an enemy.  The platforming isn't so complicated that you'll have to resort to a guide, but the difficulty comes from the numerous combinations of button presses.

Where my wireless would do weird things like not recognizing clicks until I moved the mouse, and dropping out every once in a while, this wired mouse with increased resolution never does either of those things. It's incredibly responsive, and makes me glad I decided I could \"live with\" having a cord on my mouse.The buttons are handy, and easy to reach. The feel is a little more blocky than I'm used to, but it's still comfortable. The mouse just feels like it's tracking far better than any I've used in a long time-- There's no \"jumpy\" feel to it in lower DPI settings, and less of one in the high setting than on my wireless mouse. It's kind of cool that I can switch DPI on the fly with a button.In games, I noticed my response time was better, especially for circle-strafing and mouse-looking. While I'm not a huge FPS gamer, I did get some better control with this mouse in Team Fortress 2, and I felt a HUGE improvement in the way the mouse felt for Oblivion. Clicking on small icons and buttons on the in-game GUI isn't as tedious with the Sidewinder X5.I use it in both OS X and Windows XP. Despite what the package says, the mouse does, indeed, come with drivers and control panels for OS X (not that OS X needs drivers, but the control panels are handy to assign buttons).There's one button that I find sort of stupid and useless on this mouse. It's near the back (under your palm, when the mouse is being used) and its purpose varies depending on what OS you're using. It's not reassignable, either. It does what it does, and that is all. In Windows XP, all it does is launch the Intellimouse software; That's the mouse control panel, which you can normally reach two other ways (click the desktop/Start menu icon, or go to Control Panel). That's all it does. I hardly see why a button was needed for this function. In OS X, the button just pops your pointer up to the top left corner of the screen, and again, you can't reassign this button. It's just sort of a waste of moving parts, if you ask me.However, stupid button aside, I dig this mouse. I think I may stick with it, despite losing wireless freedom compared to my old mouse. This mouse just works better!Oh, I should mention that this mouse has two red lights on the bottom, near the back, and one on top. They remain on as long as your computer is sending power to the mouse, and this might be annoying for some people who don't want their mouse to be all lit up. It doesn't bother me much, but it is curious that Microsoft would put bright red lights on the mouse when the laser tracking emits light that is invisible to the human eye. These lights aren't part of the tracking hardware: They're just decoration. I guess it's supposed to look cool or something. I just think it's sort of a waste of power.A good mouse, but not for the office or conservative desktop. Definitely a step up for gamers, though.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2008"}

Whereas the Ishimura just gave the feeling of a functional ship, the environments in 2 feel like the sum of their parts. The sense of loss and the confusion of &#8220;what the heck happened here?&#8221; like Bioshock is present in Dead Space 2.Games like this can easily fall into a clich&eacute; story, but Dead Space 2 does a nice job of being more original than falling into the same story arcs of other horror stories. Nothing is too overplayed: music, enemies popping out of nowhere, etc. This one is much very linear. Might&#8217;ve been moreso than the original.Another negative is that as the game progresses, you&#8217;ll figure out what enemies and how many will be coming based on the room layout and size. There&#8217;s also the occasional problem with the story where it&#8217;s the usual &#8220;Oh man! Item A broke down, I&#8217;ll go fix Item B, so we can progress.&#8221; It is not as noticeable as other games, but it gets tiresome in the later chapters. Despite the linearity, the pace is differentiated by varying elements. You&#8217;ll have the usual flying in zero gravity as well as feet on the ground sequences. The game is not too long and not too short.Like the original, it is completely up to you how you make your way through. This is welcomed freedom. You can upgrade any weapon, or not even use a weapon at all. In fact, the gameplay is basically a carbon copy of the first. Whereas in other games I&#8217;d find this a significant issue, I did not mind. I'd give it 4.5 stars, but rounded up to a 5.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

Melee, Super Monkey Ball, and more. Sounds like a long, varied list of interesting games, and it is, by and large. But look beyond the first-tier lineup, and Nintendo's software schedule begins to look somewhat bleak. That's the Gamecube's biggest weakness. If you don't buy more than five games a year, then you might be satisfied with the lineup that's available, but if you're always hungry for something new, the Gamecube's probably not for you.While the system is stripped down to a certain degree - it only plays games - what it does, it does reasonably well. The graphics are sharp, the first party titles are uniformly excellent, and the flexibility of four controller ports, and a slew of party games make the Gamecube *the* multiplayer game box to own, if you've got friends over for games.However, having played every console out there, the biggest hardware problem for me is the Gamecube's controller. With an unconventional button layout, and missing some features from the competitor's controllers, the unique Gamecube controller makes games that aren't native to the GC somewhat difficult to control. Because the GC has the fewest number of buttons, and no analog stick \"click\" functionality, games that maximize the use of the PS2 and xbox controllers never survive the porting process intact. The size of the controller itself can also be problematic. I don't have huge hands, but after an hour or two, the size of the GC's controller makes for an uncomfortable gaming experience. it's a shame, too, because the analog stick is the best analog stick available.The Gamecube, as a *primary* console, isn't a bad bet. It has some really stellar first party titles, and a reasonably varied list of third party titles to fill the void. But, if you're looking for a constant influx of new content, you'll find more varied libraries on the PS2 or xbox, and the Gamecube's online experience is a pale shadow of the excellent Live service, on the xbox.As a secondary console, just know what you're getting into. Virtually every port will be better on another console, due to the superior graphics of the xbox, or the more flexible controller Sony offers. You'll need a GC to experience a masterpiece like Metroid Prime, and as long as you know that the Nintendo first party titles are relatively few and far between, it'll give you an excellent gaming experience.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2003"}
{"product_name":"B000QW9D14","reviewerName":"blackaciddevil","summary":"Blue Dragon.....may be old school but, boy, is it fun!!!!","reviewText":"Given the fact that the majority of online reviews at certain gaming sites weren't too favorable for Blue Dragon; I, myself, really enjoyed it. The game itself is a traditional turn-based roleplaying game that lasts over 3 DVDs. That's well over 60 hours of gameplay and, considering turn-based RPGs are starting to be a thing of the past, I couldn't have been more happier. The thing people will notice most about the game is the fact it was created by Hironobu Sakaguchi, Akira Toriyama & Nobuo Uematsu...the Dream Team that created Chrono Trigger.It tells the story of a young boy named Shu and his friends whos' town is ravaged by a land shark. That begins the tale that sends him and his friends on their journey to stop a great evil.The game itself looks quite stunning on the Xbox 360 and, as I've said before in another of my reviews, is a reason I bought the system. Yet, it is the gameplay that takes center stage in this game. These heroes possess the power to control phantoms that mirror the actions of their masters, giving Shu and his friends miraculous strength and magical powers.If you're into long turn-based RPGs, you won't go wrong with Blue Dragon. True, it might not win any awards for originality & whatnot but it's a fantastic game that I really enjoyed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000QW9D14","reviewerName":"fallowstarz","summary":"A poo-blackened, shining example of \"childish\" done wrong.","reviewText":"\"Nene tries to use his power to make others do whatever he wants them to. People like that are no good!\" exclaims some character at some point of this story. It's hard to tell which character, because any of them could have said that. Instead of differentiating the characters subtly, Sakaguchi and Toriyama have designed a game with characters whose personalities are differentiated according to nothing but personal quirks: Shu and Maro are overzealous, Zola is sultry, etc. Blue Dragon has somehow managed to achieve a T rating while employing a form of storytelling that would insult the intelligence of players far below the recommended age range for the game. It is often said that in order to appreciate Blue Dragon, one must be familiar with \"old-school\" JRPGs. I am, but that doesn't make the story or characters any more interesting.In terms of gameplay conventions, Blue Dragon is anything but old-school, and that is one of the game's huge pluses. Enemies can be avoided on the field screen, your party can fight multi-round battles by challenging several enemies simultaneously, and items are mostly scavenged for rather than being irrationally dropped by defeated monsters. All of the characters can use all of the abilities in battle, once trained properly, and there are several action sequences mixed into the gameplay. None of these elements suggest that Blue Dragon's design is anything other than hyper-modern, and the \"old school\" pretense seems to be nothing other than an excuse for consistently employing sloppy, dull narrative.Blue Dragon is quite fun to play. The graphics are consistently excellent, and although there is no noticeable slowdown per se, the entire game seems to run about 20% slower than it would if the motions depicted in the animations were animated fluidly. This seems to suggest that the developers decided to slow down the entire game, to keep the slowdown created by technically-demanding areas from becoming noticeable. The fun gameplay of Blue Dragon would be all the more enjoyable if everything was sped up by 20%, with a proportionate framerate increase, rather than frame-skipping, to preserve the fluidity of the motions. The XBox 360 was clearly designed to be able to polygon-push more than fast enough to achieve this.Nobuo Uematsu's score for this game is surprisingly good, and the piano track played at ruined Talta Village, for example, exceeds the quality of most of his work for the Final Fantasy series. I don't care much for the musica machina motif that runs throughout this game's score, but it is appropriate for the large number of metal complexes and robot fight scenes. It's hard to recommend a game like this entirely for its soundtrack, when it's so easy to get the music seperately, and when during the play of the game, 10% of the music fills up 90% of the playtime. The vocal tracks are great, especially the epic final battle theme, which subtly pays homage to a similar track from Final Fantasy VII.This is basically the best-looking JRPG ever, by virtue of the fact that it's the first large-budget JRPG to appear on a current-gen console. But even this honor can seem underwhelming at times, since the degree of graphical improvement this game offers over some of the better-looking PS2 RPGs is nowhere near the degree of graphical improvement historically offered several times by Squaresoft, whenever it bested its previously most graphically-advanced JRPG. The art design for some of Blue Dragon's locations, such as Pachess Town and Wither Village, is incredibly beautiful, while the remainder of the locations appear to be heavily copied and pasted together.I would give this game 2.5 stars really, but I've rounded up to 3, because of Uematsu's great musical contribution. For an example of a good video game featuring blatantly childish design, check out Lunar: Silver Star Story. That game comes from the Blue Dragon school of design, but adds a lot of flavor to the formula, and would certainly be remake-worthy on a current-gen console.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2007"}

I have played many consoles and i feel this controller is the best one that fits perfect in my hand. When the Ps3 came out the system came with a controller that wasn't dualshock 3. The First controller was so light but no rumble. When the Dualshock 3 was released I had to buy it quick. Since right now the controller still alive and playing well. the grips on the analog sticks do get warn out after years of using. buttons work fine and no problem not like my two non-dualshock controllers some of them buttons don't work no more. With a controller that has last me this long is a product that would last long. The controller does have couple of negative things about it but they are not too big. The left analog stick is slightly out of place. For example, When I play Battlefield 3 and using the heavy machine gun and need to use the bipod it wont work. i have to slight move the analog down to use it. its not a big problem that i had with other games only battlefield 3. The second negative I have with his controller is the L2 and R3 buttons sometimes I will be playing a game and I put down my controller down and it accidently press the L2 or R2 buttons. Its not a big deal but when playing online and you put down controller down it and it press the r2 button and throws a grenade. Overall this controller is really good and last me since they first dualshock controllers for the PS3 came out. Soon Ill be buying a new once since I need a second controller and I know I will be doing a great buy when I do.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2012"}

Cloaked in stealth, you will move unseen through crowds, travel stories above the peasant herds on which you feed--leaping from rooftop to rooftop--and use mind control to overcome vampire-proof inventions. The combat choreography unfolds with dancelike precision as Kain engages armies of demons and humans alike. The comprehensive menu of unstoppable attacks, nimble combos, and special moves are designed to appeal to even the most jaded of fighting-game fans. The world that Kain moves through is a lushly detailed gothic environment that is not only gorgeous to the eye, but also alive with the soon-to-be-dead. The AI behavioral response makes peasants and enemies variously flee, take up arms, or remain unaware as Kain moves through crowds or charges, sword raised, into open areas.","reviewerName":"maninblue \"maninblue\"","summary":"Could have been so much better","reviewText":"This game was simply a waste of potential.  I am glad I rented this game first,because after completion, I had no further desire to play it again. This game portrays the vampire sub-culture in a very cool way.  The story was entertaining, but the voice acting is where the game really shines.  I sometimes want to play the game again just because of the great dialog.  UInfortunately the gameplay is terrible.  You fight with the same couple moves EACH time you get into a battle.  Punch, punch, grab, throw. Unless you have a weapon then expect chop, chop, big chop.  The only thing that adds diversity in the monotonous fighting is the few vampire ablilities you can use.  Even then, its still going to be the same silly fight after you use one of your abilities. They would be better off making a really intriging movie from this series, because the game itself offers nothing but linear gameplay and tedious fighting, puntuated with wonderful dialog and great voice acting.

{"product_name":"B0050SXFKE","description":"","reviewerName":"Chris Chapa","summary":"Almost perfect!","reviewText":"Like most of you, I was there since the beginning, when Desmond first hooked up to the Animus and looked through the life of his ancestor, Altair. While I may not have experienced the downloadable/portable titles that filled the empty gaps, I have been right there with the titles to the main cannon of the story. To put these main games into a list of least to most favorite would have me contemplating like Dante at the gates of Hell for a very long time. That being said, I have to be completely honest and say that while I immediately LOVED Assassin's Creed III (and still do!), it doesn't quite pull off the awesomeness I was expecting.First the pro's: the story is an excellently told piece of 'alternate history' which is a characteristic that the creaters have done so well since the franchises inception. The graphics are beautiful and highly detailed with smooth animations, which is made far more impressive by the sheer SIZE of the games realm(?). Being only 30% through the game, I am confident in saying that I have already covered more ground and seen more sights than I ever did in Constantinople and Rome combined, and that's not counting the vast Frontier you are able to explore for among other things - HUNTING, which is a very fine addition to gameplay. And while I wont go to into detail about it, the Naval Warfare is great!My con's are a combination of game glitches, inconsistencies, and less desirable control set ups/changes. Some of these may be fixed with a later software patch, but out of the box, here is what I found:While character movement has become smoother and more natural looking, there is still (and increased, it seems) an issue with getting hung up walls or fences when you do not intend to. There should have been a function/button combination made along time ago that would allow you to simply run at ground level, without having to accidentally climb everything that was near you. This is quite annoying when you are giving chase to a very speedy target, and you get hung up jumping back and forth from one fence to another instead of simply hopping back down.There is a much missed absence of the Wrist Shot hidden weapon, replaced by era specific firearms and a bow and arrow. While authenticity is important, the guns are painfully slow to reload and the targeting mechanic is extremely restricted; not allowing you even draw your weapon unless you have a target highlighted in your reticule.User controlled camera movement is slower and inexplicably limited at some times. For instance, at one point I was high on a scaffold and wanted to aim the camera in a more overhead position and could not move the camera up or down at all, yet if I jumped to another ledge, I could.There seems to be some sort of glitch where if you are using your bare hands, you cannot initiate a fistfight...at all. I was required to \"beat up\" a target, and I repeatedly failed because the only thing my character would do was kill him with a neck break or choke hold.Riding a horse anywhere off a trail or road is guaranteed to get hung up on anything and everything. Took my horse down an alleyway in the city, and found myself (and my horse) stuck on a an exposed wall of an adjacent, burnt down building, twitching and glitching and unable to move until I dismounted the horse, killed it, and called another. Same thing happens in the woods when you get near any cliffs. Fast travel or on foot is quicker.The weapon wheel as been cut in half and given, what I feel, an unnecessary change in mechanics. Being able to access only four different items at a time feels unnatural, now having to open the wheel constantly before and during a large battle or fight to swap out a horse whistle (really?) for smoke bombs.While not a gameplay affecting issue, this was a little bothersome: You are still able to purchase different colored robes for Connor. However, when there is a cutscene (not a cinematic), his robes return their original colors.  Again, it does not effect any gameplay, but it seems that they sacrificed a little bit of their quality this time.It's a lot easier to write about the bad than it is the good, but I want it known that I still love the hell out of this game and consider it a wonderful \"supposed\" sequel to the long, exciting life of Desmond Miles and his ancestors. Replay value will be extremely high and enjoyable. Any other additions and finer points that I might have missed, you undoubtedly already read about in gaming magazines, online sites, or seen in videos or trailers. I still encourage this game to be experienced and I'm confident that it will win MANY well deserved awards.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"UziHorowitz","summary":"Xbox One's a top notch gaming console and entertainment device all in one","reviewText":"Xbox One was initially announced and revealed this past June and received a lot of heat for its DRM policy that would've hurt used game sales. I was one of those people who wasn't fond of such an idea. Even though I buy mostly new games, I didn't like that the disc was pretty much a coaster after you installed it, as I'm the kind of gamer that likes to have a collection of physical games and not have everything online-only. So I wasn't going to buy an Xbox One.Fast forward to them announcing that they were doing away with the awful DRM stuff and I was sold. I then pre-ordered one along with a PS4. While I was turned off by their original plans for the console, they heard the complaints and did the right thing, even if it was a tough pill for Microsoft to swallow.So now what we have is a game console like any other. Whether it's a new or used game, it'll work, and this is the way it should remain for any future game consoles. As we saw with the PSP Go, the digital-only model doesn't work for this industry unless we're talking Steam.Onto the console, the Xbox One is a large device and pretty weighty, but it has a very reliable feel to it. The Blu-ray drive is quiet and takes the disc smoothly, you can hardly hear the fans, and the whole thing is generally whisper quiet. In addition, the user interface is smooth and works very intuitively with the new Kinect.And let's not forget the Xbox One controller which feels like a durable and well-made piece of hardware including an improved d-pad and ergonomics from the Xbox 360 controller.As for games, Xbox One has a great launch library.A quick rundown of some of the games I've played:Dead Rising 3 - Large sandbox game, tons of zombies, tons of weapons and vehicles to combine and modify, lots of side quests and leveling up, etc. Nice graphics for a sandbox game this large.Ryse - Very underrated. Not sure what's with the low reviews, to be honest. It's a bit repetitive, I do agree, but the graphics are the best I've seen and the combat is excellent. It also has a nice story.Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag - This version looks a lot better than the last gen version. Open world game with nice lighting and weather effects.Killer Instinct - Buttery smooth net code, good roster of characters, nice fighting mechanics. This game will continue to get new content throughout 2014.Crimson Dragon - Classic on-rails game in the vein of Panzer Dragoon. Another underrated game.Forza Motorsport 5 - Great graphics, nice tracks, good physics, etc. Lots of content to be had.Xbox One is a great console with great games. And to make it even better, 2014 is shaping up to be a great year for exclusives.Here are some 2014 exclusives:Quantum BreakTitanfall (also on PC but exclusive to Xbox One on consoles)Sunset OverdriveD4Kinect Sports RivalsHalo 5Fable Legends","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00020LZAM","description":"Jak 3concludes the Jak and Daxter trilogy with a truly plot-driven adventure game filled with friendship, betrayal, death, and a long-awaited understanding of the Precursor civilization that has, until now, remained a mystery.One year has passed since Jak and Daxter saved Haven City from Kor and the attacking Metal Heads, yet Haven City is still immersed in deadly chaos as three groups fight for control of the streets. The people of Haven City have grown to distrust Jak's dark powers, and as rumors boil of Jak's ties with Krew and Kor, the city blames Jak for its current woeful circumstances. When the palace is destroyed by a surprise Metal Head attack, even Ashelin cannot protect Jak as the High Council's power broker, Count Veger, forces Jak into banishment to the desolate Wasteland. Jak is flown to the harsh island and dumped. With Daxter and Pecker bravely by his side, the three begin their next adventure where the battle for the city has just begun.Five times the size of Haven City, the Wasteland is a desert environment with multiple areas including mines and a volcano. Given the enormity and variance in terrain, vehicles play a large role as off-road transportation is introduced, fueled by a true-to-life physics engine. With a rugged new look and suited with armor, Jak is also equipped with an arsenal of new weapons with upgradeable mods that enable players to increase their firepower and enjoy the freedom to strategize and activate their arsenal at any time.As Jak has been exposed to Light Eco, players can now experience Jak's magnificent transformation to Light Jak. With a glowing electric blue aura and a massive wing span, Light Jak introduces new move sets, including the ability to glide great distances, emit an energy to block enemy attack, and power up at anytime, all of which provide the player with a sense of being invincible. Dark Jak also returns with more capabilities, forcing Jak to find a balance between light and dark.Additionally, game developer Naughty Dog continues to push the genre forward with the introduction of new technology. For the first time in the franchise, enemies feature realistic ragdoll physics, which will allow gamers to witness a unique death for each enemy that is killed. Naughty Dog has also implemented independent cloth movement technology and enhanced the enemy artificial intelligence (AI) with wall climbing and smart formation capabilities.","reviewerName":"Vin Bruce \"7line\"","summary":"Best of the 3","reviewText":"Jack 1 was fun.

{"product_name":"B0050SXEM8","description":"","reviewerName":"Midway 47","summary":"Different but good","reviewText":"I was skeptical about buying this game because I had read some early reviews and I could tell from the demo that it didn't have some of the 'magic' that the 40th Day had.  The 40th Day is one of my favorite third-person shooters so I had high expectations for the Devil's Cartel, maybe too high.  After finding it at a bargain price, I went ahead and took the plunge.  Overall, the 40th Day, by far, remains my favorite of the series but the Devil's Cartel was better than I thought it would be from reading those bad reviews.  I had played through the first game quickly and just as quickly sold it but this one is a keeper.  The shooting and controls (except the overbearing cover system) are managed well and the armory has lots of options.  I didn't like hearing that Salem and Rios weren't the main characters but they're still in the game and fit into the story well enough for me to have no major complaints.  Although I think Alpha and Bravo are stupid and generic names, the characters aren't as disappointing.  I actually enjoyed playing them as much as Salem and Rios.  My only major complaint is the cover system.  I just don't like being forced to use it so much but I guess some people do.  I have the same complaint about the Uncharted games.  Popping in and out of cover shouldn't be such a hassle all the time.  So, I guess if you were expecting the 41st Day, this isn't it, but it's still a good addition to the series and I hope to see it continue on the PS4.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2014"}

Terrorists operate openly, killing thousands; drugs, disease, and pollution kill even more. The world's economics are close to collapse, and the gap between the insanely wealthy and the desperately poor has grown to the size of the Grand Canyon. Worst of all, an ages-old conspiracy bent on world domination has decided that the time is right to emerge from the shadows and take control. No one believes the conspiracy exists--no one but you.In this thrilling role-playing adventure, you play the part of J.C. Denton, a powerful, nanotechnologically augmented antiterrorist agent. It's up to you to stop the conspirators from achieving their goals. But this world is full of lies and betrayal, a world where nothing is as it seems and entire nations can seemingly be turned against you at the push of a button. To succeed, you must travel the globe in a quest for knowledge, develop your character's nanotech augmentations and strengths as you see fit, build a network of allies to assist you, and determine when stealth and strategy are more important than action. And each time you think you've got the mystery solved, the game figured out, there's another, deeper mystery to be unraveled.

This games gets everything right but the actual gameplay. The cutscenes, graphics, show history, and humor are top-notch. But the camera and movements can make the most simple movement or objective a nightmarish chore. The only reason I stuck the game out was because I love the show and wanted to see it through. I laughed alot and was more amused by just exploring and interacting with the colorful Springfield recreations.I never got the feeling of any actual flowing type of gameplay, like in other platformers like Ratchet and Mario; Every level had at least one part in it that was made unpleasant by controls alone. Nothing feels 2nd nature here; Every inch can be labored to get just that right jumping angle.  If games from 3 years ago can do this thing right, EA has no excuse to 'overlook' this type of thing.I generally don't complain alot about games, but I can't help but have an issue when everything else is so perfect, and the controls just take away alot of the potential fun.Play at your own risk.

Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Fallout 3 (the New Vegas extension?)","reviewText":"I am going to say this upfront. My initial plan was to wait until New Vegas' GOTY edition became available and then buy a used copy. Not because I didn't enjoy playing Fallout 3 - I did - but because I expected for other games to keep me occupied for the next couple of months. Sadly, the Two Worlds 2 - a promising RPG - release got postponed to \"early 2011\", GT5 followed suit with their own delay, ArcaniA (Gothic 4) too won't be available on the PS3 until March next year and, based on the PC version reviews I've seen, it may not be a worthy one so... New Vegas was the only decent new RPG actually available for purchase these days. So, here's my review, following my first 20 hours of play.THE STORY LINEI am not too far in the game at the time I'm writing this and revealing the plot wouldn't be a good thing to do anyway. But, it's probably safe to say that at least the main plot line is 'you' waking up in a doctor office after being shot in the head and then trying to understand 'why' it happened and 'who' did it or had it done to you and possibly bringing some well-deserved justice to the perpetrators - sounds familiar? It probably does. The stage is the same Fallout 3-like, post-apocalyptic world, only you wake up in a desert town not far from New Vegas and you need to find your way and your place in this world while making sure that you are eaten up or poisoned to death by the local fauna or robbed and dismembered by any of the roving gangs. Oh and, there's Vegas or New Vegas rather so... gambling anyone?GAMEPLAYNew Vegas is a strictly one-player, off-line experience. It's just you and your game-issued companions (no more than one human and one non-human at any given time) versus 'the world'.You can peacefully interact with humans and robots by picking one of the several pre-written lines while they talk back to you via spoken words (subtitles available at the bottom of the screen). When you fight you can do it either in real time or through the V.A.T.S system that stops the time and lets you pick which body parts of which enemy you are going to try to hit. The view is either 'first person', suitable when traveling fighting with long range weapons or 'third person' which I personally prefer when doing real-time melees.The games consists in a series of quests that usually involve finding someone or something and then perform some action: retrieve an item or information, fight or perhaps make an alliance. At any time you can abandon your quest and pick up a new one if available or you can simply roam the land and do things that would help you uplevel and therefore improve your skills. Killing people or non-humans, discovering new locations, unlocking safes or terminals or persuading others to do things for you would grant you experience points. Once a certain threshold is reached you move up another level and have the ability to assign 'points' to your various skills and pick one of the available 'perks'.As I mentioned before, doing 'bad' things to other people, like launching unprovoked attacks or stealing will damage your general reputation (karma) and also the way you are viewed by the faction whose member you victimized. Of course, if you go for the platinum trophy, you will have to do quite a bit of pick pocketing and other unethical things.And, speaking of trophies, the game can be played at several levels of difficulty, ranging from 'very easy' to 'very hard' and than there is the 'hardcore mode' which is hellishly hard. And you can only win the platinum if you play the game in 'hardcore' mode from the beginning until the end. If you are not after the platinum, you can switch difficulty levels at any time during gameplay.BUGS AND OTHER SHORTCOMINGSI haven't encountered A LOT OF 'serious' bugs but I did get myself stabbed while inside an abandoned bus by someone outside the bus and was able to slash the aggressor back and I did enjoy killing Geckos who, while trying to run away from me ran into a boulder and instead of going around it put themselves into a loop, trying to go through it. And the side of a Death Claw flying high... priceless.More serious, on a couple of my level-ups I was not given the opportunity to pick a new Perk. I'm not sure if this was part of the game design or it's in fact a bug. One more - and this is an update - my PS3 just froze in a very bad way for no apparent reason other than there being 7 or 8 live enemies on the screen. The crash was so bad, the PS3 button would not get me out of the game and I had to turn off the PS3 from the 'power' button. I found the PS3 to be a VERY STABLE platform that very rarely crashes. If I think of it, the last time it crashed it might have been while playing Fallout 3. This is not good.Finally, in the 'shortcomings' or serious disappointments category, not unlike its predecessor, the game tends to slow down a lot whenever there is any significant activity on the screen like... several character moving at the same time. I wish the developers took a little time to fix whatever it is that makes Bethesda PS3 games such as Oblivion, Fallout 3 and this New Vegas crawl while similarly complex games by other developers are zipping along.FALLOUT 3 vs. NEW VEGASI expected Fallout: New Vegas to be not unlike Fallout 3. However, I was surprised to see how nearly-identical to Fallout 3 this game is. Even considering the few minor improvements and additions, New Vegas could be easily confused with a Fallout 3 DLC, only a larger than usual one. New Vegas plays inside a square map that, we are told, is comparable in size with that of Fallout 3 and not larger. V.A.T.S., S.P.E.C.I.A.L., the Pip-Boy 3000, the leveling system (new Perks), the way you interact with the environment, the trash you find littered all over the place, even some of the creatures (DeathClaws, Bloatflies), the Vaults, the dirty water, the color of the desert landscape, they should all appear strangely familiar to those who've played Fallout 3 in the past.I am happy to note quite a few most welcome improvements. Game saves and loading delays are a lot shorter than in Fallout 3, making for a more immersive experience. While only 720p, the image quality appears to be improved. Human characters faces look more human in New Vegas and the lip-syncing is better. While not exactly 'bug free', this release appears to have fewer bugs than its predecessor.There are, of course, some totally new features in New Vegas. From what I read pre-release, I expected a lot more color but at least the sky is blue, most of the time. Gambling is added, including the very complicated game of Caravan (still learning it), there is some primitive potion-making capability, you get weapon mods and the ability to tinker with your ammo, there is a new interface to interact with your human and non-human companions and, of course, New Vegas comes with the much publicized local reputation - the way certain communities and factions view you based on your past interaction with them. For healing, the SuperStimpacks and the rare Doctor Bags are added.MY SCORENew Vegas is in some ways an improvement over Fallout 3 which is good but it it doesn't show a lot of innovation which is a disappointment. While some bugs and shortcomings have been addressed (load/save times) others have not. The New Vegas' story and location may be original but the tools the game makers used to tell the story have only changed a little and, in my view, not enough. I may agree that New Vegas is a 'new game' rather than a Fallout 3 expansion but only barely so.I will grant New Vegas 3 stars (means \"It's Okay\"). As I advance deeper into the game my views may change.____________________________________________NOTE 1:It's probably fair to note that I've bought the Collector's Edition. The game is in no way different - I even got the Tribal Pack extension - but it comes with a great graphic novel (hard cover), playing cards, poker chips, the big platinum chip that got you killed in the first place and a 'the making of...' DVD.NOTE 2:Some 35 hours into the game, 2 big crashes later and the 'wow' factor still missing, the temptation is strong to take off another star but, since I am still playing it, the fair thing should be to leave the 3 stars on. Three stars mean \"It's okay\" and that's how I feel about New Vegas at this time.NOTE 3:45 hours and the load/save times are getting longer, 3 more crashes. Downgraded to 2 stars.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00012BSJ4","description":"When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing:Metroid. Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better.

It's been a few years since I played the original, but the impression it left on me was largely a good one, particularly on the graphics and audio fronts. I don't remember it as being an overly difficult game to pick up and learn, and although it wasn't the lengthiest adventure in the world, I'd often find myself slowing my momentum mid-stride so I could breathe in the atmosphere and enjoy my surroundings. It was such a gorgeous melting pot of cultures, one couldn't help but appreciate it in that respect alone.The story of this sequel isn't all that remarkable, but honestly neither was that of the first game. You play as one of the three founding members of the GGs, one of half a dozen rollerblade-adorned street gangs fighting for territorial rights to the whole of Tokyo. The ultimate goal is to fill the streets with your crew's graffiti, slowly assimilating members of the other gangs along the way, until the entire underground knows and respects your crew. It's more than a little reminiscent of the original, where the locations were different but the eventual goal was exactly the same. The two storylines are almost dreamily interconnected, with several returning characters, none of whom seem to have any recollection of the events of the first game or their relationship with the others. One character whose role is bulked up this time around is DJ Professor K, the voice of \"Jet Set Radio,\" an underground pirate radio station which provided the tunes and the news updates in the Dreamcast edition, but never really took much of a role in the actual goings on. In JSRF, the professor moves from a supporting role to something a little more proactive. His broadcasts are much more pointedly directed to the GGs, and are your only real indication of where you should be and what you should be doing at any given time.While neither game in the series has much in the way of an epic storyline, at the very least the actual gameplay experience of the first was enough to keep me coming back for more. No matter how much of the game you'd completed, it was always a blast to play. I wish I could say the same for the sequel, but it seems to have grown both too simple and too complicated for its own good. Something as basic as grinding a rail, for instance, was never much of a problem in the first game. You jumped in the air, and if you happened to be within spitting distance of a grindable object when you landed, your character was automatically bumped over to it and began grinding along. It was simple, yet effective and didn't cause too many headaches at the time. For the sequel, however, the programmers have really bumped up the number of rails in any given map, which makes actually navigating from point A to point B much more of a nightmare. I can't even begin to count the number of times I'd be trying to reach a difficult spot on the map, would jump away from the rail in an attempt to land on said spot, would visibly land on the spot I was aiming for, and would watch my character automatically clamp onto the rail again and sail away into the abyss. After about fifteen minutes, I was screaming for the simple, one button grind functionality that was done to perfection in the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series, which is funny because it was precisely this kind of problem that led Neversoft to introduce the ability to actually climb off your board and roam freely around the map. JSRF's grinding system is far too simple and mistake-prone for its own good.I think my main problem with the control system is twofold. For one, far too many elements are automated, to the point that I never felt like I was fully in control of my character. Secondly, I felt like JSRF far too accurately represents the physical act of skating, and all of its downfalls and limitations. It's one thing to simulate the sense of speed, balance and adrenaline that I'm sure a great rollerblade pro feels every time he's on wheels, but it's something else entirely to handicap your gamers just for the sake of simulation. If you'll pardon the repeated comparisons, this is a translation that I felt the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series had absolutely nailed down. All of the sensations of actually riding a skateboard are there; speed, control, balance, restraint... but very few of the really bothersome limitations made the leap. When you order your rider to stop moving on an incline, it's understood that you don't want him to move again on his own. JSRF sends you slowly sliding down the hill. There's no such thing as a nuance of control in this game, at least as far as the basic commands are concerned. Jumping, grinding, standing still, moving forward, whatever... they all feel over-analyzed and needlessly nitpicked. Where's the fun in moving at incredible speeds if your character steers like a boat in mud?Now, with all that said, I'm actually a fan of a few aspects of the control scheme and the newly introduced gameplay mechanics. One of the more imaginative additions is the combo system, which works like a sort of hybrid action / sports / music game. You've got the fast pace and loose grip on reality of an action game (like the sky-high jumps in Tony Hawk, there's no way some of Jet Set's tricks are physically possible), the balance and strategy of a good sports game (planning where you'll jump after the rail ends, in the hopes of continuing your combo) and the timing and universal coordination of a great music game (you've got to time your manual tricks while grinding or grabbing air so that they land precisely along with the beat). Fully realized, it's a truly inspiring little addition, although it's such a small part of the big picture that it's likely to go completely overlooked in most people's books.As I'd alluded to earlier, the two areas that needed the least attention were the visuals and the audio, both of which were true shining points of the original, almost single-handedly responsible for its high profile and its accompanying success. On that front, not much has changed. This is still a visually sensational game, and although many of the environments and non-central characters seem blocky and undeveloped for the Xbox platform, the incredible strength of the character designs and art direction make up for it and then some. This is one of the most complete games I've ever seen, graphically. Everything a player could possibly get onto their screen is brilliantly detailed, with dozens of little surprises tucked away to keep the game interesting.The audio is, on the large, a huge success. The tracks are entirely fresh, without a single tune I've ever heard on the radio, and almost exclusively excellent. Occasionally you'll stumble across a song that sticks out like a sore thumb, (one song in particular maddened me to no end... almost start-to-finish middle aged screaming Japanese woman) and that's a problem that the first game certainly didn't have, but such tracks aren't very frequent. I'd have preferred to have a functionality similar to that in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, (to continue the endless comparisons) which allowed gamers to single out tracks they didn't like and eliminate them from the active rotation, but a couple bad songs are really a small price to pay considering the quality of the rest of the soundtrack.Visual and musical choices aside, I was really let down by this game. Sega had such a firm foundation upon which to build an absolutely dynamite sequel, success seemed like a foregone conclusion... but where there's a will, I suppose, there's a way. And, much as it pains me to admit it, Sega's M.O. this generation seems to have been creating software that really isn't up to their old standards. While it's a blast to watch, Jet Set Radio Future just isn't that much fun to play most of the time, thanks to an incredibly shallow, inattentive, under-tested control scheme. The characters are difficult to identify with, since most of their brain waves appear to be flatlined, and the story is difficult to follow and non-motivating. Even if a game looks beautiful and sounds breathtaking, nobody's going to bother with it if the gameplay and controls aren't there. And that's just the case with JSRF.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2006"}
{"product_name":"B0002BJQDY","description":"Guild Warstakes the best elements of today's massively multiplayer online games and combines them with a new mission-based design that eliminates the tedium of those games. You can meet new friends in towns or outposts, form a party, and then go tackle a quest together. Your party always has its own unique copy of the quest map, so camping, kill-stealing, and long lines to complete quests are all things of the past. Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder.You don't have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don't have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you've previously unlocked. You'll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn't allow bad decisions to ruin a character. And you'll never meet new players only to discover that you can't play with them or compete against them because their characters are on a different server than yours; in Guild Wars, all characters live in one seamless world.Built for CompetitionAfter learning the game and building up your first character, you may choose to test your skills in head-to-head competition or guild warfare. The game is designed to reward player skill and teamwork, not time spent playing, so you won't need to spend hundreds of hours leveling up your character to compete.The game includes integrated support for guilds, with guild banners and halls, chat rooms and forums. Guilds can challenge other guilds to battle, compete for control of key parts of the world, and be ranked on a worldwide ladder.Unique Streaming TechnologyArenaNet's unique streaming technology forever eliminates the concept of patching a game. You don't have to wait a month for the next big patch to experience new content. Instead, the game constantly and intelligently streams new content to your computer in the background while you play. The world can change continually. This allows us to build a much more dynamic game world than any that has existed before.","reviewerName":"Jeff Travis \"Stormfury\"","summary":"Great new ideas in a MMORPG environment.","reviewText":"Guild wars isn't exactly a MMORPG but that's ok.  In an original idea, the developers took the common 'chat' rooms that people used to use to find adventuring parties in games like Diablo or Starcraft and turned them into Cities where people can trade, chat and acquire quests.  A new and interesting way of connecting with players around the world.While it appears to be a MMORPG, this is where it stops.  Once you and your team enter the game world, you share an instance of the game world and are free to traverse the country side and complete mission uninhabited by other players, PVPers or any of the potential negatives of the traditional MMORPG.  Gone are the days of walking through the secluded out of the way location only to see 5 players run by.  This is a very nice touch.Ironically, my biggest complaint with Guild Wars would be the multiplayer aspect.  In single player, or joint missions with friends the game runs well and you're free to do any skill sets you choose.  A very fun and nice touch, however in PVP it's nearly impossible to get into a team unless you have specific skills which forces teams and classes to feel very commonplace.  I would have liked to seen more flexibility and competition using a variety of skills instead of a few 5-6 per class.  The ability to find new skills and change them out between missions is very nice and it allows you to change the entire makeup of your character to suit given quests.  Another unique and enjoyable idea added in by NCSoft.All in all this was a very fun game that I enjoyed playing for several months and the fact that it doesn't have a monthly fee really made it easy to purchase.

I had been eagerly awaiting this Rainbow Six game, although nervously after Lockdown, I worried this game series was going downhill. Then the images began popping up for Vegas and the graphics looked incredible. Finally I got it the day it was released (while on vacation so lots of time to play it) and I have to say, the series is back on top. I had downloaded the demo and that got my mouth watering. The graphics are top notch. The Unreal engine 3 is pushing this bad boy, as it pushed the other graphically rich game, Gears of War. This game is rich in detail and rides on a superb plot and storyline. The game begins in Mexico with Rainbow Six chasing after a lady tango. Without giving any spoilers, you are then taken on a route that ends up in the streets of Vegas and into the casinos. Man, I can only say that this is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. The casinos are brightly lit and amazingly caught with the sound designs and ambience. One of the most incredible parts to me was when I was in the casino during a firefight. Slot machines blow up and money spews out. The sounds of slow machines beeping really helped the mood here. The controls are fairly simple to learn and after about 30 minutes, you will be crouching and shooting and peaking around corners without even a second thought.There is also a feature where if you have the Xbox camera (I am curious if this can be done with any web cam) you can take a snapshot of your face and create your own personal character and the 360 will map your face onto the character. I haven't been able to do this yet as I haven't purchased the camera but it is a neat feature anyways. Single player campaign is well laid out and is not easy in any way. I found myself having to replay sections where I tried to run and gun and was taken out. You are given a nifty feature called the snake cam, which you can use to look under doors. Using this feature, you can spot tangos and even tag them number 1 and 2, for your team to take out in priority. You can use this feature to set your team up at one door while you move to another door and use a dynamic entry to take the enemy out. You have to think because the enemy AI is great here. Tangos will take cover and take pot shots at you from around corners. Tangos will flank you and work as a team. Ubisoft has recaptured what made Rainbow Six 3 so great and made it better.This is a must have game for the 360. It is one of the top games in terms of graphics, gameplay and longevity. This game will rule Xbox Live. I can only wait for the next Rainbow Six to come out. (Yes, the ending promises another but we all knew that right?) You can't go wrong with this game, in my opinion this is much better than GRAW.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2006"}

Rhodes","summary":"Another reason to get a GBA","reviewText":"Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories is a fantastic GBA release.  This is one of the games that makes you glad you have a GBA in the first place.More geared towards people who are already fans of the series, Chain of Memories takes place right where the original PS2 title left off.  It's meant to connect Kingdom Hearts to its inevitable sequel.The game begins with Sora, Donald and Goofy in the field.  They run off through the field to a place called \"Castle Oblivion\".  Inside Castle Oblivion are where Sora's memories are held.  As Sora traverses the castle his memories will be revived and he'll have to face them.  You'll go through all the world you visited in Kingdom Hearts.  There are no new worlds which may discourage some people.  Sora will eventually have to face the leaders of the castle (a group known as the organization) and face his memories.The castle is divided up into thirteen floor.  Each floor represents a world from the original game.  Fans of the original will quickly recognize the different worlds and find themselves rekindling a few memories themselves.The combat in Chain of Memories is a little different.  Rather than take the premise of the first game, Chain of Memories introduces cards.  The way your cards are stacked up makes a difference in the action you can take.  If you shuffle your cards right, the ones you need will be right on top.  But the problem with a card is it can only be used once and then it'll go back to the bottom of the deck.  The cards justify your actions.  Whether you can use items and spells or whether you can just physical attack.  If you have your cards stacked up right you can use devastating combos.Your enemies have cards as well.  If your card outweighs theirs (Say you have a nine and they have a four) then you striek succesfully.  If you get Zero, you can parry attacks and block them.However, the entire card system is flawed in some ways.  If you run out of all your good cards then you can virtually do nothing in combat.  Not only that, but you can only use each card ONCE per battle.  You'll also find yourself shuffleing through the cards constantly just to find the card you want, leaving you vulnerable to attacks.Bosses have cards too.  Often bosses will put their best cards on top as well and use devastating attacks in the beginning.  But much like you they can only use the card once.  This means you could simply wait a boss out and then go for the stirke.  You can make bosses much too easy by using this tactic.But the combat aside, the other aspects of the game are unbelievable.  The graphical presentation is among the best the GBA has to offer!  There are even a few 3D scenes.  The character sprites look incredible as well.Then there's the audio.  Any fan of Kingdom Hearts will be familiar with some of the tunes.  Several are borrowed from the original game.  There is no spoken dialogue but there are voices.  In battle you'll hear Sora scream when he uses an item, attacks or any other combat action.The game is mostly geared towards those who have played and enjoyed the first game.  It's an excellent game if you can have patience with the tedious card system fused into the combat.The Good+Beautiful Graphics+Great sound+Innovative battle system but...The Bad-The combat system is overall flawed-No new worlds!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2004"}

The game took place on a remote island where you were part of a special forces team sent there to rescue an archaeologist. The island was also taken over by the North Koreans making this rescue a bit harder to deal with. The game I am talking about is Crysis and was an awesome game that dealt with the alien invaders called the Celph. The sequel had you put in NYC as you were trying to deal with the alien invasion that had reached the big apple and how you were going to repel these invaders. Now a new game is going to be released in the series called Crysis 3 and will you want to go back to the big apple or should you just pass and go somewhere else instead?The game puts you in control of Prophet as you are back in NY to find out what the C.E.L.L. corporation is up to. They have enclosed the city in these giant nanodomes as they say it is to protect the populace from the Celph invaders but is that true or is there something else that is going on here? You are thrust into an overgrown and wild world as nature has reclaimed the city as the once proud buildings of glass and steel are overgrown with vegetation and the streets are filled with water. You are not only fighting the Celph in this game but also the C.E.L.L. operatives that are left behind.You will have a variety of weapons at your disposal including your nanosuit and some of the newest weapons are the Predator Bow (which includes various tipped warheads for whatever needs that arise), The typhoon projectile minigun (a very fast firing rifle) and even the Celph plasma rifle (that fires either burst or rapid fire). You will need all the help you can get as you try to unravel the secrets behind this dome and why it was put into place.Multiplayer is also coming back to Crysis three as it will support up to 12 players on the console (or 16 on the PC). There is also a new multiplayer game type called Hunter where one person becomes the hunter and the rest become the hunted (it bears a similarity to Black Ops zombie mode).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}

I thought it was a very fun experience and no game can really compare to all the mayhem one can cause in  this game. It's the perfect catharsis after a hard days work. My only complaint is the games plot. Its razor thin, it tries to remind you every now and than that a plot exists but it's very predictable (Gee who will betray me?

{"product_name":"B00006LU9L","reviewerName":"M. S. Hillis","summary":"The Thinking Gamer's Halo","reviewText":"After burning out on Halo deathmatch and hankering for some good action to get the gaming juices flowing, I finally bought this game a couple weeks ago. The result? I am seriously addicted, and find myself creeping out of bed after the wife is asleep to just try one more mission!I pretty much missed the whole tactical shooter phenomenon on the PC. I had gotten bored with endless varieties of Quake and tournament deathmatch and more or less gave up on the genre in favor of strategy games that take more thought and planning. So it's been a pleasant surprise to see how far a shooter can be taken and how a game like Ghost Recon is more of a military simulator than anything else.I wanted a game that has both a compelling single-player mode as well as deathmatch capabilities. Ghost Recon delivers on both. The single player game is great for the ability to select and customize the six soldiers that comprise your squad. You only directly control one at a time, but can guide the actions of the others through a command interface that sets movement waypoints as well as aggressiveness, and you can take control of any soldier at any time. In playing against others you control a squad of three. The command interface and squad set-up interfaces take a bit of getting used to, but I had it down pat after a couple sessions.The gameplay is great and full of suspense and anticipation. You usually need to proceed through the map very carefully, keeping a low stance to evade detection while constantly scanning the terrain for your enemies. Unlike Halo, in which your targetting reticle lights up when it scans over an opponent, you may be unsure at times over what you're really aiming at: an enemy soldier or just a tree? Also, forget about taking insane amounts of damage or finding a \"health pack\" to fix your wounds. A couple shots will kill your soldiers, and if they get wounded, they limp around for the rest of the mission. If they die, you lose that character forever and have to train a newbie for your next mission.The game is great at creating a sort of spooky atmosphere. You are plunked down in a strange area with a map but no idea where your enemies are. The blowing wind makes trees sway and rustle, adding random movement that keeps you constantly on your toes. When gunfire has erupted from aside or behind me, I have literally jumped in my seat. One drawback is the total lack of interactivity with the environment. You cannot pickup objects, even weapons or ammo from your own dead. You cannot even open or close doors.I have seen lots of complaints about graphics and while they are not stellar, as in Splinter Cell, they are good enough to convey a sense of realism. There are also complaints that the AI is too dumb to rely on to guide your other squad members. My biggest gripe with the AI is that it is sometimes TOO effective. Often my soldiers have taken out the enemy without me ever seeing where they bad guy was. I wish there was some sort of notification after which you could instruct your unit to fire at will or something. The bad guy AI is generally decent, with them running for cover, etc. In one scenario, I watched a dude drop to the ground, then crawl around the other side of a car, then re-emerge to try to shoot at me.The only other main complaint I have is that the deathmatch option only supports two people playing on one Xbox, as opposed to the four allowed by Halo. And I understand if you do a system link, it is only one person per box. Unfortunately I am living outside the US and don't have access to Xbox Live, but everything I have read says this game rocks when playing multiplayer online.It short, Ghost Recon has a few shortcomings, but the outstanding gameplay simply overrides all of that. This is one of the best game purchases I have made -- up there with Halo and Max Payne. I am a new convert to tactical shooters, and will definitely keep my eye on further Tom Clancy-tagged games and those from the wizzes at Ubi Soft.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2003"}

If I didnt need to access that 'Select' key, I'd still be using the keyboard and I'm sure that given more time (took me all of 5 minutes to make the decision of Skin vs Keypad) with the keyboard and some practice I would have gotten used to the function keys.

Cadieux","summary":"Review from a former fence-sitter","reviewText":"I was on the fence about this game for a year, but finally decided to give it a shot.  I had been concerned about not only the reported difficulty, but also the lack of a pause button.  I frequently need to interrupt my game sessions for a few minutes at a time to take care of real-life responsibilities, so the biggest drawback for me was the no-pause issue.  I had avoided buying the game mostly for that reason.  It turned out to not be so bad.  Here are some points that somebody like me might want to consider before they jump into this game:1.  The difficulty is not that bad.  While it's true that I died well over 100 times during the course of the game, I was expecting it, so it didn't seem to frustrate me much.  But a lot of the game isn't that difficult.  There are 16 bosses in the game and I defeated 8 of them on my first time fighting them.  One boss took me about 12 tries, and the others were 2-4 times.2.  Yes, it's true that some bosses can kill you in mere seconds and that if you die you have to start at the beginning of the level.  But the good news is that you can often open shortcuts so that your second time through will be way faster.  Also, some of the bosses are the entire level, so if you have to start over, you'll be at the boss anyway.3.  There isn't a pause button, but once you clear the local area of enemies, or just keep your distance so that they don't charge you, it's quite easy to find safe places in the game.  You shouldn't ever be more than a couple of minutes from the next safe location, so it's no problem to put the controller down while you take care of some incoming emails.Overall I'm very happy with this game.  At the new Greatest Hits price, I highly recommend you give it a try!Playing tips:1.  The starting class you choose can make a big difference.  There are at least 2 wiki sites online with advice for newcomers.  I used the Royalty class.  Other classes recommended are Soldier and Temple Knight.2.  Save up your souls and get the Evacuation miracle as soon as possible.

I&#8217;d played them both to hell on the PS2 already, but nothing beats having such epic games in the palm of your hands. However, the  transition from console to handheld was not without a few minor issues.The issues with the Vita edition of the MGS HD Collection include:1.) In MGS3, if you have the knife equipped and accidently brush your finger across the rear-touchpad (which will happen often), Naked Snake will abruptly stop moving and swipe his knife. It can be annoying when you&#8217;re trying to sneak by an enemy and don&#8217;t realize you have the knife in-hand. This can lead to an alert if an enemy hears you. The simple solution is to just make sure you unequip the knife when you don&#8217;t need it. Simply tapping the the Weapon icon on the bottom right of the screen will unequip the weapon quickly.2.) Because the Playstation Vita lacks L2/R2 triggers, the Vita&#8217;s rear-touchpad is used to replace them. This is in part a good thing, because now nothing from the console games is excluded, but the touchpad is also not as accurate as the L2/R2 triggers. Instead of pressing and holding the L2/R2 triggers, on the Vita you have to slide both index or middle fingers down on the rear-touchpad. Don't worry, its MUCH easier done than said.3.) The Playstation Vita&#8217;s analog sticks are a bit too sensitive, so the sniping sections from Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance will be a tiny-bit more troublesome than on consoles (particularly, the part where you have to shoot out the small mines on the oil fence while aiding Emma).Most of the extras, including the orignal MSX titles, Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2 are still available in the Vita edition. So are the gigantic amount of VR Missions in MGS2 Substance, Snake Tales and the Demo Theater from MGS3 Subsistence. Peace Walker is noticeably absent from this collection, but that is most likely due to cart constraints. PS Vita game carts hold 4 gigs max at the moment, and Peace Walker would&#8217;ve added an extra 1.5GB. Simply put, PW would not have fit.Despite those three small grievances, everything else transitioned perfectly. There really isn&#8217;t much else I could ask of handheld versions of these games. Simply put, I love them and if I had a chance to play their home console counterparts, I wouldn&#8217;t. Vita all the way baby!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}

This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired.

The RPG elements aren't as deep as you might expect, as ME2 seems to cater to a wider audience by being more of an adventure/shooter game. The dialog system, as you might already know, is deep and engrossing. The shooting mechanics is a cover-based 3rd-person perspective with the ability to issue basic orders to your squadmates (such as move to a specific spot, use a specific power/weapon to take out an enemy), hence the reference to R6. Weapon customization is relatively light; you can spend currency to research upgrades but they don't seem to make a big difference in the performance of the weaponry. This is slightly disappointing.There is a lot to do and experiment with in this game. You can explore open areas, talk to people, take on side and story missions, scour planets for resources, etc. Despite the variety, I find myself spending most of my time on side and story missions. Although you have the ability to choose the order which you complete the mission, it's not always easy to tell which move the plot forward and which do not. Not a huge issue. Also, each story mission seems to be quite linear, which is expected of course. The issue is, sometimes the mission can get long and does not allow you to save until you reach the next logical checkpoint, and you have no idea if it is one minute or 10 minutes away. This could be problematic if you can only play for short periods at a time such as myself.The dialog/plot, which most 'professional' reviewers believe to be the main strength of this game, seems to move along at a relatively slow pace. Granted I'm not deep into the game, but after 10 hours, I had expected to learn/discover more information.Overall, this is a decent game that should appeal to RPG/adventure gamers. It is by no means perfect but it does provide solid entertainment.Pros+ Solid visuals/graphics; high production value.+ Decent control scheme.+ Solid voice acting which enhances credibility of the story.Cons- Most story missions are linear and some have lengthy periods without any save points.- Weapon/power uprgrade system does not seem to make a noticeable difference in performance.- Some minor bugs such as screen tearing and freezing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2011"}

Due to the somewhat limited choice of games for the Wii U and all the great things I have heard about this remake I decided to give Windwaker a try.  I really am glad I did.  lt took me about 40 hours to play through the game and since I am a Zelda novice towards the end of the game I did need to read a walkthrough in order to figure out what to do next.  I really enjoyed my experience with Windwaker and finally got to see why Zelda is such a popular IP.  Because of this game I am now really looking forward to Zelda U, where before my playthrough I honestly wasn't interested in a new Zelda.  As for Windwaker, the music, controls, graphics, and fun factor where all excellent.

I noticed it ran quieter than my 2nd generation PS3. Other than that it's still the same old PS3 system with not much else to say about it. The games come with their manuals/paperwork, online access codes, the DLC code slip for Batman, and the games themselves come in cardboard slip covers and not actual plastic retail store cases.PS3 is a great system and I've never had any problems with. It has an amazing library of exclusive games on it with The Last Of Us being in the top 5. And despite the PS4 coming out there are still more PS3 games on the way that are multiplatform and exclusive. Sony always has support their systems way beyond their years with games, even the PS2 still got a new game on it in 2013 and the PSP still gets new games despite the release of the Vita.If you find yourself new to PS3 then I would also reccomend picking up a year of PS+ which will give you 18 games to download right away that will be added to your account and youll get 5 new games a month, plus other perks like getting discounts on games you purchase digital and more.Only thing else I can say is grab a cheap Usb to Usb Mini cable that is 10ft long to use to recharge the controller. The cable that comes with it is a bit short, but a very inexpensive 10ft cable will let you just plug it in and lay back to play games while it recharges the controller.

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"Fryfat","summary":"The True Next-Gen Console","reviewText":"While competitors were happy updating graphics for the same old games, Wii took a different approach:Change everything.Better graphics and bigger storage are included of course, but what sets Wii apart most is the controller, dubbed by users as the \"Wiimote\".  Much more than a pointer, Wii's Remote has accelerometers to detect how fast it's being swung, and gyrometers to detect what direction it's moving.  With the accelerometer and gyrometer working together, you can put a realistic spin on a bowling ball, you can create a spell with Harry's wand, or along with the included nunchuk add-on, strangle an enemy in Godfather.Wii Sports is included for the USA version, which is an introduction to the abilities of the new controller through Baseball, Tennis, Boxing, Golf, and the crowd favorite Bowling.  The game may not keep your interest forever, but as a free pack-in, it's hard to complain and is still a hit at parties in my house.As for other games, there are the requisite Nintendo 1st party titles that are always great, but there are also multi-platform games.  Critics agreed that while games like \"Madden '07\", \"Godfather\" and \"Rayman Raving Rabbids\" fell flat on other consoles, on Wii they became something special due to the controls.As for a media player, Wii isn't going to play HD DVD's, but people seem to forget that the Wii can play true next-gen media: Youtube.  Navigating the web with a Wiimote is almost as natural as a mouse.There are a few negative aspects of the Wii.  It's storage is sub-par with only 512 megabytes, if you download a lot of old Nintendo or Sega classics through the virtual console, you'll need to buy a big SD card.  Wii's online gaming aspects are also weak at the moment, with more attention being paid to multiplayer with people in the same room, and some accuse the current lineup of games (as of summer '07) to be a bit soft.  But after months of record breaking sales, reports of developers like Capcom, Konami, Sega, Squaresoft, started coming in and they all said the same thing: Wii is now their #1 priority.  The future holds great things for the Wii.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2007"}

In fact, that may be part of the downfall. My only complaint is there wasn't enough to do in the amazingly HUGE cities; There are only so many types of missions, so a little more variation and weapon upgrades(more so than offered...)would have been nice.That being said, this game looks fantastic and controls just as well. there are some target issues when it comes to intense combat, but not too big of a deal. You can effortlessly flee on rooftops, jumping left and right without a care, the game flowing with just about everything you actually meant to do control-wise.The story is complex but interesting, and the game can unfold at your own pace. You can explore, climb, collect, save citizens, ride horses, or just fight; Just expect to be in for at least 15-20 hours.  Assassin's Creed is a nice take on a familiar genre, playing more in the realms of reality than say the 'magic powers' and 'flame-throwing sword'realm. It's def. refreshing, and the time-travel bits were a pretty cool surprise.A solid, well-made, hassle free fun experience.

But as I played more online co-op and versus games, the occasions come up when you want to thank another player for playing honorably, or finishing the campaign despite the late hour, or whatever. Picking letters using the joystick and screen is a fairly laborious process, so I bought the chatpad.At first, I thought it didn't work.  I had attached it to the controller, but the chatpad did not seem to work.  Make sure it \"Clicks\" on both sides of your controller.  The fit is very snug, and I do not think it was intended to come on and off regularly.  Once the chatpad was snapped into place properly, it worked brilliantly.The chatpad is a great add-on for your controller:1) the chatpad has an access point for the standard xbox 360 wired headset.2) the chatpad is very light and does not in any way interfere with the controller.3) the chatpad letters/numbers are backlit when you start typing.4) the chatpad works fine with theXbox 360 Black Play & Charge Kitand also works withXbox 360 Energizer Power and Play Charging System - Black. You do not have to remove the chatpad to charge your controller. NOTE: CHATPAD WILL HAVE TO BE REMOVED TO CHARGE YOUR CONTROLLER WITHXbox 360 Charge Base - Black5) the chatpad is compact with green shift and red shift which allows each key to function as 2 additional signs or symbols (great for creating names for aliens, elves, or other characters)I frequently use the chatpad eventhough I didn't think I would.

Fans of the original Star Wars Battlefront will also enjoy an all-new single-player experience that takes players through an epic story-based saga where every action the player takes impacts the battlefront and ultimately the fate of the Star Wars galaxy.Star Wars Battlefront II improves upon the original game s single-player experience with open-ended mission-based objectives inspired from all six Star Wars films. The pelling storyline spans more than 16 new locations many from the Episode III movie including volcanic Mustafar and the space battle above Coruscant. All-new classic movie moments plete the Star Wars Battlefront II experience as players battle within the interior of the Death Star and visit Princess Leia s blockade runner the Tantive IV as seen at the beginning of Episode IV A New Hope.

But it is not as bad as you think. Takes only a couple of minutes to figure out the new controls. And yes you can reload your weapon in mid-clip. Just hit the Down Arrow on the Dir. Pad.Pros:With kills/points you can unlock higher classes.There's a limited number of each class, so you dont get overwhelmed by special classes.The medals system is a nice touch. So many kills/points with certain weapons gains you Boosts or Equipment Upgrades. And an increase in rank will give you Squad Members.Gameplay is now more diverse, and the clumsy starfighters are now gone. They are now more like the SW craft in other SW games (Rogue Squadron for example).The maps are definitely interesting. With a wide variety to choose from.Start with the Rise of the Empire campaign-- helps to become familiar with the controls while picking up experience.The long delay between switching weapons is gone. Now its a more reasonable delay, letting you switch to a different weapon if you come to the end of a clip.You can earn Jedi/special characters while playing (single, multi, etc.). The Jedi/Special Characters *can* be killed, they are not invincible.Addition of a Stamina bar. This bar reduces with sprinting, jumping. When flying or in a vehicle, the bar is an Energy bar, representing available boost or special manuevers.Cons:Overheating certain weapons happens often, until you realize that you can do a quick burst of fire, then lay off with the occasional shot while you wait for it to return to normal.You can't always be the characters you want, and the limited numbers mean that if your skills are lower then you might not get a chance to play as a special unlock character/jedi.Overall: Very enjoyable for previous SW:BF fans, and SW fans in general.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2005"}

While Fallout 3 holds the crown let's just say Borderlands is the prince. If you have had a hard time grasping FPS/RPG hybrids then let me put it simple for you.Like in traditional RPGs you have elemental attacks. In Borderlands you have these and they consist of corrosion, explosive, fire, and lightning. Some guns can be fused with elemental powers so i.e. a lightning combat rifle will deplete enemies with shields faster than just a normal rifle. A shotgun with corrosive powers can kill creatures faster than a gun with lightning powers.Another element that you should be familiar with are stats. Just like TRPGs Borderlands has damage, hit accuracy on weapons. You get shields that have certain aspects such as when they deplete they send a wave of corrosive acid, or they recharge faster, or give you a health boost etc. You also get grenade mods which change the way your grenades act just like guns. There are also specific class mods that can increase some of your stats even further. Additionally, each character has a specific ability they can use and you can equip special spheres that add attributes to this ability. Sound like a TRPG so far? What about enemies? They too have levels and shields and the damage you deal to them will bounce off of them in a series of numbers along with the experience you get once they are killed.There are a lot of little tidbits such as the money system, you can purchase items or upgrades at vending machines, saving clap trap robots can give you more storage space, there are healing items, when you kill an enemy you can loot them, you can also loot the dungeons you enter or the open world. See, it still sounds like a TRPG. What makes it different? Just add guns, a vehicle you can drive and shoot from, and a fast travel system. The way to play in all this fun is co-op. More players+harder enemies=better loot. Good math in my book.This sounds fine and dandy like nothing can go wrong, but Borderlands has its issues. While the game play is actually pretty flawless with lots of guns such as rocket launchers, combat rifles, SMGs, and revolvers etc. The content is very thin. There isn't much to do, but run around the barren wasteland completing the 150+ side missions and 50+ story missions. There is hardly a story or any dialog. You're just running around trying to find this Vault with some special treasure. All the loot is the same and even the storage bins you find them in get's boring to see after awhile. While the game has a pretty neat cartoony graphic style everything is brown and boring and it makes the neat art style put to waste.The difficulty isn't something to complain about since it increases as you level up. Each area has to load separately and the load times are longer than they should be. Most of the side missions vary from scavenger hunts, to killing people, looting, and more killing, but the core game play is really shallow, but the stuff it's wrapped around is flawless. This game is really meant for people who just want a straight forward shooter with some more depth and a twist. While it does feel more arcadey than Fallout 3 and more pick up and play it just doesn't have that charm and amazing feeling to it. Borderlands is executed well, but just needs more filling to make it superb. However, the game is highly addictive and even though you know you're doing the same thing over and over again you never get tired of it. The game has a level 50 cap, and can be completed 100% in less than 20 hours, so Borderlands is a great purchase for any shooter fan.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00004U5VI","description":"While it's hard to see why some four-player games are worth the trouble,Gauntlet: Dark Legacyis one game that looks, at its preview stage, like  it'll have gamers begging for their PlayStation2 Multi Tap accessories and three  extra Dual Shock 2 controllers.The game is a port of the coin-op of the same name that hit the arcade in the  spring of 2000. Much of the setting, action, and controls have survived the  translation. The difference here is that there's just more of a good thing in  the PS2'sDark Legacy. You play as one of eight characters--four from theGauntlet Legends, plus a sorceress, knight, dwarf, and jester.Dark  Legacyalso features a larger selection of threads for each fighter. Once  your character is attired suitably, the game becomes a stab-and-jab fest. As inLegends, the single player game is good, but it's the multiplayer mayhem  that attracts people to theGauntletgames.Gauntlet: Dark Legacywill feature the four realms fromLegends,  plus four new ones and a fantastic new battlefield section.--Todd Mowatt","reviewerName":"J. Leigh \"JL\"","summary":"Not far from other Gauntlet implementations","reviewText":"It is somewhat surprising how little difference there is between the various implementations. Visually the PS1 version isn't that much different from the PS2 version. Even the cutscenes aren't much better.There are more characters that one can control but the characters don't gain a significant amount of visual detail in the PS2 version. Part of the problem is that the characters remain about the same size in each version and there isn't a whole lof of detail one can fit in that same amount of screen space.If you don't have a version of Gauntlet for any platform then get the PS2 version (in this regard I give the game a 4/5). If you already have the PS1 version, get the PS2 one only if you are a die-hard gauntlet fan (in this case I would give the game a 3/5).Unless Midway ups the visual quality of the next version of Gauntlet significantly, they are going to lose their market to competitors like how they lost Mortal Kombat to the clones.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2001"}

{"product_name":"B00005TNI6","description":"Final Fantasy Xis the first title in this landmark RPG series to be released for the PlayStation2. The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"humanbeldot","summary":"Beautifully rendered with an engaging story","reviewText":"The Final Fantasy series completely reinvented the RPG genre, turning it into something that can cause the player to gain an emotional attachment to the characters. With Final Fantasy X, the first game in the series with voice acting, that familiar sense of attachment has been wholly translated to a simple yet beautiful and emotional story.The CGI scenes are beautifully rendered, the backgrounds - especially those of Besaid Island and Macalania - lush and colorful, the story simple, yet at the same time, wonderfully complex. One of the biggest complaints about the game is the voice acting. Personally, I believed that the voice actors worked with what they were given, and that dubs are notorious for being very bad. James Arnold Taylor gives an effective, if occasionally obnoxious (but I don't believe it's his fault: he voiced Ratchet perfectly), reading for the main protagonist Tidus, and at times it feels as though you're right there with him. Every voice actor chosen for the English dub was, I believe, very well chosen.The storyline begins very simply: Tidus lives in a machina (machine) city known as Zanarkand and is the local star of the Zanarkand Abes Blitzball team (a form of underwater soccer). An attack by an entity known as Sin, however, launches him into another world, 1000 years into the future, known as Spira. He begins a quest with a young summoner, Yuna, and a cast of colorful characters to vanguish Sin and find a way to return home.The depth of the story as it goes on, however, can be amazing. Subplots are uncovered; new, vast areas for exploration (a temple off the Calm Lands, accessable only by chocobo, and especially the Omega Ruins) are discovered via the airship, unlocked later in the game. Fiends can be captured to create awesome new creatures that give worthwhile prizes once defeated. Character depth and development, while not particularly noteworthy, is still enough to be engaging. The most painful thing will be early in the game, when random battles pop up while going from place to place, and of course the frequency of cutscenes and the inability to skip them. Still, it isn't enough to take away from the story and the journey, and can have you playing (if you go for every hidden area and secret) for well over seventy hours.All in all, the game is an excellent buy and still looks beautiful, even alongside newer games for the powerhouse PlayStation 3 and its Blu-ray-based games. No matter what price you pay for it, it will be worth your time and money.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMAT","description":"GoldenEye 007has been a huge success for Rareware, and it's easy to see why. More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"Dolphin","summary":"Liking this game","reviewText":"This game is a keeper to have and I wouldn't mind playing another James Bond game, which I'm getting From Russia with Love.

As a lot of people know, A Wii Controller costs $39.99, and this cost $49.99. So why spend an extra $10 on a game that really doesn't matter when the controller is the main thing you want. Well you get a controller plus a game with pretty cool games that further more shows the wii controllers capabilities. There are 9 games in all and they are Billiards, Laser Hockey, Fishing, Cow Racing, Ping Pong, Mii Pose, Battle Tanks, Shooting Range, & Find Mii. They all have a specific and fun way too play. There are some good games, but most of them suck. About 25% of the games on here are worth playing but 75% of them are not.Good Games-Billiards - the most fun game and the one game that has the most realistic physics that are very impressive, I wish they could have had a full 15 ball game instead of 9 Ball, too short especially with two players.-Laser Hockey - a pretty fun game, plays like good ol' PONG but more flashy. The game can get a lil frustrating and very tireing cuz in order to control your side you have to keep pointing at your TV screen.- Battle Tanks -  a cliche' game basic and simple move around with yout Nunchuck attachment and shoot things (Warning: If you wanna play with anotther player you have too buy a Nunchuck Controller since this doesn't come with one).Bad Games- Shooting Range - Boring- Find Mii - probabley the worst game on here- Pose Mii- an annoying game period- Ping Pong - hard to control and frustrating as hell- Fishing - Just like real life except faster and twice as boring- Charge! - a cow racing games that you have to knock down things while you go and try too win the race. actually kinda fun with another player but gets old fast.Although most of the games suck some of them are kind of worth buying like Billiards alone. But They could of maybe added a Nunchuck controller upping the price a little bit of course, and could have added a 4 player multiplayer. But if you need too buy another controller which most likely you will, then you can't really go wrong with this it's just an extra $10.00 for an average game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2007"}
