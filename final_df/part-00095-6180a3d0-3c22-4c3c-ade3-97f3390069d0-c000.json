{"product_name":"B00005NZ1M","description":"When Microsoft releasedNFL Fever 2000on the PC in 1999, it gaveMaddena serious run for its money. It's been a few years, butFeverandMaddenare once again going head-to-head on the Xbox,  and once againFeverproves itself a serious threat to EA's perennial  football powerhouse. That's not to say thatNFL Fever 2002is a perfect  game, because it isn't, but it does offer great graphics, decent AI, and plenty  of bone-crunching gameplay.NFL Fever 2002features several gameplay modes, including practice,  single game, and season, which itself contains a couple of different options,  including dynasty and fantasy challenge.Fever 2002has a full NFL  license and includes all 31 current NFL teams--and 15 fantasy teams--along with  all the current stadiums. Dynasty mode is where most players will find  themselves, as this mode lets you manage all aspects of your team, including  signing and cutting players, negotiating trades, and making sure that your team  comes in under the salary cap.A great feature in dynasty mode is Dynamic Player Performance, which adjusts  players' ratings (which determine how well they play) based on past game  performances. So if you have a second-string running back who rattles off three  or four great games in a row, his rating will increase, which should keep him  performing at that high level. On the flip side, if a player has several poor  games, his rating will decrease.Because it was designed specifically for the Xbox (unlikeMadden NFL  2002, which was ported to the Xbox from the PlayStation2 version),NFL  Fever 2002looks awesome. Player animations are highly detailed, the  stadiums look fantastic, and the weather effects are topnotch. Beyond the  obvious features, though, there are many subtle details that really add to the  experience: the field will get torn up in wet weather, player uniforms will get  stained with dirt, and the crowd will begin to thin out if the game is a  blowout.In terms of gameplay,Fever 2002delivers a solid experience. The AI is  pretty solid, especially on the defensive side, and if you call a perfect game  it's possible to get a shutout against the computer, even on the higher  difficulty settings. On the downside, the computer rarely runs the ball, even  when it has a high-powered running back like Corey Dillon, and AI play calling  is rather suspect at times.Those complaints aside,Fever 2002is a lot of fun. It offers great  graphics, multiplayer is a blast, and the dynasty mode features a good deal of  depth. If you only want one football game,NFL Fever 2002deserves your  consideration.--William HarmsPros:Dynamic Player PerformanceGreat graphicsSolid defensive AICons:Computer rarely runs the ballGameplay a little arcadelike at times","reviewerName":"C.

I love the look, the feel, the sounds, everything else.  Sure, I can't rack up numbers like I could on Madden, but I could never learn how to play Madden.  After all the years and all the consoles and PCs, I still get thrashed by Madden and give up and wait for next year.  This game is fun for me.  I can be competitive, and that is all I ask out of a game when playing the computer.  Other than the 5 minute quarters, I have zero complaints about this game.  Personally, I liked 8 minute quarters on Madden; it kept the thrashings respectable.If you want depth, this is most likely not the game for you.  I may suck at Madden, but I do miss some of its features that Fever does not have.  If you want to have fun, but not NFL Blitz fun, this is your game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00004YUWA","description":"Icoweaves the tale of a young boy trying to escape his  imprisonment in a large, vacant castle. Along the way, he discovers another  captive--a beautiful princess named Yorda. Players control Ico with the goal of  escaping the castle with the princess safely in hand.Although it looks like an adventure game and has some rudimentary action  sequences, Ico is mostly about solving puzzles. Players will run, jump, and  climb their way through the gargantuan castle as well as figure out which  objects and environments are interactive. Yorda is very much a damsel in  distress, and isn't nearly as capable as Ico. A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike. The  ambient soundtrack and simple controls let the player focus on the tasks at  hand. Sony has crafted a very unique game that anyone can play. Few games are as  elegant in their simplicity as this puzzler from Sony.--Raymond M.

Luckily though, i did get an added warranty with my product since it did cost me 500 at the time (bought it from walmart). needless to say, walmart warranty plans suck. i sent it in 3 times because of ylod issue and it came back twice with other problems. still waiting on refund or another ps3.

{"product_name":"B0000A9Y11","description":"Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

Never have I enjoyed Nintendo's handheld technology more than with this product.Taking the best parts of the GameBoy Advance (large color screen, access to an excellent game library), Nintendo has improved upon its original model by adding several great features.  The features I enjoy most include:* Backlight --&#62; you can play your GBA SP in dim rooms, on the move (when you don't have access to extra light), heck, you can play it IN THE DARK!  This is an amazing improvement.  I'm sure that the third party market that has made a mint off lights for the GameBoy and original GameBoy Advance systems are very mad, but this internal light is even better than any of the numerous add-ons I've bought over the years.* Rechargeable-battery (with adapter) --&#62; you can now charge the internal battery by plugging it into the wall (or by buying a separate car charger).  The battery lasts anywhere from 6 - 10 hours (depending on whether you use the backlight or not).* Flip-top screen --&#62; this smaller, sleeker design also serves to protect the screen from getting scratchedAll told, these additions are amazing, and saved me at least $25 (now that I don't have to buy all those add-ons from another company).I really enjoy my GameBoy Advance SP, and play all of the great new GBA games as well as my old black and white GameBoy favorites on it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2004"}

If you are an avid fan, and can overlook ALOT of flaws, this game is fun. Like everyone says the graphics are bad. Horrid even. Campaign is glitchy with poor hit detection, sway, and freezes/crashes. Plotline is decent, though I haven't finished it.Multi is fun as ever, but if you played the beta, expect that level of quality. Everyone is saying its made for the next gen systems, and I hope so, cause if it doesn't impress I doubt anyone would buy anything else from this franchise, BF4 on ps3 is that bad.Everyone saying it is a step backwards and worse than bf3 in every aspect is correct. It has the quality of some game ya found in the bargain bin. very very poor.The controls have been changed to best utilize new next gen layouts, but I set my control scheme to veteran, and heli/jet sticks to legacy. It wasn't that bad to adjust, had the hang of it in a few rounds.No doubt this was rushed to market, it has no business being on a retail shelf.If you are new to the Battlefield series, or where thinking about checking it out, wait for ps4, or rent it. this ps3 version isn't going to steal away any fans of other games, and would leave you scratching your head asking,\" this is the great battlefield series?\" Overall a very poor presentation.Now, the game does have a fun factor, I did enjoy playing online, but I am a fan of the series, and only rented the game. I am not going to buy it on ps3, and cant really recommend that anyone buy it.They should have made bf4 next gen only, and released new maps for bf3 to satisfy current gen. It is apparent that little time went into the ps3 version.Though a huge fan of the series, it pains me to say, don't buy bf4 on ps3, its garbage. I know next gen is just moments away, but if a company is going to release a product and charge top dollar for it, they better do it right. current gen bf3 is just wrong.I look forward to doing a 5 star bf4 review for ps4, as the parts are there for a great game, I just hope that for ps4 they put it together properly","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2013"}

In the Borderland series farming relates to running an area or end boss over and over again, defeating him saving the game and restarting it and fighting him again.

{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Robert Evans \"Robert\"","summary":"One of the best consoles of its time","reviewText":"The Nintendo 64 in my opinion was the best console Nintendo ever made(and yes I did own a SNES for a very long time untill it died on me)and it is in my mind better then the nintendo gamecube.  The console came out around 1996 and launched some amazing games that I'm going to get into in just abit but first let me say that this is also one of my favorite consoles, it had great games, the quality and quantity were magneficent and just about everything about this console is great now how does it sum up?Sound-Some good some bad but in the end it was acctually far more worse then the Playstation(the first of course)which was such a huge let down for some of the Nintendo fans, I mean I'll be honest it was so mushy in some games it's not even funny!  It's a shame cause most of the sound is what brings scores down for games in the gaming industry(seriously it does)but for me the amazing games just make up for itGraphics-Um........were all of you as shocked as I was when we saw Mario in a full 3d world?  If your answe was yes then you are correct, the visuals in N64 were far more superior then the Playstaion and put out some of the best looking vidoe games of it's time(and to me some games that are still good looking to this day).  The visuals were just jaw dropping, awe and looks of amazement for me.  Simply put...Nintendo scored big time in the graphics departure.  It broke out of the 2d cartoony look and braught us new and exciting/pretty looking games of 96 to 2000.Memory Card-I can't say much other then like the Dreamcast VMU, the memory card with Rumble pack was just awesome...Nuff saidGames- Where the heck do I start?  The games for the Nintendo 64 were some of the best games ever created on a console.  Mario 64 to many and myself was a friggin legend beyond belief and was hailed to many as the best game ever made.  When it comes to RPG's the games for N64 probably gets a 1/10..Paper Mario and that was it......but in adventure departure it gets a 1000000/10, why?  THE GAMES WERE FRIGGIN AMAZING!  The console braught many, many amazing games.  Golden Eye, Perfect Dark, Donkey Kong 64, Mario 64, The Turok series, Conkers Bad Fur Day, Rayman 2(which was one of best platformers I've ever played), Banjo Kazooie and many many more.  Those games let alone made Nintendo 64 one of the best consoles ever made(next to the Sega Dreamcast).  One huge reason in particular for why I loved the N64 was simply this......Ocarina of Time.  Yes folks, to me The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was hands down the greatest video game I've ever played and was to me the greatest game of all time.  It had an amazing story, superb visuals and combat and amazing enviroments and everything about the game was just breathtaking and was let alone a system seller for me.  Another game in particular other then Ocarina of Time was the consoles last game that was released in 2000 and that was Conkers Bad Fur which was hands down another great game/must own for the console, it not only used parodies and dirty humor to bring the gameplay to life but the game itself was really good!

Though alot of people choose SNES I choose this, don't get me wrong the SNES had some amazing games(such as Donkey Kong Country and Yoshis Island which were amazing games)but I still choose the n64 over that console for somereason.  If I had to name you the games system sellers it would be Perfect Dark, Goldeneye, Mario 64, Rayman 2, Conkers BFD and of course OCARINA OF TIME!!!  Yes for a one console that is ALOT of system sellers..ok i'm done ranting about the gamesPrice-why do I bring this up?...well for one thing the system and like 5 games would would be a total of 50 bucks(heck maybe even less)and the fact that it's really cheap now is another reason you should go out and buy this console.  Why spend 100 bucks on PS2 when you can get a N64 for 20 bucks(then again I own a ps2 so I should shut up for saying that)and some pretty amazing games for 10 bucks?...IT'S A MUST HAVE FOR BACK THEN AND EVEN NOW!!...GO AND GET THE CONSOLE!Overall- One of the best console ever made with amazing games, a cool looking controller, great memory card, and overall great everthing!...Ok I'm done ranting!Overall = 5 OUT OF 5!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2005"}

Voice acting was that good and entertaining. I thought Origins was a solid action RPG but I do agree with the unbalanced difficulty. There are certain places where normal mode was just too hard for me, so I switched to casual in those spots. The other thing that bugged me was when an ally gets knocked out. The only way to recover him during battle is a mage skill. No potions for this I could find. Other than that I really enjoyed it.

So here it goes.When the game runs correctly(will get to this in the cons), it's absolutely amazing. I'm a long time FPS veteran and can honestly say that the Battlefield games do a fantastic job at delivering fun gameplay. I'm not much of a vehicle guy so I'm usually on the ground using my main weapons and I have a blast in every game. One thing I'd like to note if I dare compare Call of Duty with this, is that I rarely feel cheated when being killed by an enemy. If I get killed in Call of Duty, half the time it doesn't make sense, bullets follow me around walls, lag comp gets me killed, etc. If I die in BF, I feel that it was fair and that I played poorly.The other thing Battlefield hits home is graphics. Comparing it to pretty much any other shooter at the moment it's easily in the running for best looking one. Gun design is excellent, character models look great, even vehicles look realistic. Not a big thing many people think about but the sound is also nice. Guns sound at least somewhat accurate to real life.Now the rough part. As with BF3, BF4 has had a rocky start. No response from the servers, disconnect from matches, erasing campaign progress. No doubt the majority of the playerbase has had these problems. But as with BF3 they WILL be fixed. Everyone has to realize how much work it takes to make a game run absolutely flawless. It's nearly impossible and people don't allow it to breathe.Should EA have delayed it until they had issues resolved? Of course.Did they want to rush it out the door for holiday season/next gen console release to get more money? OF COURSE.This is a business. They have to make money.At the end of the day I'm happy that I bought it because I've been enjoying it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2014"}

BUT - The SetPoint software that you use to customize the mouse and set macros for each of the buttons is next to worthless.

You have to go to multiple screens to set profiles for different applications and to set macros for each of the buttons.  I am a very technical person (MCSE), so I can't imagine someone who is not technical being able to make it through the setup of macros.  In the end, I could not get the macros to work at all in any of the programs I tried:  Photoshop Elements 9, World of Warcraft, etc.  I went on the Logitech forums and they were no help.

While our son loves noodles and hates meat, our daughter tolerates noodles and loves meat. And the same type of thing is true for their video game selections. He likes to play games in order to get tot he end of the game and to win, while she likes to just experience the game.We purchased Kirby's Epic Yarn for our daughter for Christmas because she loves Kirby - and what little girl wouldn't, he very cute! Once her brother got done playing one of his new games, she took her turn and put Kirby in. What surprised me wasn't that she loved it, but that her brother wanted to play as well! Every time she plays it now, he's in the room offering advice and cheering her on - something that doesn't always happen in this household.PROS:- Easy game play. As you hold the Wii remote sideways, it's a very easy game to play. Just push two buttons and control which direction Kirby goes in and you're able to play the game.- No \"dying\". This is an especially good thing for our daughter, who isn't the most talented video game player ever. If Kirby falls off a ledge, little \"angel\" yarn people pick Kirby back up and bring him to a safe place.- Multiple players on every level. Instead of being able to play two players on just certain levels, with Kirby's Epic Yarn you can play two players on every level, so that my daughter and son can play together. And unlike some games, which gives the second player only a small bit of functionality, Kirby and Prince Fluff can both do the same things, so there's even less chance of bickering between the two fo them.CONS:- None yet!I have a feeling the only con we'll have is that we wish the game were longer, but as of right now there are no cons to this game.A great, kid-friendly game that is not only fun to play for every age in the family but that is fun to watch and listen to as well, although the music in Kirby's room is definitely lullaby music and has had me closing my eyes more than once!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2010"}

FF7, FF9, and FF10 are also very good, but FF6 got the RPG formula perfect: Great characters, great story, great battle system.  If I had to sell all my RPGs, FF6 is the one I would keep & play over-and-over.As for FF5, the story is rather weak, but the gameplay is really really good, thanks to the job system (like FF10-2).  What I like to do with FF5 is to experiment:- What if I had 4 white mages?- What if I had 4 black mages?- What if I had 4 fighters?- Would I survive the battles w/ such weak teams?Thanks to its job system, FF5 has a great deal of replayability.  Even after you beat the game, you can go back and replay with a completely different team, and new complications (trust me, beating this game with 4 black mages is NOT easy).Bottom Line: Buy Final Fantasy 5/6 right now.

I can't put everything on high, but the game ran smoothly with the auto-detect the game did on my system.\\The biggest thing I love about this game is the draw distance.  If you play any game and say, &quot;Oh look at how beautiful those fogs covering up the distance are...&quot;, well, you won't be seeing much of that here.Sniping is brought up to a new level with this game.  Any other game, long distance is about 100 meters.  This...is 10 times that distance.  Using your binoculars aren't novelty item.  You don't have to squint to see if what you're seeing through your sniping scope is an enemy or just a graphical glitchy-blob.  Non of that.  You zoom in, you can clearly see your enemies from far, faaaar away.  It's a lovely feeling to be standing in one island and snipe someone on the other island a kilometer away, and watch him fall from the bridge he was walking across and into the water.  Sweet.But the game's not all about outdoors.  There's plenty of actions inside bunkers, warehouses, and cave systems.  The graphic engine does all of them very nicely, and without any of them annoying load times between the transition that you might see on lesser engines.  Oh, and there's the complementary rag doll physics that's pretty much a requirement for any self respecting FPS game.The AI doesn't leave much of an impression.

This game is simply brilliant.  It's hard to compare it to the first even though they have VERY similar mechanics.  The main differences I'd say, the first game the story was better and in the second the timed button pressing segments are a little more relaxed so you can spend more time enjoying the cool moves he does.The game has an epic feel to it, which I don't use lightly.  The cut scenes and much of the game are simply beautiful.  You're also in environments which actually feel huge.  At one point you have to run across this giant chain and while it's slightly annoying to control with the camera being fixed it really puts you in the right frame of mind.  The new grappling hook mechanic is executed well.Some of the puzzles are very obvious, some are a bit tougher, but nothing felt unfair.  You're also given a very limited area so it's not like Prince of Persia 2 where you might not know if you're in the right section of the map to complete something, if all else fails you can just try to smash everything and see if something breaks open that you can use.  I found it to be an excellent mix of combat and puzzle to keep you interested throughout.  Also, the punishment for dying is not horrible so you can experiment and die a few times without having to do a long sequence over and over and over again just to get up to that point.The two God of War games are some of the best on the PS2 period.  One note though, they're mature titles.  There's not only a lot of violence, decidedly unheroic actions, but partial nudity.  If you've got young kids, you may want to pass on it.

It was the Core edition that came with no hard drive and a wireless controller.  Long story short, that one broke, along with three other 360 consoles.  But during the times they worked, I ran through three controllers, and they all had the same problem.THE D-PAD WAS HORRIBLE!  Simply put, it was very inaccurate, especially when typing messages.However, the new controller designs feature a new d-pad, which I have grown to love.  Granted, it still isn't on the high level as the PS3's d-pad, but it still is pretty high up there.  I'm VERY glad they improved the d-pad.  I can't fully test it yet since I bought it for gaming on my laptop, but I'll update this review once I start using the controller on my PS3.Anyway, on with the rest of the controller....I'm the type of person that can adapt very well when it comes to gaming.  I can go from a PS3 controller, to an Xbox 360 controller, and even to keyboard/mouse on the PC, with little problems.  So I really have no clear, \"I only prefer this, period\" preference.  I WILL say that I like the PS3's controller for its d-pad and responsiveness, along with the convex analog sticks, which feel a bit more accurate to me than the 360's concave analog sticks.  However, the 360 wins when it comes to the triggers (obviously), and the size.  If you have fairly big hands, the 360 controller is superior.  My pinky fingers will hang off the PS3 controller, but that isn't a problem with this one.Simply put, it works, it feels great, the buttons are very responsive, they don't hurt to push down, and the D-Pad is FINALLY useable.  Great job, Microsoft.  You did something right this time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2011"}

The Rock looks exactly like The Rock. Everyone in the game looks exactly like they do in real life. There is no excessive shining on the wrestlers like there is in the newer Smackdown VS Raw games. One complaint I have is that Triple H looks horrendous. THQ can never seem to accurately model Triple H. This is a big step up from Shut Your Mouth, which looks fairly bad as far as graphics are concerned. Also, to top it all off, there is barely any loading time.There are very few graphical glitches in the game, but they don't really affect your gameplay. If you do a move to someone on a table, but you fall off before the move is executed, you will find your opponent still having the move to him in mid-air. This is minor and everything is fine after the move is finished.Created wrestlers still look fairly bad. With the right amount of time and a good online guide, you can recreate just about anyone. If you are the type of person that hates spending hours trying to adjust little, tiny details, you will end up will an average looking CAW (Create-A-Wrestler) with not much about him/her.The moves and animations all look stunning. Nothing seems unrealistic or too bland. This is wonderful considering the sheer amount of animations the have in this game. If your character wants to do a chokeslam, there are multiple different animations of that move for you to use. This allows you to have varied CAWs.Story- 9/10Story mode in recent WWE games have been considered interesting, but not worth playing though more than once. This game was before voice-over was put into WWE's games, so you will not be trapped into and linear storylines. There are storylines, but any wrestler can be apart of them, not just the ones that have Voice Over for it.There are some extremely interesting storylines that you will play though during Season mode. You may have a manager of your choosing and someone is trying to steal her from you. You may be working for Mr. McMahon, or you might choose to oppose him. You might just be going for the Tag Team Titles. It really depends on where your character is on the card.There are no limits as to where a wrestler can be on a card either. If you want to play as Ultimo Dragon and win the World Championship, it is possible. If you want Lesnar to go for the Hardcore Title, go right on ahead. The storyline is very flexible, but there is just enough of it to keep you playing over and over again.Sound- 8/10There is no voice over in this game at all. So don't expect commentary or your favorite superstars to speak their mind. There is no licensed music in the game either. I personally am glad, because those songs get repetitive and commentary is usually lackluster. Instead you have a techno/rock/rap remix type soundtrack through the game. It is nice on the ears and isn't repetitious.In-game sound effects all sound decent. The Big Show's Chokeslam still have a slamming sound before the opponent is even slammed. Most of the other sounds in the game are done realistically.Gameplay- 10/10Usually this is all that matters in making a game good or bad, the gameplay. Here Comes the Pain has created the perfect arcade wrestling style game. Matches are fast-paced and full of exciting moments. A new grappling system has been created just for this game and it works to perfection. Instead of only being able to do 4 moves, your character can use 16 moves now.The roster in this game is the best in years. You have favorites like Brock Lesnar, Goldberg, Triple H, The Rock, Steve Austin, and many more. Then you have tons of smaller level superstars like: Matt Hardy, Ultimo Dragon, Rhyno, Test, and many more. Also, after gaining them through Season mode, you will gain Legends like: Roddy Piper, Road Warriors, Ted Dibiase, and again you will get many more. This is one of the most balanced rosters you can find. It doesn't matter what type of wrestler you like because they are all here.Match types are vast as they are in all WWE games. This is the first time that the Elimination Chamber match is playable though, and boy is it fun. You get all your normal cage matches, Last Man Standing matches, and other WWE matches. You also get to play the new Bra and Panties match, which is fun for a play or two. These matches will allow up to six players at the maximum. This creates a ton of multi-player goodness.Season mode is very well done. You can choose who you want in Season mode, and you can choose what Roster everyone is one. This means you can actually make Brock Lesnar and Triple H on the same roster finally. You don't always have a storyline in Season mode. Sometimes you can just drop by the General Manager's office and pick up a title shot assuming your Superstar Points are high enough. This is very fun and enjoyable.The game's AI is nearly perfect. I have only noticed a few glitches in cage match and ladder matches; they will sometimes just sit and watch you win the match. This rarely happens though, and they are usually wonderful.Difficulty- 9/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty)The game itself is not that hard when it's on normal mode. You won't dominate everyone, but it's pretty easy to not lose. On the other hand, Legendary difficulty is extremely hard. Superstars will reverse almost every single move you do until they finally hit their finisher and win the match. It takes a ton of practice to even get close to being good enough to win a match on Legendary.Brock Lesnar, who happens to be the game's cover boy, is probably the hardest wrestler to beat on the game. He dominates nearly everyone in his path within a matter of a few moves. When you think about it though, you can always play as him and dominate if you want. He's be a good choice for your first play through.Overall- 9.5/10This is my favorite WWE game, and I've played No Mercy. Nothing can touch the gameplay mechanics and the sheer fun of changing around your rosters in Season mode. If you haven't experienced this game yet, I suggest you give it a try.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2008"}

For my taste, it has far too great of a cartoonishness to it, which severely limits the potential for it to be as violent and cutthroat as... well, \"Cutthroats\".  There's no throatcutting in this one---just a swing on a rope, a HAHA!, and a smirk as the enemy shakes his fist and goes \"OOOH YOUUU!\"The campaigns as well follow an utterly ridiculous task of \"Find Baron Montalbon\" or whatever his name is, whom you defeat in battle and he gives you ONE PIECE of a multi-piece map to find a family member of yours.  THEN you must track him down AGAIN (because you're apparently too stupid to have him tell you EVERYTHING then kill him) to get ANOTHER piece of that one map.  Once you have all the pieces, you rescue your family member, never see them again, and have to hunt down THE SAME PERSON AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR MORE MAP PIECES for family members ranging from Aunts, Sisters, Fathers, Mothers, etcetera.Then there's ridiculous quests involving lost cities and hunting down famous pirates from history all just smashed together in whatever year you pick.  Despite supposedly gaining \"infamy\" for killing these famous pirates, you don't get anything except the number 1 slot on most famous pirates, and a lot of money.A surprising feature which seems to severely limit my actions is that as soon as you start to gain successes, commanding multiple ships with a hundred or more men and lots of gold, morale starts going down the crapper at breakneck speed, to a point where even getting vast amounts of gold can't solve it---your best result is to either kill them off in pitched battles, or retire for a short while.  This eats away a few years of your life before you return with a smaller crew and smaller ship.About the only aspects of gameplay which are always entertaining are ship battles and turn-based, grid-based land battles.  Ship battles are real time, involving simultaneous use of steering and sluggish firing to break down your enemy's ship and either destroy it, or board and force a surrender or fight it out on deck, where surprisingly your forces always seem to die quicker than the enemy's, no matter what.  Land battles are particularly fun in execution and strategy.But these are very, very small aspects of a broader game, which most of the time is spent sailing (and the wind almost always blows in one direction for months endlessly, making sailing take a LOT of gametime) and visiting cities to do the exact same dreck---get a few minor upgrades to your ships, sell some cargo, visit the tavern to recruit some random bandits, speak to a cloned barmaid about whatever (usually she doesn't give you anything important, just \"ooh you so scary you is numba 1 pirate in the evar\", or talk to some random guy in a corner offering valuable things like jewelry or maps or information).Then there's DANCING!  Every major town has a governor who has a daughter, who comes in three formats: \"Plain\", \"Attractive\", \"Beautiful\".  Every time you visit, you do a little Olde English dance to Baroque harpsichord music, and you must press buttons properly in sequence or trip over your own clownshoes.  She basically falls in love with you based on your dancing, giving her stuff, and killing her suitors.  I haven't yet discovered if this has any relevance to the overall gameplay at all or is just an excuse to add another minigame into it complete with more cleavage.Once you've reached an old age and are too sick to pirate (it will always be sickness that forces you to retire), you cannot continue on with your character.  But really, you wouldn't want to.  New games, no matter if you start in 1620, 1640, 1660, or 1680, are exactly the same as one another, with the exact same quests, games, technology, and pirates.  This is a dumbed-down, kiddie-friendly version of historical piracy in the Carribean, and as such you don't get to \"live the life\" of a REAL pirate, complete with kidnapping, butchering people, scurvy, ransoming people for medical supplies (actual event: Blackbeard ransomed people for medicine), sex, drinking (Black Bart Roberts died because his ship was ambushed while his men were all drunk), etcetera.Even Pirates of the Carribean was more violent and realistic than this game.Being that they are of the same genre, I have to compare Cutthroats with Pirates.  In Cutthroats, you can invade cities with massive armies of your men, including with cannons taken off your ship, have townspeople try to fight you off, then surrender and you can take them prisoner or execute them (including women and children), you have to keep your ship supplied not only with food but with gunpowder for the cannons, accessories like sugar and rum and tobacco for the men's morale, you have to buy guns and grenades and pistols if you want to arm your men for personal combat, lifeboats if you want your men to survive when the ship sinks, and wait in harbor for your ship to be repaired if damaged.In Pirates, all you need is food and cannons.  Everything else is provided, and repairs are done instantaneously.  While landbattles are fun, they are only more fun than in \"Cutthroats\" because in \"Cutthroats\", the map is huge, and your men move at a snail's pace quite literally.  There's no murdering, raping, pillaging, or anything that was synonymous with pirates.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2008"}

It has undergone a nice visual upgrade, here, and remains a solid game. More old school classics deserve this sort of treatment!The Assault on Dark Athena chapter is serviceable, but does have a couple of pacing and gameplay issues that are disappointing.  Without giving too much away, there is a planetside section that has beautiful scenery, but also has repetitive bad guys in spades, after which there are some boss battles that aren't very challenging...  this means the last hour or two is just grinding away at the game, which is too bad, because the initial run through the ship is pretty satisfying as a sci-fi noir beat em up.Where this game shines in the overall is that it's a solid return of a good franchise, a great character - if you are a Riddick fan, then I recommend this as a nice addition to the series.But the price? Top dollar for new seems a bit much to ask for a 5 year old Redux of a great 10 hour game, with another good, but not great 10 hour game added in to the purchase...I think a better deal for everyone would be by releasing EFBB as a Playstation Network download and Dark Athena as Add-On content (because that's what it is).

Nintendo's fans (and even some fans of those \"other\" video gaming consoles) have waited 8 long years for the next installment of the Metroid series, having been tantalized in 1995 with the stunning (for the time) graphics and gameplay of Super Metroid on the 16-bit SNES console.  Nintendo picked Retro Studios to produce the next installment in the series, which -- in a move that surprised many longtime fans -- was to be completely 3D, and played from a first-person perspective.  What was this?  Heresy!  A Metroid game not in 2D?  How could they do it?Very carefully.Someone at Nintendo had clearly read the writing on the wall, as Metroid Prime is probably the best game on the 'Cube right now, and also one of the best games on *any* next-gen system.  It's that good.  The gameplay, graphics, and, well, *everything* have been polished to a mirror sheen by the fine folks at Retro (literally; one of the cooler visual effects in the game causes your character's face to reflect on the visor in front of you when bright explosions go off nearby).  The game moves slowly at first, as you explore a recently abandoned research frigate, but eventually picks up steam, and becomes downright frantic near the end, as you face several long, difficult stretches filled with enemies, and a series of climactic boss fights.  However, the level of difficulty remains fairly low, as long as you devote some time to exploring the game world and searching out energy tanks and missile expansions.  Also, the difficulty in the boss fights comes mostly from discovering the particular tricks you should use to fight them, not from the actual gameplay.There are only a few minor points on which Metroid Prime can be faulted.First, this style of game is not for everyone.  Despite initial appearances, this is *not* a traditional First-Person Shooter game (a la DOOM, Quake, or Halo).  The pacing is (deliberately) slower, the combat more strategic and less about pointing the biggest gun you can find at the enemies and holding down the trigger.  Most of your time is spent exploring the nooks and crannies of Tallon IV, discovering hidden powerups and new abilities, and gradually uncovering the plot of the game (done, IMO very tastefully, by reading computer data logs and messages left inscribed on various archeological ruins scattered around the planet).Second, the controls will throw off some players who are used to \"standard\" console FPS controls (ie, using one stick to move and strafe, and another to control your viewpoint).  Metroid Prime reverts to the \"Goldeneye\" system where the left analog stick controls turning and forward/reverse movement, and you have to hold the R trigger to look up or down.  Aiming is taken care of by an auto-lock system (similar to that in the N64/GCN Zelda games), but some will find the control scheme limiting.  I think it fits the game perfectly.Finally, there are a few actual bugs in the game, one of which can cause it to occasionally crash (however, the general abundance of save points makes this less heinous, as long as you save often), and another which can make it impossible to complete the game (though only if you fail to pick up a key item when it is *very* clearly presented to you after defeating one of the later bosses).Seriously, if I could give the game 6/5 stars, I probably would.  It's that good.  If you own a cube, buy it.  If you don't own a cube, get one while you can still get MP bundled with it for free.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-10-2003"}

{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Lethal","summary":"Uncharted: Now with 90% less story","reviewText":"I loved the original Uncharted and considered it the best PS3 game around.  Then its successor managed to be much better, a game I've beaten several times and still have on my shelf.  Tragically, Uncharted 3 comes off like a lazy cash grab, with minimal storytelling, a bad melee system added to the game engine, and graphics that are showing their age.The best part of this series for me has been the characters, but we get far too little of them here.  Chloe's role is so small it's like she's only there so they could say she's back.  She waits in the van in the early stage, never utters a meaningful word of dialogue, and is absent for the majority of the game.Elena Fisher is one of the most likable women in gaming history, but doesn't even show up until half way through.  She and Drake are separated, but absolutely no explanation is ever offered.  It's implied that they are engaged or married, but never spoken of.Most of the game focuses on the bond between Nate and Sully, the one character who's in all his glory.  However, Sully demonstrates the athleticism of a pro athlete half his age, since he's at Drake's side for most of the game, making leaps that defy physics.Speaking of leaps, I died many times when I was unsure where to go and tried a jump that seemed just as plausible as ones Drake had made, only to plunge to my death.  Throughout the game it's unclear when you're in a cut-scene and when you're in control, leading to more needless deaths as I said \"Wait, I was supposed to act there?\", and mashing buttons during cut-scenes just in case.  There are also multiple sequences where Drake is in an altered state, like in Max Payne or the last stage of God of War 3.  I hate that effect, so I just had to soldier through.Ultimately, I felt like I was soldiering through most of this game.  Really Drake, you couldn't sense that the moment you collect an important artifact from a tomb would be when the bad guys walk in and take it from you?  The platforming and shootouts are all far too familiar, with nothing fresh added at all.  Don't even get me started about the inexplicably convenient hand-holds for climbing no matter where he's at.Remember the part in Jurassic Park 2 when they're in a bus on the edge of a cliff, and they fall repeatedly but manage to grasp something to stop their plunge?  This game contains numerous moments where Drake's survival is SO implausible that it hurt my head.  Of course this is a guy who gets stranded in the desert for several days but still Rambo's his way through another horde of bad guys before getting water or rest.  Of course that doesn't stop the bad guys from acting like a James Bond villain and passing on numerous chances to kill him or make sure he's really dead this time.The new melee system seems like an attempt to rip off the Batman combat system, but is shallow and poorly conceived.  You'll have to use it anyway, since it's forced on you sometimes, while other times an enemy is within ten feet of you which makes it nearly impossible to aim at him.For those who played Prince of Persia Warrior Within and gasped over it being ruined with machismo compared to Sands of Time, that's roughly what Naughty Dog did here.  Lots of action, with the core elements being cast away.  This game is perfect for a teen with zero interest in character development or context.  Even the motive for Drake's entire adventure is vague until the end, but he eagerly faces and kills hundreds for reasons unknown.  Elena and Sully each question him there, but ultimately shrug off his willingness to kill, motivated only by curiosity and a need to prove something.At one point it appeared that a main character would die, and I rolled my eyes, certain they wouldn't.  Considering that I was near tears when Elena was shot in Uncharted 2, that's a staggering failure to connect me with the story.Buy Batman: Arkham City or whatever other big title you want and wait for this to hit the bargain bin.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2011"}
{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"MikeB \"Metalhead\"","summary":"Great graphics, flawed controls","reviewText":"Uncharted 3 has the highest production value of any video game I've ever seen.  That doesn't mean it's flawless, but it is quite impressive.First, the good:  Uncharted 3 has hands-down the best graphics of any PS3 game ever.  There's so much detail crammed into every texture it's near photo-realistic.  The animation is superb, especially on human characters; the way they run, climb, take cover, and everything looks very realistic.  Facial animation is noteworthy, because so few games get it right, but Uncharted 3 not only gets it right, but does it perfect.  There are even little details like the clothing, which is affected by water, wind, and movement, adding even the littlest touches to make everything feel as real as possible.  The attention to detail in the graphics and animation is nothing short of astounding.The levels are also very well done.  Uncharted 3 takes you around the globe to see many interesting foriegn lands.  Each new location has it's own personality and is full of character.  There were many times I stopped just to take in the sights like a tourist.  But you can't stop for too long, because this game is action packed!  You're constantly running, jumping, climbing, shooting, and doing all sorts of crazy acrobatics as hundreds of bad guys try to kill you in numerious ways.  You'll fight in a burning castle that is collapsing around you, flee from enormous swarms of giant spiders, even duke it out in airborn plane that is torn apart mid-flight.  It's all very excting stuff, and you'll feel like you're inside a big budget action movie.The music, sound effects and voice acting are also top-notch.  The music is probably the best I've heard since Skyrim, and deserves an award.  The voice acting is also great, and all of the actors make the characters come alive.Now, the bad:  As great as graphics and stuff are, I like to PLAY video games, not WATCH them.  Now, I don't mean that I don't like cut scenes.  I do.  I actually liked Final Fantasy XIII because I wanted to see some wild cinematics, and Uncharted 3 also has some really wild cinematics, too.  But unfortunately the gameplay is so scripted and linear, I felt less like I was playing, and more like I was watching the game unfold as I held the control stick right.  I know this isn't an open world game, but it's so restrictive that it became annoying at times.  Also, the controls are a little wonky.  If you're moving Drake in a direction, and then change direction or stop, Drake doesn't follow your control stick movements precisely.  Instead he'll make wide turns or take a few short steps before coming to a complete stop.  This can be frustraing for moments where you have to be standing in exactly the right spot before the Triangle button command appears in the corner, allowing you to move that object that's blocking your way.  It's also frustraing when the Circle button is both \"dodge\" and \"drop down ledge\", because sometimes you'll be standing at the edge of a wall, press Circle to drop safely down, and instead Drake will go lunging off the side and die.  This isn't helped by objects sometimes being climbable, and sometimes not.  I've had numerous deaths because I though I could jump and grab the ledge of an object that looks like something I should be able to climb, and then Drake just bounces off of it and falls to his death.  And speaking of falling to your death, there was no consistant distance that would kill you.  Sometimes a drop of 15 feet would be enough to end Drake's life, then other times I'd be looking for the path they (the programmers) wanted me to take and see a drop of 100 feet, and I'd think, \"That fall will kill me for sure\", then after spending 20 minutes trying to find an alternate path, I'd go back to that 100 foot drop, take a leap of faith and whadda ya know! Drake didn't die!  15 feet: Dead.  100 feet: Okay!  There's nothing worse than dying in a game, not because you screwed up, but because the rules changed without warning.Another annoyance was that sometimes a cutscene will lead into gameplay without warning, and you won't know that the game expects you to take control now, and then some guy will punch you out a window or run you over with a truck, and then you'll have to start over because you didn't know you were expected to do something.  There should have been a warning or signal telling you that you're in control suddenly.I also found gun fights to be a little difficult.  In Uncharted 3, as with the other two games, aiming is imprecise and can make extensive gun fights a chore.  There were times when you could sneak around to avoid gun fights, but I also found sneaking to be difficult.  One or two enemies, no problem, but three or more and it was impossible not to be detected.Overall, I liked Uncharted 3.  The graphics, animation, story (sorry I didn't touch on that... it was good), acting, and music were all good.  The action was non-stop and thrilling.  Unfortunately, sometimes my enjoyment of these things would be interrupted by awkward character movement, inconsistant platforming rules, and tedious shoot-outs.  I'm not saying you shouldn't buy this game.  It's really good, and if you enjoyed the previous Uncharted games, this one won't dissapoint.  I'm just a little frustrated that the wrinkles in the previous games weren't ironed out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2012"}

I hadn't played Halo 3 in months because I was bored with it. There's a lot of content here and I'm glad to say this game is worth every penny of $60 and I've been very entertained. Yes, it's still Halo and \"more of the same\", but they've changed enough about it to make a new Halo experience, not just another rehash. ODST was a joke of a game compared to Reach and having owned it almost made me skip out on Reach.The campaign spoilers will go at the bottom of the review.I'll put in some of the major stuff I've noticed but I'm sure I'll miss a lot.There's a new graphics engine and the graphics in the game are superior to any other 4 player split screen game I've played, and I make a special effort to purchase as many of them as I can. The graphics are certainly not Killzone 2 level, but very high quality. MUCH better than Halo 3. I was very pleased when I played the BETA that the new engine still plays in HD when doing split-screen and that it's split horizontally. The blood and shield effects are very well done. You have a night vision mode instead of a flashlight now, similar to ODST. The sound effects are pretty darn good. They finally made the sound of a grenade somewhat deafening. The music, as usual, is very well done and adds a lot to the experience.The new engineering packs have really added to the game and are what really makes Reach a different experience. Your options that you'll find in the campaign are sprint, hologram, bubble shield(that also heals you), cloaking that doesn't work well if you're moving quickly, what I'd call an ostrich or turtle shield that turns you invincible but immobile and unable to attack and a jetpack. My personal favorites are the bubble shield and the hologram. The Covenant have a roll instead of a sprint in multiplayer.The enemies are much more mobile and capable of dodging than they were in the past. I beat it on heroic and found the game to be more difficult than the past games, but certainly manageable. The Covenant have engineering packs too. They use the roll very well. There are a couple of new enemies/variations that make the game a little more diverse, but for the most part you've encountered most of them before.There are new weapons. There is no dual wielding. Both factions have weapons that are very similar now, I suppose it made balancing the game easy. All the weapons seem more effective than they were in the past (probably explains why there is no dual-wielding). The particle beam gun is pretty neat as is the covenant grenade launcher. The rocket launcher can lock onto vehicles. There are some of the old goodies, but there's a new covenant needler battle rifle, a covenant multi-lock plasma/rocket launcher and a couple of other new guns. The battle rifle is single fire instead of burst. There's the awesome pistol from the original Halo. There are two animations in how you melee something when you're holding a weapon. You can also backstab/knife someone now and it shows a little cinematic of you letting them have it instead of them just dying in with an ordinary hit.There's a health-bar under your shields like HALO 1. There's no red screen when you're injured either, just a red bar. This is a huge plus for me. It's the perfect system.Customizable characters are a great addition. You get credits for every kill you make, and you can use those credits to make your character look different. New helmets, new kneepads, new add-ons etc. It's a great way to make people feel like they have a real in-game Avatar. As far as I know there are no benefits combat-wise to having new armor, it's just visual. This is how I like it. In Call of Duty games you have to play the game for quite a while to unlock all the weapons and upgrades and it gives experienced players an unfair advantage online. In Reach you should always have a level playing field, you'll just look spiffy if you play a lot. Your customized appearance is in the campaign and multi-player, even the cutscense as they're rendered.Vehicles. The ghost has been nerfed. It was my favorite vehicle. I got a 27 kill spree on one in Halo 3 so I'm disappointed. The invincibility power ruins running people over. The guns on it are not all that effective either. There's a mini wraith vehicle that is pretty awesome, it can carry other people too. There's a missile launcher mounted to a Warthog also. The humans have the VTOL aircraft with side gunners again.Multiplayer is where this game really shines. No games does online split screen shooter as well has HALO. The engineering packs/loadouts add a new dimension to the game. Sprint and roll makes the game much faster than it used to be. Not every game mode makes use of the loadouts so if you're a purist you've still got options. Some of the packs don't seem too effective on some game types but sometimes it's fun to just mess around. There's an invasion mode where you play Covenant VS NSDF and try and capture objectives. It's a lot of fun and a great new challenge. There are 3 more classes available with different engineering packs. I also played some firefight (like ODST, but with some new modes) and it was great fun. You can put a human player on the covenant side to make it even more challenging.HUGE NEGATIVE: No 4 player split screen in Big Team Battle, the Campaign, or Firefight. I expected this for the last two, but Big Team Battle has always had this option. 3 or 4 players split-screen Big Team Battle was what I'd do 90% of the time I've ever played Halo. It probably didn't run very well with the new engine, and that's unfortunate. Taking this away from the game took away A LOT of value for me. I should remove a star but there are still a variety of other options for you to play. I still think the game deserves 5 stars but the loss of 4 player split screen Big Team Battle really hurts the game's playability as a \"party game\".Negative: DLC. I was a fan of DLC until Bungie/MSFT disabled some game modes on my original copy of Halo 3 because I didn't want to buy their overpriced map packs. That's shameful. Charging $5+ for 3 maps is shameful. This game might be great now but once they release a couple of map packs the price of playing the full game goes up and up and up. If I lose game modes I'm dropping this review to 1 star. Matchmaking doesn't have much variety. There are more maps than what the playlist is using over and over. Of course the game could use some more maps but I'm not willing to pay much for more of them considering how easy it is for them to make a map with the included editor. Many of the multiplayer maps are in the campaign anyways.Negative: The double punch in multiplayer, it's not as easy as it was in the beta but it's still how you'll die about half the time. I actually like it but I know it'll annoy a lot of people as sometimes not firing your gun at all is the best strategy.Negative: Matchmaking still doesn't work perfectly, but the option to vote for different game types/modes makes it a lot more enjoyable.Negative: In invasion mode the humans seem to win the majority of the time. This may or may not be because of their weapons loadout. The assault rifle is easier to use as the shots hit instantaneously and you don't have to lead your target like you would with the plasma gun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2011"}

The combat system I also felt was very good and easy for this game as again while I haven't played the newer FF games so I can't really compare those with this one it still was very engaging to play the fight scenes with relative ease.  The astounding thing I've seen with this game as well was the animation and graphics probably one of the best out there so far on equal with the Uncharted details(Yes as you can see I am a big fan of the Uncharted games), and also the voice cast for the characters were great very nicely done and perfect for their roles.

{"product_name":"B006P5RW3M","description":"","reviewerName":"Nanohead \"nanohead\"","summary":"A remarkable achievment, with some glaring painful issues","reviewText":"I loved the Witcher, and looked forward to Witcher 2.  I pre ordered last year, and played through the game.  I chose Roche the first time, and it was a great game, albeit not particularly balanced in the beginning.  It was pretty difficult initially, and after you level up, it becomes a bit easier to deal with, but its never quite straight forward.The story is EPIC, most likely one of the deepest, nuanced, and complex stories ever told by the Video Game art form.  There have been some great story driven games (Bioshock comes to mind), but Witcher and Witcher 2 especially are just remarkable.  The choices you make matter, and the game can be replayed over and over again with different results (if you have the patience)Witcher 1 had a novel swordplay mechanism, where timing and controls had to be very coordinated.  It was a bit tough to get used to, but once past it, it became truly clever, easy and addictive.  Witcher 2 refines that approach, but also complicates it, by changing some fundamental dynamics in the way swordplay is accomplished.  I find it less satisfying than Witcher 1, but still basically good.Potions are an area where CD Projekt took a painful step backwards.  Potions are an integral part of the game, and in Witcher 2, potions MUST be consumed BEFORE a fight, so you sometimes have to go backwards several saves, just in order to take potions.  This is by no means the end of the world, but it makes it somewhat annoying, when you stumble into an ambush, and just start dying over and over and over again.Gameplay is mostly good, however, there is NO fast travel, which means you wander around aimlessly quite often.  That, combined with an awkward map system, make it draining to look for quest locations sometimes, as there is simply NO WAY to know where you need to go.  Kind of dumb actually, and it didn't need to be that way.  It appears that if you read certain books, then some portions of the map activate, although I cannot confirm this, because it seemed to be pretty inconsistent.NOW FOR THE BAD.Most video games have their own subtle twist on controls, saves, and combat.  However, Witcher 2 does a few things which make it extraordinarly frustrating at times, and caused me to just walk away from it for days at a time.1) Trapped Boss Battles:  I generally hate boss battles, because they waste time, disrupt the story, and are usually just annoying. When there's some super tight secret to beating a boss, it can be more annoying.  Witcher 2 bosses are not that difficult in general, but they are some of the most frustrating boss battles in video games.  In certain cases, many controls are disabled (dodging, potions, saves, etc), and to add insult to injury, you are TRAPPED, with nowhere to hide, or regain health.  So you just have to spend tons of time finding the exact combination of moves, etc.  It is horrible in many cases.  You can dose up on potions ahead of time, but when the battle comes, the potions are no longer there, and you can't do anything except die, over and over and over and over.2) Disabled controls when you need them most:  There are numerous portions of the game, where important controls are disabled (dodging, saves, etc), which causes you to have to replay those sections a zillion times in order to figure out a new set of control constraints.  I just hate this.  You invest massive amounts of time trying to master a set of controls to play a game, so you can enjoy it, and every so often, the controls completely change to something completely different.  Just terrible3) Massively confusing character management:  Witcher 1 was pretty straight forward.  You could just do stuff....  Witcher 2, has tons of things that are totally and needlessly complex.  I still haven't figured out how to use mutagens at all.  Selecting specific ingredients for potions is massively annoying and confusing.  Character building trees and simply bizzare, where you have to make choices you really don't want or need.4) Disabled Saves and many other features at random times:  Sometimes, you'll be wandering around, and the music will start going into battle mode and saves, potions and other features are disabled.  But there're no enemies around.  And you are locked out from many actions, from meditation, to potion creation, to character development.  Makes NO sense.5) Finally, inconsistent control response.  I could probably live with most issues, but this one is just a sin.  There are many times where no matter which keyboard or mouse button you push, nothing happens.  So you die, and die, and die, over and over and over and over.  Just a PITA.  I just don't understand what the problem is here.There are plenty of other warts on this otherwise remarkable piece of entertainment software.  The enhanced version is very refined, I had no real bugs or crashes (on a massively overclocked CPU/GPU machine w Windows 7 64bit).  Other than painful boss battles (where I sighed after a while when a boss appears), and just bizzare controls, the game is fantastic.  For me, I had to take breaks once in a while, as the game was exhausting from the control, map and navigation problems.  But all in all, a terrific game","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2012"}

I remember when I used to be really excited for this one. After seeing a picture of a supersized Mario running through a field of Koopas, I had to get it. However, it kept being delayed....And then when it finally came out, I got it, and I wasn't disappointed.Those that have played the original Super Mario Bros series (as well as Super Mario World) know what to expect. Classic 2D Goomba-stomping block-breaking action throughout all-new levels. This is something we haven't seen since Super Mario World (Although there have been remakes and stuff), so it is pretty cool getting fresh 2D Super Mario action once again. What's also great is that the gameplay still remains to be good fun, and with all these new levels, as well as some other elements mixed in, it just makes it even better.One downside is that while the minigames were a nice touch, but they were mostly recycled from Super Mario 64 DS. I guess it's okay for those that don't own Mario 64 DS, but those expecting new minigames will be disappointed.However, 4-Player multiplayer makes the minigames fresh again! Meanwhile, you can also play with a friend in a Versus mode in while Mario and Luigi compete and find Stars around 5 levels. That is pretty fun, actually, especially when getting to use the power-ups to sabotage the other player.Overall, this is a pretty great adventure that does the original SMB series justice. Let's just hope New Super Mario Bros 2 does something clever with its coin gimmick...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2010"}

Also, the idea of making a cartoonish adventure somewhat nonlinear is poorly executed in it.I didn't play far enough to see if Donkey Kong corrected any of this, but it looks like it didn't.

Raillard","summary":"More Star Wars goodness, though not perfect","reviewText":"I mostly agree with those reviewers who criticize this game for being very good yet not quite up to the first KOTOR.  This may be the case, but I still feel that to give this game 3 stars while saying it's a great game is a back-handed compliment.  In my opinion, the rating scale is absolute, and not relative, meaning that if I have a great time playing a game, it will get high marks, regardless of whether it lived up to the hype or not.  Yes, the first KOTOR was a phenomenal game, but so is this one!  I wonder if the roles were reversed and KOTOR I were the sequel, wouldn't people have the same criticism?The Good: Terrific gameplay, engrossing storyline (no less believable or entertaining or deep than the first; the jury seems to be out on who prefers which.  I liked the first better, but I suspect it had something to do, again, with novelty and a Star Wars game not stinking for the first time in human history).  The world is believable, the characters are fun and deeper than most hollywood movies (certainly than the last 2 Star Wars flicks), and most importantly, you CARE about your character.  I genuinely agonized over certain decision because of the possible repercussions.  Also, this game has two great value incentives: long gameplay time (40 hours or so) and great replay value (I'm planning on completing it on Dark Side next).  The new tweaks (create and breakdown raw items, modified force powers) are nice and generally well-implemented.The Bad:  The graphics are terribly outdated.  The Neverwinter Nights graphics engine on which this is based is some 5 years old, and it shows.  Compared to what is being done out there in terms of visuals (Half Life 2 anyone) or even just on the Xbox (Halo 2, of course, but also Splinter Cell), this franchise is due for a facelift.  They added weather effects, which are nice, but actually have little impact in gameplay atmosphere.The Ugly:  Some of the effects actually slow down the framerate below acceptable levels.  It's too bad, because they can be gorgeous.  The loading is also on the long side, though I've seen longer.  It'd be nice if the loading were related to lots of high resolution graphics, but alas that is not the case.Bottom Line: This is a phenomenal game, with an addictive blend of RPG and action/adventure driving a solid, well-written and well-acted storyline.  I know people who prefer KOTOR I to this one, but I also know some who prefer this second version to the first.  You be the judge.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2005"}

I seriously thought my game crashed because everything froze during combat and i couldnt do jack until the framerate got better.- Loading times are horrendous sometimes.  Races are the worst.- AI is more than dumb.  Sometimes while fighting, my 2 partners would just stand around with thumbs in their butts not doing anything.  Also, they frequently get stuck on eachother and stuck on walls, etc.  It's so annoying.  One more problem with my teammates AI...if there are mines in front of enemies they will charge right through the mines like they never saw them and then attack the enemy on the other side, thus taking heavy damage.  How dumb is that???Those are pretty much the only bugs in the game but they can be very frustrating.  I guess if there are positive things about this game they are...- Powerful force powers (force lightning rips through everything).- Playing the dark side always kicks butt.  Getting to beat down innocent civilians is fun stuff (i wish you could kill every npc in the game.  that would be cool)When all said and done this is a good star wars game that is plagued with bugs.  if you loved the first, you won't love this one...you'll probably just like it.  i always hated starwars games' storylines and this game doesn't get better with it.  still a pretty good game though.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2005"}
{"product_name":"B002I08VXI","description":"","reviewerName":"ChrisInCali","summary":"One of the worst Nintendo made games in years.","reviewText":"Steel Diver is a big departure from what you'd expect in a game made by Nintendo. The company that has made so many games with an emphasis on accessibility has taken a sharp turn in the opposite direction, and that shift is not for the better. This side-scrolling submarine game walks the line between simulation and action, with compromises on both sides leading to a flat experience. Fiddling with the various sliders required to pilot your underwater craft demands the steady hand of an aspiring pilot, and there is momentary satisfaction when you successfully guide your submersible past a particularly nasty stretch. But punishment for making a mistake is so minimal that Steel Diver never taps into the pleasure zone that an actual simulation can call forth. On the other side of the coin, torpedo fights against enemy ships showcase the explosions you'd expect from an action game, but sluggish controls make lining up your shots too taxing to elicit much of a thrill. Steel Diver can't decide what it wants to be, and that ultimately leads to a disappointing launch game for Nintendo's 3DS.The story is mostly ignored in the game after the brief opening set-up.  Instead of focusing on what your motivation is, the game just expects you to stay interested in it's dull, repetitive, and brief experience. The seven missions that make up the bulk of Steel Diver can be beaten in 4-5 hours, and that's if you don't get too bored before then and just quit. The objective in every mission is the same: Get from the left side of the map to the right as quickly as possible.  The slow-reacting controls mean that fights take a while to play out. It takes a bit of fiddling to aim in the right direction, and because you withstand so much damage before you die, there's little fear while you line up your shots.Steel Diver never figures out if it wants to be a simulation or an action game, and that indecision leads to a yawn-inducing experience. Even worse, if you do get sucked into this adventure, there isn't much content in the $40 package. You can play through the seven missions in a few hours, and once you're done with that, there are a handful of time-trial missions but little else to occupy your time. The dull two-player mode certainly doesn't add much value, so you're stuck with a game that's over before you know it. The novelty of seeing an underwater world through the wonders of 3D is certainly fascinating for a little while, but once that excitement fades away, there's not much here to keep you engaged. Steel Diver sinks before it even has a chance to swim.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00003E4EB","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo-Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$110 recommended retail price for a console with two controllers, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Jack M.

{"product_name":"B000088KH9","description":"Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis the third in the successful mission-based stealth series that first appeared on the PlayStation in 1998; few changes have been made to the basic format. Players can once again choose to be either Rikimaru, the silent sword-wielding assassin, or Ayama, the acrobatic younger ninja. Both characters pass through the same game world, but each has slightly different goals that take them on different routes. A third character can be unlocked later on.During the first mission, you're required to choose a number of weapons to aid you in your immediate tasks. Throughout the game, more and more weapons--from melee to ranged weapons--are added to your arsenal depending on your performance during each level; your chosen weapons dictate how you approach the mission goals. The silent approach is always encouraged, and there's a variety of graphically satisfying stealth kills that will only work if you remain elusive and strike unexpectedly and silently.Aside from the stealth kills, the game is a mixed bag in terms of its graphics. Light shimmers off your sword menacingly, but the environments are bland and repetitive, and the game fails to maximize on differences between light and dark areas in ways that might have added to the experience. Also, the stealth dynamic is made less challenging by the shortsightedness and slow reactions of the enemy guards and the iffy AI. Since guards give up searching for you within seconds and are unable to follow you through doors, this potentially atmospheric and tactical stealth game is actually just a hack-and-slash arcade romp. Multiplayer options are included, though, so if you feel the need for a more realistic opponent, you may want to call a friend.Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis still an enjoyable experience despite its flaws. It&#x92;s just a shame that, after doing so much to establish and define the stealth-game genre, it fails to raise the bar or introduce any novel elements. The game feels more like an update of the first Tenchu, and while this is no bad thing, fans will probably be expecting more.--Chris Ryan, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"mdizzog","summary":"Tenchu: Wrath of various demons, soliders, wooden robots...","reviewText":"This game is hard.

Uncharted is that and more. I had a great time with this game, but not just because of the gameplay, the whole presentation is great. The voice acting is up there with the best I've heard. The characters sound very natural, not forced and stiff like some games. They also have some genuinely amusing dialouge and the male and female lead characters have pretty good chemistry. I beat this game in two days because the story is very good and plays like a movie, I wanted to see what happens next.The graphics are excellent. Like many others I stopped frequently to take in the beautiful sights and sounds. The cutscenes had a quality about them that was very surprising and innovative. The characters act very natural and relaxed, as realistic as I've seen in a video game. The gun play and cover system works very well and I actually looked forward to gunfights because they were a lot of fun (some people thought there were too many). The jumping, climbing and swinging parts were also fun thanks to solid control and realistic but forgiving physics. Naughty Dog (the developer) was smart not to make these jumps too hard because that just becomes tedious and frustrating, and they wanted to keep the story moving. Which is one of the reason the game is only about 8 to 12 hours long, it's more about the story and keeping it moving than fifty hours of complex gameplay. There are many unlockables that add some replay value, so I ended up playing for about 18 hours before I had to return it.Another thing I liked was the female character. She was very cute and smart, but not ridiculously beautiful with huge boobs. Don't get me wrong...etc. etc. But it was refreshing to see a more regular female character.I understand why people would complain about the game being too short, Sixty dollars is a lot to spend on a game that lasts two days. But in this case it didn't bother me, the length seemed just right (plus I rented it). There were some little flaws in this game: I thought looking around for hidden treasure was slightly more tedious than rewarding. Sometimes when you try to get cover by pressing the O button your character keeps jumping to the wrong wall and you get riddled with bullets. But these and any other flaws are so minor there really not worth mentioning.Anyone with a PS3 who hasn't played this game should put it at the top of their list, the chances are good they'll love it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2008"}

Meet interesting people! And kill them!","reviewText":"Ah, Renaissance Italy. A time of great development in theology, culture, art, legal codes and the like. Also, a great time to visit if what you really want to do is run along roof-tops and murder people.Yes, welcome to \"Assassin's Creed II\", the aptly named sequel to the original \"Assassin's Creed\". I haven't played that one, but I have played this one, and I gotta say, molto buono!The game features a lot of wonderful things; from the great eye-candy of places like 15th century Florence, to an engaging plot, excellent voice acting and a nice variety of missions.The story concerns young Enzio, an Italian lad from a reasonably well-off Florentine banking family. Bad Things wind up happening which force him to go on the run. He learns, from a variety of teachers, including a prostitute (?!), how to become an assassin so that he can get revenge against those who have wronged him! Along the way he picks up all sorts of new weapons, many of them assembled with the help of a young artist named Leonardo...The most fun part of the game for me is running along the rooftops, parkour-style. Rooftop-fighting can be interesting, if somewhat shorter than you might like at times, as your enemies have an annoying tendancy to fall to their deaths rather than letting you gack them.Also, be careful not to fall yourself! I fell off a very tall building at one point, but landed on a monk, so that was ok. My shoes weren't even damaged! He saved my sole.One slightly amusing thing: you can play the game in several different languages. For fun, I tried playing it in Italian with English subtitles. That worked and was pretty enjoyable, but you only get subtitles with the main dialogue, and not the street sounds. Bummer, that.I've not finished the game yet, but I've put in a fair amount of time. There's nothing in it I care to criticize (aside from that language thing I just mentioned, but that's so minor, who cares?). I won't say that it's perfect, because how can any game be?, but I will say that it's darn fine and one of the best examples of what video games can be when they really put forth the effort.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2009"}

Assassin's Creed II is one of those rare games, and also represents what a sequel should be.Assassin's Creed II boasts a wonderful enrapturing story that really grabs you both in a politic/historic/science fiction sense. Never have I seen the three mixed so well with an ending that can make your head spin for hours afterward and have you talking amongst your friends about for days. You are not Altair, but Ezio Auditore who is on a path of vengeance for the rival banking family that killed his. In the real world you are still Desmond Miles trying to unlock the secrets of his assassin ancestors, and figure out what the Apple of Eden is really meant to do and why everyone wants it.From the start you will notice major changes from the original and this being graphics. The game is truly one of the most beautiful of the decade capturing the Italian Renoconce era with all of its amazing architecture, historic figures, and language along with the social classes of the time, but before we talk more about beauty let's talk game play.As everyone recalls the first game was very repetitive and pretty bare bones so expect Assassin's Creed II to have tons of things to do. Not only are there more side missions, but there are more scripted story driven missions and playing a Desmond isn't so boring. You actually go to a different location with Desmond and even fight with him...just a hint without spoiling anything. You have your messenger, beat up, and race events from the previous game, but gone are the \"helping citizen\" events. You have tons more variations from raiding assassin tombs (interior Tomb Raider style levels), to Templar Lairs, races on horseback, assassination contracts, finding codex pages to upgrade your health, chasing down people stealing your money, chasing down messengers, solving glyph puzzles, finding statuettes, restoring your uncles villa, more viewpoints and the list goes on. Yeah there is more variety and because there is so much to do, and so many ways to do them you really never get bored because I never did.You can do ten side missions then three main missions then fast travel back to your uncle Mario's villa to upgrade the city to get more income for you to spend, then go find some feathers for your mother in mourning, then maybe get some codex pages.Doesn't sound like enough? That's ok the variations in story missions never get dull with all the weapon upgrades you get. You even get to use Leonardo di Vinci's flying machine about 2/3 of the way through the game.  Want to talk about upgrades? Well there is an economy system in play here, but don't get too excited. It's your simple buy stuff from merchants and upgrade your stuff type thing. You can upgrade your armor over a dozen times, buy dozens of weapons, upgrade medicine pouches, throwing knives, and even poison vials. You can dye your clothes, buy paintings to increase the value of your villa. Did I mention there are every assassin weapon in this game? You have smoke bombs, dual hidden blades/punch daggers, poison blade, hidden gun, and even a passive ability to toss money on the ground to distract guards.Fans of the original remember that the best attack was the running and jumping assassination attack. Wanted more? Well you get more with the ability to pull guys down from hanging on a ledge, from a hiding spot, on a bench, in a crowd, jumping off something, and any way you possibly can. You can now swim which is a huge plus, and blending has totally changed. Instead of having a \"blend\" button the previous \"blend\" button is now a \"walk fast\" button which can be used to pick pocket people for money by just running into them. Blending now consists of using any group of pedestrians or hiring people. You can hire courtesans, thieves, or mercenaries to do your dirty work or distract guards from important posts or patrols. This allows you to walk right on by to wherever you need to be. You can blend by sitting on benches, or dropping your notoriety. Your notoriety is the creed diamond that has a red bar around it. The higher it gets the more the guards will be on your case and chase you for subtler things. Ripping down posters or bribing heralds can bring it down, but becoming anonymous first is a must.Now that we have basic elements out of the way let's talk combat. The core combat system is here, but with upgrades, such as being able to counter a counter attack, take away weapons, use your hidden blade as a weapon for instant counter kills and so on. The enemy AI is also better with four enemy variants that can chase you down or kill you with their bulk and massive weapons.Free running is also slightly improved with tighter controls and better designed levels, more climbing puzzles (viewpoints), and just more terrain overall. The game really only gets frustrating when the controls get a bit sticky and you cling to well to ledges. The world is 3x the size of Assassin's Creed with the towns of Forli/Venice, Firenze, the Villa, and Roma. After about  through the game you get to ride a horse drawn wagon in a chase down a mountainside to get to Forli/Venice which is a rich cinematic experience which the game is full of. Once you get to Venice you can ride gondolas and swim in water.So with all this greatness and beauty that Assassin's Creed II gives us how does this soup taste? With all these ingredients I have to say it tastes damn good. Everything works well together and the game feels like a rich illustrious world that doesn't feel dead. With fluid combat, free running, plenty of stuff to do, amazing visuals, voice acting, history, and science fiction you get anywhere from 15-25 hours of wonderful game. This game will have you sitting back and savoring every moment, but not because of just how amazing it looks and sounds, but how beautiful the game is as a whole. These games come once in a decade and Assassin's Creed II is it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

I paid 31 bucks in January 2013. It worked fine on my PC running Windows XP Home SP3.This was my first Elder Scrolls game; it was recommended to me by a coworker.============================POSITIVES============================The graphics are very well done...it's a very beautiful game.The sound effects are good too.Key bindings are fine and configurable.============================NEGATIVES -- GAMEPLAY============================A lot of running around.Run/walk to one village, speak with someone, get some information, then run/walk to another village to do the same. The amount of running/walking adds boredom to the game. Some can be avoided by clicking on a place you have already visited and then selecting Fast Travel; then if the place you really want to go to is nearby, then you don't have to run so far.Dragon folklore = boringDragons speak English.Other characters talk to you, but you can't talk to them...you just read lines of text on-screen and click on what you want to say (but your character has no voice and can't speak).Repetitive dialogue. When you don't do exactly what you're supposed to do, then you have to listen to the dialogue again...and again. Use the enter key to fast-forward/advance through dialogue that you have already heard.Most people (bandits) that you encounter along trails want to kill you, and you have to kill them to continue (sometimes you can outrun them). I find myself killing a lot of people and animals without knowing why.  I just have to kill them to move forward in the game.Your sidekick (Sven) does not die.Fighting a dragon with bow/arrows is time-consuming (and seems silly--an animal that large would have very thick skin, and small arrows just wouldn't penetrate it).Battles with enemies are awkward, because you can't tell when you hit air or when you hit the enemy (most of the time it feels like you're just beating at the air).============================NEGATIVES -- GAME MECHANICS============================The sound is too low even when set to maximum in-game; this seems to be a known issue with the game; online help did not fix it.Dual cursors appear when you drop to Windows and come back to the game.  Very annoying.  I tried several \"fixes\" from help forums, but nothing worked. The only way to solve the problem is to restart the game.When you drop to Windows, you can't just ALT-TAB to go back to the game.  Instead you have to ALT-TAB, select the game, then ALT-TAB again and select some other window, then ALT-TAB again to the game.Music sometimes plays at the same time as dialogue, and that makes the dialogue difficult to understand.Characters sometimes talk at the same time, which makes their dialogue difficult to understand.Sometimes 2 characters are saying things to you, but they are too far away to hear both of them (i.e., they are separated, so you can only hear the person that is closest to you).The Skills screen is not intuitive, and it is not easy to navigate.On several missions, there are obscure things you need to do in order to proceed.  For example, when you need to use \"dragon call\" to spring a trap for the dragon named Odahviing, you need to do the shout from a balcony area instead of right from the main porch area.  Stuff like that is frustrating, and requires a walkthrough for help (but if you ALT-TAB to windows, then you get the double-cursor...another source of frustration).============================CONCLUSION============================The story and gameplay were mediocre. I found myself playing through the game just to see how it ended.The ending was also mediocre.  The bad dragon was killed.  That's it.  Then you go back to the land of Skyrim with no further objectives.Apparently, that is the end of the main quest.  There are more quests?  It wasn't obvious that the game had more quests. And frankly, I wouldn't care enough to continue with other quests in light of the game's negatives.  The story and characters just aren't compelling enough to me. I did not feel any connection to my character or the other characters in the game.I kept Skyrim after playing it, but I'm not sure if I will play it again. There are several other games that I would much rather replay than this one.Visit my Amazon Collections to see my 4-star and 5-star PC games:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customers/A12LH2100CKQO/collections","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2014"}

But Sorta Flawed...","reviewText":"The Elder Scrolls is my favorite Video Game Series of all time and Skyrim is the BEST in the Series!  But it's far from perfect.The Elder Scrolls series is the most versatile RPG system ever created.  When I play, if my character dies, I delete the saves, start over, and play an entirely different way.  So, if my Wood Elf Hunter, armed with a bow, and potions gets crushed by a wandering Giant, I create a Nord Blacksmith Berserker Werewolf armed with a Greatsword and fight to free Skyrim from the Iron Grip of the Empire.  If he dies, I can create a charming High Elf Mage with an arsenal of Magic Spells and Familiars.  If she dies, I can create a ruthless Redgard Battlemage Vampire who wants Skyrim under Imperial Control.  With mods, there are almost an infinite number of ways you can play through the game.  There is no good or evil in The Elder Scrolls Games, there are just alliances and repercussions.  And there are also a ton of different ways to complete most of the quests.  It's the only series where your character can truly live in the world.Skyrim is HUGE and the environments are breathtaking.  The Art and Technical Direction come together to create a truly memorable experience.  There are times where you'll be riding a horse up a mountain trail and you'll stop and admire the view.  Then you'll snap out of it because you hear ferocious howls coming from just over the ridge.  When you approach, you'll find two Sabercats battling a Troll.  Of course you let them battle it out and slay the wounded winner, skin them, and make leather armor out of their hides.Skyrim features a simplified Crafting / Enchanting System where you can create just about any weapon or piece of armor that you'd like.  Throughout the game, there are ore deposits in caves or on the sides of mountains.  Just bring a pickaxe to start mining.  When you get ore, you can smelt it to make ingots.  You can use those ingots and leather to create any type of weapon or armor that you'd want.  Regarding Enchanting, you can use an altar to Learn an enchantment from any magical weapon that you find.  So, if you found a sword of Fire Damage, you can learn how to enchant your own weapons with Fire Damage.  Once you know an Enchantment, you just need an Item, the Enchantment, and a Soul Gem (a crystal with the soul of a beast inside) to enchant (and name) the weapon.  There is no \"durability\" stat so you'll never have to worry about something breaking or weapon upkeep.In Skyrim Leveling Up has been simplified.  There are no Stats like Strength, Intelligence, Dexterity, etc...  Instead, there are Skills.  Each time you use a Skill, it goes up.  When enough Skills Go Up, you Go Up in Level.  Whenever you gain a Level, you can get 10 more HP, 10 more Mana, or 10 more Stamina.  You can also choose a Perk.  If your character is a Swordsman, you can select +20% more Damage With Melee Weapons.  As you get better with Melee Weapons, more Perks become available.  Any time you Level Up, you can choose a Perk for ANY Skill, as long as you are good enough with that Skill to Unlock the Perk.  There are Communication Perks, Combat Perks, Magic Perks, Crafting Perks, Stealth Perks, etc...It definitely pays to stick with a gameplay style and improve it.  If you focus on 1-3 things you'll be a lot tougher, than if you tried to improve everything evenly.You might be thinking, well, wouldn't it get boring if I was just a Stealth Archer?  I'd have to play a 150 hour game as a sniper.  The good news is that anyone can cast low level spells and you can improve your casting abilities with Perks and Items.  Every character you make can also learn DRAGON SHOUTS, which is a special kind of magic.  You may have 1 Dragon Shout equipped at a time and these can freeze an enemy, slow time, make you teleport 50 meters, create a storm, pacify enemies, breathe Dragon Fire, etc...  So, you can use these Shouts to round out your Character Builds.There are a few flavors of killing enemies:Two Handed Weapon Melee, where you can attack, block, or Power Attack - costing you stamina.  If a Power Attack lands on an enemy, it creates an opening.One Handed Weapon Melee + Shield, where you can attack, block, shield bash, and Power Attack.Dual Wielding Melee Weapons.Single Handed Melee Weapon and Magic Spell in the other Hand.Archery (uses both hands) but combined with Stealth, you get massive damage bonuses.Dual Wielding Magic Spells, where you can have a spell in each hand.  Heal and Fireball, or Summon Familiar and Oakflesh, or Ward (shield spell) and Conjure Sword, or Invisibility or Raise Dead, etc...The enemies are pretty simple:Melee enemies charge you and perform attacks, blocks, and power attacks.Missile enemies shoot at you and when you get close they draw a melee weapon.Mage Enemies summon enemies or try to shoot you with spells.Dragons fly around blast you with their breath weapon, and occasionally land for some melee combat.In Oblivion, the entire world leveled up with you, which was terrible, because every fight felt like it had the same difficulty.  Now, the world does become slightly more difficult as you level up, but there are still incredibly tough enemies like Giants and weak enemies like Wolves throughout the game, so there's some variety.There are a TON of Quests in Skyrim: Main Quests, Misc. Quests, Nord Quests, Empire Quests, Fighter Quests, Mage Quests, Thief Quests, Assassin Quests, Faction Quests, City Quests, Daedric Prince Quests, Random Quests...  and many of these have branching steps.  And because this is an Elder Scrolls game, there are always a ton of different ways to solve each one.  This is the type of game where the Adventure Truly Belongs to YOU!Skyrim does require Steam and you can't play if the Steam Servers are down, which is awful.  On the plus side of things, Steam makes it incredibly easy to browse, install, and upgrade mods with the click of a mouse.  So Steam is a bit of a double edged sword.The major flaw of Skyrim is the acting and writing.  Although the lore is Incredibly Rich and Skyrim references ALL of the other Elder Scrolls games, the Dialogue is incredibly simple and the voice actors are on the level of a College Drama Class.  Each Voice Actor also plays about 50 different characters, so it gets irritatingly repetitive.  The characters are also severely lacking in emotion.  The main problem is that there are NO Cutscenes.  So, you may finally meet a Jarl / King, and he is congratulating you on your efforts, and a peasant talks over the king's grand speech with something trivial.  So as the king is saying, \"There hasn't been a Dragon in these parts in a thousand years.  The scrolls were lost, but this is the harbinger... My pig just took a dump,\" interrupted townsperson #41.  The characters are so emotionless, that it's hard to get motivated for the quests.  You just see them as a chance for Loot.Maturity:  There's loads of fantasy violence, talk of prostitutes, and some gore, but it's fine for Teens.Replay Value:  Nearly Infinite.  You can finish the Main Quest in less than 25 hours, but you can enjoy this game and discover new things for 1000 hours.Overall:  The lack of emotional content keeps this game from being perfect.  But the adventure, the flexibility of the game, and the scope of the world are amazing!Buy it if you want the adventure of a lifetime or wait a few weeks to get the Legendary Edition, which is more expensive, but comes with the Expansion Packs.If you loved Skyrim, you should definitely check out The Witcher 2!  If you like Open Ended World Games, there are plenty to choose from:  Red Dead Redemption, Far Cry 3, Fallout, Assassin's Creed, GTA, and Saint's Row.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2013"}

Having ammo crates at different locations in the levels was a nice addition.I didn't do a lot of multiplayer, but the little I did was fun...definitely different from the other military games, such as CoD.  Having a stealth-like class is pretty cool.  There aren't as many varieties of weapon upgrades, as there are in say, Black Ops.

And it's hard to believe that over the years there have been very few. if any, successful titles that has come from this franchise.  Don't believe me, look it up in wikipedia.So, when word had it back in 2008, that Rebellion was going to work on this game for the current gen systems almost every fan had a nerdgasm waiting for this game because they just thought that this time around it would be done justice by the studio that had done the other 2 iterations from years before.This is where we have our problems.Fans, on first look it is soooo hard to hate this game. Most of the environments looks about right and the sound fx sound right but when you really start getting into the game, you realize that there is so much that is off that it becomes very hard to like this game.Let get my biggest nitpick out of the way first and when you read what I have to say it will become clear from a fan's POV. I got this game to play the predator levels and while the game lets you play with all 3 species interchangeably, this is where I really wanted to start. First off, I cannot believe that Rebellion totally missed on the Predator mask filtering sound effects. It was PERFECT back in the 1999 game. Some of you are probably asking if I am serious, so let's do a comparison. If any of you watched the first 2 films there is a noticeable hum and thrum to the filter from the Predator view in infrared. Stop reading here and go pop in your old VHS if you still have it! It's not in this game!  The sound is iconic! It's the same as if there was a Star Wars game released and you KNOW there are lightsabers there and there are but you hear everything else about the lightsabers BUT the hum. I tried to grit my teeth and keep going but then other issues started popping up and then this is where it starts to spread game wide.For one, the control scheme is hit or miss because in some cases you have entirely too many combos you have to use and while you DO use each and every button, your combos will easily have you hitting the wrong buttons when you don't need to. Worst of all is your melee buttons are on the bumpers and most of us who are FPS players are so hard wired to using triggers that when it comes time to use those bumpers in the game will find ourselves pulling the trigger instead. Although you have a heavy and light melee attack sometimes trying to use each or both will leave you vulnerable especially since some are used as QTE.  And truth be told, for the Marines, the controls are probably most workable because it's a human. The predator it takes a bit more work because you have jumping combos and weapon combos and with the xenomorph it's probably most difficult because while you are trying to get the control scheme down you also have to orient yourself in particular rooms especially since it clings and crawls on everything and most of your attacks are melee attacks.Next up is the HUD and level design. In many cases, you will find yourself in the dark and trying to figure where you are going. For one there is no map to guide and the pointer in your HUD sometimes become useless because as you follow it can sometimes flip back and forth and will render you entirely lost and in the dark. Also on some levels when you need to find an objective, it may be clear as day on one portion where it is and other times you have no clue. For instance, one level I needed to extinguish a fire by breaking a pipe open and I found myself fighting hordes of baddies rather than taking time out to find the pipe because the HUD wasn't concisely marked as it could have been especially since the objective and the exit were right smack together. Worst was because I had to switch the mask filter to \"see\" the enemy I ran past the objective at least 3 times before I realized I needed to switch to regular view to see it which at that point put me in near blackness and a few cheap deaths. On the other hand there was a level I played and if you followed the voice prompts you knew where to go.  But then the worst offender is that this game actually tried to throw puzzles in here. There is a level where you have to open a door by finding switches scattered thru the level. No problem.  Take your time and find the switches. The problem was placement and spawning.  Because the levers were on a cliff ledge, as soon as you turned a switch on, 3 or four monsters jumped you and if you weren't careful you instantly fell off of the cliff which you have to repeat getting to again. One thing that Rebellion did bring back and something I wished to see in other FPSs is that when you shoot a light, it goes out and makes rooms darker. But, why is it if I am using laser weapons, I have to shoot a light 2 and three times for it to go out? It's hard enough that you are wasting energy and finding recharge stations on levels are so willy nilly it's frustrating.Another issue is the AI and interaction. This is straightforward and short. The AI for the marines is just dumb. It doesn't take much to get a whole gaggle of soldiers to run in your general direction for an easy kill problem is, most of the time you are the ones being killed because they all just blindly run and fire at you. In an age when most AI are programmed with unpredictable flanking schemes, it's really a shame to see AI behavior almost reminiscent of the 1999 game. Also for pushing buttons and switches, you have to be exactly in the right spot or else it just won't work and in a game with the frenetic pace that this has, it's inexcusable especially when pulling off trophy or stealth games and after you have seen one head with a spine attached ripped off, you have seen it all.Last up are the character designs. It's a mixed bag. On one hand, all of the races are represented and detailed. On the other hand it's again that 1999 issue popping up. For one almost anything that you kill `dies' the same way, no ragdoll effects or anything. There are really no variety of characters and it really would have been noticeable among the Predators and somewhat on the Marines but almost everyone is the same and it sucks to know that the 1999 game actually had a little bit more enemy variety. Even the weapons loadouts are imbalanced.  Marines have very limited ammo and very few places to reload and once you find yourself engaging a horde it's very easy to see your rifle ammo exhausted long before you have cut down a good number of Aliens before you complete your objective. The predator mode is imbalanced because certain things you need early on (like enhanced vision) you don't get until well after levels where you really need them and some of the weapons you get really don't work all that well like they should when you are in the middle of a fight. The Xenomorph mode can sometimes be frustrating because it walks ON EVERYTHING and pulling off stealth kills is difficult if you are not exactly in the right spot.So in conclusion, AVP disappoints with so many inexcusable issues that it will made die hard fans run off and load up the PC game (yes I still have mine) just to get the bad tase of this iteration out of your mouth. It starts off with a fleeting promise of a good game and immediately descends in to sub par mediocrity. This was so painful, I didn't bother getting into multiplayer mode. I would strictly advise that anyone wanting this game, get this as a rental only.2/5 stars.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2010"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E1JS","description":"","reviewerName":"Matt32 \"LIGHT WEIGHT\"","summary":"Finally an MK title I enjoy!","reviewText":"I stopped playing Mortal Kombat at Trilogy.  Every game started becoming the same with nothing that really interested me since that point.  There have been a lot of new concepts put into the games (3D, different characters, combos, even different concepts such as the DC VS MK thing)  But when you get right down to it, Mortal Kombat was always meant to be a side scroller fighter and not much else.That being said, I was very concerned that this game would be ruined with too many new features but I'll be honest, it stayed very true to the format MK should be following!  I think it is a great revamp!  There are few good reviews of this game and a ton of crappy ones.  Some go really in depth so allow me to skim over this game really quickly.First, things I did not like1. Controls seem to be a little shoddy on certain characters.  Certain moves are being performed and certain moves are not being performed.  I think a little tweaking on the combos and such would have made some characters a lot more fun to play with.2. No run button, I was really hoping to see this feature but instead you must use certain moves (or the infamous jump-kick) to get close to your enemy quickly.3. I don't know how big of a problem this has been for others, but it has been taking me forever to get into any online play.4.  Certain things in the krypt are garbage.  I bought the collectors edition with the art book, I don't need to see more concept art.5.  During the tag (or what seems to have taken place of the endurance matches) I don't like that a character's team mate can randomly pop in and hit you.6.  Too much delay between certain attacks.  I hate unleashing a combo and then you kind of have a pause of about 2 seconds leaving you very opening to counter attack.7. Kahn fights have some issues in my opinion.  A couple of my friends have brought this up as well.  There seems to be a problem with hit detection (Kahn throwing objects and they hit somehow when they shouldn't, late hits, etc) also, he seems to be able to cancel attacks to start another one.  They are fairly minor problems, I have no trouble beating Kahn on the 2 easiest settings but it starts becoming a problem as you increase your challenge (even on easy its tough to work around).  I think the Kahn fights could have been more polished to make them more enjoyable rather than irritating.Ok things I do like.1. Characters look great, very gritty, realistic, and fresh.  No longer are the girls the same figure with different colors, no more ninjas with the same stance and different colors.  Very high attention to detail not only on the fighters but the scenery as well.  Extremely visually pleasing game and IMO one of the best graphic jobs on a Mortal Kombat game to date.2.  Story mode, I've asked this question:  Is it sad that I actually enjoyed watching the between fight scenes in story mode more than the MK movies?!  Very well planned story line, Story Mode is very fun, alternating between characters.  Pulled of great.3. X rays, enhanced moves, different combos, new fatalities that don't take a novel of commands to execute.  Perfect.  Even the characters have different attributes (some are power hitters some are quick, some have high defense, etc)  so all have a weakness in their own way.4.  You won't be just jump-kicking your way through the bosses anymore.  Does anyone remember how many games all it took to beat Mataro, Goro, or Kahn was a constant barrage of jump attacks?5. The different game modes.  I haven't tried all of them yet, but you have story and then the classic ladder match.  You also have this new tag team feature that is really nice.  I'm enjoying it so far and I can't wait to spend more time exploring this game.Some people say MK is too easy...may I suggest stop playing it on EASY setting then?  To me this is one of the more challenging MK games.  A great \"revamp\".  I suggest getting it if you are into fighters.  When it all boils down to it, these games revolve around the same idea, fighting.  Not much else you can do, but if you know how to enjoy it, you can get plenty of wonderful hours out of it.  Buy it, check it out, if you don't like it resale it, take it to a Game Stop or Game Exchange.  But I seriously doubt a serious gamer will be disappointed with this game. (also the Kollector's Edition is boss, I high recommend it :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2011"}

The office towers had the majority of the action; but the multiple cubbyhole workstations, made for very repetitious play and became quite monotonous after a while (not to mention confusing). There was only a few short outside scenes.3.)It was difficult, in many cases, to figure out where to go next, once your mission was completed (especially true in the office towers). I found that once you completed a mission,  some previously  locked door or gateway became open, and you had to go back and find it before you were able to proceed on your new task.4.)You only had access to your 3 most recent saved games; and, as you could only carry three weapons at any one time, it was sometimes difficult to know if you should pick up a new weapon (while discarding another one) just before you were about to change locales forever (where you could not possibly return to without restarting a previously saved game).5.)No \"bosses\" to fight, even at the end. A rather dull and anticlimactic finale. \"Boss\" fights have always been one of my favorite parts of FPSs and I missed them in this game.6.)And finally, the game has no replay value whatsoever; I can't think of a single mission or scene I'd be remotely interested in replaying again.All in all, a different type of FPS.

{"product_name":"B00005B8G1","description":"The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption.

Some of the reviews here seem to focus on the comparison of this drum kit versus Rock Band drum kits. I have yet to experience Rock Band so I will just focus on this particular product.The drum kit arrived needing some minor assembly which wasn't a problem.  Once it was set up, the drum kit was easily detected by Guitar Hero. Best of all, it is completely wireless.  I have found that many gaming accessories that are advertised as \"wireless\" still require an AC adaptor be plugged in, which obviously defeats the purpose of being wireless.  This kit only needed a few AA batteries, which were included, and nothing more.  No controller wires nor electrical wires.After we turned it on and synced up with the Xbox 360, the drum kit integrated seamlessly with the guitar and vocals of the game.  The drum kit is very well constructed and is built to last.  It is quite sturdy and impressive looking, and sounds great! My kids and I greatly enjoy playing together as a family with each of us playing an instrument while another sings.  The guitar, singing, and drumming all come together quite nicely, and my family feels like a real band when we play together.If you are looking for a wireless drum kit to add to your Guitar Hero ensemble, I would recommend this solution.  The only drawback is cost - this is not an inexpensive toy by any means.  But, if you decide to make the purchase, this wireless drum set works and sounds great, and since it is well constructed, will last.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2010"}

I'm a huge fan of Fallout3 and it has a little of that feel to it. The story could be better, but isn't terrible. The graphics are great, the controls are easy to learn. I'm a little over half way through but I have recommended it to others. I haven't hit any glitches, which is a big bonus. Some of the cons would be that the load times are slow after you die or go into another area, there is no map so make sure you do everything you want before you leave a place, I wish there were more to explore without being on a mission.

Tom","summary":"There's no sense of urgency in buying a Nintendo 3DS quite yet","reviewText":"With no real interesting launch titles in the US and a short battery life, as well as a few other negatives, there's no sense of urgency in buying a Nintendo 3DS yet for any but the most dedicated gamers. This is a revolutionary device only in the fact that Nintendo is the first to come out with a 3D hand-held game system that does not require glasses. It's actually pretty cool and while I don't like 3D movies, the 3D on the Nintendo 3DS is fun and seems to work pretty well!There are some flaws with the technology though, which I'm sure will only get better in future versions. The first is that with the 3D on, if you view the screen away from the sweet spot angle and go off axis, it looks blurry. This is easy to do if you are playing a racing game for example and move the unit around a bit.You can get a headache and/or eyestrain if you use the 3D for too long although it's easy to turn it off or down on the fly via a switch.The battery life is not good. It only lasts about 3-5 hours. For a heavy gamer, it may not last throughout your day of game playing. Nintendo includes a charging cradle and it is recommended that you return the unit to be charge any time you are not using it.If you are used to the size of the DSi XL you will likely be disappointed with the 3DS since the screens are more the size of the DSi. They seem a bit small. Since I have an iPad, I actually prefer to play games on that-larger screen, cheaper games.Lastly, the release price seems about $50. too high to me and I expect that the price will actually come down given a bit of time.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2011"}

It is every bit as good! You don't have as many squad mates to choose from, but the environments for every mission are better than ME2.There is no more mining of planets for certain minerals. This was a pain in the a$$ in ME2, but I also kind of missed it in a way. If you wanted to upgrade something, then you had to use a certain amount of minerals, and the only way to do that was to mine them from planets. In ME3, if you find an upgrade, then you can use it right away. Kind of speeds things up a bit, but I still kind of missed the mining.I did not play any multiplayer, and it took me 43 hours to completely finish every main and side mission. I know there have been a lot of people that complained about the ending, but I actually liked the ending in ME3 better than the ending in ME2. You are able to download the extended ending DLC for free, but I still thought it was pretty cool.I would totally recommend this game especially if you have already played ME2.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Surprisingly good, a must play for X-Files fans","reviewText":"Though it suffered a number of release delays and with the dreaded fact that it is a licensed video game, The X-Files: Resist or Serve is a surprisingly good game, even though it draws many comparisons to various Resident Evil games because of it's presentation.  While it suffers from graphical glitches and a few gameplay and control issues, Resist or Serve still shines thanks to it's mix of survival horror and puzzle elements.  Playing as FBI Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully; you investigate a series of bizarre and brutal murders in the town of Red Falls, Colorado.  The game's story is written by veteran X-Files show writers, so the game's story plays out much like the lost episode that it is claimed to be.  Mulder's story is more action oriented as you take on hordes of zombie-ish creatures, while Scully's story is puzzle oriented as you combine various toxins and perform autopsies.  The puzzle elements are a nice diversion than the usual &quot;find the key to open the door&quot; type puzzles that are populated throughout other games of the genre, and that alone is refreshing.  The character models of Mulder, Scully, A.D. Skinner, the Lone Gunmen, Alex Krycek, and the Cancer Man are nicely rendered so that each character resembles their series counterpart, but the character movement comes off as wooden.  The sound of the game is where Resist or Serve shines as each actor reprises their role (thats right, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are on board as Mulder and Scully) and the music recycles various episode scores and sounds brilliant.  All in all, The X-Files: Resist or Serve is a surprisingly good game that any and every X-Files fan should check out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2004"}

Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience. Merging blistering 2D action with meticulously rendered 3D environments, players race through intriguing locations across the globe as Sonic to save a chaotic world.The other side of SonicSonic and his alter ego Werehog.View larger.Collect rings for Ring Energy.View larger.Swing into action with Werehog.View larger.A NewSonica New StoryOn a quest for world domination Sonic nemesis Dr. Eggman has managed to steal the chaos emeralds once again and this time drained them of their power. As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new modified game engine,Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.","reviewerName":"Mark E.

Apocalyptic/Sci-Fi style shooter games have never really been my thing.  They kept begging me to play with them telling me how awesome the game was and I continually scoffed at and ignored them.  I just looked at the game and thought, \"This looks ridiculously goofy and doesn't look like something I'm interested in at all!\"  Finally, my friends badgered me enough to buy the game and play with them.  That was over a year ago.  Since them we've played through the game and all four of expansions/DLC twice and still play every weekend to this day.  I can't think of another non-MMO game that I've ever done that with friends.  Released in 2009 and developed by Gearbox studios, Borderlands is a science fiction First-Person Shooter with RPG elements.  The game takes place on the planet of Pandora where treasure hunters (that's you) are seeking the location of an unopened vault of alien (Eridian) technology.  Pandora has largely become a barren wasteland filled with ruins, garbage, gangs of bandits and plenty of alien creatures which terrorize the landscape.  You take on the role of one of four characters classes; Brick - a muscle-bound tank like berserker, Mordecai - a sniper/hunter with a pet bat-like bird named Bloodwing, Lilith - a lithe elemental-like witch who has the ability to phasewalk and Roland - an ex-mercenary and professional soldier who can deploy turrets.  Arriving at the small outpost of Fyrestone you meet a humorous and memorable robot named Claptrap (quickly became my favorite NPC in the game) who introduces you to the basics of the game and begins issuing you your first quests.  From Fyrestone you begin your search for the legendary Eridian Vault.  Here are my thoughts on one of the most fun and innovative games I've ever played, Borderlands;Pros+ Claptrap (Love him or hate him!).+ Great cell-shaded animation graphics, easier on the system.+ Superb voice acting.+ Excellent game mechanics and over the top non-stop action.+ Quirky and amusing yet adult style of humor.  Plenty of extremely clever in game jokes.  Example; a combustible fire rate gun that has the phrase \"We don't need no water...\" attached to it.  A giant flying mob called \"Mothraak.\" A gun with a quote from \"Waiting for Guffman.\"  A giant spiderant creature named Helob. etc.+ Near infinite amount of randomized weapons, items and guns (think Diablo's random item generation system).  Game designers boast there are approximately 17,500,000 different item combinations.+ Vehicles are a blast to drive, literally.+ Excellent multi-player.+ Fun boss fights.+ Ability to reset your allocated skill points, for a price of course.+ In game voice chat.+ Plenty of blood and gore.+ Second wind (Fight for your life) option helps you avoid death and respawn fees.+ Maps repopulate and items respawn with every session creating a unique experience every time.+ Excellent soundtrack that completely fits the setting.  The respected composer roster consists of Jesper Kyd, Sascha Dikiciyan, Cris Velasco, Tim Larkin and Raison Varner.+ Instant travel posts are convenient (also a con - see below).Cons- Some real problems with in game voice chat being recognized after experiencing disconnections.  Very frustrating.- Missions/quests can be a bit of a pain if everyone isn't at the same point in the game as you can get locked out.- Some minor environmental bugs where your character can get stuck in areas and sometimes be unable to get out.  Also, AoE damage is sometimes ineffective against enemies standing on certain platforms or ledges.- No on-screen mini-map.- A few quests can be buggy with locations and not update.  Frustrating when you're trying to find small items.- Eridian weapons are extremely disappointing.- Some missions are too similar.- No individual character creation system.  Only 4 characters to choose from.- Game is heavily instanced, breaking the feel of world immersion.  Instant travel posts don't help with the immersion either.- Boss weapon drops are pretty lackluster.- Abrupt ending.- Some of the rare Orange colored items are junk.- Gameplay is so great it overshadows a decent storyline.- Can't skip the developer/publisher/video card load up info.  So annoying.- Vehicle's machine guns are largely useless unless you want to needle enemies to death.  The Racer's guns and rockets are nearly pointless at higher levels of the game.  Honestly, it's easier to run over enemies and risk blowing up your vehicle rather than shooting them.- Once your money is maxed out it's impossible to actually tell how much money you have.-Nothing to do with your experience once you reach max level.  It would have been nice to have an alternative advancement that went towards extra skill points.Borderlands has held my interest for over a year and a half and still continues to do so.  My friends and I still play every weekend even though we're all max level (L69 after expansions).  The game is just as fun as when we started day one and we're always excited to find those ultra-rare weapon or item drops.  This game is all about online co-op with friends, not with random strangers.  There just too many random things to do which I feel would make playing this game with strangers a complete cluster-F.  That being said, I played through the game as Brick the berserker specializing in melee, shotguns, rocket launchers and sniper rifles.  My friends each played the different remaining three classes so no one was the same.  Honestly, it was and still is quite possibly one of the most fun games I've ever played.  I guess next time I'll have to be less stubborn, listen to my friends and not judge a game by its screenshots.  Looking back I wish I had pre-ordered this game with them and played at launch.  That being said, Borderlands 2 will definitely be a release day buy for me when it's released.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2011"}

Kojima, coming to the conclusion that hack-and-slash was a terrible genre, accepted his offer under the condition that all the blame go to Platinum Games. Tatsuya Minami, being the pig that he is, had no objection to these terms. Later that day at Platinum Games headquarters, Minami announced to his team, who were seemingly at work on Beyonetta 2, that they would be changing the protagonist to Raiden and calling the game Metal Gear Rising.

{"product_name":"B000R0SR9E","description":"A supernatural horror action game with a story devised by the master mythmaker, novelist and filmmaker Clive Barker. Mingling the darkest elements of Barker's horror fiction and films, Jericho deals with the mysterious reappearance of a lost city in a remote desert. When a form of evil that goes right back to the dawn of days resurfaces from there, a Special Forces squad, trained in both conventional warfare and the arcane arts, is sent in. Their mission: hunt down and destroy the evil that lurks at the heart of the city before it destroys humanity.","reviewerName":"A. Son","summary":"Unfairly critiqued","reviewText":"I can see what happened with this game. The hype was so big before it came out that it destroyed it. While Jericho is far from perfect, it's received far too much bashing for a game that's pretty decent. The atmosphere is creepy and unsettling. The storyline is unique and intriguing and also ties in well with the gameplay aspects which was a pleasant surprise. Probably the best aspect I can say about this game is the intuitive gameplay. You have 6 squad members and you can switch back and forth between them (which ties into the storyline I might add, which I thought was really neat). Each member is very unique, sporting different weapons and different special powers. Usually in games like this, I find the 1 or 2 guys I'm best with and go through the entire game but Jericho greatly encourages you to use everyone and I found everyone (and their powers) to be useful throughout the game. Jericho further encourages this behavior by starting you out with different characters after every cut scene and instead of immediately switching over to my favorites, I felt more inclined to stick with who they'd give me for a while. Jericho gives every squad member their chance to be uniquely better to handle certain enemies and situations. It also helped to freshen up the sometimes monotonous gameplay. The squad itself was well developed. They act and talk to each other like a squad and the character development was surprisingly solid which is a rarity for an FPS. I also want to point out that the boss battles were all pretty awesome! I enjoyed them all and there are quite a few and man do they look messed up!Jericho does have its flaws though. For one, the gameplay pretty much consists of killing wave after wave of enemies, move along, then repeat. This can get old if you don't change it up and switch between squad members. Second, there weren't a lot of different enemies to fight. Probably 10-15 different types of enemies throughout the entire game. I WILL say though, the method of killing these enemies can differ greatly and many times, shooting isn't your best option. Another thing I didn't like, there's not a good cover mechanic. You can duck but it doesn't do a whole lot of good. It's hard to get good cover from the enemies shooting at you. This becomes less of an issue later in the game but it's a killer for the first part. I can't help but wonder if this game would've been better using a third-person system like \"Gears of War\" instead of first-person. Not only could you use cover, but since you have characters who depend a lot on melee attacks, and button pressing sequences (God of War style), third-person probably would have played and looked a lot better.PROS:Intuitive gameplayCaptivating storylineGood character developmentCreepy AtmosphereGood voice actingFun and grotesque bossesCONS:Sometimes monotonous gameplayNo good cover mechanicNot a lot of variety of enemiesBottom Line: This game got unfairly skewered when it came out. While it's not a classic by any means, I'm glad I ignored a lot of the negative backlash it got and enjoyed playing it. I DO think it has the potential to become a revolutionary game with its innovative gameplay but I'm afraid with all the negative reviews surrounding it, it'll never get its chance to work out the kinks in a sequel.SIDENOTE: I see a lot of reviews complaining about their squad dying a lot and them having to constantly heal everyone. When I first started playing, I can honestly say it was happening to me as well but as I continued to play I realized it started happening less and less. By the third mission it wasn't happening at all. The key was learning how to play it and play with the different characters and learning how to kill different enemies efficiently. I can see how learning by trial and error might annoy some but the point is, the game doesn't have to play this way. The AI is not dumb. They DO find cover, they run from explosives, they use their powers, they shoot at immediate threats and Rawlings goes out of his way to help heal everyone. You just have to learn how to play. It just doesn't hold your hand through some lame tutorial and tell you the best way to kill everything. Change it up. Use different characters, different powers, and different weapons. Even if something seems to work fairly well, there's usually something that works even better.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2009"}

The first two are the logitech g35, and then the Triton 720+. I do like my first two and have no real complaints about them. The XP510 is nicer.I really like the abundant features, especially the bluetooth capabilities built in. I've taken several phone calls using these, and it's very convenient especially if you're in game with the volume blasting your ear drums. I don't have to worry about missing an important call.I also really like the comfort. This headset has the best feel when it's on my head. The cups are soft and the pressure from the band that holds the cups is not to tight. It stays on my head without any buildup to pain.I have had static a bit, right out of the doors. It has however gone away. I hope it doesn't come back, and I certainly will post an update if it happens.  This static was out of the box on my first use without charging the headset.I did have a little trouble getting setup. I did not at first realize I needed an additional cord to be able to chat on the PS4 which is the primary system i planned to use this headset for. I do own all the other current and last gen consoles and may switch between however.to repeat:YOU WILL NEED TO PURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL CORD TO USE THIS HEADSET TO CHAT ON THE PLAYSTATION 4.I'm not sure if that was listed in the product description. All i saw was compatible and felt good about thatI didn't really talk about the audio yet, so here goes.The sound/music is amazing. There is a good amount of bass in this headset as well. The first thing I did when i got it going was listen to some music. Played Metallica, then some ELO, and some other random music; yes I have a diverse interest. The point is that it all sounded great. I could easily see myself listening to music on this headset if i ever needed to.Overall if you have the money to put down on this expensive hardware, I would recommend picking the xp510 up. It sounds great, feels good on your head, and offers more features than you'll likely use.There is a lot more that I didn't cover as I have not gotten to it. yeah, it's got a lot going on.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2014"}

MOHAA made me love FPS war games.  Call of Duty (COD) has a lot of things that I wished MOHAA had when I was playing it.  COD allows you pick up any type of weapon in the game including the enemy's.  It handles the supply of ammunition much better by letting you take the German weapons and take their ammunition as you kill them.  MOHAA would give you Thompson rounds for picking up MP40 rounds and similar for the rifles.  The stance feature is setup better.  You can change from standing to crouch with a single button you don't have to hold it down as in MOHAA and you can drop to a laying down position, which MOHAA did not have.  COD also has an improved aiming feature where you can look down the weapon site on all weapons not just sniper rifles.  The only playability feature that COD did not have was stealth mode.  In MOHAA you could sneak right up behind the enemy if the opportunity presented itself.  Since a lot of the missions involved team movement you wouldn't be able to use this feature often; however, there were several times that it would have been nice to have.I also like the game engine that COD uses.  MOHAA also has some missions where you work with other guys on your side; however, the teammate AI was generally awful.  In COD, your teammates actually act like soldiers.  They use cover effectively and can engage the enemy without getting themselves killed (at least some of them can - the Russian troops just act like cannon fodder).  They are useful they don't just get in the way as in MOHAA.  However, they aren't always careful with their grenades (watch the shrapnel).  The enemy AI has even improved over MOHAA.  In MOHAA, the enemy would always react the same way (always).  The Germans in COD sometimes take different routes (they do still spawn from pre-determined locations).  They also use team-attacking tactics.  This is very evident in one of the Russian missions where you are holding the building waiting for reinforcements.  Holding the building against 100+ Germans for 4 minutes is hard on veteran difficulty (no health packs, more accurate enemy, more damage if hit) when all your teammates are wiped out.  The AI attacks in groups using guys to draw your fire while they get better firing positions.  And boy they are just waiting for you to run out of ammo and have to reload.  Needless to say that took a couple of loaded saves.One other thing I really liked is the historic battles.  I use to play Close Combat (1 thru 5) and I recognized a lot of the locations in the airborne drops by the Americans and British.  Other than the D-Day landings MOHAA story line seemed kinda generic.The only reason I don't give COD 5 stars is the single player is way to short.  I played on the highest difficulty and finished in less than 24 hours, MOHAA lasted a lot longer.  I haven't played online yet, but I can't imagine it being much different than MOHAA.  However, as I remember multiplayer is pretty addictive.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2005"}

Bakehorn","summary":"VF5: A great fight with just a bruise or two to show for it.","reviewText":"SEGA's Virtua Fighter carries a legacy that only the blue hedgehog can rival. Akira, Wolf, Sarah - you've seen them in one form or another, whether it's the blocky polygonal models from the original or the immaculately detailed PlayStation 3 ones. Does this legacy fall far from the tree?Virtua Fighter 4 was a critical success on the PlayStation 2, with a global average of 91% in its original form and 91.4% in the revised form, Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution. In fact, it sits just under Soul Calibur 2 (91.6%) as the all-time highest-rated PS2 fighting game. History lesson aside, Virtua Fighter 5 does little to improve upon its PS2 predecessor, but it really doesn't need to. Fans of the PS2 game will find two new fighters and improved gameplay and graphics to boot. Cover boy Akira is joined by his entire set of Virtua Fighter 4 peers and newcomers El Blaze and Eileen. El Blaze, a luchadora, uses fancy wrestling moves while Eileen hops around a whole lot and utilizes what I considered cheaper hits than other characters. My personal favorite was the bald monk Lei-Fei.Fighting is a breeze for newcomers and series vets alike. I can't say how grateful I am for this, because Virtua Fighter 4 wasn't so accessible and as a result I personally didn't appreciate it as much as my critical peers. On the PS3 pad, X serves as a punch button while Circle kicks and Square blocks. The triggers act as shortcuts for combinations of those three buttons, making special moves easier to execute. Combos are simple and flow together well, giving Virtua Fighter 5 a feel that is more similar to Dead or Alive than other fighting games. Fights tend to last longer than in other games, since the default settings require you to win three rounds, not two out of three, but three rounds, meaning close fights extend into five rounds.Quest Mode is where it's at in this game; the mode is essentially a recreation of the experience of traveling to different arcades and challenging players on a machine. To start you create a profile and choose your preferred character, and then the Quest world is open to explore. There are several different arcades with \"players\" of different skill levels, so there is a feeling of progression as you go from one arcade to the next, improving in your ranking and piling up wins. Winning matches and tournaments in the different arcades will earn you money and items to customize your character and beef out your profile. Not only is it addictive to collect items and personalize fighters, it's very difficult to stop trying to improve your rank and dominate different arcades.Unfortunately, Quest mode is the only attention-grabber. The Arcade and Versus modes are very generic and don't offer anything you haven't seen before. There's a VF TV mode, which is entirely worthless-it lets those with HDTVs and HDMI cables appreciate their expensive commodities by watching two CPU-controlled characters battle. Virtua Fighter 5's biggest flaw is its lack of PS3 online play. With Quest mode being such a focus and character customization being a bit part of that, I find the lack of at least some sort of online profiling to be inexcusable on SEGA AM-2's part. After all, A.I. opponents in quest mode don't recreate the tendencies of human players very well, and it isn't even until elite ranks that the CPU becomes difficult or utilizes techniques that force the player to study the fighting system beyond a few different combos.At least Virtua Fighter 5 shows off the PS3's power for the most part. Arguably there isn't a better-looking game on the system. Every character is fleshed-out-literally, in fact-with detail down to their skin textures and hairstyles. All of the different outfits are colorful and react realistically as the players animate. I was very impressed with the animation in general; Virtua Fighter 5 stands right beside Dead or Alive 4 as the fighter with the most visual fluidity. The only complaint I have from a technical standpoint is that the overall sound of the game is slightly muffled and doesn't blast out of the speakers like I think it should.Virtua Fighter 5 should be your next PlayStation 3 game if you enjoy fighting games and can deal with its \"more of the same, but improved\" syndrome. Quest mode could easily have you hooked for thousands of matches and have you searching for band-aids for gamer's thumb. The lack of online play hurts its overall longevity, but perhaps this will be attended to with the Xbox 360 version's summer 2007 release.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2007"}

As time passes, his lonely town of one becomes a town of two, three...until it grows into a town to behold. The town is not the only thing to behold. Among the newcomers are beautiful ladies who have moved to the town to start a new life. Which one will be our hero&rsquo;s lucky lady? However, our hero is soon faced with a problem. Creatures of the frontier, many of them hostile towards humans, pose a great threat to the safety of his townsfolk. To find a way to live in peaceful coexistence or perhaps destroy them along with the danger they bring &ndash; the decision is up to our hero.GameplayAs with previous related games,Rune Factory: Frontierfeatures a myriad of Life Sim activities like farming, raising livestock, building relationships with NPCs, etc., as well as role-playing elements like dungeon crawling and item collection and leveling, but in structuring gameplay it goes to great lengths to incorporate an open-ended structure that allows players to choose the type of game they wish to experience at all points in the game. This means that although at the beginning of the game players will find themselves presented with the familiar opportunity of starting a farm, selling their crops at market and by doing so improving the overall prosperity and size of their town, they are not necessarily tied to the land. Although farming is an excellent way to finance adventuring, the rich RPG elements of the game can be pursued at any time. These elements present themselves mostly in the form of battling monsters and bosses that have found their way into the land, but seem to be coming from the mysterious 'Whale Island,' which floats in the sky above your town. Players can either battle the monsters or make friends with them, raising them as a kind of livestock. As with everything inRune Factory: Frontier, the choice is yours. Whether it's growing crops, expanding the town, fighting (or befriending) monsters or even falling in love, the experience is unique to each player.Key Game Features:Lifelike Interactions- NPCs will come and go based on the player&rsquo;s actions. Want to get along with your neighbor? Want to give fellow townsfolk something they might hate? Go ahead, but they may get upset and leave the town. Be nice to attract more newcomers.Natural Ecosystem- Breathe life into the barren wilderness by cultivating it and planting crops. Small creatures (spirits) will gather first, triggering a food chain to later attract larger and rarer creatures. You are responsible for bringing more fertility to the land.Floating Island to Explore- There is an island that floats in the skies. When you see it, you must quickly find a way to get on it as new discoveries await.Intuitive Wii Controls- Use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk to do everything. Plow the land, shake hands with townsfolk to strengthen relationships, or even wave it around when you&rsquo;re on a date with a girl.

It's similar to Harvest Moon but I actually prefer this to HM for some reason. I think the graphics are better along with the gameplay overall. You get to build your farm from the start instead of working side-jobs for other people. It can get monotonous having to come back and water crops or harvest especially if you've planted most of your field. I believe as 1 week passes in game, it amounts to around 2 hours real time. The dungeon is extremely fun killing monsters and leveling up, as well as finding items you need for forging or cooking, etc. Interaction with other characters is kinda lame.

The game had received negative reviews from critics such as IGN and Gametrailers. I think Sonic the Hedgehog (also known as Sonic '06) is an underrated game. Because of the fun gameplay, interesting story line, and great soundtrack, it is actually one of my favorites in the series.To avoid spoilers, I will only go into detail about Sonic's story. It all starts at Soleanna, an island ruled by a princess named Elise. On the night the people of Soleanna are having a festival,  Dr. Eggman comes and captures the princess (for reasons later revealed in the game). Although Sonic arrives in time to stop him, Eggman gets away. It's up to Sonic and his friend, Tails to save the princess. The story gets a bit complex for a typical Sonic game, but I found it interesting and cool how all three stories fit together perfectly. My only major complaint with the story is the implied romance between Sonic (a hedgehog) and Elise (a human). In these \"implied romance\" scenes, the dialogue gets weird and cheesy.The gameplay in Sonic '06 is basically the same as Sonic Adventure, with some improvements. You move in a 3D environment where you talk to people, complete missions and buy things. At certain points in the story, you get to play more full-length levels that are fun and lengthy (which is rare for a Sonic game today). For Sonic's story, you try to get to the end of the level as fast as you can while collecting rings and jumping on robots' heads. At the end of some of Sonic's levels, you enter a speed level where you travel at high-speeds on a single-path. These are challenging and sometimes hard to control. A couple of levels in Sonic's story involve the princess being escorted (carried) out of the area. Sometimes, you face hazards like quick-sand and water, which Sonic can't run through. To walk across these, you can use a shield made by the princess' power by holding down R1. I was very surprised that these levels are almost as good as the regular levels. Sonic's story, in my opinion, is the most fun out of the three stories.Although Shadow's gameplay is very similar to Sonic's, there are some differences. Instead of having high-speed levels, Shadow gets to ride vehicles at certain points of the regular levels. Some of these vehicles include a motorcycle, a buggy, and a glider. Shadow can also preform combo attacks in the air, which Sonic cannot do.Silver's gameplay is different from the other two. He cannot jump on robots' heads like Sonic and Shadow. He can use psychokinesis, which is the ability to levitate items and throw them at enemies. The cool thing about psychokinesis is that he can pick up the missiles that the enemies hurl at you. In my opinion, Silver's overall gameplay is the least fun out of the three due to the fact that he's the slowest.The graphics in Sonic '06 are good depending on what part of the game you're in. In gameplay, the graphics are colorful, unique, and detailed. On the other hand, the characters in the cutscenes move funny and the shadows move randomly. Of course, the graphics in the gameplay are pretty incredible compared to the Sonic game before this (Sonic Riders).One problem with Sonic '06 is the stability. A couple of levels have some annoying glitches, but they are rare and avoidable. The framerates will drop whenever the action gets too intense. Though I never had a really big problem with the camera, others say that the camera can be unstable at times. Fans of the series who have played and beaten Sonic Adventure will find the camera easier to control. The most annoying part about the game is the loading screens. They're not very long, but in town missions, they appear often. Fortunately, most of the town missions are avoidable.The controls in Sonic '06 are simple, but challenging. You move with the left analog stick, jump with the X button, and kick and roll with the square button. There are different ways to control the camera such as moving the right analog stick or using the L2 and R2 buttons and you can reset the camera behind you with the L1 button. Sonic '06 can be a hard game at first, but when you master the controls and camera, it can be very fun.The voice acting in the game is pretty good. Jason Griffith does a great job portraying Sonic and Shadow. The rest of the voices are good, with the exception of two. Elise and Silver's voices are very annoying. Elise's voice is over dramatic, and Silver's sounds dorky (although I have learned that the actor of Silver purposely did this because Silver is 14 years old).The music in Sonic '06 is great. Just about all the level tunes are cool and have a rock sound to them. I also particularly like the town theme, which has a very European sound. This is probably my favorite soundtrack in a Sonic game.Overall, I consider Sonic '06 the most underrated game I've played. There may be some problems with the glitches and loading screens, but the gameplay is still very fun as a whole. Because of camera control and high-speed action, Sonic '06 is primarily for longtime Sonic fans. The game is cheap because of it's age. You can find a used or new copy for less than $20. While it's not the best Sonic game, Sonic the Hedgehog is still a fun game for Sonic fans.Final Score: 7.8/10For more details on games such as this one, visit [...]","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2013"}

The residents of Raccoon City go about their lives unaware of the dark fate that surrounds them. Sent in to investigate a series of grisly murders in the area, S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team scrambles into action. On the way to the scene, Bravo&#x92;s helicopter crashes. Although everyone survives, what they discover next is a gruesome site. An overturned military transport truck, riddled with corpses. Rookie member Rebecca Chambers is beginning to wonder what she got herself into. Bravo Team is about to discover the evil nightmare that is growing all around them.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Classic if familiar Evil","reviewText":"What's strange about a series like Resident Evil is that with 5 main canon games (1, 2, 3, Code Veronica and Zero) before 4 overhauled the series for the better, many were complaining about the lack of gameplay innovation and Capcom's tendency to stick to the same thing many grew to despise over the years and yet we almost forgive the same thing with series like Grand Theft Auto, Final Fantasy, Halo or Legend of Zelda. So Zero in a sense is the last time the old gameplay will be featured and while there's a couple of new innovations and refinements, it's still the same and like the saying goes: it might not be the best but it's certainly better than anyone else doing the same thing.Story: Taking place before the mansion incident of Resident Evil, Rebecca Chambers of S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team is en route in helicopter investigating strange murders when they experience engine trouble and make an emergency landing. While exploring, Rebecca finds an empty train and encounters Billy Coen, an ex-marine who was scheduled to be executed when he escaped. The 2 have to team up in order to survive and in the process, learn about the founders of Umbrella and many other secrets.Graphics: The REmake boisted some of the most atmospheric and all-around immaculately detailed graphics the Gamecube has ever seen. While it doesn't have that great art design the mansion and its surroundings brought, Zero is a step-up with even more realistic shadows and lights, especially during the train where lights whiz past the windows and throw quick shadows on the floor. The creatures are just as messed up and awesome as well but the color palette is kind of, I don't know, bland.Sound/Music: What was odd about the REmake was that there was a lot of really eerie, atmospheric music yet most of the time it mainly used the sound effects to set the tone and Zero makes better use of the sound spectrum with so many sounds and creepy music to provide its weirdness. The voice acting, while still B-movie in nature, is a bit more improved and not as annoying.Gameplay: Same control scheme so veterans will not have issues but newbies will definately feel the learning curve. Basically, wherever your character is, pressing Up will always be forward and Down will make them back up. In a 3D environment, it does feel awkward but if you've played previous games, you'll know what to expect so it's not as big an issue. But the big gameplay change is the zapping system where you control Rebecca and Billy at the same time where you can either have them follow you or make them stay in place (a la Ashley in Resident Evil 4). Some puzzles require teamwork. One early example is Billy is locked in a room with a jammed door, a dumbwaiter and a key. He puts the key in dumbwaiter, switch to Rebecca who grabs it, unlocks a door to get an Ice pick, send it back to Billy who uses it to unlock the door. Some of it is clever while others aren't used to their full potential. Also, the partner can be set to Action where they'll attack the enemy who's trying to grab you or Idle where they just sit there, helping conserve ammo. It's not as cumbersome as you'd expect and it's even welcome in some areas.The other gameplay change is in regards to the item boxes. While I personally never had an issue with them, many had an issue with having to walk back everywhere to deposit an item you don't need yet or ever or get an item that's required for story advancement. Now in Zero is the ability to drop items whenever you want with a handy map that tells you not only what's there but the specific location on the map. While it's incredibly useful to get rid of ammo for a gun you don't even have, there's times where you leave them in close proximity to another and have to somehow accurately put your character over it to pick it up, plus there's just way too many items, from herbs to ammo to bigger weapons retaining their taking up 2 spaces aside from REmake's one slot (a major letdown), they'll just be a lot of stuff to sift through.As far as the difficulty is concerned, it's a little bit more annoying than the REmake was since while gone are the Crimson Heads, in its place are leech zombies who have a loooong reach with their tentacles, can withstand several grenade blasts and even explode before they die, making it hurt even more. Advice is to avoid at all costs, then of course there's big toads and agile monkeys and with narrow hallways and cluttered rooms, you'll end up running into a lot of monsters. While the series has always recommended you save ammo and run, it should be greatly emphasized here.Resident Evil Zero is certainly a welcome addition to the series with its creepy atmosphere, gameplay mechanics and its story but one can see why 4 became the overhaul that changed the series for the better.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2007"}

InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"SleepyJD","summary":"Nothing compared to the Computer Version","reviewText":"If you have access to a half decent computer than don't even bother getting the PS2 version of this game.

What amazes me most about SSFIV:3D is the fact that it has everything that I loved about the EX+@ series and ups the ante. Not only that but it's pretty close to the console experience of SSFIV(by pretty close meaning some cuts were made to bring SSFIV:3D to the 3DS, after all).Seeing as to how they've did SSFIV:3D so well, I'd love to see Capcom bring their other fighters, like Power Stone, Rival Schools and Star Gladiator to the system.By and far, Super Street Fighter IV:3D Edition is the best portable fighter released on the system, thus far.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2011"}

That evolved to Goldeneye on Nintendo 64. That all changed when Metal Gear Solid came out for PS1 and I now wanted a good story to go along with my gameplay. I have always kind of liked the COD world war series, but never got into it. When MW1 came out I was blown away, I loved the game and it had a good story to tell. My only complaint with MW2 was that the story was not only lacking, but down right stupid. I never got into multiplayer because I don't have the time to train myself to compete with a bunch of 5th graders who spend 40 hours a week playing the game.This all leads me to Black Ops, as with all 1st person shooters the campaign is short, yet good. The action is intense and the overall gaming is fun. What made the campaign even more fun was that I felt fully drawn into the game due to the compelling story. I actually wanted to check out zombies but I could not draw myself away from the campaign in order to check it out. The story was that good; I wanted to find out what happens. I'm not going into detail what the story is about because you probably already read that somewhere else. As far as the graphics, I thought they looked sharp. The scenery was not as sharp as MW2 because their seemed to be a haze in the air everywhere I went but it was still looking good. My favorite part was in Vietnam they started playing rock music from the time of the Vietnam War, which made it fill even more authentic.As far as zombies go, it's fun to shoot zombies every now and then when I have a few free minutes so it's a nice add-on bonus.Bottom line, if you are a lone wolf player like me, this is definitely the game for you.

The graphics, even now, are very good. Minimalist shapes and soft colors get the job done and create a very dark atmosphere in the world, as if the sun is constantly behind clouds.Despite the presence of elves, fairies and princesses in this game, the soundtrack does a good job of letting the player know that these are dark times, not a time of festivities and celebration. The dungeon themes in particular are very mysterious, foreboding and gloomy (Link! Step away from the edge! Don't do it!).After playing a great many RPG's where one usually has to \"grind\" to build levels to grow stronger, a game like this that focuses on real-time action is a nice change of pace. Even more so because it is done so well. Unlike many RPGs, I found that the items and power-ups are actually rather practical, things you would actually use regularly (like the BOMBOS spell).The storyline is simple and straightforward, not World Fantasy Award-winning material by any stretch of the imagination. This simplicity is a good thing though as it makes the game more accessible to those who just want to run around with a sword instead of reading page after page of text.The gameplay is very faithful to the original . . . and at times very hard.

My major complaints with the old PSPs is the size and comfort.Pros:1. Better ergonomics for a lot of people.2. 16GB built in is much faster than UMD.3. Form factor easily fits in pocket.4. Component TV out with cradle (seperate purchase).5. Great looking screen, great looking gadget.6. MediaGo is a great and intuitive application that works seemlessly with the PSP.7. Bluetooth for headphones and even the PS3 controller. Some games I play on the bigscreen when I'm home.8. Comes with Rock Band lite for free. I love free stuff and since you have to buy downloaded tracks I think this was a smart move for Sony.Cons:1. 802.11b (instead of 802.11g), however I haven't really been impacted by this as I use the PS3 or PC to download.2. MediaGo downloads are very slow, PS3 is much faster downloading game content.3. Price! $250 is way too high. $199 for a release price or $169 to be competetive with the DSi.4. Game prices! Can't buy used, downloadable games are often more expensive than the new UMD version which is rediculous. Stop charging us for convenience, let us save some percentage of the money you save.Other:1. Content has grown exponentially since it's release. It's no longer and issue.2. I'm worried that a cheaper 32GB version will come out in 2010. Sony loves to screw early adopters on the PSP as evidence of their 4 versions of the product.Im summary I love the PSP Go but think it's overpriced. I sold mine with a few UMDs and peripherals for $150 so it was only a $100 upgrade and I do consider it an upgrade from the 1000.If you already have a 3000 and like it, stick with it. If you are in the market for a new PSP, definitly consider the Go if cost is not a major concern. If you want access to used games and a cheaper system go with the 3000. If you find the 3000 to be uncomfortable and want better portability, go with the PSP Go.Lastly, I'd give this 5 stars if the price was less for both the console and games.

{"product_name":"B00BGAA0SU","description":"","reviewerName":"VA Gamer","summary":"An amazing game - the first \"next gen\" title by a mile","reviewText":"(+) Phenomenal graphics and presentation. The world and characters are well realized and meticulously detailed. The visuals are fantastic - from a vivid and adaptive environment to dazzling particle effects and everything in between.I have the Gold Wireless PS4 headphones and uploaded the game's custom profile to them. It makes terrific use of virtual surround sound and balances ambiance, effects, and background music well. This game features some of the best audio of any game I've played(+) Outstanding writing and acting, an adventurous science fiction tale that's often both thoughtful and funny, with plenty of memorable moments. The storytelling is strengthened by impressive, lifelike, and precise facial and body animations. If you enjoyed the animation in L.A. Noire this is several steps beyond that. The story is great, with an entertaining narrative and likable characters. Dialog feels genuine from the earliest moments of the game. The lead character Delsin is especially likable.(+) The gameplay is an overall refinement over previous installments. Locomotion and traversal are fluid and precise, granted variety by differing power sets. Traveling about the city is faster and more natural feeling than it was in inFamous 1 or 2.Aiming and general combat gets a huge boost thanks partly to the superior Dualshock 4 controller, but also swift movement and melee abilities that synergize well with context-sensitive range options. Within the first hour you're dodging bullets by transforming into smoke, throwing smoke-charged grenades and rockets, quickly making use of the environment to rapidly gain ground or position on packs of enemies, and more. Good utility use is made of the controller's touch pad and movement capabilities without feeling forced or gimmicky(+) A free content patch added an alternate reality game named \"inFamous Paper Trail\". Players complete missions in-game then review evidence and poke around on-line to unlock the next chapter. There is a plethora of content, and 95% of it is really good(+) The setting deserves a mention of its own. It's not an accurate representation of Seattle, Washington, and nearby rural areas, but it captures it in essence and spirit. It feels at times lifelike, and yet sensational - like the reimagining of a real city within a super hero comic. It's alive with sights and sounds, bright neon lights and painstakingly crafted architecture and signage. I spent some time after the first mission just soaring about several city blocks and taking in the view. The AI pedestrians increase in number as the game progresses, it seems, and have a handful or reactionary dialog and animationsOverall this is an incredible game. Fun, funny, gorgeous. It is easily the first game on any of the new consoles to be, without a doubt, \"next gen\". It hits you as soon as you start playing - \"oh yea, this is why I bought a new console\".","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2014"}

{"product_name":"B000084318","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"There's a great game under those graphics folks...","reviewText":"It's a controversy that was so massive, fights broke out(literally). No, this isn't Columbine, or the recent war in Iraq, or Clinton's sexcapades, it was the Legend of Zelda demo from Spaceworld 2001.  Instead of the ultra-realistic and \"mondo cool\" demo from 2000, we now have something that looks like Saturday Morning's cartoon lineup.  Admittedly, it's strange seeing my favorite characters(the 3 main ones in every Zelda) in cel-shaded graphics, the thought soon vanished afterwards.Story: Link is living on Outset Island and celebrating his birthday when his sister(another change from before) gives him the classic Green Tunic, then Link sees a girl being dropped in a nearby forest. He rescues her but then his sister, Aryll, is kidnapped by a big bird.  He then sets off on a rescue mission and gets caught up in the ancient legends of old.Graphics: People absolutely were divided on these graphics. Some liked the change, others said \"let me play it first\", others didn't give it a chance and just completely dismissed it saying they wouldn't even bother playing it at all, which is a shame cause these are just beautiful. Fluid animation, wide facial expressions and great bosses(dare you not to exclaim \"holy **** he's huge!\" if you get to the Dragon Roost Island boss).Sound/Music: It's not orchestrated, which is a bummer, but it's great music nonetheless.  Voice is basically like Ocarina/Majora(no actual speech, just the occasionally laugh, moan and scream).Gameplay: the critical factor with games and Zelda delivers, and then some. Taking the Z-targeting and making it L, it's pretty much the same as Ocarina/Majora.  Except now, Link has some new items, like a boomerang which can hit multiple targets.  Where the game loses points is the open sea. Yes, a huge portion of your playing time will be spent out on the sea, sailing.  It's cool the first time but after awhile you're like \"just get to the island already\".Regardless of your feelings towards the graphics, which shouldn't even be an issue in games, there's still a great game with a great story and solid gameplay under those Saturday morning visuals.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2003"}

Intuitive and easy to use, the Wii MotionPlus is compatible with a variety of Wii games to help you increase your accuracy and enhance your overall control.","reviewerName":"&#308;&#308;","summary":"Great game with just a few cons","reviewText":"Wii Sports resort is the sequel to Wii Sports, and it is just as fun if not more fun.  The problem is not only that there are repeat games from Wii Sports, but you are also required to have an accessory to the wiimote (the accessory is called the Wii Motion Plus), and you can't play the games without it.  There are 12 main sports, and there are 2-3 versions of that sport, so you are basically getting about 25 games.  The sports included are:Swordplay-This is the most active of the games, as you hold the wiimote as a sword and swing it at your target.  You can swing any way you want such as up to down, or right to left.Wakeboarding-This is the sport when you are on a board, and you are holding onto a rope and being pulled behind a boat.  You hold the wiimote horizonatlly in this game, and you yank it up in order to do tricks on top of waves.Archery-This is basically using a bow and arrow to hit a target.  You need the nunchuk for this game.  You hold the nunchuk in the right hand (unless you are left-handed, then you hold it in the left), and you pull back the nunchuk, holding onto the z button.  You release the z button when you want to release the arrow.Frisbee-You hold the wiimote like you would a frisbee, and you make the motion of tossing a frisbee in the direction you want it to go.  You might want to make sure you have the wrist strap on while playing this game.Basketball-You do dribble in this game, and you can press the A button or \"arrow\" buttons in order to pass to a teammate.  When shooting, you hold the B button pull back the Wiimote and throw.  You can also block an opponent's shot by yanking the Wiimote up in an effort to jump up and block.Power Cruising-This sport is basically riding a motorcycle on water.  You need the nunchuk for this game, and you hold both it and the wiimote like you would hold on to handlebars.  You twist the wiimote in order to accelerate.Cycling-This is bike riding.  You need the nunchuk, and you hold both it and the wiimote vertically.  Then you alternate swinging them upward as if you were pedaling your bike with your hands.  You have to watch your stamina, though, and don't tire out.Golf-This is exactly the same thing for Wii Sports, only it has different greens (different courses).  You hold the wiimote down like a golf club and make the action of swinging it.Table Tennis-This is much like tennis, only you are playing it on a table.  You swing the wiimote in order to hit the ping-pong ball back to your opponent.Bowling-Almost exactly like the Wii Sports verion, this game has one big difference.  Like a real bowling ball, it twists dramatically with your wrist.  You really have to focus on keeping the ball straight, which makes it a bit harder than the original game for Wii Sports.Canoeing-In this game you paddle a set course by using the wiimote like you would a paddle.  You paddle on the opposite side of the direction you want to go just like real canoeing.Air Sports-These games are really easy to do, and they only require you to hold the wiimote and aim it.  The sports included are skydiving, island flyover, and dogfight.These games are really fun, but it is a huge letdown that you cannot play against others unless you buy another Wii Motion Plus accessory.  Also, I do not see why they put golf, table tennis, and bowling in the game when they had them in previous games.  Although it does have a few minor flaws, this is still a great game that you will love if you like Wii Sports.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2010"}

Players can even customize their own hero or villain and upgrade them with an in-depth skill tree system that will increase their special abilities.","reviewerName":"Mithlas","summary":"Fair RPG, Decent Lord of the Rings Game","reviewText":"Before getting to the review, I want to correct falsehoods in the product description: it's fairly linear, not free-roaming, though once you finish an area you can return to it by loading a game save. There is no horse or warg riding, but it is nifty to be able to play as the bad guys in some of the boss/miniboss fights after you've beaten them as the good guys.Like many games set in the backdrop of a famous franchise, this game relies more on the setting to do its work than it does itself. While the characters aren't entirely vacuous, they're still fairly shallow and the story of 'your party coincidentally follows the fellowship, occasionally running into individual members for cameo appearances' just doesn't cut it for me, and when you boil it down that's pretty much what this is. The fact that the developers failed to try to mix things up - your party is a virtual copy of the Fellowship - also weakens the sense of immersion.Story: 3.0/10While the flames, flashes, and particle effects are all very solid, the motions still look relatively stiff. Fortunately, there also aren't major slowdowns, jags, or anomalies, so all in all the look is 'fitting'. If the franchise hadn't already done all its work for it, I might have given a higher score, but at least the characters look nice and they change appearance for each and every piece of equipment you put on them.Graphics: 6.4/10Like graphics, the sound is nothing much either way. It looks and sounds like the movie, and while not an engrossing retelling at least it's passing without being too cheap.Sound: 6.0/10Again, the game is using somebody else's hard work. Although, when you're going off the score by Howard Shore it's hard to go wrong. While it's still stealing from the movie, at least this is one area I have difficulty faulting it.Music: 8.0/10While the story and backdrop are most definitely not this game's strong point, I'll at least give credit to the decent RPG mechanics. Three members of your party stand up for battle (occasionally with a forth as a guest from the original Fellowship), and you earn proficiency to fill out a decent skill tree semi-unique to each member, and everybody has unique armor and equipment you can add that changes a detailed status layout giving a strategic element to an otherwise bland game. Only pity is that allocating skill points doesn't seem to do much - no matter how much speed you pour into your dwarf, he'll always go last. You'll run out of action points pretty quickly in the beginning, but you find an elfstone allowing you to create your own items like healing herbs or AP potions - while you can only use it in battle, at least it gives you more options and soon gives you freedom to act at will if you give it some patience.Gameplay: 7.8/10The only reason you'd replay this game is if you missed a piece of equipment the first time around - like many games, there's no special dungeon or game extension or reward for reaching the end. While you can unlock short clips from the film, if you've seen the extended edition of the trilogy (and you probably have if you're even looking at this game) then it won't be anything you haven't seen before. Still, being able to reload and practice in previous areas, as well as the bonus \"evil mode\" where you get to play boss battles *as the boss* is pretty fun, especially the fact that you get special goodies you can send to your party as a reward on your next load.Replayability: 4/10Despite having a weak story, the sight and sound is decent and while definitely not an ambitious RPG it is at least a decent one. Give it reasonable expectations on its own, and it will help you pass the time with a decent ambiance as a bonus. If you're expecting something as grand as the music from the trilogy, look elsewhere, but as an independent game it's a nice RPG.Overall: 6.9/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2009"}

You look around and around for enemies, then they're suddenly behind you.  I don't think I've ever been this scared by a video game:  there were several times when I suddenly found goosebumps on my arms.I think the thing that makes it so scary is not the blood, but the sound:  creaks, footsteps, etc.  If you listen to music while playing this game, this effect completely disappears.Gameplay was not original.  In fact, it's basically a zombie-shooting game where you move through a series of mazes and gradually acquire more powerful weapons.  Nothing groundbreaking in that regard.What I did think was excellent was the story behind the game:  it was well-written and convincing.  It involves a city beneath the sea where things have gone haywire.  If anything, the writing was a little convoluted for a zombie-shooting video game:  the whole thing with Atlas and Fontaine, for example, saw me clicking over to Wikipedia to find out what was supposed to be happening.This is not something you want to play around your family.  I think, really, that the thing is far more graphically violent than it needs to be, even more so than reality.  In other words, if you really went around blowing people away with a shotgun, I don't think the reality of that would be so messy.I thought it was very cool how the game had at least two separate endings, depending on the karmic nature of your behavior while playing.  Such that this is probably the first video game I've ever played where, when I finished, I immediately started again from the beginning, mainly to get the other ending.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2009"}

I'll ignore the DRM in this review and leave that decision up to you.Aside from the tiresome problem of DRM this game (actually, it's two full games) is really a blast. Riddick is an interesting combination of stealth, hand to hand combat and traditional shoot 'em up game-play paired with great graphics and a good story.The hand-to-hand combat is especially well done and incorporates a variety of weapons like shivs, knuckle dusters and clubs, each with their own special combos and counter attacks. The combat has a gritty, almost visceral quality to it that simply has to be experienced first-hand. The shooter aspects are pretty standard but cover all the bases, including some missed by more pure shooters (you can lean around corners and shoot out of cover, for example).For the most part you'll be sneaking around in areas you're not supposed to be, which means lots of crawling through vents and so forth. Riddick can do lots of cool things, like swing along hanging rails and ledges, which allows him to stealthily make his way through even the tightest security. Of course, it's a bit of a happy coincidence that there always happens to be a ladder or vent near every locked door, but I digress.Graphically this game is quite impressive but it will cost you a pretty good system to play it at the best settings. The environments and character models are quite detailed and feature extensive use of shadowing and reflections. The characters have life-like facial expressions and Riddick looks spot-on. The voice work is excellent although the dialogue is occasionally a bit ludicrous.It's worth pointing out that the bonus game, 'Escape from Butcher Bay', has been updated so that it looks and plays just like 'Dark Athena'. This means you really get two full, modern-looking games for the price of one.Highly recommended! Make your call regarding DRM and then acquire this game accordingly ;)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYLRK","description":"","reviewerName":"Vynny \"Vynrod\"","summary":"Ugh - another AC game ruined","reviewText":"Previous AC titles have had their fair share of frustrating parts - desync if caught, terrible tail and escort missions and 'playable' cut scenes that drag on and on. This culminated with the second most recent AC release, Brotherhood, which would have been stunning if not for everything past the god awful sequence 8 mission and beyond. However, Ubisoft redeemed themselves with the excellent Revelations which kept cut scenes to a fair minimum and missions wouldn't be canceled if you messed up, you simply wouldn't get full synchronization.Sadly, and I mean really disappointingly, Ubisoft have fallen back on their old ways with AC 3. To start there is a SEVEN HOUR tutorial. I kid you not it will take you around seven full hours of game play before you will truly be able to free roam in Boston and the frontier lands. I kept thinking to myself perhaps this IS the game - no real free roam just the pretense of it in which well, meh, but I'll soldier on and hope it gets better.Which it does. In fact it gets stunning with amazing landscapes and so very much to do it's kind of overwhelming. You start to appreciate exactly why you had such a long run up beforehand, as to simply throw you into free roam without sufficient preparation would mean you'd never know how much there is to do and how many ways to do it. So I was in my element. You can wander around Boston, fly through the trees of your homestead, sail the seas with awesome ship battles, all the time upgrading everything including new Assassin's clothes, weapons and so on. THIS was the AC 3 I was waiting for. Boy it's awesome!Sure there's a few tedious 'instant desync' missions which you'll do about ten times before getting it right and some of the graphics glitch here and there but nothing too unbearable.Until you hit... sequence 8! Yes Ubisoft have fooled me again. Great game until the game-breaker Sequence 8. It's completely 100% linear for the entire sequence and it goes on f...o...r...e...v...e...r. I just wanted to wander around New York city, buy some property and find the eagle vision sync spots etc. Instead it's a boring playable cut scene after playable cut scene in which your interaction is limited to small strolls or horseback rides about ten yards. And you know why you have to manually travel from one area to another only to be greeted by another cut scene? It's so your wireless controller doesn't go to sleep. That's why. It's not for artistic purposes, it's so they can show you fifty minutes of glitchy cut scenes and claim it's a sequence.And to finally kill the game for me, when you've done stupid sequence 8 you're out of the animus in a train station in Brazil as Desmond. No weapons, no cohorts, no radar, no free roam, no fun. Just no fun at all.I gave up. Please consider what you want out of an AC game. If you loved the free roam but hated the locked-off camera and tedious missions do bear in mind that this is the worst offender yet. I hark back to the simplicity of AC 1 and the gorgeousness of AC 2. This... this is just junk.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2012"}

Activision made a game that's actually fun?","reviewText":"The reason I became interested in this game is because I've never played a spiderman game before, so I was very curious. After reading several reviews, it appeared that this was the best of the lot, from a ps3 perspective. I'll be the first to admit that I had a few reservations about playing this game, mainly because I've had 'issues' with Activision games in the past.The combat - Overall, I had a blast while kicking butt in this game! Although Spiderman doesn't really possess any weaponry outside of his web, it was still fun to fight. As like many other games, you'll be able to perform a ton of combos that will keep the fighting pretty fresh. As you continue your quest, you'll be able to call on the aid of several of your favorite heroes and villains, depending on which path you take. The help of these superheros can result in some epic street brawls! The main combat tweak that sets Web of Shadows apart from other games in its genre is that you can change 'spiderman characters' on the fly. There's the traditional red Spidey, then there's the black, symbiote nasty Spidey. The cool thing is, they actually play pretty differently! Traditional Spiderman is very elusive and moves around very quickly. Black Spiderman is quite a bit stronger and can pick up cars and toss them. I won't tell you which Spidey I think is the best, I'll let you decide for yourself. *COUGHS black symbiote spiderman is superior COUGHS* I'm sorry about that, the pollen count is a little high, causes me to cough and sneeze everywhere...The bad guys - I was pleasantly surprised at the variety of enemies in this game! Usually with open world sandbox type games, you see the same recycled bad guys time and time again. But not in Web of Shadows, you'll see a nice variety of enemies; even on par with open environment games like inFamous. Yeah, I said it...on par with inFamous. Boss battles single handedly catapulted this game from a 4 star game, to 5 star territory. Many of the battles were varied, and you can't hack and slash your way past them, so don't even try it!Miscellaneous - I was very satisfied with the length of the game, it took me about a month to beat it, which is standard for me (I don't play everyday). There are side-missions you can do that serve as a nice distraction from the main storyline. Some of them are pretty fun, while others - not so much... If you're the type that enjoys collecting things, you may enjoy searching for hidden Spiderman symbols that help you level up, I think. The biggest issue I have with this game is the camera. I've heard about bad cameras plaguing videogames but this is the worst I've experienced. The camera can and will be the cause to numerous deaths because at times, you'll have no idea where you're at on the screen, while the enemies continue to pound you into submission. Although the camera was awful, it wasn't enough to knock a star off (pretty close though).Web of Shadows exceeded my expectations in every way imaginable. This game is more fun than people may realize, regardless of the not so great graphics. If you're on the fence, get it. The experience will be a breath of fresh air; especially when compared to some of the garbage that's out today. Happy gaming boys and girls :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2012"}

The deep combat system is the main reason why. It is like you can play with two different characters at the same time. Red Spiderman and black Spiderman both have different moves to use and you can switch between the two anytime you want. The moves and combos themselves can be very devestating and brutal making the action more intense and exciting. When you swing through downtown New York, it actually feels like you are swinging. You actually feel like Spiderman since the camera follows you during the swing. It is a great experience in a video game. Boss fights like Wolverine and Venom also stand out.

{"product_name":"B000E9TBRK","description":"Tetris DS is Tetris like you've never seen before! With six highly addictive modes of play, with single-player challenges & multiplayer matches. Each of the six modes of play features a theme based on a classic Nintendo game. It makes the most of the DS stylus and dual screens, and allows a Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to compete in two- or four-player battles.","reviewerName":"bixodoido","summary":"The best Tetris yet","reviewText":"I love Tetris--I have ever since the days of playing it on my original (bulky) Gameboy with the spinach colored screen and of the level 19 'secret' on the original NES console.  Over the years I've eagerly tested every new version of the game that comes out but have yet to find one that really captured the essence of the original for me.  Until now.Audience: Not only does Tetris DS provide a faithful version of classic Tetris for anyone wanting to relive the classic, there are also several new modes for the puzzle game enthusiast who may not be all that attached to Tetris but who loves a good puzzle game.Graphics: Well, it's a puzzle game, so of course graphics aren't a major thing.  All that matters is that the game looks good, which is does.  Tetris DS also includes classic NES characters and scenes from classic games, though, for added nostalgia (characters like Mario, Samus, Link, and Donkey Kong!), and those graphics are excellent while not being much of a distraction from the actual game.Gameplay: This is where this game surprised me.  I've always loved classic Tetris but have never been crazy about the 'spinoff' variations of it.  Well, Tetris DS provides several alternative forms of gameplay that are incredible.  There are six modes in all, and each of them provides a great variation on the game.  My favorites are push--a vs mode where you complete lines in an effort to push your opponent over a hazard line (which gives you the victory)--and tower mode, in which you've got a huge tower of pieces to manipulate and try to dismantle by completing lines.  Classic Tetris mode also allows you to acquire items for use against your opponent and the ability to store a piece for later.Control: Control is simple and straightforward.  You have the option of using the stylus (in touch mode) or of using the DS's controls.Challenge: Like most puzzle games, Tetris DS offers the ability to adjust the difficulty to fit each person's needs.  Some of the high level AI (in push mode, especially) is really tough.Multiplayer:  multiplayer options are amazing.  Up to 10 people can play using just one cartridge, and you can also link up with players around the globe for one of several multiplayer game options.This game is well worth getting.  Not only do you get a great version of the original Tetris, but you're also getting several other modes of play that provide hours upon hours of gaming entertainment.  I have played a lot of Tetris games in my day, and this is the best I've seen since the original.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2007"}
{"product_name":"B004NRN5EO","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"Caraculiambro","summary":"catnip for geeks","reviewText":"I'm stunned that everybody is talking about this game and that it's selling so well.  I mean, it's got nothing!  It's just pure gimmick.  How can I be the only one who sees that?Consider:  the story is awful.  Most of the time you don't know what you're trying to accomplish or why.  You spend the first half of the movie attempting to ring a couple of bells, for example, but you never learn why this is necessary.  Then you have to collect a bunch of souls.  It's never explained why this is necessary:  it's just that it's stipulated that it is before you're permitted to move on to the next level.  What's stopping me from simply marching off to Gwyn's headquarters, doing battle with him, and taking his job forthwith without further ado?  Beats me.I can think of a long list of other reasons why this game is totally forgettable.  The interface is poorly done (think of how awkward it is to equip items, sell something, or search your inventory).  The characters are silly (e.g., Mushroom people?  A giant floating worm?  That's the best you can do?).  The graphics are unremarkable (think of the way water looks in this game, such as when one of the hydras shoots at you).  Even the setting makes no sense (like I'm so sure there'd be merchants setting up shop in in the middle of the battlefield).And the combat!  The combat is very awkward.  For the most part it consists of just one cheap shot on you after another.  Boss fights are confusing because the bosses are so huge that your view is typically obstructed by the posterior of some giant demon.  You can't even see your guy, so most of the time you're just swinging wildly.Most unforgivably, you can't pause!  What infernal innovation is this?  A video game that's intensive is one thing:  a video game that punishes you for having children or wanting to answer the phone is something else entirely.Despite all these things, I managed to make it all the way through this game.And I would have to say, of all video games I've played, this was the worst, the most hateable.  You might think you've played an unfair, sadistic video game before. Hah!  You don't know from sadism until you've played this.  The whole time I was playing it, it was like being in an abusive relationship.  You don't want to back out of it because you told all your friends and family you were doing it, but it gives you no joy when you're with the person.That's what I'll remember about this game:  it gave me no joy.  With other games, you might hoop and holler when you accomplish something.  In this game, when you beat a boss monster or survive a level, you find yourself with a dirty \"that's it?  that's all I get?\" kind of feeling.Have you ever driven down to some government office, struggled to find parking, and then waited in line, only to learn that you didn't bring some document you needed?  Remember the feeling you had driving home?  Well, that's the feeling you'll have when playing this game:  a unrewarding waste of time that provides no delight, no satisfaction, and no sense of getting anywhere.In fact, this game only has one thing, one claim to fame.  It's very difficult.  Not enjoyable, original, mind-blowing, genre-expoding, or even immersive; no, no --  just difficult.Soon after this game was released there was a video online of a guy who raced through the entire game in about 1.5 hours, using some sort of cheat.  Seeing that helped me understand something about this game:  see, if the game played like normal video games (such as Skyrim or Diablo), you'd be done with the entire thing in about 4 or 5 hours.  That's how little there is here.But coding all that content is expensive, so what I imagine the gamemakers did once they were about a third of the way through the coding was say, \"Hey, instead of doing all that pesky level-creation, let's just ratchet up the difficulty instead!\"  It's a substitute for game content, you see.  Make the hits of monsters incredibly damaging, while having your hits be puny.  And every time you die, you have to do everything all over again.  That way, the game will take you hundreds of hours before you can complete it and feel like a full game.Making it so difficult was clever in another way, too:  Geeks are notoriously competitive, so even though the game aggressively has no story, content, originality, etc., there's still a sizeable subculture of geeks out there who will be drawn to the game merely so they can boast that they got through it.  Enough at least to make producing such a game financially worthwhile for a software company.But \"difficult\" is not even the word for what this game is.  A more precise phrase would be \"infuriatingly repetitive.\"  When you die, as I say, all the enemies repopulate.  But they're all in the exact same spots and attack you in the exact same ways and at the exact same moment every time you draw near.  So to beat the level, all you have to do is learn how to hit here, run to there, shield up here, arrow there, etc. at the correct times.  In other words, the fact that you're getting more skillful at the game is an illusion:  you're actually just memorizing a maze, like those guys who used to memorize patterns in Pac-Man.What would true difficulty look like?  Howabout having the nature, number, timings, and strategies of the monsters changing with every attempt to clear an area?  That way, clearing an area would truly be a matter of skill and quick thinking rather than simple memorization.Perhaps you say, no, no; you don't get it!  The whole point of the game is to be sadistic.  It's for people who like to play sadistic games!If that's the case, you masochists need to ramp up your standards, for if sadism is what draws you to this game, it's also going to prove a let-down in that area.After all, your character can defend himself.  Not just that, but your character can get more powerful.  One can try and try again to clear an area.  The game's rules make a kind of internal sense. And most importantly, the game is finishable.You find this satisfyingly sadistic?  Hah!  Move over.  Here's some ideas for a sadistic game:  levels that cannot be completed because you come across locked doors to which there is no key; powerful items in merchants' inventories that are always out of stock; monsters that can damage you but cannot be damaged in turn; puzzles that cannot be solved by any means; instructions that cannot be followed; floors that suddenly give way below you, without your being able to do anything about it; monsters that arbitrarily change their resistances; weapons that suddenly break; traps that cannot be avoided; spells that suddenly don't work; savegame files that become corrupted for no discernbile reason.  Or how about this:  every time you die, it randomly deletes savefiles from other games on your PS3.  Or how about, most evilly, a game that couldn't be finished by any known means?  Now THAT would be sadism.In comparison to such a vision, this game is child's play -- sadism light.  What I'm saying is that if agony is your bag, you should also account this game a failure because it only glancingly provides it.When this game finishes, it sends you right back, willy-nilly, to the beginning for something called NG+, which is supposed to be much harder.  Folks, I immediately popped the game out of my console, never tempted for a second to open that cursed cell door.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2012"}

So it's hard to truly impress me.  I love games, so I play lots of them and have fun with them, etc.  But to really impress me, a game has do to something I've never seen before.  And this one does that, and how.  It complexity, depths, and breadth of a ginormous open world console/pc game, and puts into a console that you can play while sitting on an airplane, or in the car, or on the toilet...etc...etc.  Stunning.When the Vita launched, I would marvel at how beautiful Uncharted:  Golden Abyss was while playing it...but this game is on a whole different level.  Uncharted was very linear in scope, and so the technical achievement there isn't quite as impressive.  This game though...it's truly like picking up a PS3, cramming it into a tiny little handheld, and playing it anywhere.  The depth of the world in this game is stunning.  I find myself ignoring the task at hand, and climbing to the highest tower, and just taking a few minutes to look around.  It's breathtaking...and you can play it on the toilet!  What a world we live in.It opens up the idea that ANY game could work on the vita.  They should totally remake arkham city for this system..totally.As for gameplay, it's assassin's creed through and through.  If you like those games, you will like this game.  It doesn't really stray from the script there.The plot is ok, and keeps the game moving along.  Nothing mind blowing, but good enough.  Aveline is an excellent character, with a great back story and I find myself rooting for her as I am slashing up red coats.The multi-player, at this point...I just don't get it.  It's a complete loss for me...I fiddled around with it, but just couldn't figure out exactly what the point was.  It's kind of like Risk, but not exactly...strange choice, for sure.  If it were up to me, I would have just left it out.The only downside to the game are a few bugs, and some framerate drops when things get hectic.Otherwise, what is there to complain about...it's a console quality game in the palm of your hand.

BUT, and this is huge, if you are a solo gamer (like me) this game can get hard and cheap with so many enemies you can barely get out alive or with any ammo left. I tried to play the True Vault Hunter Mode (available after you beat the game the first time) and died three times at the first boss (Boom Bewm. Just way too hard. And that sapped the fun. And took two stars off.UPDATE: After writing the review I've stayed up past midnight four straight days playing this. I can't stop. I think about it at work. I Google info, easter eggs, wiki entries for the game. I constantly am hoping/looking for the best loot and guns. I am beyond addicted. I honestly haven't had this much fun or addiction to a game since the SNES. This isn't really the BEST game I've ever played, but it is quite possibly the most FUN game I've ever played.ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS:I'm average, at best, at FPS. I've dabbled, and enjoyed, Halo 1&2, MW 2&3, BioShock 1&2 and a few other FPS games. I tend to enjoy the campaigns more in the style of BioShock and Uncharted. I like to collect. I like to hunt for better gear, and I like the occasional fun, challenging, but winnable fire fight.I should have known I would love BL2.... because the combinations of humor, fun, solid controls and LOOT was perfectly aligned with what I wanted!I rented a copy from RedBox and preceded to play it nonstop for 2-3 days then eventually bought a copy because I never stopped thinking about playing that game.I'm only level 7 on my new character but this has been a blast so far. Can't wait to keep unlocking and using guns, guns and more guns! Guns that get thrown and explode like grenades when you reload. Guns that set people on fire. Pistols with crazy zoom that can fire 55 bullets in a clip. Shotguns that fire three shells and electrocute... so many possibilities for crazy, fun carnage!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2014"}

But this game is done real nice: Even from the start, the menu has that kooky background music from several Ghostbuster scenes - it's fun.  There's a little movie at the start - kinda like the intro to an actual movie, which is cool.  The gameplay itself is cool - certainly looks nice and it's awesome they got everyone to chip in for voices (THANK YOU Bill for signing up!).-But the gameplay isn't perfect.  There's no map.  Sometimes you're told to follow someone, only to have no idea where they are or where you're supposed to go.  I can't bring up a big map to see where they are in relation to ME.  Also, the gameplay is also odd in that once you have a ghost, do you throw a trap or wait for them to?  It's a little weird.-I like the re-load button for the pack - I wondered how they'd handle that since the proton packs don't use \"ammo\".  I thought the cool-off period works nicely.  The gameplay is smooth and fun.  A bit repetitive, but it's all right.  Different than most first-person-shooters out there.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2010"}

Enter an exciting gameplay environment that authentically recreates the whimsical time period of the film and expands the lore and supernatural events that seemingly plague New York City.","reviewerName":"Russell Wayne Brown \"CriticalBill\"","summary":"We Have the Tools!!!!","reviewText":"The Ghostbusters first came into light in movie form back in 1984 and with some of the, at the time, top comedic talents became in a huge hit.  The Ghostbusters then returned for the next movie in 1989.  And now in the form of a video game, after countless spinoffs...we have a 3rd installment all with the original cast(only missing Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis), with that said, if your a fan of the movies you owe it to yourself to get this game.Once you pop in the disk and load it up, you're treated like your part of the next installment of the franchise.  The story takes place a few years after part 2 ended.  The new rookie (you the player) will be tagging along with the group as a guinea pig of sorts to test out new equipment.  Here the plot unfolds in front of you as Peter, Ray, Egon, end Winston trade dialogue and watch a few cut scenes'.  The positive to all this is the story and the dialogue are a treat to watch and hear.  Listening to Murray try to pick up ladies while on the job is great fun.  Even Ramis and Aykroyd's \"sciences\" jargon is really cool and makes any fan all giddy inside.  Trust me the story doesn't disappoint.With that out of the way, lets get to the rest of what's important, game play.  The game plays as a 3rd person shooter but rather then guns your shooting your trusty Proton Packs.  The beam is used to weaken ghosts until you can hold them with it.  Then just toss a trap, move them over it and watch them get sucked in.  Capturing ghost is one of the best features and feeling in the game...and it's a good thing to because you'll be snagging them left and right.You'll also be able to test out some of the new and old equipment.  The PKE Meter is now in your hands and when you switch to it you'll be in First Person with night vision looking around.  The new equipment has you testing out a Slime Pack (like in part 2), Stasis Beam (slows enemies down), and a Guided Rapid Fire Beam.  All of them are fun and useful against different ghost.  For example if you a ghost possess someone then you'll have to slime them down so the ghost will be released.  Getting ghosts and finding different artifacts around the levels will give you money to purchase upgrades like steady streams and faster trapping.The graphics are a nice welcome as well.  The major standout is the models and the, in particular, the proton packs all look really nice.  The proton packs moves and changes in lights and structure based on what beams you have equip.  The ghosts look really well also.  Throwing things at you and flying through walls adds to the satisfaction of capturing one.  The environments are all outstanding and really set the games mood over all.  Everything from the Ghostbusters Station to the sewers all has a nice look and feel to them.  You'll also find a ton of Easter eggs that fans will enjoy.Overall this game is a joy to play and I recommend it anyone who is interested.  If you're a fan of the movies I'm sure you already got a copy of it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2009"}

For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience.

{"product_name":"B002I0H79C","description":"Gears of War 3","reviewerName":"Stephen M. Lerch","summary":"Great game, great close to the trilogy","reviewText":"I've only spent a few short hours with the campaign and some of the Horde 2.0, but so far, this game is turning out to be exactly what Epic and Microsoft promised, an amazing close to a great game series.Additions to the core campaign most people will like would be 4 player co-op. Always wanted that in the previous games, but the way they were designed it really only felt right with 2 players. This time every mission requires a team of 4, which means real 4 player co-op is possible and quite fun. Playing the campaign alone isn't bad, but as I've read in reviews and agree, it really is meant to be played with real people. Playing with the equivalent of bots allows you to enjoy the game but it won't be as rich of an experience in my opinion.You still have the cog tag collection hunt, along with the little collectible bits of paperwork strewn throughout the game just as in previous games in the series.Another cool addition, for those playing co-op, is the arcade mode. In this mode you still play the core campaign but everyone is scored. Depending on amount of kills, rescues and so on you get a score. It doesn't really do much but add a taste of competition to the 2-4 player campaign, but it definitely adds to the fun factor.Horde 2.0 is a ton of fun. The addition of \"buying\" emplacements and so on really adds to the depth. For those that love the original Horde from Gears 2 though, the hardcore lovers of the mode, you might be a touch disappointed that it's been changed. For me, it's a change for the better.There are a ton of other multiplayer modes that I just haven't gotten to yet, but I will update my review when I finally get a chance to play them.Graphically this game is nothing short of amazing. Unlike previous games in the series there doesn't seem to be any screen tearing in the campaign (EDIT- later in the game there was some minor tearing). I haven't experienced any in the Live modes I've played, but reserve commenting further until I spend more time with it. In the Beta there was screen tearing galore, so I'm hoping they focused on fixing it for release.Music is Steve Jablonsky (Gears Of War 3 The Soundtrack). If you enjoyed the music in Gears 2, you'll enjoy it here as well. Orchestral, moody and pitch perfect for the scenes in which the music plays. I miss the Gears 2 title screen song, but hey, this is Gears 3 and it needs to be refreshed.Sound effects and voice work are equally amazing. All the voice actors from the previous games make appearances here as well, including fan favorite Cole. Really high quality work.Over all the game feels like a truly worthy upgrade to a truly classic series. I'll miss the further adventures of Marcus and gang, assuming we don't really see a sequel or extension (highly unlikely, right). It's like closing a chapter with friends.Definitely worth $60. I bought theGears of War 3 Epic Editionand love it, but the game on its own stands tall.EDIT 9/21/2011 - I've now spent a total of 10 hours in the campaign. This is me playing from Act 1-1 to Act 2-6 on my own, then playing through the same with my 65 yr old father. We were both having a blast with it. We also had a few people join the party and we went through part of Act 2 w/ 4 people. Despite the larger amount of people there were still plenty of Grubs to kill for everyone and still had some challenge to it. With 4 decent player characters though, even hardcore is a touch \"easy.\"BEAST MODE- this is one awesome addition to the franchise! You and a party of up to 4 other people (5 total) take control of the Locust and get to try and kill as many humans as possible. It uses a money concept similar to the emplacements and weapons in Horde 2.0 (which also feels a lot like the way it works in say, Call of Duty Black Ops zombie bits). You have to purchase your Locust and as you kill more people, you get more money, which enables you to buy better and better Grubs, all the way up to a Berserker, which is awesome! If you only have 30 minutes to play Gears and have some buddies on Live, this is a fast paced, frenetic jump of fun for sure!NEW WEAPONS- the sawed off shotgun is the weapon of choice for many a multiplayer fan. I'm personally not big on the tactics used w/ the weapon in multiplayer but once you get the hang of it, it makes a decent up close weapon. In the campaign though it's not really a weapon you should be using. You have to get far too close to enemies to kill them, and in the case of the Drudges, you don't want to be near them when they blow up!Retro Lancer isn't bad. The handling is different, the active reload timing is different and using it like a spear takes getting used to. It seems to be more powerful than the chainsaw Lancer, but they built it to feel like a prototype of the chainsaw version, so they did a good job making it feel like an evolution from the retro to the regular. Good stuff!The Digger - you fire a projectile towards an enemy, it burrows underground and pops up near the enemy and explodes. It can be pretty devastating if you can get it to hit.That's all for this edit. Thanks for reading!EDIT- 9/23/2011Played more campaign last night. I now have at least 15 hours on the campaign. For those of you that have read the campaign is really only 10-15 hours, I've replayed Act 1-3 w/ my father over Live and we made it to Act 4 last night and watched the story bits every time which is why it is taking so long to finish.After spending this much time with the campaign, I have to say I continue to be impressed. There is one level that I think will be the best in the game. It's Act 3 Chapter 1, which I won't name as I don't want to give anything away in my review, and it is simply astounding. It was frantic, it was hectic and 100% fun. I actually wanted to jump out and restart the mission when it was over.And what happens at the end of Act 3 Chapter 6 is unexpected and for me at least, quite emotional. You'll understand when you get there and do yourself a favor, try not to read any spoilers on-line.I'm hoping to finish the campaign tonight or early this weekend, at which point I'll stop editing my review.With 15 hours into the game, I can still say that this is definitively the best Gears game of the 3 which is absolutely no small feat. With all the multiplayer modes, all of which are amazing fun and a decently lengthy campaign which can be played w/ up to 3 other people, there should be enough to keep you busy for some time to come. Definitely worth the price.EDIT 9/24/2011-Finished the campaign last night with my father. From start to finish I would say the game took 12 hours. This includes us dying, watching cut scenes, listening to dialog and so on. If you buy the game for the single player campaign, you might find this to be a bit too much money for too little time spent, HOWEVER, with the multiple difficulties and the ability to play with arcade scoring on, I'm sure you'll have fun going through at least 3 times, though subsequent play throughs will take less time given you'll skip cut scenes and dialog. So figure 6-9 hours per campaign play through, which means you will get 24-30 hours play time out of it, minimum.The game is well balanced. There wasn't really any level or any section of the game where myself, nor my father, felt the difficulty spiked unevenly. Given this is Epic, I didn't think this would be an issue and it isn't.The game is a ton of fun and with all of the multiplayer game types you can probably play this game quite a lot and never find yourself bored.This will most likely be my last edit. Enjoy the game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0001VGFK2","reviewerName":"Acoma","summary":"Surprisingly Good...","reviewText":"As a father I fully expected this to be a game tailored for the average 14 year old. I was very mistaken, on advice from a friend I picked it up to see what the hype was about. What it turned out to be was an extremly FUN game. This is what the entire game is about...fun. Not only is it fun, but the story is extremly well done. Not to mention the voice acting talent they got onboard for this game; Peter Fonda, Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Penn, Ice T and the list goes on and on.It very much feels like you are engrossed into a major motion picture centered around a protagonist from South Central L.A. who recently arrives from the East Coast upon hearing his mother's death. Immediately upon arriving your character (Carl Johnson) is thrown into a very deep plot. The main character was also a refreshing surprise as most games out there don't depict a black guy as the protagonist, and not only is it a good character but breaks out of certain stereotypes. Does he speak slang ebonics? Sure...but he's also very intelligent and witty. Thumbs up on that.As mentioned by other folks, there is a LOT to do. There is a main plotline and most of the \"quests\" have to do with the main story and there are a BUNCH. The greatest appeal of the game is the fact you aren't limited in what you can do. You can do SO much...Fly planes, Sky Dive, Drive, etc. Practicaly every vehicle in the game is interactive and you can hop onboard or in the driver's seat and cruise along whether it be in the skies, highway or offroading.For those whom have a moral skepticism about this game, I would say give it a chance. It's worth your money, but just don't play it with your kids around. There is a lot of adult language in this game to say the least.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000038IFX","reviewerName":"Richard Veysey","summary":"a timeless story of fighting for what is right (and love)","reviewText":"After playing Xenosaga, I was quite eager to pick this game up in some way.  Unfortunately, somehow Crash Bandicoot made the greatest hits collection, and great games like Xenogears are forgotten, but I was fortunate enough to drop the name near a kid who had a cousin who had a copy, which I was glad to purchase, since the cousin didn't like it.I must admit, I was somewhat disappointed with the battle system.  Although it can be fun at times, it lacked the luster that the Materia and Sphere Grid systems had in the world of Final Fantasy, simply making battles mediocre button pushing.  The slightly dull combat system wouldn't have been so bad if battles had taken any strategy, but, for the most part and with a few exceptions near the very end, battles are mostly just using your strongest combo and healing yourself when necessary.  Once you get Billy in your party, you become practically invincible, since he is able to heal the entire party for more than 300 HP for a paltry 4 EP.  The best aspect of the game's combat system, however, would be the gear system.  Although not used as well as in Xenosaga, Xenogears makes gear combat fun by separating it from the status of the characters, but also giving the gears abilities based on the abilities of the character riding them.  Fighting in gears, however, is always done in a way that you can't win without them, or you can't use them.  The only times you'll have access to your gears is on the world map and in places with large enemies that would crush a party on foot.  This is once again a place where SquareSoft could have added strategic elements (benefits of battling in gear Vs. on foot, an element used brilliantly in Xenosaga), yet decided to opt for simpler battles for a more complex story line.The music in Xenogears, composed by the brilliant Yasunori Mitsuda of Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross fame, was terrific for it's time, but with the quality sound that the PS2 is able to put out, Xenogears music will just get dull, especially to the ear of one who has played Xenosaga.  Also, like in many other RPGs, Xenogears music is extremely repetitive, especially during the second disc.  The theme song for this game was done by Joanne Hogg, and is verysimilar to the theme songs from Xenosaga, using the exact same instrumentation and style, yet Hogg's voice just has that enchanting quality which I haven't yet tired of.Xenogears' story is where it shines, and earns its entire five stars.  Xenogears takes elements of religion, fantasy, and sci-fi and mixes them to create the uplifting, suspenseful story of youngFei's search for the truth (and escape from it) in a world of lies.  Enter the character of Elhaym, the beautiful soldier who happens to stand at odds with Fei due to her birth and origin, who changes Fei forever by showing him the joy of love.  Each character has his or her individual motive, from the villains to the heroes, each trying to find what they most desire.  Some wish for power, others for love, and others simply answers to life's most difficult questions.  From the beginning of the first disc, you are propelled from Fei's quiet existence in a small village in the woods toward the flying cities of Shevat and Solaris to the paradise Mahanon.  The second disc, unfortunately, falters, as the action is greatly reduced, and the game becomes almost a series of monologues telling us what happened and how.  For a good example, imagine if the scene whereLuke and Han rescue Princes Leia in Star Wars were replaced with Luke and/or Han sitting in a chair saying, \"We then traveled to the Death Star to save the Princes.  We found out that she was being held in a certain cell and saved her, but on the way out, we encountered some guards (picture in background of the heroes and storm troopers engaged in fighting), we only survived by jumping down a hole into a trash compactor...\" etc.  This gets somewhat obnoxious, but I'm sure that this was only done to save space and avoid the obvious irritation of having a third disc for the end movies.  If you're completely into the game's story, you won't mind the dialogue bits too much, since they allow you to skip over some annoying bits that would keep you from getting to the incredible conclusion.For those Xenosaga Fans out there, this game will make a great hold over until Feb. 15, when Episode 2 comes out.

I Particularly enjoy the Swimming in the game and spend half of my time Swimming with my online character....the other half is spent riding around the ghetto as Franklin and Michael taking out Ballers and Vagos. this is hands down by far the Best Produced and Made GTA game in the series and im Amazed they were actually able to pull it off on the PS3.my ONLY group of complaints is why was so much left out of the game???? where are the Turf Wars??? Drug Wars??? why so few interiors???? wheres the gambling???? wheres the home invasions???? all of these things were in Previous GTA's....yet None of them show up in GTA5 which is puzzling considering you do Have Gangs in the game and one of the main characters is a self proclaimed Drug Dealer, yet theres no side activities for these things??? I think R* should have spent less energy focusing on making a HUGE city with excessive amounts of mountain and water and instead, focused on giving us more detailed interiors and activities.as far as Online is concerned, I do enjoy the open world theme but I liked the way it was with GTA4 where you could just Find a deathmatch or whatever game you wanted to play and be thrown into it. I can honestly say the 2 weeks iv spent with the game, I havnt been able to find a decent Deathmatch at all, everyone just wants to freeroam.Overall, this is a GREAT car driving game that reminds me a lot of Midnight Club LA and it is fun to just drive around, rob some stores, shoot at some goons, visit the strip club, etc but it could have been so much more. I would have atleast liked a small city with some gambling and casino's and maybe the ability to own a casino and protect it with hired men against other gangs....and a lot more turf war, hitman and drug war missions. all of these things would have made this the best GTA of all.....but until they release DLC adding all this, its just an Alright game that's been Well Produced.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2014"}

I was also worried about a big forced install and there isn't one.  This game could be better in many aspects especially when compared to its lineage, but if you are into playing as Vector and other old and new baddies from the RE universe and enjoy the mercenaries mode from 4&5, you will enjoy yourself. The controls feel good with the X button having a few too many functions in the heat of action and the controls becoming frustrating during certain final battle. At least I can customize my controls(shootR2) unlike RE:5.  The storyline is a rehash with newly illuminated plot details and while it is nowhere near the revelation that is Revelations and is more akin to the action packed pacing of Mercenaries I am confident that RE fans will enjoy themselves.  The game has excellent SFX and looks solid graphically.  Movement and animations are pretty good but not quite up to RE standards when scrutinized.  Some of the boss fights are annoying in a bad way and the trophies are more than half focused on multiplayer/online. I am having fun even when I am seeing the YOU'RE DEAD screen for the 20th time because my AI teammates aren't utilizing pickups etc.. 3&1/2 stars for the single player campaign which gets better as it progresses and you utilize your built up XP points.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2012"}

This adds a completely new dimension to sports, racing, fighting, and more games. Aside from the Start and Select buttons, all of the functions are analog for greater control, a wider variety of operations, and a more compelling interactive experience.

This controller is also compatible with all software that supports the original Dual Shock controller.","reviewerName":"Edward \"war02orc\"","summary":"Definately a great buy","reviewText":"First off, Sony does not support or recommend ANY third party products.  This is for a very good reason.  Sony has standards all companies have to meet in order to be supported (bear the PS2 or PS logo).  Most third party equipment is made below these standards in order to cut costs.  I have found that most third party equipment I have owned has broken very easily, caused my ps2 to malfunction, or even damaged supported sony licenced equipment.  Any damage caused to your PS2 or equipment is NOT covered under sony's warrentee if the damage was caused by a 3rd party device.Next, the layout couldn't be much better.  The 2 joysticks are located very comfortably and all the buttons and very easily accessed.  The D-pad isn't in the greatest spot for some games, but most have either no commands for the d-pad or have commands that won't have to be accessed in a hurry.  If you like the layout of the PSone controllers, you will like this one.  The ps2 controllers can also take one hell of a beating without breaking (I have dropped it in water, spilled soda on it, thrown it at the wall, stepped on it, etc. and it still works fine).Finally, there is the addition of pressure sensitivity.  ALL the buttons are now pressure sensitive, not just the joysticks.  This plays a major role in many games on the PS2.  Some games will not work with controllers that are not pressure sensitive because the pressure sensitivity is needed (ex: The Bouncer requires this.  The harder you press the button, the more damage your attack does.)Overall, Sony did a great job with their PS2 controller.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00006HBTW","description":"It&#x92;s a pretty bold claim but for many,Mario Partyis the best multiplayer game series ever. No need for guns or complicated role-playing elements here--Mario Partyis fun because it&#x92;s simple. The original N64 game created an entirely new subgenre--an unlikely combination of traditional board games and lots of ultrasimple arcade titles. The idea is that you travel around the board trying to collect stars, which must be paid for with coins, and you get coins by competing in minigames, which occur at the end of every round. These minigames generally don&#x92;t last longer than a minute or two, and many are based on oldGame & Watchtitles. There are over 50 minigames inMario Party 4, and each involves either a free-for-all, two players against two, or one against three (depending where you land on the board at the end of your turn). These can involve anything from skydiving to basketball dunking, or car racing to hide-and-seek, to name a few.Admittedly, this basic description of the gameplay might not sound too exciting, and indeed if you&#x92;re playing with less than three human opponents it can be pretty tedious. But play it with the full complement of non-virtual rivals and the game&#x92;s infinite capacity for cheating, backstabbing, and ganging up allows it to completely transcend the humdrum sum of its parts. There&#x92;s nothing terribly new in this third sequel except that the graphics are much improved and the minigames are all new, but that really misses the point: get this game out at Christmas instead ofTrivial Pursuitand you&#x92;ll wonder how you ever got through the holiday without it.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Lawrence E.

Not necessarily in gameplay, story, or anything else of that sort.  I guess the only way to articulate it would be in it being an overall fun, enjoyable and positive experience.Not saying that this game isn't fun, nor enjoyable, nor positive...it's just not so to the degree those other two titles are.More specifically, this game seems to be a mash up of God of War and Castlevania Lords of Shadow with some VERY light RPG mechanics.  The graphics are quite wonderful, music is appropriate, and the general look of the game is quite grand.Where this game stumbles, for me at least, is the time limit.  Yes, I know this is the entire point of the game and is an important story element.  However, I hate the feeling of being rushed as do I quite dislike the prospect of having to back track to the game's hub to give the female character an item to extend the game's time limit.  It's just a pain.Not to mention, I found myself having to block out a chunk of time which I knew I could dedicate solely to gaming in order to knock out each tower without interruption and without having to seek time extensions.

Garrelts","summary":"Wireless Perfection","reviewText":"If you've used a Sony Playstation at any point over the last 10 or so years you pretty much know what to expect with the Dualshock 3. The size, shape and layout of the DS3 is almost identical to the original Dualshock controller that was released for the Playstation 1. Chances are if you liked using any of the previous Sony brand controllers you'll also enjoy using the Dualshock 3. Similarly, if any of the previous Dualshock controllers weren't quite right for you then you'll probably dislike the DS3.Slight changes have been made to the shoulder buttons and the addition of a'PS' button allows for quick start-up and shutdown of the PS3 as well as access to the PS3 X-Cross Media Bar.The L2 & R2 shoulder buttons are now less 'button' and more 'trigger'. Personally I'm mixed on the new layout. The trigger design works great in certain games such as racing games; but can be less than perfect for platforming or action games.The DS3 features the exact same motion sensitivity featured in the Sony SIXAXIS controller for the PS3. The major addition of the DS3 being the rumble feature. In using the DS3 for approximately 6 months it has become my controller of choice. Simply put the DS3 offers a level of immersion into games that the SIXAXIS cannot offer. The actual amount of rumble varies from game to game and many games even offer the ability to adjust the rumble feedback.Also improved over the SIXAXIS is the feel of the DS3 controller. Because of the added weight afforded by the rumble mechanism the DS3 feels heavier and more appropriate than the lightweight SIXAXIS.Because the DS3 is wireless it relies on a built-in battery to power the controller. Battery life is comparable to that afforded by the SIXAXIS which is approximately 8-10 hours. In my experience charging the DS3 to a full charge takes about 30 minutes to 1 hour.The DS3 relies on Blutooth technology to power the wireless feature. Range is excellent and advertised to be about 30ft. Suffice to say that I've never experienced a problem with regards to wireless range.All told the DS3 is the premier Playstation controller. Well built and sturdy the controller will last through many gaming sessions. I highly recommend the DS3 to any gamer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00000K1VA","reviewerName":"J. N. K \"Esco\"","summary":"A Scary and Explosive Thrillride That Just Never Stops!","reviewText":"This game is extream fun and entertainment, let alone being an awesome game itself.  I felt once again like I was taking part in an adrenaline pumping movie once again, only this time, with more killing than ever before.  To write this review, I will split the game into three sections: what was good, what was bad, and what made me really love this game.Now I will list the goodies.  Well, to start off, just look at it; if you notice, the graphics are crisp and insanely detailed.  If that weren't good enough, the cinematics are also incredibly intense and clear, and they tell the story rather well.  What's good about the cinematics however is that they are very well directed and carry the mood perfectly.  The mood of this game is magnificant, it's like a blend of fear, anger and depression all at once.  The music supports these emotions, which is esspecially good when they focus on a single emotion.  Also, the sound is great, another advancement over the sounds of the previous entry.  I loved the voice acting and the new clicking sounds to the guns, as opposed to the old popping sounds of gunplay.  The gameplay is almost perfect as now you can auto-aim at the zombies, but not make it super-fake looking like it was in the original.The plot though, like RE2, is the backbone of the game.  The characters in this game are well done and all play roles in the story.  The story constantly increases the intensity as you are pitched up against bigger and badder dudes, esspecially Nemesis.  The opening was awesome, and this game has one of the most emotional endings I have seen for the PSX (not quite Final Fantasy level).However, there are setbacks to this awesome game, as I will now mention.  I will have to state that the storyline wasn't as gripping as in RE2, nor as complicated with multiple scenarios.  The cinematics, while the finest I have ever seen, are very short in length, so their overall effect isn't as high as I could have hoped.  Also, after beating the game so many times, this game is now to me very easy for I know Nemesis' weaknesses, and can easily exploit them (email me for free tips).  Also, the music isn't for the most part as good or scary or sad as in RE2.  However, some of the tunes at the very end are absolutely astounding and alone are worth purchasing the soundtrack (well, I did just for those three tracks).Now, I will tell you my favorite aspect of this game, my reason for giving it a five star rating without any hesitation.  The reason is that it satisfies my male cravings to kill and win.  Nemesis follows you around so much that instead of getting annoyed, you get ....  He constantly lowers your overall ammo amount and forces you to use up healing items.  As you fight him, you lust nothing more than to give Nemesis as much pain as you can give to him; you want him to die a horrible death.  In all the times you fight him, he passes out when you win, and that's the end.  Then, the second to last time you fight him, you can use acid faucets to melt parts of him away.  You can take off his arms, and even his head.  And the last time you fight him, you set up the puzzle, and while you wait, you can unleash whatever firepower you want on him; there's no passing out and allowing your escape, the last battle is a battle of REVENGE!  I loved that, and I think any player who likes thrilling and fun games would love this game too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2001"}

It is a nice change of pace from playing COD.  A major reason i bought this game is because they added Team Deathmatch to their multiplayer game types.  In my opinion thats is the funnest game type.  Very fast paced, and close combat.  The other modes i really don't care for.  Conquest, and Rush seem to be all about who can hop in the tanks first and just unload.  I personally hate the vehicle gameplay.  If they would take out the tanks,choppers, planes, and just have the cars to drive around in that would be awesome.

Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"Adds style and panache to a genre that's been shot to death","reviewText":"I first saw Darkwatch at an electronics convention in New York City and immediately fell in love.After completing the single-player campaign in Halo 2, I shifted gears to Darkwatch.  Where Halo is basically every military science fiction trope (Starship Troopers, Aliens, Predator, Space: Above and Beyond, and Battlestar Galactica to name a few), Darkwatch sets out to create its own genre.  And that genre is Wild West Horror.Darkwatch draws on two sources for inspiration: Deadlands, the pen-and-paper role-playing game, and Pale Rider, a Clint Eastwood Western. Deadlands first combined Victorian gothic horror with Wild West sensibilities, creating a wacky combination of gore and grit. Pale Rider established the notion of a supernatural hero in a Wild West setting.  The Darkwatch is a secret organization similar to the one depicted in Van Helsing with access to advanced technology dedicated to keeping supernatural villains under control.Darkwatch follows the twisted life and death of Jericho Cross, a train robber who decides to rob the wrong train.  He unwittingly unleashes Lazarus, an ancient vampire, and thus brings about hell on Earth. For reasons we don't ever fully understand, Lazarus turns Jericho into a vampire.  And thus, Jericho has all the cool traits of a vampire, from drinking blood to \"blood vision\" that allows him to pick out living auras.What ensues is a visceral shoot-em-up.  You can shoot enemies heads off their bodies with a six-gun (called a Redeemer), blow off their limbs with shotguns, and even mow them down with Gatling guns. You can also use a scope rifle similar to the one used in Halo.  Did I mention the \"rail rocket\" AKA bazooka? The game even has a Coyote, similar to the Warthog from Halo.  Unfortunately, I didn't read the instructions closely enough; there's a \"chieftain\" setting on the controller to make Darkwatch's controls match up with Halo's.  Which would have helped, as my subsequent Halo games have suffered from playing Darkwatch so much!Need more parallels to Halo?  Instead of the artificial intelligence known as Cortana we have Cassidy Sharp whispering ghostly advice. Jericho has a \"blood shield\" just like the energy shield in Halo that slowly replenishes. And instead of fragmentation grenades, Jericho throws dynamite...with predictable results. There are even dual pistols that fire in a glorious cacophony at close-range enemies. You can also elbow critters with your ranged weapons, although they're considerably more deadly since in Darkwatch every gun has a blade on the handle.  Just `cause it looks cool.Darkwatch is all about shooting things up.  Bottles explode.  Bad guys snipe at you from everywhere.  And you can fan your pistol, firing at ridiculous speeds.  You run and jump across cactus-studded canyons, burning towns, dripping caverns, moving trains, and on horseback.  Even the music is reminiscent of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.  In short, Darkwatch is most definitely a homage, if a twisted homage, to the Wild West genre it riffs on.Being a veteran Halo player, I decided to play Darkwatch on the harder setting (Shootist) and I'm glad I did.  The game goes by quickly.  In addition, the bad guys are repetitive; it suffers from the Diablo-esque tactic of reusing the same enemy model by tweaking it slightly: they're not just evil skeletons, they're SHIMMERY evil skeletons, with twice the EVILNESS!  Still, that doesn't keep the aforementioned Reapers from being alternately scary and hilarious.  Blowing Reapers' heads off causes them to stumble around in confusion looking for their heads; throwing dynamite causes Reapers to cover their heads and running screaming. And since Reapers lack a lower jaw, they're pretty freaky critters.Then there are the screaming Banshees that are fond of taunting you. \"Run!\" they whisper as you run away, or \"Dynamite!\" when you throw dynamite or my most favorite quote of all, \"MY ARM!\" after blowing off one of their arms.In theory, there's a bit of a role-playing element as Jericho whether he wants to reject his vampire/criminal heritage or embrace it.  Poor souls, sometimes dead and sometimes living, give Jericho an opportunity to prove his moral character.  These choices provide access to good or evil powers, neither of which have a very significant impact on the game.The single-player storyline is barely coherent and surprisingly adult.  There's a video titled Prom Night that will undoubtedly get a lot of replay by male players (my wife thought it was ridiculous).  The ending is very abrupt, but I've gotten used to that with games these days.The multiplayer is excellent; the blood vision power becomes much more important when picking out an intelligent enemy from a distance.  The ability to jump really far changes game play, even more than it does in Halo.  The multiplayer games can be played with vampire powers turned off, turning it into a traditional Wild West shootout.Darkwatch doesn't break any new ground as a first-person shooter, but it definitely adds style and panache to a genre that's been shot to death. Playing on hard, I felt I got my money's worth.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00007B77T","description":"We could talk about theSerious Sambackstory, but that would be missing the point, namely to commit carnage on a galactic scale. The smooth engine, multiplayer options, and fast pace make this game a solid choice for fans of first-person shooters.The interface uses the tried-and-true Xbox formula for shooters: the left thumbstick controls movement and the right thumbstick controls the angle of view. The extensive arsenal is something special though, with each weapon possessing a different efficiency so you have to find the perfect weapon quickly for each situation. For instance, the shotgun is a great weapon for up-close fighting among a crowd of enemies, but it's horrible at a distance or when you're stuck in the middle of a melee. The enemy list is also quite extensive. You will be fired upon, stepped on, stabbed, slashed, and electrocuted. Enemies will appear by land, air, and water.What makes this game stand out and keep you interested, though, is its irreverent, offbeat sense of humor. Serious Sam makes outlandish comments throughout the game, rides cosmic surfboards between scenes, saves progress at Dr. Who-like telephone booths, and pays homage to the Indiana Jones theme song. And you can change the blood splatters between red, green, and hippy (flowers and fruit). Our only major complaint is level design. Even when you believe you've cleared a room, enemies can pop out of midair and injure you. By not allowing you to seal yourself off from the onrushing masses in appropriate spaces, a major strategic element has been missed.--Eric Franklin","reviewerName":"Guillermo \"la union\"","summary":"fun fun and challange","reviewText":"this game is my faborite  is simple  a lot of laughfing and fun playing. recomended for a fps.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2007"}

The game system brought so many people to their needs. It definitely has changed the way that we all will now play video games at home. Although, this isn't completely out of the ordinary for racing games. There have been several games with a feel from a steering wheel we've played from attachments with games like Gran Turismo, but not when the original controller of the game system is turned into a wheel. That is exactly what Excite Truck has brought to the table for new gamers alike, and as one of the launch titles for the system. The question is, does it really deliver the need from speed?Excite Truck for the Nintendo Wii, is a wild and outrageous racing game that really tests your abilities with the Wii controller. The game controls differently than other racing games, as you race wild trucks including the 4x4 Bandit, and many other trucks. As you race, you have to earn enough star points inorder to advance to the next level. As you race through the game, you also encounter pow blocks which make your car invisible to other trucks and trees too, and exclamation marks which alter the course in different ways from making shortcuts, to giant hills where you have to go through rings. The graphics aren't bad and look nice, while the soundtrack is a blend of mostly rock and roll feeling. The control however is the most difficult part of the game. It is very tricky for new Wii owners to learn to how to steer with the Wii Controller. You have to steer the trucks with the wii controller, by using it like a steering wheel, which is very frustraing at first, but gets a bit easier later on.Despite a couple of flaws with the manuverability, Excite Truck is a wild and fun game for any Wii owner, or die hard racing fan. I like how much fun it is, and how wild the game is when you race. I definitely recommend this game a whole lot. It is different, but a lot of fun.Graphics: BSound: B 1/2+Control: CFun & Enjoyment: B- for solo players; B- for multiplayersOverall: B-","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2007"}

While not the first game to offer enhanced control with Sony's  dual-stick analog controller,Ape Escapeis the first game to require either an analog ordual shock controllerto play. That requirement  ensures that players will have full control of their hero, Spike. One stick moves Spike in any direction,  while the other swings his monkey-catching devices.InApe Escape, a circus monkey named Specter stumbles upon a scientist's prototype  intelligence-enhancing helmet, turning him into an evil monkey genius. As Spike, the professor's young  friend, you must travel through time to clean up all of the monkeys Specter has sent back in his attempt to  repopulate the world. If that's not enough to make you laugh, then chasing his goofy monkey minions as  they scurry from your clutches will certainly tickle your funny bone. You'll discover a variety of gadgets to  help you in your quest, including monkey radar, a slingshot, and a propeller for flying. Spanning 25 huge  levels,Ape Escapeis approachable for novices, and offers added challenges for veteran gamers.  One such challenge is to lure a dinosaur near a rocky cliff, and then jar the monkey off his back and into  your net.

To clear a level, Spike (played by you) must capture a set number of monkeys. After filling that quota, you must access the next level. Reaching the monkeys will require you to jump, sneak, swim, climb and fly through a variety of situations.  To help you on your way, you are given a net and a lightsaber type stun club.  Throughout the course of the game, Spike will collect six additional gadgets.  In addition to providing the means of completing future levels, returning to previous levels with new gadgets will allow Spike to capture any monkeys he left behind. In addition to monkeys, each level has tokens to collect. Collecting enough tokens will open minigames.  This game gets addicting pretty fast.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2003"}

The graphics are a little behind but the shere size of the game makes up for it.ONE OF THE FEW GAMES OUT THERE THAT IS ORGIANL AND UNIUIQE. Which you don't see anymore. It seems like alot of games anymore just copy what is \"IN\" and what makes money now adays. I would say  Deus Ex- HR is like playing chess compared to the other shooters out there which are like playing checkersThis game actually has both elements of Deus Ex, and Deus Ex Invisable War. I just wish they made the augmentations more useful. Half of the aug's are great but the other half you don't need.This games follows more so the original Deus ex with an invetory that is filled with different sized weapons and ammo. This game makes you think and strategize which is why I love it. And you have many different ways of completing quests. The replay value to me is huge just the fact of the acheivments and ways you can play through the game. Example : killing/knocking out enemies , Stealth/firing away, sniping/sneaking up and melleing. There are camera's, robots, and turrets in the game that you can control or shutdown from computer terminals. YOu can eather hack or find the passcodes to unlock computers and doors in the game. I would suggest getting the +invetory space aug because some of the weapons are huge and take up alot of space. You don't have to worry about moeny in the game after a while so buy what you want. YOu don't have to worry about any of the aug's to do with computer skill except for the the lvl 1-5 hacking aug. The reason is there are the nuke and stop hacking programs that you find and buy through out the game, which you find alot of. And always carry an EMP grenade.For people that want the most experience with this game you must search everywere. And I mean everwhere to get hidden items. 2 Examples are punching through walls to find a hiden room or climbing down a very long elivator shaft and being rewarded with an augmentation.Update: I just beat the game with 35-40 hours of gameplay. I even beat it on Hard diff. and that was pretty easy also. This game lets players use their minds so people with strategy can put it on hard difficulty. But I would suggest playing this on easy first becuase on easy the game actually highlights hidden walls and items but on hard it doesn't. SO it makes it easier to find secrets on hard cause you can remember were they are. You can pretty much get every Augmentation by the end of the game. I had 3 points left to unlock at the end of my 2nd game playthrough.Good LuckMy fav weapon in this game is the pistol-with the armor peircing .  I wish there was different ammo types for the crossbow like in the original deus ex. I loved the sniper rifle in Dues Ex, and Deus Ex IW. But don't like using it in this game with the fact that you can't use a silencer, and the rifles sways way to much. UPDATE: I got the new DLC that lets you have a silencer on the sniper rifle :) .Watching the endiings makes you think a little. About people you didnt like in the game but see how they thought.Cons : This is a very small one, but tHe only con I have is the design of the augmentations. I wish they were all worth the same usefullness in this game. Like in Deus Ex-IW the augments were all great and each one depended how you were going to play the game. I wish they would have brought back medpacks and even an orb like in DE-IW that decomposes bodies to heal you. I think it would have added to the RPG game if they did away with regenerating health. I also think it sucks that they have 2 weapons that are the most fun at the end of the game.I'm addicted to this game! I beat it twice and I want more. I think of playing this while I play my other 360 games. I think I will give it a couple days before starting a new game though. Hope they have a new Deus Ex in the works.If you want I'm also on xbox live = STRIFEalucard","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2011"}

Period.  Nothing comes close.  A lot of people say Tekken Tag for the PS2 is a better game, but Tag is merely a rehash of Tekken 3 with updated graphics, and Dead or Alive 2 just doesn't have the same shine. Soul Calibur introduced so many new ideas to the genre of 3D fighting that it's hard to think how anyone will surpass it:  the 8-Way run system and Guard Impact are just two of them.  The graphics are flawless 60 fps glory, the sound crystal, the backgrounds enthralling.  Mission Mode and the huge unlockable Art Gallery send replay value through the roof, but the true treasure here is the combat system.  Helped by pinpoint control, beginners and veterans alike will find no end to the depth of the fighting engine that the 8-Way Run system opens up, allowing your fighter mobility across the entire surface of the arena.  People are still talking about the huge leap Soul Calibur represents for fighting games.  Namco has produced a work of art that also happens to be the most flawless game I've ever played -- a year later it's still the most played game on my Dreamcast and I'm still discovering new moves and techniques.  Soul Calibur has sold many Dreamcast systems (my own and all my friends' as well), and at the price the system and the game are now, it's an ABSOLUTE STEAL.

{"product_name":"B00002STH5","description":"It's taken a while to get here, but Nintendo's 64-bit update to the old SNES classic, F-Zero, is here. F-Zero X is a stunning achievement in that it's truly the first racing game that runs at a brisk 60 frames per second, even in multiplayer. In fact, more than anything else, it is this feature that is F-Zero X's claim to fame. Does the rest of the game stack up? Well, it depends on what you're looking for.Instead of trying to compare it to its 16-bit counterpart, we'll dissect F-Zero X purely on its own merits. After all, the bar has been raised for racing games in general over the past few years. So what does the game have to offer? Well, first of all, forget any kind of simulation aspects. This is twitch gaming at its best. Although you can tinker with the basics, like acceleration and speed, that's about all you get to do. Everything else is just about driving. Playing like a Wipeout without weapons (which was like playing F-Zero with weapons), F-Zero X's only added enhancements are the inclusion of dash plates located at various points around the track. When you run over one of these plates, you get a severe speed boost that doesn't cost you any energy (after the second lap, you get boost power that you can use at any time, but it takes away some of your energy), enabling you to blast past some of your opponents. However, they too can use these plates.That's not to say that you can't dispose of your opponents though. By using the Z-button or the right shoulder button you can either crash into your opponent making his energy meter drop, causing him to explode if his meter is low enough. Or, you can try to shove him off the track if there is no barrier keeping you in. A number of play modes are available, including practice, death race, time attack, and vs. battle. However, the majority of the racing will be done in the grand prix mode, where the cup levels await. Each cup increases in difficulty, naturally, but with each additional level conquered, more and more racers are made available to you, adding replay incentive. If you make it to the final secret cup, you'll uncover a random track generator that offers you a fresh challenge every time.So what's the problem with F-Zero X? For starters, with up to 30 different racers onscreen at any given point, some sacrifices had to be made in order to keep the insane frame rate so high. Polygon counts on the vehicles are very low, giving them a particularly uninspiring look. The track detail is also very limited, giving the track a spartan feel to it. In its defense, the tracks are cleverly designed, especially the twisty corkscrew tracks that speed by at a blazing pace. One feature that's lacking is a first-person view. If speed was truly supposed to be on display here, a cockpit view would definitely have helped, but alas, there is none to be found. Control is pretty good, although the analog stick can be kind of touchy in places, leading to a few inadvertent fender benders. The sound effects are very good and actually add to the feeling of speed in the game. Unfortunately, the music can be pretty annoying in a cheesy synthesized-metal kind of way and doesn't really add much to the whole experience.As a game, F-Zero X is certainly thorough in its execution; unfortunately, there just seems to be very little in the game to keep you coming back. Sure, Nintendo incorporated all those funky characters to give it... um... character, but the game erases all that good stuff with its overwhelming blandness. Yes, the game can be fun in multiplayer, being supersonic and all that, but the game just lacks those certain intangibles that make a good game great. Practically flawless from a technical standpoint, the biggest thing missing from F-Zero X is that it lacks a soul. It's yet another stunning update to the legendary Nintendo catalog, but it's games like this that make you wonder: Where's Metroid 64 or Donkey Kong 64?

The graphics are low on detail, but Nintendo compensated with a huge emphasis on speed. Tracks twist and turn every which way, including death-defying jumps, corkscrews, half pipes, and cylinders. The familar F-Zero soundtrack has been updated too, and keeps the excitment high.However, the Gamecube version basically topped this game in every aspect possible. F-Zero was a franchise where the sequels consistently made their predecessors look hopelessly outdated, and the same applies here. F-Zero X sacrifices graphic detail for speed. F-Zero GX sacrificed neither. So if you've been playing the newer versions, there's no point going back to this one.A solid title for its era, and good if you enjoy retro gaming. Otherwise this probably won't hold your interest as much.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2006"}

At Least in regards to Sheva. She is the stupidest AI character i have ever had to deal with. There was a part in the game when her commander says to Chris that she is a very skilled soldier and I laughed so hard when he said that. She always shoots first and removes the element of supprise you could sometimes have. Also When she shoots she doesn't stop until until she's totally out of ammo. She uses herbs and health spray as soon as i give it to her too.I want to comment about how you can't mix herbs in her inventory either. You have to move them into your inventory to do it. And given the lack of inventory space(9 slots each) it's really a problem. Did i mention that the body armor you can buy takes up an inventory slot? No? Well it does.The set up of the levels is in chapters like the last one only you can go back to any one at any given time which mean you can farm the levels for ammo and treasures. I found myself doing this every few chapters because I was low on ammo( Thanks Sheva!). Theres no combining treasure like in 4 WTF???There one more thing that really pissed me off about this and thats the fact that you can't us a herb or health spray when its on the ground. Like if your about to pick it up but want to use it right away you need to have a free slot open in your inventory to do so. In Resident evil 4 you could just use it without having to pick it up.The ending also wasn't very exciting, at least in my opinion but i'm not going to spoil it for you.The reason i gave it 4 stars for fun is becasue of the mercenaries mini game which is awsome. This is probably the only \"fun\" i had with this game and you know why? No stupid Sheva using all my ammo! Too bad you have to BEAT the game to get it! The no pausing to switch weapons in the inventry adds a level of urgency to it too. If you really have to have this game I would suggest rushing through the story to get to the MERCENARIES!!!And for you people that are going to say I should play it with a friend or \"why don't you get some friends\" I didn't want to play it with a friend because it's a survival horror game if i play it with a friend it kind of of ruins that.

It seems like the game makers simply cannot resist including one or more monumental design flaw. I started the game on the \"World Tour\" in stage 1 of 5 of the Great Lakes. My first mission is to kill 5 deer in 2:00 minutes while avoiding killing doe's and taking out moose before they attack me with their horns. First of all I don't think moose generally attack rabidly. Second, the more times they hit you the more blood splatters on the screen which may seem nice in theory but is annoying in a game where you're trying to pick out animals. I failed my first time out partly because I had problems telling the difference between a deer and a doe (isn't a doe also a deer) and partly because the movements are rather clunky.I am by no means a hunter but I have a mental image of what hunting is like. I imagine it involves a lot of searching, waiting and patience. Probably holing yourself in a location that is difficult for animals to spot. What I don't imagine it involves is standing in the middle of a field firing at animals as they run aimlessly about. The backgrounds are as static as a portrait. Not a blade of grass sways or a branch moves and your feet are cemented to the ground. All you can do is scan the landscape back and forth over and over again. The animals look decent in still shots but their framerate is low and their movements are boring. There are no herds just the same animation sequences played over and over again. Snore. Why can't we hear some nice sounds of nature rather than this bland soundtrack?After completing round 1 of stage 1 of Great Lakes I went on to round 2 where I needed to kill 7 deer in 2:30 while avoiding moose and wolves. Where was the ramp up for beginners? This is hard. In round 3 of stage 1 of Great Lakes you need to tag 5 direwolves in 2:30. Here's the problem. Tagging does not kill, it only tags so while I am armed with darts I am defenseless against attacking animals.You can control with the stylus or circle pad. Although neither control scheme works the circle pad is fatally broken and unusable. It's designed to start moving very slow and then speed up the further you turn. So at first you can't target an animal because you're too slow and then you fly right past it. Also, it's designed to continually snap to the center of the screen so targeting animals is pretty much impossible. The sniper rifle is very difficult to use regardless of which control scheme you. In one stage you need to hit deer from a distance but that means finding a deer far enough away (and I failed multiple times because apparently they were too close) then hit 4 more while they zip back and forth through your scope. You're again defenseless against attacks and the sniper rifle stubbornly refuses to target because it keeps moving past your target point.I finally figured out the secret of the sniper rifle. Never use the scope. This destroys the fun of a sniper rifle but it's still better than the alternative of using this broken scope. I managed to get to the T-Rex fight and it just shined a spotlight on what's wrong with this game. As if the controls weren't bad enough, as if it wasn't annoying enough that animals are endlessly attacking you the dang T-Rex would stomp and roar shaking the ground and throwing off your aim. Trying to retarget with this broken control scheme is just an exercise in frustration. Rather than fun this game felt like a chore I had to endure to get through this review. I really can't recommend this to anyone including hunting fans since there surely are better hunting games available.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00000DMB3","description":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timemay be the greatest single-player video game ever created in any genre. It's that good. Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide. WithThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Nintendo has come up with an all-consuming adventure title that will provide days of engrossing gameplay.--Eric FredricksonPros:Best single-player video gameFreedom to explore a rich, complex worldHelpful fairy guide gives hintsCharming, humorous, lighthearted, yet challengingCons:Some puzzles can be frustratingOnly one saved game per player--don't save when you're stuck!Much more fun with Rumble Pack","reviewerName":"Lisa Houghtaling","summary":"Zelda Ocarina of time.

You come on a house fire, save a kid, and try to find out what happened here. The good thing - you have the whole of Silent Hill on the case. The bad - you have the whole of Silent Hill on your case.It leads to many things, including yourself, and it is a beautiful thing.First, I am going to list the one fault I have with the port and that is views. While many of the games have had a lot of bad angles, this one had some really awful ones. This leads to a lot of deaths if you don't watch it, and to a lot of getting tangled up in furniture or missing something without looking closely. That said, it is only a small thing and, really, this IS a Silent Hill game and deserves much praise.The set-up here is a lot like 2 in the way it maps out the regions. It gives you the whole set-up of the leading without leading, and it lets you make mistakes and it lets you find a plethora of items. The enemies get increasingly more bizaree, too, and you always have a looming fear of a triangle head in your mind (ooo that Butcher). All the while you are learning about one of four ending on your way to Travis and what he is all about and, i must say, Travis has a screwed up life.you also learn more Silent Hill lore - a lovely thing I WANT in these games.Another thing here is the control and the ability to dodge. Sometimes you cannot avoid and sometimes you have to blast, but all sorts of things are useful as melee weapons. you can use things like sticks and swords as three hit weapons before they break, or things like typewriters that just hit hard and break. You also have better guns in the process, and these help quite a bit. If you are a bullter saver like me, you will find yourself walking through this with ease. This leads you to bonus outfits and other things that are really nice.for a port this is amazing. I really thought it would be something decent, but I found myself having to beat it. It is the regular 4-8 hour game play-through depending on your speed, but those are well-spent. You get the horrid monster, the good sounds, and the other wonderful stuff. You also have a grand sountrack with Mary singing actual songs - pick these up because they are great.all in all, this deserves a lot more praise than it had.

{"product_name":"B002I0JIQW","description":"","reviewerName":"Veil_Lord","summary":"Fantastic But Not Much More Can Be Done With The Series","reviewText":"Portal one was the unexpected star the orange box for me. I have the orange box on a very deep discount just to play half-life two. Ended up somehow disappointed by half-life two, not quite sure why, but just didn't do it for me. However, portal was just a whole lot of fun. It was a well done game that had very few issues and the humor was just perfect for me.Still, I wasn't that interested in getting portal two. I'd been playing a couple of other puzzle games lately and I just wasn't in the mood, but thankfully a family member got it for me for my birthday and I had great fun with it. If you haven't played any of them basically you have this portal gun which lets you open two separate doorways that connect. So for example if you shoot the blue doorway on one side of the room and then the orange doorway on the other side of the room you can instantly traversed the whole length of the room by going to the portal. The only annoying bit is that you can only use the portal gun on certain materials. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but then again if they let you use it on anything you could just bypass every puzzle and there would be no point to the game.The first game sort of felt like a mod to the original game, which I guess technically it was, but portal two feels like a full game in its own right. It's a longer, there's more dialogue, and there some brand-new puzzle elements for you to toy with. In our little boxes that can focus laser beams and later on you also have this goop that let you bounce and another that lets you go faster. If you played the first game, then you'll breeze through a good chunk of this game with no problem. Otherwise it may take you a while to get oriented. However I should add, this game is very relaxing and not really hard at all. For the most part once you do something it's on rails. For example when you jump on a platform it will usually shoot you to the exact same spot every time; you don't have to be moving the mouse very perfectly just to hit a difficult jump. You're also generally not under attack, though you will be in some tests.  I found the game incredibly fair in not punishing you too hard for dying.  I also hit zero bugs playing.The game is reasonably long, though not exceptionally long. I won't spoil anything for you, but when you get to the part where you think the game is about and don't worry it's not going to. At least until you've seen the blue goop, the orange goop, and the talking potato you still have plenty of game to go. Fair warning though, there's not a lot of replay to be had here. Once you figured out the puzzles and heard all the dialogue there isn't much reason to play the game again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2012"}

WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number  of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode,  but it's strictly one player. In spite of these flaws, the game remains  addictive and fun. It bears repeating that gamers looking for anotherGTA  IIIwill not find it here: this game provides an arcadelike experience  that's excellent, but in a very different way.

Bennett \"Will 'vouge' For Food\"","summary":"Metroid ReDux","reviewText":"One of the biggest trends in video games right now it's re-vamping old games for a new generation.  \"Metroid: Zero Mission\" with other games like \"Tomb Raider: Anniversary\", and to some extend \"New Super Mario Bros.\" all claim to not be a remake but a update of the original concept.  \"MetroidL Zero Mission\" retells (as the box art puts it, the \"real\" story) of Samus Aran's very first adventure.  Taking it's cue from the mid 80's NES classic \"Metroid\", \"Zero Mission\" is a throughly enjoyable and classic 2-D gaming experience for the GBA or Nintendo DS.As the adventure begins anyone familiar with the original game will notice that the enviroments look similar to the original with different layouts and gaming textures.  New areas, weapons, and enemies have all been added to create the redux of a classic (and oft released) video game.These updates for the most part succeed.  The graphics are crisp, clear, and detailed.  Especially when playing on the high res DS.  The control is what you expect from Nintendo--right on and intuitive.  The music is also a well produced effort, with many familiar tracks being remixed for this version.But what is missing is the sense of adventure and sci-fi from the orginial.  Maybe it's because the series is so well known and Samus' true identity is readily accessible by many fans.  Also many of the updates, for example the new grip ability take away some of the challenge that made completing all those old games so rewarding.In the end, \"Zero Mission\" is a great, solid, and engaging game.  It's fun to see a different side of the Metroid mythos and the added graphical powers and newly introduced areas of Zebes (hauntingly familiar to those fans of \"Super Metroid\") help add depth the story.

E Jackson","summary":"a great mission","reviewText":"What makes Metroid: Zero Mission so good is the fact it perfectly blends the original NES Metroid with elements of Super Metroid, creating a fascinating blend between two classic games.Many of the abilities from Super Metroid are used in the game, despite the fact it seriously feels like you're playing the original NES Metroid for the majority of your playtime.For those of you who've played the NES and Super NES Metroid games, I like how the game tricks you into thinking you're walking across familiar territory, only to suddenly change a layout in a drastic -and radically new and inventive- way.  It leaves you wanting more, in fact, because you will remember how much you craved the gameplay from the older Metroid games.Some of the theme music -such as in Norfair- is REALLY different compared to the original theme, and in this particular case, hauntingly terrific.However, I don't necessarily think the music in Metroid: Zero Mission is better compared to the original Metroid (or Super Metroid for that matter) but some of the familiar themes will definitely catch your attention because now they've been remade in a strange way giving the game a fresh alternative, and don't be the least bit surprised if you happen to enjoy these updated themes more than their original versions.Some of the boss battles -such as the Kraid fight- don't offer significant changes to their strategy of taking them down and out, but that's alright- this is *still* a great game that does every single thing correctly. I highly recommend this game.Also, the game blends both enemies from the NES and Super NES Metroid classics.  You'll encounter all kinds of familiar foes, but with a new twist.The only reason I'm not giving Metroid: Zero Mission 5 stars is because it just can't compete with the original Metroid or Super Metroid, two groundbreaking games that deserve all the praise they've received the last several years. In comparison to these two amazing games, Metroid: Zero Mission has a \"been there, done that\" feel to it.

From what I see, it's either you enjoy wrestling and love this game, or you hate/couldn't care less about wrestling and you don't. I happen to be in the latter category, and so I feel that there is nothing about this game that I really enjoy. I really don't think there are anything in this game that would appeal to other non-wrestling-fans except for the fact that it is easy to pick up and play. Being a non-wrestling fan, I don't really understand what exactly the crowd meter thingy is for. You could be beating the life out of the opposing wrestler, yet your relation with the crowd is relatively low. I highly doubt that any other non-wrestling-fans would know what it is either.That is not to say that there is nothing fun about this game. As I said, the game is very easy to pick up and play. After a few rounds of button mashing, you would be able to figure out that A is to grapple and do whatever other attacks you have, and B is to just beat the living crud out of each and every one of your opponents. Yet if you are not familiar with how to end a match, then you'll likely just attack for a while until your opponent gets seriously bloody. Constantly pressing B just to turn your opponent into a bloody mess gets old if you keep on doing it for several minutes. And controlling characters on a semi-3D environment just does not feel natural. Sure, I don't mind the fact that the game keeps you locked onto an opponent at all times, but it is moving around that gets tedious.WWF No Mercy was probably the most realistic wrestling game back in 2000. There are authentic entrances with authentic entrance music as well as authentic game modes. Yet to be completely honest, I don't really care. The graphics are more gritty and realistic than Asmik Ace and Aki's previous two wrestling games (1998's WCW/nWo Revenge and 1999's WWF Wrestlemania 2000), and the characters models don't look like faces painted on blobs like earler wrestling games. In other words, they actually look like people this time around. However, they still don't look very good. Stephanie McMahon looks like a zombie, or somebody really ugly wearing a lot of makeup. Crowds are no better than previous Asmik Ace/AKI wrestling games. They don't look like cardboard anymore, but they are just really ugly, really pixelated sprites instead. Sound effects are a bit laughable. It's just \"BOOM! KAPAM KAPOW!\" Yeah. It's not that I have anything against this game, but I just don't find it that good. It still is the best of the Asmik Ace/Aki wrestling games. Maybe I would appreciate it more if I actually watch wrestling. Hey, at least from the critical success, it establishes the Nintendo 64 as the premiere system for wrestling. That is something to be proud of.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2004"}

Beautifully crafted with stunning graphics, incredible library, and with Bluray playback? You can't go wrong. I am not a fanboy either. I absolutely can not stand Sony for the disastrous Playstation 2, killing of Sega, and for always making systems that are not durable and that break down easily. Yet when Nintendo failed to impress me with Wii, I forced to find another console to use. Xbox 360 was out of the question. While obviously more advanced then Wii, I feel Microsoft just wanted to make money with their dumb overpriced online service, expensive and obviously untested Kinect camera, and mediocre game library. So I decided to try out Playstation 3 and discovered that Sony had made it just right. The graphics are amazing, clear, and are constantly making me drop my jaw with every game I play. The games are magnificent, from Little Big Planet to everything else under the sun.  The online store, while not as diverse as the store on Xbox Live, has a lot of quality games. Playstation 3 also has many other things, such as an internet browser and bluray player. I'll call it the best of the current consoles, I won't call it the best ever, but I can recommend it to everybody looking for a sleek high tech console.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2013"}

I waited about a week after it came out to rent it but it was all checked out. So I ended going to Gamestop, Best Buy, Meijers, 2 Walmarts, and a Target before finally giving up to hearing \"it's sold out\". The next day I got it at Toys R Us. This game is plain fun.To describe this game I would say Left 4 Dead meets Walking Dead(the comic/tv show). It's not a guns blazing shoot em up, but a lot more panicy and survival type game. Every enemy you run into can be your downfall, fighting 1 zombie can take up to 20 to 30 seconds depending on the zombies level. The unique battle with a zombie is more like hitting it to the ground and smashing it's head in, instead of just shooting it with bullets. I like this game. I had a lot of fun doing the co-op which I recommend. Knowing you got a friend watching your back is very helpful when zombies come from all sides.The story is nothing special. Pretty much trying to get off the island and all that. The game is mostly for it's sidequests which gives the game a lot more playability. The majority of the game is just going to be killing zombies and running around the beautiful island.I recommend this game if you like a more slow paced realistic zombie game. This is not left 4 dead so don't expect guns and hordes of zombies coming at you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2011"}

Not that the campaign is over (most reviews are saying that it's like 20-30 hours) but there are just too many problems I have with the game.1- The BUGS and no, I'm not talking about the accidentally released \"preview build\" that excited fans purchased on steam at midnight(My friend was unlucky enough to get that crap) I'm talking about the horrible hit boxes for the zombies. It's completely random whether or not you have enough reach (or too much, sometimes the zombies will be too close for it to register). I was playing coop with a friend and for some reason, people kept addressing me as \"him\" even if I played a chick. What's the kicker however, is that there isn't even a day one patch to fix (allegedly) 37 major bugs, many of them game ending glitches.2- The STORY we all remember the stunning first trailer (that put it on the map) of the father trying to save his dying daughter to the sound of a lone violin. Well, this game has none of that. Instead, what we get is 4 playable characters who, although they have a paragraph of info at the start, don't do anything for the plot. Where is the emotional drama you might ask? All the characters do is regurgitate the same one liners like \"Take that, bitch!\" to stupid zingers.3- The ENVIRONMENT- We were told that this would be open world, and it certainly is. How much of it is interactive? Very little. Outside of the weapons and health items, pretty much the only things that even move are the slow moving beach balls and chairs. Zombies are also not randomly spawned like left for dead, all you need to do is pay attention to exactly where the \"bosses\" come from and then avoid those places since they mostly offer little worthwhile rewards addressed in my next point4- The WEAPONS- I'm not saying there isn't imagination in the weapon designs, they're quite creative. Unfortunately, most become useless to your almighty foot. Kicking takes no stamina, the knock back of enemies brings them to the floor, and you can upgrade your \"foot\" ability to the point where if you are ever surrounded, all you need to do is put your back to a wall and start kicking. It's quite comical.This list keeps going, but this is already becoming quite a long review, so I'll just leave it at that I'm sure people will find more BS that pops up in this game, so just take this as a cautionary tale.....","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2011"}

{"product_name":"B006IOAHPK","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Meet (And Kill) Some Friends OF Mine","reviewText":"&#34;South Park&#34; is an acquired taste, and over the years, I've met an equal amount of people who despise it to counterbalance those who love it. I fall on the &#34;love it&#34; side of the spectrum, as I've always found the franchise to be full of clever and deservedly mean pokes at modern society, as well as good-natured ruminations of what it's like to be a kid. That same experience applies to role-playing games, as while I fully adore grinding levels and sinking several hours into a world-building experience, I'm well aware that many people find RPGs to be long-winded and dull. So, to some, the combination of &#34;South Park&#34; and RPGs sounded miserable, while to others, it seemed like a blessing. And while &#34;South Park: The Stick of Truth&#34; might not be for everybody, those interested will adore it, and all others will hopefully be able to see the impressive craftsmanship that went into it.&#34;Stick&#34; follows the New Kid, who moves to the quiet little mountain town under mysterious pretenses, and quickly falls into a raging battle between elves and the noble warriors of the Kingdom of Kupa Keep (KKK... yes, they call themselves that.) The epic struggle is over the titular Stick of Truth, the owner of which can control the universe. Well... not really. See, the kids of South Park are engaged in a town-wide LARPing session, complete with leveling, custom weapons, armor, classes, and the like. This puts an interesting spin on the show's universe, as everyday locales like the school or Jimbo's Guns become dungeons or supply stores. And instead of going all &#34;Calvin and Hobbes,&#34; the writers wisely chose to make it perfectly clear that these are little kids pretending to be in a role-playing game, and decided to build off that concept.The result is one of the more clever video games in recent memory. Narrative tropes, worn gameplay mechanics and other aspects of role-playing games are put on display and mocked here. When learning the turn-based battle system, a character questions why they have to wait their turns, only for Cartman to bark that it's &#34;like olden times.&#34; Naming your custom character is irrelevant because you'll end up going by &#34;D*uchebag&#34; for the majority of the game. Other things of this nature help solidify this is as a tongue-in-cheek parody of the genre, complete with visual and verbal cues to famous series. As a functional, funny parody of an established type of game, it's a rollicking success.On top of that, it's &#34;South Park&#34; at its absolute finest. Beneath the clever satire, we have Matt Stone and Trey Parker's signature blend of shock humor and gross-out gags. Only this time, it's a lot funnier than many recent episodes of the show itself have been, as it feels less constrained by time and censorship, and more like a creative burst of lovably vile, gut-busting energy. Before playing this game, I would have laughed in disbelief at the concept of beating up meth heads for coffee ingredients, or using different types of farts to solve puzzles, but lo and behold, these are both things that you'll end up doing in &#34;Stick.&#34; Admittedly, some jokes wear thin after a while, and as is the nature of licensed games, hearing certain characters repeat lines in different circumstances makes them lose some of their luster. As a whole, though, this is still a very funny and fresh experience, akin to the funniest bits of the &#34;Saints Row&#34; franchise distilled into a 12-hour (18-20 if doing the side-quests) game.And yes, despite the copious amounts of &#34;South Park&#34; fan service, clever satire, and rip-roaring gags, this is still a game. Actually, it's quite a good one, and I say this as an avid fan of RPGs. The turn-based combat is only tight and fun (if not a bit easy,) and holds a surprising amount of depth to it. Aside from wailing on opponents with a variety of humorous weapons, you'll also have to learn how to break down enemy armor, counter different stances, and handle the buff/debuff system. Players who are weary of turn-based RPGs might find solace in the fact that you'll be doing a lot more than clicking commands, as using attacks often requires a series of button presses or flicks of the analog sticks. Of course, you won't only be locked in fights for the entire game, which is where the sizable overworld comes into play. As the new kid, you and a &#34;Buddy&#34; of your choice can wander around South Park taking side quests, finding collectibles, and making friends to add to your Facebook-esque list of pals. There's plenty to do, all around, and both the combat and exploration aspects of &#34;Stick&#34; are admirable in their execution.One's opinion on the graphics and sound in this game will boil down to how much they like &#34;South Park.&#34; As a fan of the show, I feel like it captures the visual style and musical elements perfectly, right down to the crude walking animations. The music sounds like a mixture of Western RPG soundtracks and the typical musical motifs one would expect from the series, even blending the two occasionally (listen for Cartman&#8217;s voice during a choral section of a certain piece of background music.) It looks like &#8220;South Park,&#8221; sounds like &#8220;South Park,&#8221; and most importantly feels like &#8220;South Park.&#8221;All of this being said, it&#8217;s important to stress that this game isn't going to change minds of the uninitiated. If you hate the humor of the show, and find it to be far too offensive or nasty, you probably won&#8217;t get many laughs here, as it&#8217;s arguably &#8220;South Park&#8221; at it button-pushing worst. Those who think that the visual style is jarring to the eyes and lazy aren't going to be impressed by the graphics, as they look exactly like fans would expect an average episode to look. Basically, if you don&#8217;t like &#8220;South Park,&#8221; you&#8217;re not going to be getting much out of this, nor do I think you were intended to in the first place. It would be like the protagonists taking their parents to a movie by the infamous Canadian duo Terrance and Phillip; obviously, the humor wasn't intended for them, and it&#8217;s going to do more harm than good.To put it bluntly, this isn't intended for general audiences. It&#8217;s for people who like either like &#8220;South Park,&#8221; RPGs, or both, and if you don&#8217;t fall into that category, odds are that it isn't for you. Just because it has a limited audience, however, doesn't make it a bad game by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, it&#8217;s one of the best licensed games out there, and by far, the best &#8220;South Park&#8221; game ever developed. And, to go out on a limb, it&#8217;s one of the most devilishly original and fun role-playing games to come along in a few years, albeit a simplistic one.Despite some jokes overstaying their welcome, and despite the limited appeal of the whole package, &#8220;South Park: The Stick of Truth&#8221; is quite the admirable little game. Creative, hilarious, and fun, it&#8217;s pretty much heaven for anybody who likes the show, and even for people who are only casual viewers. It might not win over any new fans, but considering that most likely wasn't an intention of Obsidian and South Park Studios, it&#8217;s not really a tragedy.And if you do feel like this game should cater to each and every gamer out there, I only have one thing to say.&#8220;Eyyy, relax, guy!&#8221;Score: 8.5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2014"}

In my life I've played countless thousands of games of all kinds. From side-scrolling shooters to J-RPGs, from racing games and puzzle games to space-combat and music/rhythm games....but I've NEVER played a game like this!A few years back I decided to buy a PS3 in order to get a cheap BluRay player, and bought a few games to see what the system had to offer. Most of the games I bought for the PS3 left me thoroughly unimpressed. And then I got down to trying this game...This calls for Strategy...The actual game play of Valkyria Chronicles plays out as a marvelous hybrid of real-time and turn-based strategy. You and the computer take turns moving, attacking, calling in reinforcements, issuing orders, healing, and initiating other special actions for different unit types. What makes it different from other games is that while you are moving your units they can come under fire from enemies, and vice versa. This basically means that in order to do well you will either need to group units together so that they can attack together (while you attack other units you control with the enemy in line-of-sight will also attack), or you will need to use orders to boost the stats of an individual unit so it isn't shredded by concentrated fire from multiple units. Of course, there are MANY different ways to play the same levels. You can use snipers constantly, or not at all. You can use shock troopers in groups to mow down units or scouts to quickly take positions. One thing you will almost DEFINITELY want to do is use your tanks for cover.The difference between this game and others of its type (it's more a strategy game than an RPG) is that it forces you think outside the box, repeatedly, and painfully. You can't just charge in guns a-blazing and make it once the difficulty ramps you. You will have to get enemies to move where you want them, and systematically cripple the enemy's ability to control the battlefield. The way that this unfolds cinematically is pure genius. Likewise playing a mission to the point where you think it is over and then finding out you are only halfway done forces you to approach the separate parts of a mission differently.The ChallengeWhen I first powered up Valkyria Chronicles I was intrigued, but not very impressed by the art style (it grows on you after countless hours of play). I found the game play interesting, and VERY difficult. The music, presentation, and overall design of the game is top-notch, and helped to pull me into the world of the game. I found myself playing mission after mission, spending hours and hours trying to beat \"just one more\". And then I got stuck. I ended up shelving the game for quite a while before I came back to the mission, but I am eternally grateful that I did. The game forces you to think outside the box and learn to control the battlefield. This becomes essential as halfway through a mission the tables get turned on you, and you have to switch strategies and often unit types completely just to keep from getting blown away.True, there's no frustration like playing for 2 or 3 hours and then having someone shoot your tank from behind, destroying it in one shot, but thankfully you can save during the battles and resume them later (A strong warning: Do NOT make your ONLY save a battlefield save.  If you discover that it is IMPOSSIBLE for you to win at your current level and with your current units, you will have no way to exit back to the main story {only back to the title screen}. ALWAYS save a copy of your game in story mode in addition to any Battle Saves).If you truly get stuck the best method is usually to follow the J-RPG mantra \"when in doubt, LEVEL UP!\" The skirmishes can be a bit repetitive, but they allow you to level up entire classes between major story missions to even the odds, or even give you a ridiculous boost over the computer. On the other hand, if you are a godly gamer who finds the game way too easy you can simply NOT level up your characters using skirmishes and try to beat a computer that shrugs off head-shots and chews through your units like tissue paper!Yes, this game is hard, but when you get better, and get farther, and come to grow attached to your favorite characters, their deaths (from which they do not return until the end of the game!) or triumphs come to mean SO much more to you.  And as you come to grapple with this brain-scratching experience something else happens...The Heroine of the BattlefieldI really can't overstate how amazing the presentation of this game is. The style of the graphics, while not necessarily flashy or incredibly detailed, is very warm, beautiful, and compelling. The cinemas between missions are excellent and really draw you into the story. There's a built-in encyclopedia explaining about the game world.There's great music that really heightens the mood at key moments. The way the story unfolds is as good as the best anime I've ever seen. The voice acting in both the English and Japanese is superb, and you can choose to use either one. And once you beat the game, additional options unlock including a music player, and a new game plus mode that lets you repay the entire game carrying over the stats and weapons you finished the game with.Every character in this game that you play with on the battlefield has a unique personality, with pluses and minuses that come into play under different circumstances. While it's interesting tactically, it also makes you feel....attached to the characters. Really, genuinely, attached. I remember the first time I activated the heavy Lancer Largo's special ability \"Large Heartedness\" and his health completely replenished just as he was about to die, while destroying multiple heavy targets at a crucial point in a mission that would decide if I won or lost. The dialog actually made me get teary-eyed. I remember seeing the super-heroic Vyse attacking the final boss absorbing massive amounts of firepower and doing insane damage, shouting heroic phrases as his stats boosted over and over from his heroic special abilities. Character development while in the attack phase of a strategy game?  Yes. Goodness yes.The ShowdownHonestly, this game has one of the best endings of any game I've ever played. There is dramatic tension that builds and builds up until the epic finale complete with a climatic epic boss battle. This is followed by some fantastic ending cinematics with epilogue, and then TWO of the best ending credits I've ever seen in a video game complete with fantastic music.This is a SEGA game, and in many ways absolutely represents the very best of the qualities that make SEGA games some of the greatest ever created. Idealism, emotional depth, incredible presentation, deep, compelling, and incredibly fun game play, and a world that makes you want to return to it time and time again. When I finally beat the game I DIDN'T have the feeling of finally being done with an ordeal I never wanted to visit again. I had the feeling of just finishing an absolute CLASSIC that I loved with all my heart, a game that I know will draw me back time and again to experience in different ways, trying out different strategies and determined to finally get an A rank on every mission and play through and experience every extra.

It was well made and insanely broad in what you could do with it. If you aren't phased by fantasy violence then you'll probably think the game is a lot of fun too. But I will never let my children come within 10 feet of this game and you probably shouldnt either. Here's why.A fitting retitle of this game would be \"Scarface: the Game\" because that's what a great deal of this game is modeled after, an extremely violent movie about being a drug lord. The game takes place in a realistic coastal city. There are restaurants, beaches, hospitals, hotels, police depts, grocery stores, bars, gas stations. In fact the game was modeled after the locations and sights found in the movie Scarface.The city is populated with pedestrians, golfers, shoppers, people waiting to get on buses/in cabs, hookers, gang members, strippers, drug dealers, policemen, emergency medical technicians, bums, store cashiers, etc.You can kill any one of these people.You can solicit a prostitute, and then run over her with your car as she gets out and leaves, then take the money back that you paid her. You can watch a strip show then shoot the stripper. You can hack a pedestrian up with a chainsaw. Throw a cab driver out of his cab then run him over with it. You can perform drive-by shootings. You can start a gang war. You can walk up to a car, aim a rifle at an innocent driver and shoot them directly in the head and watch them fall out of the driver's seat. You can drive around inside a shopping center and run over the shoppers. You can distribute flyers for adult films that you're producing. You can even start a massacre shooting then as the EMT's come to help people, blow them up with a rocket launcher, or simply beat them to death with a baseball bat. You can become such a threat to the city that the National guard may appear with tanks, helicopters, and infantry. Yes you can kill them too. You don't have to do all this stuff. In fact almost none of it is necessary in completing the main point of the game. You simply have the freedom to do it if you desire to.Or you could simply go through the basic missions of the game that involve an ex-con's rise to power as a leader of a powerful mafia-type drug cartel a la, you guessed it, Scarface.Your kid will probably love it. All in all, for what it is, it's extremely well made. Of course if you are worried that violence etc found in video games could negatively affect your child, then you should by no means let them anywhere near it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2006"}

It's difficult. Actually, no, it's punishing. No...in fact, it can be maddeningly infuriating at times. It is also a complete blast.I don't want to write an essay. In short, though, Demon's Souls is an action/RPG which is a bit like a combination of a 3rd-person adventure like Uncharted, a hack-n-slash action/RPG like Diablo, with the required thoughtfulness in swordplay of the original 2D Prince of Persia (you have to be an old-schooler to remember that one).The game is difficult, but veterans of the 8-bit days will find the difficulty somewhat nostalgic. The game does not simply restart you unscathed 15 seconds from where you kicked the bucket. Rather, you have to start the level from scratch, and to regain your earned currency (which you earn by killing enemies, and use to buy improvements for your character), you must fight your way back to your corpse in spirit form with half of your health. Die before you get there? Kiss that currency good bye. The game is FAIR, though. You have the option of running, at your liberty, to the beginning of the level and exiting to the starting area to spend your winnings, so that you can return all-the-more powerful. When you feel like you are pushing your luck and the level is outgrowing your character skills, it's time to heed that advice. Of course, this IS a dungeon crawl game, so when you come back the enemies will have returned. Think of it as more souls (i.e. money) to be made.It helps to go into this game EXPECTING to be in spirit form more often than not. The game assumes you will die a lot. In that sense, one should avoid frustration over death. It's a natural part of the game.Battle must be approached carefully. Running in and hacking mindlessly will only tire out your character, and likely result in an unceremoniously awkward death to even the most bottom-rungs of the enemy food chain. You must work with your shield, your footwork, and given the right character your magic and ranged weapons to succeed.All of this alone makes for a fantastic experience beyond any action RPG offered in this generation of games. What makes it a slam-dunk are the online aspects. The single player game takes advantage of your internet connection (though you can opt out by signing out of your PSN account). You will see occasional apparitions of other players fighting through the same level you are. Further, before long you will obtain an item that will allow players to invite you into their games to assist them. Later, a more sociopathic ability is obtained: the ability to break into another player's game, without their consent, hunt them down, and kill them. Either provides a bit of a \"shortcut\" to regaining your body, with the further effect of easing/intensifying the difficulty of the world around you...helping people \"lightens\" the world, harming them \"darkens\" it.On top of this, the ability to examine bloodstains to view apparitional replays of other players' deaths is fantastic and adds to the feeling that you're not dealing with this alone. The game punishes EVERYONE, and they are struggling with you, and it will prove it via these replays.This is no quick game. Reports from those who have played the imported non-US version claim play times of 80+ hours to conquer the game for the first time...nevermind 2nd and 3rd playthroughs, which supposedly come at a higher difficulty.All that said, it is not impossible. In my very first shot at it, I actually survived for a good half hour in the first non-tutorial realm without dying, and when I realized this, I quickly found my way back out and spent my winnings to upgrade before I went and got myself annihilated (and make no mistake...I did shortly thereafter). That is what is fantastic about this game (so far for me at least): if you respect it, play conservatively, and don't do anything you wouldn't try in real life, you CAN have a reasonable chance at survival. Stay on your toes, don't push your luck, and survival IS possible. Often death is simply a result of a lapse in attention or a reckless decision. If, on the other hand, you approach it like you would, say, \"God of War\" or just about any other action game from this generation, you WILL pay a price for your stupidity. And it's wonderful.Just to wrap up: the graphics are nothing short of what you'd expect in a top flight PS3 game. The sound is amazing...I have never wanted surround speakers so badly. And, as I mentioned, the gameplay is phenomenal.My only warning: casual gamers need not apply. Do NOT approach this game unless you like a challenge.Looks like I wrote an essay, after all. It could use some editing, but I have some playing to do.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2009"}

And has been said often, this game is no cakewalk.  I won't rehash what has been said by the big online reviewers but I would like to add a few thoughts.1st: this game is very much like a modernized old nintendo game, for better & worse.  I would liken it even to Deadly Towers(gasp!), but I mean that in a good way.  You're dropped in an extremely difficult gameworld with almost no introduction, you're character starts out very weak and you need to explore (carefully!) to find some loot that will begin to make you stronger.  Of that loot, there's plenty of it and like games like deadly towers, it's quite colorful.  The customization is very flexible and for those who are willing to play this game A LOT you can get quite powerful.Still, there is limited story & npc interaction, almost no \"role playing\" in the Bioware/Bethesda sort of way, and almost zero hand holding.  You're basically thrown to the wolves (or in this case, demons) and left to figure it out for yourself. For those that are up to the challenge, you're in for a treat.2nd: This game reminds me a lot of a well polished mmorpg played almost entirely by soloing.  The game is almost entirely about the grind - killing enemies, exploring the world, aquiring loot & upgrading your equipment.  The multiplayer content is unique and interesting - much as been said about it elsewhere, but suffice it to say that it is enjoyable once you get your head wrapped around how it works.One last thing: I don't think this game is that hard, really, once you get the hang of it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000VJRU44","reviewerName":"CKE","summary":"Very fun, but only part of the \"fitness\" answer","reviewText":"My wife and I are in our *early* 30's and we have found that the Wii Fit is the game that we use the most on or Wii. I have delayed writing this review by about 2 months to make sure that we continued our use - and I am happy to report that we are still enjoying using it on regular basis.One thing to note is that the Wii fit alone will not turn you into lean-mean-fitness-machine but it can be a helpful part of the process. Many of the games are marginal in calorie burning (like the penguin fish game), but are designed to help you with \"balance\" - which seems to be a bit of a reach.  Other activities such as \"stepping\" , \"hoola-hoop twirl\" and \"rhythm boxing\" can help you shed a few calories. My wife really enjoys the yoga selections that are offered.One complaint is that your fitness age and the size of your character is determined strictly by your BMI. I understand that this is recommended method, however people who have spent time in the gym strength training will generally be recognized as being overweight. For example, every linebacker in the NFL will be labeled as obese. It wouldn't be that big of a deal except that your Wii Fit character looks like a walking beachball!One noce feature is that the Wii Fit offers additional activity logs and a fitness tips. This helps remind us that additional exercise and proper nutrition are components to a healthy lifestyle.Pros-- The daily checking of BMI and weight can help keep people motivated to maintain their exercise regimen.- Most of the games are pretty fun - Top 10 performances are kept to help you compare to other users within your household.- Everything seems to be very well thought out. The games have an authentic athletic feel (even the ones that are not rigorous).- Appropriate for all ages - in all honesty this is the rare game that is good for 3 three to 93.- Price - Nintendo could have charged well over $100.Areas for improvement -- It would be nice if more than one person could be \"logged in\" at a time. If my wife wants to challenge my score I must exit out of all of the menus. She would then select her figure - get weighed - read a fitness tip and so on.- BMI is leaned on a little to heavily (no pun intended) this may alienate people who are more muscular than fat.- It is a little unkind to people who are bigger. I guess it is meant to serve as a motivating factor, but some people may see it as being insensitive.Overall, I highly recommend the Wii Fit - in fact, it is the one game that should motivate you to buy a Wii. While it is not the answer to total fitness it can be a useful voice in making fitness a part of your daily life.5 stars","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2008"}

Don't bother reviewing the game modes of each individual title in the sequence, as eventually you'll need to get a player update.  Sure, it may help to determine whether, for example, '12 was better than '07, but chances are you won't be playing '07 because you want the current players and their attributes.2. Graphics: This Madden continues to be solid in this department, putting forth a solid visual experience that doesn't decline from previous seasons.3. Gameplay: This is the big one.  The Madden controls have, through changing controller schemes, managed to stay relatively simple and streamlined.  New gamers can pick up and play right now, while franchisees don't have to learn new control schemes year in and year out.  This Madden continues that fine tradition, with no major control changes to screw things up.Thus, I will likely continue to give the Madden series five-stars until they really screw up (as they did with Madden '10 for the Wii, for instance).

THUG is no different.  Although the same elements exist from THPS 4, there is a new twist(Before you read the rest of this review, know that I am not a gigantic violent video game freak, I am just talking about innovations to the THPS series, and read the entire review so you can understand my point).  Without the names of several superstars burdening the main character, he or she can be seen breaking the law.  Now believe me, this is in no way a GTA kind of crime spree, it is all in good taste in an attempt to do something that is meaningful to the story, unlike the gratuitus violence in several games today.  With this freedom, the THPS crew has the ability to completely innovate the plot making it much deeper with a great story to boot.  There are some minor polishing effects that THUG could use however.  Once again the music selection is a little under par, but this is not a problem.  The difficulty curve for some missions is also steep, but fortunately you can skip the majority of these missions if it is too hard for you and come back to it later when you feel you can tackle it. Finally, some goals can be a chore, but they are few and far between so you will not have to worry about it.Pros:Great Story(Especially for a sports game)Innovative THPS gameFluid movements, as usualMost goals are fun and not too hardCons:Some goals can be lame or difficultSoundtrack could use some polishingThe verdict:This is a great game that is worth a rental at least and for most people a purchase.

This is a wonderful take on Laura's 'first' adventure. TheFMV's are top; the people almost look real. The storyline is long, but if played consistently can befinished within hours. In my opinion it's great and amazing the first playthrough.PROS:Graphics-Top notch. People look real, environments look real, even physics in the game are very realistic.Gameplay: Very realistic. Weapons don't sway like they would if a real person was holding them; there is recoil, whichcan be reduced but not eliminated with skills.Environment: The location is quite big and the player can get turned around. Must often check your location oruse 'Adventure Mode' to find out where to go next.Survivability: I don't expect there to be a realistic damage system to the player. Otherwise players would be dying of starvation,gangrene, bullet hits, cuts, falls, etc. Being her first adventure she would be trained in many things though not have the experience shewould have in later games. I do not see a \"Laura Croft Buns of Steel\" DVD anytime soon.Upgrades: Skill points are awarded every level, with three types of skill groups. Weapons can be upgraded via PARTS which change the look and improve the overall effectiveness of the weapon. Parts can be found which can add 'bonuses' which make the weapon more effective and change the look very little. Ex: the bow you start out with looks like garbage until you get the final one.CONS:Base Camps: Many are located in hostile environments. Player can't use them if enemies are around which is realistic.Re-play: None. Although once the game is complete, player may go back to find other things in the game that he/she missed. There are somenew enemies now that Laura is experienced and well-armed they are nothing. Since I already know what's going to happen, another playthrough would be simply for enjoyment.The CONS are small, and I am a fan of Tomb Raider. I think they don't have much replay value since you are playing a story/adventure. The game series is made that way and those are not my preferred game types.

But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiis held sideways, allowing for easy, classic inputs using the D-pad to direct playable characters, the 1 button to jump and 2 button to spit out projectiles like snowballs and fireballs. In addition, players can access powerups with their choice of either the push of a button, or by shaking the Wii remote, again demonstrating the perfect merging of classic gameplay and modern game design which isNew Super Mario Bros. Wii.Key Game FeaturesNew Super Mario Bros. Wiioffers a combination of cooperation and competition. Players can pick each other up to save them from danger or toss them into it.Supports 2-4 players in multiplayer mode.Mario, Luigi and two Toads are all playable characters, while many others from the Mushroom Kingdom make appearances throughout the game. Players can even ride different Yoshi characters and use their tongues to swallow enemies &ndash; or their fellow players.In some areas, players use the motion abilities of the Wii Remote controller. The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"Based on the DS version, but enough variety that makes it a perfect fit for the Wii","reviewText":"I loved New Super Mario Bros for the DS and played it for a long time. And when word came out that it was coming to the Wii, I was excited and cautious at the same time. For anyone who played this on the DS, New Super Mario Bros. Wii looks very similar as far as graphics and sound effects. The two games even share the same multiplayer aspects. And that is where the similarities end.New Super Mario Bros Wii holds its own by featuring new stage layouts, new graphic effects, new music tracks, new enemies to defeat and fun, multiplayer games outside of the main story mode. And this game is much, much harder than the DS version (which is a great thing, IMO.) You can tackle this game alone or have your friends join in anytime. It's a blast to play with other people and this will definitely attract the old school gamers while the new generation gamers will be more than willing to try it out.My only gripes are the Wii is much more capable of pushing out great graphics so it kind of sucks that New Super Mario Bros Wii's graphics are slightly improved over the DS version. Also, this would have been a perfect game to feature online multiplayer so you can beat the stages with other people. But oh well, it's still a great game and worthy to be part of anyone's Wii games collection. I highly recommend this title so if you haven't played it yet, get to it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2010"}

They're both amazing games and are in their best form yet with this HD upgrade. I don't regret paying $49.99 to play these two games once again, they're that good!The major downside to this trilogy would definitely have to be Peace Walker. I just don't \"get\" this game. It doesn't feel like a Metal Gear Solid game, there really isn't any stealth involved at all, you can't crawl, the menu system is overly complicated and poorly thought out. Enemy A.I. is rather poor too, except when you go up against the enemy vehicles, which replace the boss fights from previous MGS games, and that was another poorly thought out concept! The boss fights were always a staple in the MGS series, and these vehicle fights in Peace Walker don't match up. Although it is cool to face enemy tanks and armored vehicles, these confrontations should not have replaced the boss fights. MGS isn't MGS without boss fights!Thus far I've managed to play through roughly 5 hours of Peace Walker but I don't plan on completing it because it just didn't hold my interest. As expected, 2 and 3 are fantastic and are still worth the full price of admission.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2011"}

The side missions each have their own style, some requiring absolute stealth while others almost require a visible attack. I did, however, run into a glitch at the end of the last coop mission for Briggs COOP Mission 4 and that is why I gave this game 4 instead of 5 stars. I and a random player from Xbox Live fought through the whole mission and got trapped in a non-completing sequence where we were left restarting the check point over and over to a hoard of enemies that eventually stopped and left us nothing to do. Other than that heartbreaker I would give the game 5 stars. (UPDATE: Ubisoft has stated a update is coming out to correct this glitch)I really liked the purchasing of the weapons and gadgets as well as the ability to customize the components of most. This added a little extra fun for someone like me who is OCD with their games. The storyline was cool (as are all of the Xbox 360 games in this series).

{"product_name":"B001COTC3E","reviewerName":"Steve","summary":"Review - Resistance Retribution","reviewText":"This game is my absolute favorite game for the PSP.  The game is an intense, fast paced, 3rd person, over the shoulder shooter.  Nearly every aspect of this game is perfectly made, the graphics, enemy and weapon designs, facility and world designs are all perfect and beyond flawless.  Additionally, every aspect and detail of this game is crystal clear, crisp, clean and beautifully crafted.The story line is awesome and is one of the best on the PSP.  This game takes place between Fall of Man and Resistance 2 and follows a character named Grayson.  Grayson was a British Marine who fought the Chimera, but who was forced to kill his brother who was nearly converted into a Chimera in one of their conversion facilities.  In this game, you find out that Grayson deserts the military and is later caught and sentenced to death, but his assistance is requested by the French resistance forces and he is later spared.  The main character Grayson is absolutely awesome, he has issues with authority, doesn't follow rules, and generally does what the hell he wants.  One of the best scenes is when Grayson tells Mallory that he promises not to blow up the Chimera conversion facility so that she can study it and learn from it, than as soon as she leaves he blows the thing sky high!The weapons in this game are absolutely sick!  You will be using the Razor the most which is an assault rifle used by the chimera.  This weapon has great fire, great power, great speed but the accuracy is kind of sucky, additionally in can be charged to shoot a massive spinning blade that does huge damage.  Also, the Auger is awesome it can see and shoot through walls and is super powerful, the only issue with this is that it has such a small clip size.The controls on this game are phenomenal, fluid and are super easy to use.  You can look around, up, down every possible direction and can move easily.  My only complaint about this is how slow Grayson moves.  Sometimes you just need to haul as* but it just does not happen.  The control scheme is exactly the same as Syphon Filter: Logan's Shadow, and also includes the ability to hide behind walls.  What makes this one better is that when you are done shooting Grayson automatically jumps back behind the wall, while in Syphon Filter Logan is left like a sitting duck while you try to maneuver back to your hiding place.The replay value on this game is also awesome.  There are 4 hidden weapons which you can get by collecting all of the pieces of hidden intel in each level.  Sometimes the intel is easy to spot other times it is a real pain.  Additionally, you can collect skill points which demand you to perform certain actions such as not taking damage, killing 5 enemies with one explosion or killing the final boss in less than 4 minutes.  I do not have 100% skill points so I cant tell you what this unlocks.  Additionally, if you hook up the PSP to your PS3 you can play in \"Infected Mode\" where Grayson is a Chimera, in this mode you regain health over time (in regular game play you have to look for health packs), you can breathe under water and can breathe toxic gas (gad i wish that was the case in regular play).The game itself on normal mode is not very difficult, there are not an overwhelming amount of enemies and if you think logically you can kill enemies or groups of them much more easily.  This is awesome as it makes the game accessible to non-gamers like myself.  There is also a hard mode which is to say the least.. f-ing hard.Definitely pick up this game, it is awesome, time consuming, exciting and fast paced.  The game is action filled and  you will not want to put it down.  It is utterly addictive.  In my opinion if there is any PSP game to buy, this is the one you need.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2011"}

I grew up loving them, and still love their old material, and more than likely always will, which is one reason my mouth watered when Guitar Hero: Metallica was announced. First and foremost, for Metallica fans (or metal fans in general), Guitar Hero: Metallica is a treat and a must have. Featuring a fantastic setlist that includes the songs you'd figure would be on here (\"Enter Sandman\", \"Master of Puppets\", \"Fade to Black\", \"One\", \"Fuel\") and some surprising but more than welcome choices (\"Disposable Heroes\", \"Orion\", the Mercyful Fate medley from \"Garage Inc.\"), it's safe to say that if you're a Metallica fan new or old, you'll be in Heaven. The game makes full support of the Guitar Hero: World Tour prepherils, including an Expert drummer mode that makes use of two kick-pedals, which is nothing short of intense. Added to all this are extra songs from other bands including Mercyful Fate (complete with King Diamond coming out on stage!), Diamond Head, Alice in Chains, Judas Priest, Samhain, Corrosion of Conformity, Suicidal Tendencies, Motorhead, Queen, Slayer, Foo Fighters, and more besides; all of which amounts to one of the best overall track lists (in my opinion anyway, but then again, I love old school metal and this is all right up my alley) to hit a Guitar Hero game yet. The game also supports the \"Death Magnetic\" downloadable content, and while I would have loved to have seen some other Metallica tracks (like \"Motorbreath\", \"Whiskey in the Jar\", \"Harvester of Sorrow\", or \"Of Wolf and Man\") instead of \"All Nightmare Long\", \"Frantic\", or \"No Leaf Clover\"; but that's just me. All in all though, Guitar Hero: Metallica is a blast to put it simply, and if you're a Metallica fan or old school metalhead, you will find much to admire here.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2009"}

In regards to how the game looks, if you play it on a standard def tv it looks amazing, better than it's ever looked before.

However once you start playing this game it will strangely hold your attention for a couple of hours easily, if not longer. I think what makes it so engaging is the fact that you do only what you want and when you want, and you are enabled to customize your town and house, in thousands of different options, to suit your own taste. The game is fun for all different kinds of people,  I can have, say, a lovely Victorian house and decor and my little brother can have all the cowboys, pirates and alien style house decor and clothing he pleases, while my little sister goes in for a more modern flare. This is really just a chill-you-out, relaxing sort of game. I actually know more adults that enjoy this game than children.
