{"product_name":"B00004WMVL","reviewerName":"J. Jongeling \"slice of heaven\"","summary":"Only to complete your collection","reviewText":"Let me begin this review by telling you that if you are going to start this game, prepare yourself to finish it. Put on some nachos or grab a large drink because there are no save points. The game follows the classic RE storyline, but adds a twist. This is a nice game to obtain if you are not digging the new plot-deviation of RE4, 5, and 6. Also good to complete your collection in the same vein as Umbrella Conspiracies. So, on to the game itself...The game will take you anywhere between 1 and 3 hours to complete. Any longer and you should be checking your pulse. I was getting tired of not being able to save, mainly out of boredom, but I toughed it out anyways. My first time through I played lazily and ended up with a B ranking and 2:32 something. I have no intentions of improving on my rank, as the only interesting part is starting the game over with all the weapons you acquired in the previous run-through. A quick read through (or follow-along) with this guide : [...]  will help you get through the game very fast. It's so short that you can print it on one page.________________________________My pros :* First-person shooter perspective adds a whole new element to the series, and actually is very scary. I yipped more than once when the dogs jumped up at me or the hunters were lunging at my face.* The game follows classic RE style but with a twist in the story line that somehow still folds together.My cons :* Voice acting is BAD. I mean original RE bad. Maybe even worse. It's just gross!* Graphics are a suckfest. Blocky, ugly, sketchy...REDC, RE2, and RE3 all look better on my TV.* ZERO replay value. Like renting a movie you only watch once.  I heard there was a rocket launcher to obtain but that's too easy. Give me an alternate character or alternate story line instead!* Disgusting side story. Why the developers thought they needed to concoct a story that involves abducting pre-teen children and cutting open their skulls for extraction of pituitary brain matter for Tyrant growth is beyond my comprehension. Disturbing at best, distasteful at worst.________________________________Get this game if you are really a die-hard. Otherwise you'll be better of skipping this one - and believe me, you won't miss much!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000KLNLUK","reviewerName":"Twins Daddy","summary":"WOW...Can't Judge A Game By It's Cover!!","reviewText":"THIS IS A GREAT GAME!  I got this in a PS3 lot on eBay several months ago and played through all the others before this one.  Never saw a trailer...Never read a review.  I just thought, \"This is the most FUGLY cover art I've ever seen for a video game so the game itself must suck.\"  Well, I was wrong on this one...If you like shooters, then you HAVE to rate this one a 5 on FUN.  In fact, I rated this one a 5 OVERALL too.  Some people say, \"there are no 5 star (or 10.0) games.\"  I believe there are and those are the games YOU ENJOY MOST!  Not everyone is going to enjoy the same games in the same way, but I'll give some reasons WHY this game made quite an impression on me.UNIQUENESS - There's no doubt Dark Sector is a flat out 10 here.  Any game where your primary weapon is a BLADE (glaive) that is thrown like a boomerang, and when correctly applied, leaves your enemies writhing in pain from severed limbs or simply sliced in two or perhaps decapitated is unlike anything else on the market...This game could've had the std assault rifle as primary weapon (in fact, it is offered as a secondary weapon), but it just wouldn't be the same...The GLAIVE is a KILLING MACHINE!ENEMIES - This game doesn't just have your average soldier-types charging you with AKs and shotties...That can get boring.  This game has those guys and SO MUCH MORE.  There's pretty much a BOSS battle in each of the 10 chapters, sometimes more than one.  These can be VERY challenging and too many games today make you wait around to the end of the game to really throw something at you...Dark Sector doesn't wait.  I won't spoil it, but there are some creatures that will flat out have the hair on the back of your neck standing up.  This is at least a 9.5, maybe 10.SPECIAL ABILITIES - Another area Dark Sector has in Spades!  Again, it's hard to describe everything you can eventually do without spoiling things...But I like the fact that you EARN special abilities and don't just root around and find them lying on the ground.  These abilities really help you defeat bosses and anyone else who gets in your way.  I give it a 10 here especially because you can control the flight of the glaive in slow motion...COOL!WEAPONRY - I'm SO TIRED of playing shooters where you only get to handle the good stuff once you pry it from the enemy's cold dead fingers...Then there's nobody left to shoot!  If you like to keep your finger on the trigger and fill the bad guys with lead, even pushing their lifeless bodies 100 yds along the ground before letting up, you'll like this game.  You'll also like it for blowing stuff up until it's FUBAR.  There's enough of that fun stuff without overdoing it.  Be sure to buy the Korbov TK6 when it's available in Ch 7 for 40,000 Rubles...It's worth every Ruble.  The FINISHER:  What a way to end an enemy.  Another 10...CONTROLS - No complaints here...But you'll really need to MASTER the Glaive in certain parts, particularly the final BOSS battle.  I got R1 and R2 mixed up a few times in the heat of battle, but I can't think of a better way to place the fire controls for this game.GRAPHICS - This is a D-A-R-K game, not just in name.  If you've never been to Russia you'll think it's always night time and raining.  However, it does create an appropriate atmosphere for this type of game that you wouldn't get with bright sunny days.  I'm not as picky about \"textures\" and \"polygonal resolution\" as some people.  If it doesn't hurt my eyes and I can tell what's going on around me, then I'm happy.  Only during the final BOSS battle did I notice some framerate slow down...But there really is a huge amount of stuff going on.  There were some instances where enemies would \"slide\" out to attack or their body parts would flutter about on the ground...But I don't get too hung up on those things if the gameplay has me moving on.  It's not the best graphics I've seen, but it also wasn't dreadful...A 9.0 here.SOUND - Another excellent point in this game.  There is repetition, particularly in death sounds...But I honestly haven't played a game that didn't have the same sounds looped throughout the game...The sound was really pretty good all the way through.  Nothing weird and some were downright bone chilling.  Voice talent was also right on and there was nothing that seemed cheeky or out of place.  I was never left wondering what someone said.  That's worth a 10 to me.GAMEPLAY - This is where Dark Sector earns its keep.  I went into this game with LOW expectations.  I think that helped me get pulled into the action, and there is PLENTY of action!  I wasn't too crazy about the Prologue in black & white...But the rest of the game is hardly bright & shiny colors so I guess it's within the overall theme.  There are puzzles, one of them timed.  There's uncontrolled, splattering gunfire with vibration feedback.  You have to think on your feet and play smart.  There are upgrades, some you pick and others you acquire.  Just when you think you've hit a dead spot, it comes right back in your face.  It's a challenging game, decent storyline and when you complete the game you feel like you've accomplished something.  It might not be saving the world, but these things do make for a very worthwhile diversion.  This one's got it where it counts...10.This is not a long game, maybe 8-10 hrs for some or 20 hrs for others...But it's an INTENSE game.  That's what I like!  Once you beat it on \"Normal\" difficulty, it opens up the BRUTAL level...So there is some replay value if you're up for it.  That last BOSS battle had me freakin out for a good 30 min...I can only imagine what it must be on brutal difficulty!So, the unbelievably HORRID cover art aside, Dark Sector is really worth a play.  I'll give a game a 1-star rating if I feel it's deserved and I don't just hand out 5-star ratings without a game really proving itself to me.  Check out other games I've given 5-stars and you'll see what kind of company I believe Dark Sector keeps.  And ONLY $6 now?!?  It would probably be 3 times that if the cover art was anything like that of Kill Zone 2 or Resistance 2.If only I could get a SOLID game like this for just $6 every week (that's not a rental)...I'd be a VERY HAPPY PS3er!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Kevin T.

True Sega Saturn had lousy 3D graphics and  bad third-party support, no one can deniy the fact it had some great games  on it.  And I hate Playstation, but because they shaped their graphics just  right the games somehow came out looking better than N64.  Not only do we  get a really cheesy system, they also had to turn many classic 2D games and  turn them into horrible 3D games (Like Earthworm Jim 3D, Zelda, Donkey Kong  64, Kirby, Rayman 2, and so much more...)!  Plus the controll drove me  bonkers the way they controll it.  Sometimes the controll's bother me so  much I have to stop playing the game.  Plus because the games are in  cartriges (Lousy sound and space because of this) they cost [a lot]  and the games are usally short and don't last more than a couple of hours  before you're finished with the game.  And this is from someone who has  loved all their other systems they made.  Which is why I was crying after I  played this thing (I still think once was too painfull) at a friends house.

{"product_name":"B000BI3QK2","description":"","reviewerName":"Paul Mosier","summary":"The Zenith of Role Playing Games","reviewText":"After playing this game for over one hundred hours I believe I have an adequate amount of time spent for an accurate review. Being a fan of RPG's I would have to say I am somewhat biased, but have played hundreds of games over the course of 16 years.Game play: Elder Scrolls IV has some of the most phenomenal action I've ever seen in an RPG. I would definitely consider it to be an action RPG. Unlike many conventional role playing games everything is real time. The new radiant AI system was used for Elder Scrolls IV in which the NPC characters lead regular lives and make their own decisions. Unfortunately this means that sometimes you can't find members of your guild or faction. I count seven different factions which I have joined so far; The Knights Errant, The Blades, The Fighters Guild, The Mages Guild, The Arena, Order of The Virtuous Blood. Each gives you the ability to advance to the top. While the game is not as interactive as I would like (i.e. the ability to cut down trees etc.) it is considerably more interactive than many other RPGs out there. Quests are quite varied in length, difficulty and aspects. There is a main quest line which has you searching for an heir to the emperor of Cyrodiil.Setup: One of my favorite things about this game is the hot buttons where you can have eight different spells, weapons or armor of your choosing. This allows for great ease of use while in the heat of a battle. There are four sections in the menu area: character, weapons, spells and log of quests. It is a huge improvement over Morrowind in my opinion and is very organized. Each section has subdivisions to divide even further.In the beginning of the game you are offered a choice of races and then classes to choose from much like Elder Scrolls III; after which you are able to customize the look of the heroine with an unimaginable number of facial features and skin tones as well as age and hairstyle.Leveling up is done by increasing your major skills; each class has a set of major skills for example mine was a Breton, battle mage, the mage so a few of my skills were blade, blunt, alteration, destruction, conjuration and a few others. If you are looking to level up a great deal plan on spending hundreds of hours playing the game because after nearly 110 hours of game play my character is at level 33 out of 120. Also many people believe that the monsters/people that are fought level up with you. This is not entirely true. As you level up the actual enemies change-not their level. For example at level one the most difficult animal you will fight in Cyrodiil is a wolf while at my current level it would be an ogre.Graphics: The artistic care that was taken to create this game is breathtaking. Every little detail adds to the overall masterpiece that is Elder Scrolls IV. It is by far the best looking game I have ever seen bar none. Much of this is due to the graphical prowess of the Xbox 360 or one's top of the line graphics card. Nonetheless, the makers of Oblivion have created a work of art. The forests are so realistic it's sometimes easy to forget it is a game. Each leaf and flower is discernable with vibrant vivacious colors and moves with the wind. The shading is the aspect that gives the most realism to the game. Unfortunately, I can only describe the landscape of the game to a certain extent. In order to truly experience it you must try it for yourself.Music: There isn't much to say about the music. It is dreamy and fits the medieval feel of the game; as usual is in 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound.Cons: Unfortunately there is no such thing as a perfect game so of course there are a few small downsides to Oblivion. One of the things that really bothered me is the speed of the leveling up. I wrote about this earlier on in the review. I would have expected to be much higher in level by the time I had completed all the quests for each faction. 144 quests and only at level 33-doesn't exactly seem like even trade-off. However, I'm sure there are quicker ways to achieve a higher level. Some smaller qualms I have with the game are: the voices used for NPCs in the game-from what I can tell there are only about ten different people doing voice acting, while in battles when your horse is near, the enemy most of the time goes for the weakest thing around, which is of course the horse. I lost probably three or four horses because of this. The \"solution\" is to pay for horse armor by downloading it on Xbox Live for like $2.00. Honest, I don't think you should have to pay for something that they messed up.Rating:Game play: 9.5/10Setup: 10/10Graphics 10/10Music 10/10Replay Value 8/10If you absolutely wanted to play Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion for the cheapest price my recommendation would be to buy an Xbox 360 core system. You ask why I would say to get an Xbox over just purchasing it for the computer; the most obvious is the graphics capability of the average game player's computer. First of all if you plan to run this game on a laptop most would need to purchase a whole new computer with a GPU to handle the game probably running anywhere from $1500 to upwards of $5000. Secondly it would be possible to upgrade a desktop computer to run Oblivion. If you plan to do it you would most likely need to have at least 1 gigabyte of free RAM, a graphics card for the game I would expect to be about $200 or more. The last thing and of course the most expensive is the processor. A hyper threading 2.8 GHZ Pentium or better is I believe minimum to get a smooth running game. I would suggest a dual core processor. In essence it would not only be cheaper for most just to buy the Xbox but a lot less of a hassle seeing as the 360 already has the capabilities to run this caliber of game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2006"}

I recently played through halo reach on legendary and decided to play through Halo 3 ODST again on Legendary. this game is just amazing ( in my opinion ). If you are a true halo fan I dont really see what is not to like about this game. I know that alot of people dont like the fact that you dont play throught this game as the Master Chief. This doesnt affect the game at all. Instead you play through as an Orbital Drop Shock Trooper (ODST) . The game is a little harder especially on heroic and legendary settings because you cant just go in guns blazing and expect to live. you have to pick your targets carefully and use your cover. since you are not the enhanced super soldier Master Chief you cant take the damage that he could. there is a bit of tactical play in this game compared to the previous titles. Sometimes rather than engaging in a fire fight it is best to try and find a way around a large group of enemies rater than engage because you are rather fragile compared to the Master Chief. I also found that when you come across more powerful weapons like the rocket launcher , Plasma cannon , covanent sniper rifle , etc. its always best to keep one of these in reserve. I tried to always have one of these on me at all times because you cant always get around some of the more powerful enemies and having one of these weapons evens the playing field a bit.I find that the plazma cannon is the best for the slow moving Hunters and the enemy vehicles. All in all this is still Halo and you are just playing as a special forces soldier an ODST. you have to be tactical like I said and be more careful in how you engage the enemy . this new element in the Halo series makes for a good change of pace and one I think you will love as I do.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2010"}

It was an epic cRPG that not only absorbed you into a world of scheming nobles, romantic witches and invading darkspawn but it was also an exercise in morality choices and balancing the clashing personalities of your companions. Following in its success, everyone and their grandmother is waiting to play the sequel (for some reason, the grandmother usually opts for a handsome rogue character). However, the question is this: does the sequel prove worthy of the original?Well, like an embellished Varric's tale, it seems to be a mix of good-news and bad-news.LEVELING UP (FINALLY) MAKES SENSEIn most cRPGs, leveling up involves adding points to strength, constitution, dexterity, intelligence etc - which, in turn, have an effect on health points, dialogue options, defending ability and damage dealt. By reading the manual you know what affects what, however, in most games, you cannot readily see those effects as you level up. Not so with DAO2. Every point added to an attribute will increase the derived statistics on the same screen.COME FOR THE LOOT. STAY FOR THE STORY - YOUR STORYYour hero, Hawk, lives during the times of the last blight, fleeing Lothering as it is burned to the ground.  Your decade-long story is narrated by Varric Tethras, a companion of yours. However, how the story will twist and turn is entirely up to your actions and choices.  The story will absorb you completely because it reaches so many bifurcation points that, in the end, it is entirely your personal creation. And, yes there are companions with...benefits here as well;))I am guessing blood-branding the bridge of one's nose will be the next fashion fad.THE FREE MARCHES NEVER LOOKED MORE BEAUTIFULIn a nutshell: you are not actually playing the promo video but the graphics are beautiful.The armor and clothes could use some more work in depth and texturing but the environments, the warrior moves and the spells look spectacular (keep in mind that said moves and spells will also start to look familiar after a while, especially since they look much more impressive than the actual damage they inflict - and have to be repeated again and again in every battle).What I truly missed though was the isometric tactics perspective! The camera does zoom in and out and it pans around but it is no longer possible to get a bird's eye view of the battlefield and plan your attacks accordingly. And this was not the only thing I found missing.FEWER OPTIONS ARE HARDLY EVER AN IMPROVEMENT IN AN RPGIn DAO I favored a dual-wielding warrior, building up both strength and dexterity, equipping him with both Maric's blade and Starfag and giving him all the cool moves of double-yielding.  Well, although DAO2 is hardly short in cool moves, it offers less specialization options in order to make warriors and rogues visibly distinct on the battlefield - hence a warrior in DAO2 cannot dual-wield.Do you find being human in a fantasy game trivial and prefer to play the role of an elf or a dwarf? Sorry, Flemeth did not see that in your cards: EA decreed you can only play a human in DA2 (and I am laying the blame on EA simply because something tells me it was a cost-cutting decision).Personal preferences aside, the number of abilities and skills has also decreased - and some, like coercion, I outright missed.WHAT'S NEXT, RPGs WITH EMOTICONS OVER THE NPCs' HEADS?What I also missed was real dialogue options. If, like me, you found DAO laconic, you will sure find DA2 almost, well,...illiterate. Sure, your hero now has a voice but did the dialogue options have to consist of such short summary-phrases that give you only the gist of what is to be said? And why did those options have to be presented on a (Mass Effect!?) dialogue wheel with...visual hints on the attitude of the responses available? More often than not, you end up saying a completely different thing than what you intended...Give some credit to your customers Bioware, we can read!AM I PLAYING A FANTASY GAME OR WAS I BEAMED TO THE BRIDGE OF NORMANDY?This is the first thing that hits you actually. Playing, and enjoying, a fantasy cRPG requires immersion - and the graphical interface plays an essential role in this. It was not by mistake thatBaldur's Gatehad menus designed as if chiseled in stone, whereasIcewind Dale'swere as if carved out of dark wood. The interface sets the mood of the game. Now, can someone please explain to me what are ...SciFi (read, Mass Effect!?) menus doing in a medieval fantasy game?Not only does one expect to find himself in a spaceship whenever the skills-tree or inventory menu is closed, but the in-game information is now displayed in smaller portraits with horizontal bars for health-&-stamina/mana. The portraits have moved from the upper to the lower left side of the screen; however, if opening up the screen for gameplay was the aim, well, they now seem to take up more space than before. Not to mention that they are harder to see.WHAT GAME AM I PLAYING AGAIN?Watch a gameplay video of the upcomingDungeon Siege IIIandDiablo IIIand try to answer this: can you really tell a difference in the gameplay? Sure, their stories and graphical styles are bound to be somewhat different but action games, hack&slashers; and RPGs seem to have merged into a single hybrid-genre of quick cinematic moves, looting, bartering, re-equipping and leveling.  And DA2 did not escape this.Whereas DAO had lots and lots of character, its sequel appears to have clearly favored style. I am sure it tested better on the teenage (console-seasoned) target groups - but I am also sure that said target groups did not include any RPG purists.(ALMOST) REASONABLE DRM ADDS EXTRA POINT TO FEALTYEA dropped the ball with the recently released and over-DRMedDAO-Ultimate Editionso, hopefully, they learned a valuable lesson. Going the draconian way of UBISOFT & 2K GAMES only manages to shoot your own sales on the foot. Surprisingly, DA2, although not perfect, sports a reasonable DRM scheme.The game requires initial activation (add half a star to the overall rating if this is not important to you) and it will re-authenticate every time it is run and it has access to internet connection - but it will not require to do so in order to run. In other words, once activated at installation you can block its internet access and it will run fine. Moreover, it contains neither disc-checks nor any form of SecuROM - at least not according to the official EA/BIOWARE announcements. Let's only hope this customer-friendl(ier) trend holds when the DLCs start rolling out...Initially I had rated the game at 3.5-stars game - and then rounded my rating up rather than down because of how much I enjoyed the series overall. However, as I progressed I realized that I could not honestly give this game more than 3-stars, pedigree or not.DA2 is a good-looking game that relies more on its stylish hacking&slashing; than any uniqueness of character and on the appeal of forging a personal story rather than following a deeper preset one.Without any hesitation, I would choose the original game over the sequel. DA2 may not measure up but it is still a fun game on its own, one that will stay with you long after the last blade is swung and the last spell is cast.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2011"}

Recalling both \"Half-Life\" and the aforementioned \"Halo,\" \"Far Cry\" still manages to find a place all to itself.The game casts you as Carver, an ex-military type who now spends his time in the tropics sailing people around on a rickety boat. As luck would have it, he's met by a freelance reporter named Valerie who wants to take pictures of a high tech island facility - but she's more than she seems to be, and the facility, apart from being guarded by an army of mercenaries, is the home of some genetic research that's gone terribly wrong. Carver gets hopelessly entangled in this business despite his (constant) protests, and has no choice but to fight his way off the island. Regrettably, despite the potential coolness of the storyline and characters, the plot is perhaps the weakest element of \"Far Cry.\" The story only makes so much sense if you haven't familiarized yourself with the tidbits in the instruction manual, and there aren't any real surprises.Despite this shortcoming, \"Far Cry\" plays like nothing else. The Crytek engine is nothing short of staggering - you can see miles around you in every direction with little to no visible scenery \"pop in,\" and all of this at a surprisingly slick frame rate! Lush jungles, ancient ruins, and high tech bunkers are all rendered exceedingly well, and they're full of armed thugs and mutant monstrosities just itching to tear you a new one... and they will if you think you can just \"run and gun.\" Enemy artificial intelligence is certainly imperfect, but sometimes utilizes very believable tactics to flush you out, flank you, or otherwise get the drop on you. The game's less human adversaries tend to take a more direct approach (because they can), but they're suitably menacing, and sometimes even downright scary.Given that \"Far Cry\" is a shooter, it's worth noting that the actual shooting is intensely gratifying. Rag doll physics send your foes flipping and collapsing in mostly plausible ways, and your weapons selection is certainly a worthy one. You are limited in how many weapons you can actually carry around at any given time (think \"Halo\"), but this only adds to the game's strategic depth. You can also pilot vehicles in the game (again, think \"Halo\"), and they're not only helpful for getting you from point A to point B in record time - some of them have mounted guns that pack a wallop. These vehicles are well implemented (all except the wasted hand glider) and easy to master, and further add to the meat of this already remarkable game.There are a few problems in paradise, though. Collision detection can be spotty sometimes - shoot a merc in the head and he may drop immediately, or he may keep coming until you shoot him several more times. Also, the boxed version of the game does not employ a quick save feature, and instead forces you to play by \"checkpoints.\" A PC game should never limit you in this fashion, particularly when some of the game's checkpoints are unevenly spaced. Still, it's not a serious issue, and it should be fixed in an upcoming patch. The game's finale, which fails to rise to the occasion, is a harder problem to address, but it's not a deal breaker either. Finally, I would have liked to encounter more enemy types in the game - similar mercs and mutants await you at pretty much every turn, and midway through the game you'll have encountered pretty much all of them.In the end, \"Far Cry\" is still an awesome game - the best one released in 2004, and an easy contender for \"Game of the Year,\" or, at the very least, \"Best FPS.\" The heavyweights such as \"Doom III\" and \"Half-Life 2\" have their work cut out for them, because \"Far Cry\" is not much of a slouch in any department. Good luck, guys.Final Score: A- (5 stars on a curve)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2004"}

FarCry is best played on the generation 256mb cards. If you don't have one well between this, Half Life 2 and DOOM 3, you really should or else you are not going to really experience this games are you?FarCry makes use of everything your machine can throw at it. On top resolution the grass, trees, textures, maps, animation, shadows, gun fire, zooms, explosions, water are virtually unparalleled in terms of graphics except for DOOM 3 which beats it in lighting and story although FarCry can certainly holds it on for some time to come.What makes FarCry so good is the endless size of the tropical islands, with the mercenaries running around the place looking for you. The game works on the bases of save points which activate a save for you. This is a type of saving the game that is turning some people off, but it does increase suspense dramatically and you should at least try and use it to improve the enjoyment you get from the gaming experience.Really FarCry is a first person blast em up at its complex and detailed heart. There is no real content to review except go blast your way into becoming a hero and experience a type of world design not seen before. You get to drive, walk, run, swim, battle beasties, run through swamps with an M60 and night vision, blasting the baddies all night long. Its graphics make it well worth playing however it is not a wholly original experience - just a damn good that pushes a RADEON 9800 256mb to see what it can do and it is pretty impressive making the XBOX and PS2 look like a gameboy in comparison. Start the 256mb revolution with this, DOOM 3 and Half Life 2 when it comes out.

However the title was released in an incredibly busy fall/winter period and despite some positive press, the game didn't exactly sell well, not to mention the criticisms that it was too easy. I will admit the platforming was very rudimentary and basic in that game but it was also slightly zen-like, almost effortless and you never felt frustrated by the puzzle-y platforming aspects and it was a game where you can just...\"go\" and not worry about repeating long sections or have your fifth attempt at another hard section. Which makes the appearance of \"Forgotten Sands\" a very curious one, not only because it makes you wonder if they're even planning to continue the Elika story or if they stopped because of the low sales or if this is just a bonus release until a \"Prince of Persia 2\" or whatever it's called. And then of course there's the film version of \"The Sands of Time\" coming so close to the game's release and it makes you wonder about what this game is trying to do: rejuvenate the old Prince after the low sales of the last one? Just a simple cash grab for the movie-going masses? Either way, it's a game that as a longtime Prince of Persia fan, I don't regret I played it but I do regret that it's not a great game.Story: Set in-between the time between Sands of Time and Warrior Within, we find the Prince (now voiced by Yuri Lowenthal who did Sands of Time and Two Thrones) visiting his brother's kingdom only to have it under siege. The brother, at a loss and outnumbered, unleashes a powerful demon known as Ratash and the 2 brothers carry a medallion that can end the whole affair but the brother, caring for his kingdom but also for the newfound power, doesn't make it easy and it's up to you to once again save another kingdom and bring down Ratash.Warrior Within got heavy flak for being a really dark game in which the Prince said lines like \"you bitch!\" and apparently became a Godsmack fan, as evidenced by the metal riffs as well as the darker tone of the game in general, let alone the storyline but personally, aside from the metal, it kind of made sense. Having messed with time so much in the first game, the Dahaka was sent after the Prince almost like a time officer, trying to make the Prince atone for all the time interference he did and tried to kill him, causing the Prince to be constantly hunted and barely getting any sleep by the time Warrior Within rolled around. There's none of that in Forgotten Sands; there's no change in personality, no mention of the Dahaka's upcoming appearance and aside from one mention of Farah, this might as well have been a stand alone. The main plot itself in the game isn't that exciting either as there's no Kaileena to play off of or a Farah for some love triangle or even any kind of bond and the character you mainly associate with in the game seems more like an ally than anything more. Ultimately, Forgotten Sands as a story feels kind of unnecessary and it could've taken place before Sands of Time or after Two Thrones and you wouldn't have been able to tell the difference.Graphics: Like I mentioned above, the 2008 version of Prince of Persia is still one of the most stunning games available on consoles and not only the artistic design but the vistas, animation and impeccable detail makes it a sumptuous treat for the eyes. Forgotten Sands on the other hand looks bland and even when the game opens up with adding some new color, the game still doesn't look terribly gorgeous. Ubisoft basically said the combat was like the previous trilogy only there would be at least 50 enemies on screen but apparently somebody didn't tell them to have the game optimized for that kind of enemy count as the game can slow to a crawl and there's even gameplay hiccups during platforming itself at times which boggles the mind since Assassin's Creed II was twice as populated in parts and that thing barely coughed. Then again, the set piece at the end of the game is stunning and one bizarre location looks nice but the chief offender is the Prince's face, almost neanderthal-ish, like his face has no bone structure. This I don't get either since the Wii version and even the cover and disc art has a much better looking Prince so why his face looks so messed up is just weird.Sound/Music: Like mentioned above, Yuri Lowenthal provides the voice again and I got to say I missed him. Nolan North did a fan job with 2008 one but he felt almost stoic, kind of bland as a main character. Yuri's Prince on the other hand is fallible and still has that tendency to talk to himself and make little quips about things and while he's not as buff and manly, he feels way more relatable as a main character. The music is pretty good but it's not really a memorable soundtrack and one you can hum but I guess it does the job well. The sound effects are decent and pretty basic so there's nothing much to talk about there.Gameplay: One complaint that was lobbied against the '08 one was that it was too easy, but mainly people were complaining about Elika and her tendency to save you from mistimed jumps and mistakes even though all she was a fancier (and cuter) time rewind from Sands of Time or even a \"now loading\" screen substitute. Forgotten Sands tries to bring back the trickier parts of Sands of Time with timing and mastery of your abilities getting you through. Prince gets 3 main abilities: the time rewind which is back like you remember, make a mistake, press RB and rewind to give you another chance. There's also the...I don't know what to call it but it's like the power from Epilogue DLC from the last game where you can bring back platforms, beams or water fountains/jets and reinstate them to be used but only one can be turned on at the same time. But your main ability is the water freeze where holding LT will freeze water which either acts like a water column you can climb up or jump off of or make it like a beam you can jump and swing off of. These abilities will start to mesh a bunch in the game and pretty soon you got to freeze a waterfall, run up it, jump off, freeze the jet to jump off, turn on a platform, wall-run across a frozen waterfall, jump off and...yeah, it gets complicated, almost turning the game into a rhythm game. My biggest issue though is that the controls don't feel...\"nailed\" and you'll absolutely swear you pressed the button to make the Prince jump off a wall or have him not run up a wall even though you're holding the button for it. The platforming's as tricky as ever but it's just the controls that are not quite as refined as I would've liked. If you're a longtime Prince fan, you'll know the difference between a legitimate mistake on your part and a control issue where the Prince did something you had no intent in doing and sadly, the game has a few.In 2008, the Prince had more of a cinematic one-on-one (well, two, counting Elika) and I kind of liked it, especially since the Sands trilogy had a more button-mashy vibe and that returns in Forgotten Sands though there is some differences. One is that the game has 4 powers you can use, ice power that shoots out waves of ice when you attack, a flame attack that sets enemies a-light, a shockwave that knocks enemies to the ground and a stone armor that gives you better defense. The lack of a block button I feel is disappointing because the enemies are quite plentiful and it's very easy to get hit by people you didn't even know were about to hit since there's at best 40 or even 50 onscreen at once. But the combat feels adequate but definitely not ideal since lack of lock-on makes you swiping at the air but the kick button gives you a way to knock enemies away and give you some breathing room (plus it allows you to get your \"300 `This is Sparta!''\" kicks out, complete with achievement). My one issue here is the camera because there's these typical rhino bosses where you have to dodge before they ram into you, causing them to crash into the wall, but when you're juggling fighting 30 guys in addition to 2 rhinos, getting nailed out of nowhere than nailed by the second one while you're down is beyond frustrating. As much as the platform is the highlight in Prince games, the combat always seems to be a problem.The puzzles aren't exactly that tricky and it's more platforming puzzles now though there's some occasional \"puzzle\" puzzles in there. They seriously overdid the swinging spiky logs, the spike-y floors and the spike-y columns that move back and forth and after awhile you feel like \"is this all the platforming you're going to make me do?\" Also the game is remarkably short and aside from a slow beginning it starts to pick up but the game has barely any replay value and there's not much reason to replay the game aside from achievements/trophies.So should you buy Prince of Persia: Forgotten Sands? If you own the previous 4 or you're a diehard Prince fan anyway, then go ahead but personally I wouldn't. It's too brief given its full retail price and from a story standpoint, it's nice nostalgia but unneeded so this game is what I call the \"Gift game\": you'd gladly accept if somebody bought it for you but paying full price yourself just doesn't sound right. Solid rental.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2010"}

All the big hallmarks of the Call of Duty franchise seem to be here, linear story and cut scenes. But it doesn't seem to have the care and the excitement of the first two CoDs. And the third installment adds nothing to the game. For all intents it is just a poorly done expansion of the second game with no real improvements of polishing. It also seems that half of the game your character is being controlled by the computer or in a state of advanced shell shock. This seems to be a very heavy handed way of insuring the player appreciates all the scripted events throughout the game.As just another FPS WW2 shooter it might be an alright game. But since it carries the Call of Duty name people should, and do, expect it to be better than average. It is unfortunate that CoD3 isn't.

Yes, this is a large claim, but one that can be explained in a single phrase: Next-Gen Freedom.Driver's heaven is a wide open worldIn Paradise City even cars can fly.View larger.Go for broke in 'Marked Man' Mode.View larger.Nothing is off limits, even head-on crashes.View larger.Start a race any time with 'Easy Drive.'View larger.Although theBurnoutseries&#146; over the top mobile action has been its calling card since it ignited audiences on the PS2 in 2001, and later on the first generation Xbox console,Burnout Paradiseis the first game in the series that has been designed specifically for play on Next Generation consoles. This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Happy r/c","summary":"Motorcycle doing wheelie can't flip backwards","reviewText":"Try GRID racing game which I think is better.Way, way too many screen options before I could just start racing is very very frustrating.Only 1 car and 1 motorcycle, the rest have to be bought online (stop nickel and dime me).I didn't grow up with muscle cars, mostly rice burner cars.Awesome crash scenes.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2010"}

Besides having Angelina Jolie prance around as Lara Croft in the movie adaptations (which isn't a bad thing to look at mind you) there hasn't been a decent Tomb Raider game since Tomb Raider 2 for the PS1.  The last Tomb Raider game, the Angel of Darkness, was abysmal to say the least, but it looks like Eidos is trying to restore the franchise to it's former glory with Tomb Raider: Legend.  The first thing you'll notice about this game are the mouth watering graphics.  Yes, this is the PS2, and the graphics are simply awesome.  Lara Croft looks better than ever as she goes back to doing what she does best: raid tombs!  The game puts you back in the dark and mysterious tombs that made the franchise worth playing, and for the most part, they are well designed and challenging enough without getting too annoying to navigate.  There's some motorcycle based levels as well, and the same puzzle solving elements and gunplay are well done as well.  The game's story may not be the most well written material you'll come across, but what stops Tomb Raider: Legend from being something really special is the game's length.  The game can be completed in a matter of hours or a whole afternoon, which is so disappointing it makes Activision's GUN look as epic as Final Fantasy VII.  Despite it's maddening shortness, Tomb Raider: Legend is a step in the right direction for Eidos to restoring the franchise to the pedigree it deserves to be at, and maybe next time we'll have something really special on our hands.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2006"}

Having software to force games to support a controller when they normally don't? Even crazier. But this thing also apparently works on the PS3 -unless the game uses sixaxis, then it will not help you there.Many use the 360 gamepad with their PC games these days and it's a fine choice for the most part, however that controllers dpad leaves a lot to be desired. The logitech has a far better dpad despite it not looking that way, overall it's pretty comparable to the 360 controller in many ways- and it's cheaper and more versatile so this controller to me wins by default. I will say the triggers are worse than the 360's by a large sum but they're still pretty good.It feels good in the hand and doesn't feel like one of the cheap 3rd party controllers you'd find in stores for consoles. Buttons feel nice and everything seems to work perfectly fine.In the 2D platformer: Blood Rayne (Not the older 3D titles) there was a platforming section that had you bouncing off enemies to cross a pit, with the 360 controller it was very, very difficult to get it to always get what you wanted, with this? Far better.Passes the test with classic games such as Sonic 3 and Knuckles, even speeding around the special stages smoothly was a nice little thing I couldn't do with my 360 controller. When the switch is on the x mode, all games that work with a 360 pad will work with this without a bit of fussing, steam works with it, Devil May Cry 4, Borderlands 2, Darksiders, Darksiders 2 and even found profiles for it to work with Mass Effect 2 or 3, works for me! :|The quick and dirty review:Want a cheaper more versitle option to the 360 controller that has a far better dpad but mediocre triggers that requires no added work to get working with games that support the 360 controller? This is your controller. Want a wireless version with rumble? Get the 710, it's still cheaper than the 360 pad and has all this controllers features.This review isn't stating the 360 pad is bad, I have 3 of those but I can say with years of experience with that pad they are NOT good for platformers if you want to use the dpad.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8M4","description":"It's often argued that Nintendo makes the best video games in the world,  but one thing the company isn't known for is scary games. If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster. While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C. Persia. And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Julia","summary":"Fantastic, but not for everyone","reviewText":"I have to say, this is a very amusing game. It is cliche in some ways, but certain aspects are so unique that they highly outweigh the typicality. The parts that are pretty frequent in games like these are the types of enemies (very normal zombies), the environments, and the stories (many might disagree with me on that third one, though).Now, if you enjoy plots like this (it's sort of complicated, you should read about it first), you will love this game. Personally, they are not my favorite. They are relatively common for being a zombie game.However, this is where I will say how outlandishly abnormal this game is. There is something that I have never encountered before, and this is my favorite part of the game--there is a SANITY meter. It depletes over time, and the lower it gets, the more bizarre things that start to happen (it is, in some ways, similar to an adult swim game called Schizophrenzy). Now, this sounds much more bland than it actually is, I can assure you. There are a lot of things that can happen because of this meter lowering to dangerous levels. But my absolute favorite one by far is when the TV's sound begins to lower, and that's not all--as it lowers, the bar that shows up on the TV when it lowers (like when you press the volume up or down on the TV, the bar that appears showing how low or high it is). So when this happened, it is actually one of the rarer ones to appear, I frantically searched for the remote, thinking one of my cats was sitting on it. I found the remote and I was in awe when I saw it was untouched--my friend and I figured out eventually that it was because of the sanity meter. But for about an hour we were convinced that my house was haunted. It was terrifying living on the top of a woodsy hill in a secluded city at 1:30 in the morning. That sold me. But the other sanity meter results (there are a LOT of different ones) are creepy and confusing, as well.I have told this to many, many people. It was just that fantastic to me.There are a lot of puzzles in this game, and they are cool, but most of them are a bit complicated to me. My friend was the one playing (he had played this game thoroughly prior to this, though), so maybe if I were the one playing I would've figured them out from exploring more.Anyway, parts of the game (namely the puzzles) reminded me of a more complex Tomb Raider game.I would say, if you like games like these, this is definitely worth the time and money. But if you're like me, then you might prefer to simply watch parts of it from online videos or friends playing the game, because the sanity meter is, without a shred of doubt, the best facet of this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00007UHPJ","description":"Primalfollows the story of Jen Tate, a modern woman who must face the demons of an immortal universe to discover her own supernatural origin. As Jen, players learn to unleash and control four different demon-fighting forms, each possessing unique skills and attributes, as they are immersed in a fantasy world joined inextricably with our own. This is not a world of goblins and barbarians, or any other such fantasy fare. Within the dark realms ofPrimal&#146;s alternate universe, gamers find themselves involved in an intricate and realistic story--enhanced by several subplots and twists--that makes them question the fine line between fantasy and reality.Primalis a story-driven game of exploration, combat, and puzzles, presented through the experiences of Jen and Lewis, a present-day human couple drawn into discord by eternal forces. While gameplay revolves around the events of the story, there are many personal revelations and surprises for the characters along the way. Essential to the game&#146;s core is the unusual and evolving relationship betweenPrimal&#146;s two main playable characters, Jen and her companion Scree, a gargoyle. Players can switch between Jen and Scree at any time and will be required to assess and utilize each character&#146;s strengths to succeed in various areas of the game.Primalis set within a huge environment featuring four expansive realms surrounding a central hub. A dynamic loading system allows for uninterrupted gameplay between levels, and magical portals act as links and windows into other worlds. Additional technological achievements include seamless character morphing between Jen&#146;s human and demon forms, extravagant particle effects, and environmental effects such as fog and mist.","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Fantastic adventure game - just save often","reviewText":"This brilliant adventure game has Jen as an intelligent 21 year old woman who learns she has supernatural powers - and must use them to keep the world from ending.There are many ways in which this game shines. First and foremost, the plot and environment in which the adventure takes place has a huge attention to detail. Jen and her boyfriend are into the nightclub scene - he's a heavy metal singer - and the way in which the movie opens really draws you in. The club they're in looks exactly like a few I've been in.The characters are extremely realistic, smart and savvy. This isn't a brainless bimbo having to 'learn about life'. Sure, she doesn't know about her supernatural powers at first, but she's quick on the uptake and takes care of herself. This is definitely a chick that girls can look up to and that guys will want to get to know.Along comes Scree, a fun gargoyle that gives her a hand. The combination of Jen's abilities and Scree's special powers makes the puzzle solving and adventures even more fun, as you figure out which would be better in a situation. Yes, there's some fighting. But this is NOT a button-mashing game. The intro sequence definitely sets the pace. This is more like an interactive movie in which you actively affect the plot, rather than a run-around-gathering-coins brainless activity.There are different worlds and different characters you meet, and the PS2's graphics have really been tested in this game. The heat waves that rise from torches, the steamy breath in the wintery world, the reflective lighting, the detail on the characters - it's all extremely impressive and helps immerse you in the game.The sound is great too. Unlike other games that feel you need an action-packed thumping soundtrack while you explore a quiet environment, this game gives you the soft noises you'd expect - very realistic ones at that. It makes the times where something is jarring - like the snarl of a nearby monster - really affect you. The Heavy Metal thumping only jumps in during battles, where it doesn't seem intrusive.The game definitely isn't for the wham-bam-thank-you-maam type of gamer. Puzzles won't be solved in 3 seconds by jumping up platforms. You have to really examine your environment and consider what might help you out. Which is good for most gamers, but will be frustrating for gamers raised on instant gratification.Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the game is that it wasn't QAed thoroughly enough before release. The game had numerous problems with freezing up and stuttering speech, meaning that I had to save frequently to ensure lots of work was not lost. Perhaps it's understandable with a game this complex, but another month of testing and fixing would have been well worth it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2003"}

The last one that I enjoyed was an Xbox launch title, and it featured a beautiful white-haired assassin on its cover. That game was Dead or Alive 3. Naturally, Team Ninja's fourthcoming fighting game got my attention, and after being pushed back a few weeks, Dead or Alive 4 for the Xbox 360 finally released. Did it meet my expectations? After hours of learning combos and pounding opponents, I can finally say that yes, it's an amazing game.I always enjoyed the gameplay in Dead or Alive. It mixes playability with technicality unlike any other game out there. Button-mashers can have a good time because the fast-paced fighting allows mindless attacks. Those who memorize combos and time reversals can also enjoy the series, because it allows for that as well. The fighting in DOA4 is as fluid and fast as ever. Punches and kicks are incorporated beautifully into complex combos. Watching your fighter use his or her abilities is almost like watching an orchestrated dance, especially with some of the female characters. Team Ninja put an emphasis on the reversals and throws this time around, so those moves have been made a little easier with improved controls and timing. Once I learned reversals and a couple combos, I was set to go. I went from the button-masher camp to the finesse camp, and an in-game Sparring Mode can turn any newbie into an expert with just a little time.The Sparring Mode also offers a perfect opportunity to master the three new characters. Kokoro, the geisha-in-training, isn't a very exciting character by any means but she's new regardless. Eliot, one of my least favorite characters in recent memory, has a generic fighting style and an appearance that suggests Team Ninja forgot what gender he was intended to be. La Mariposa is a great addition, and her luchadora skills are perfect in DOA4. I enjoyed using her more than the other two new characters, but some of the fourteen returning characters are fantastic as well. My personal favorites were Kasumi, Ryu Hayabusa (of Ninja Gaiden fame), and Christie, the white-haired assassin and DOA3 cover character I mentioned earlier. Christie was my favorite character overall, but any player can find a character to enjoy. The slower fighters, like Bass and SPARTAN (yeah, the Halo character), aren't as easy to use but they're powerful and can take a few hits. Fast characters like Christie and Jann Lee are the ones I'd prefer to use, but some of them are pretty cheap. Like I said, there's a character for anyone here.There are a few different game modes, but the list is probably the most generic and traditional part about Dead or Alive 4. Story Mode allows you to unlock ending movies after completing eight stages of fighting with a particular character. Time Attack Mode forces you to complete stages as quickly as possible. Survival Mode, which was my favorite, thrusts you into a fighting ring where a constant, never-ending stream of enemies fight you to the death. By winning battles, your health regenerates, so the goal is to defeat as many opponents while earning as many points as possible and staying alive. I'd say that playing the Sparring Mode and Survival Mode made me a much better player than I ever was before.Online is where half of the fun lies. Team Ninja did an absolutely fantastic job making a unique online experience. Between each fast-paced battle is a lobby system that allows every player to have his or her own unique avatar. In the lobby, players interact with their avatar's animations as well as typed messages. It's endlessly entertaining to watch a cute little dog trash talk another player. If you aren't fighting, you can observe battles in a full-screen Watch Mode or on the lobby's television set. I simply loved this lobby system. The actual gameplay online is a little laggy, but it's fun and difficult to stop playing nonetheless. To avoid unfair matches, there is a grading system that makes sure that inexperienced players won't be teamed up against experts. This grading system is determined by wins, losses, disconnects, and the like. Overall, I think the online aspect of DOA4 is perfectly done.Another nearly-perfect aspect of DOA4 is the visuals. I still think that DOA3 is one of the prettiest games out there, but DOA4 blows it away completely. Whether you're playing in high-definition or not doesn't matter, because the beautiful levels and perfectly modeled characters look great on any television set or computer monitor. Each level is bursting with color and life and I really wanted to move around a bit more than the game let me. Most of the locations are layered as well, so fighting can be carried around the playing field pretty easily. The character animation is spot-on, and I think Team Ninja especially shows this with the long and slow throwing moves. From Christie's snake-like attacks to Bass's beefy wrestling grapples, every attack looks natural and, for the lack of a better word, perfect. I mentioned the levels being colorful, but the characters are also adorned with some of the most extravagant clothing items I've ever seen in a video game. Whether it's Ryu Hayabusa's fancy ninja suit from Ninja Gaiden or Zack's Teletubby-influenced costume, I was impressed throughout the entire costume selection.There isn't much to complain about here. Besides some annoying deaths (like when I'm pushed up against a wall), occasional online lag, and cheap characters (Zack and Jann Lee, I'm talking about you), Dead or Alive 4 is one of the best games I've played on the Xbox 360. Whatever Team Ninja did during those weekly delays, I'm happy about, because the final product is exceptional.(NOTE: This review is also posted on GameFreaks365.com, where I write reviews on a regular basis)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2006"}

I was expecting the game to be more of an expansion game to Pokemon White, instead of a full-blown, full-content Pokemon game. The game plays out extremely well, with a few added graphics enhancements to Pokemon White. The number of Pokemon is overwhelming in the game, as well as the number of areas and cities to explore. The story line is also cool, it picks up 2 years after the events of Pokemon White, so you get to see a lot of the old characters return. I could go on about every detail in this game, but suffice it to say that all features in this game work extremely well and are really fun to play. I would recommend this game to any fan of the Pokemon franchise!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"Whipple McTeelson the Third \"Purveryor of Mad...","summary":"Greatest Invention in the Illustrious History of Humanity!","reviewText":"To get right to it first, unlike some other unlucky souls my PS4 works.  Granted, though I don't doubt that some aren't working I have a feeling completely based on equal parts whimsy, irrationalism, bias and sheer hunchiness that many of the negative reviews on this and many other sites are just fools that don't even have a PS4 that want to tinkle all over the grand parade that is the unveiling of the PS4.  Sometimes it pays to plan ahead and simply pre-order on Amazon.Now onto the system.  To those that have bought a PS4 and played it I ask 'Isn't this thing a marvel?'  Cause it sure is.  Obviously the box is black and shaped like a parallelogram.  Just like all the pictures.  But unlike a lot of the other pictures when you fire it up the graphics are completely unbelievably unbelievable though since it is actually right there on the big screen I guess I just gotta believe.Sure, the master class that own PCs and play all their games on PCs and tinkle all over the rest of us console enthusiasts on our very own console based websites I guess I finally get to see the awesomeness of gaming that you saw 3 years back before your fancy computers have moved forward.  I stand in the wake of your speedy speed boats and think of what the PS5 will be like in 10 years.  But at least I ain't wasting thousands of dollars every year just to keep up with Cyrsis 4 when that game comes out in 3 years or so.  And though I don't get the unmitigated delight of popping a game in and crossing my fingers that it will work without having to rush back down to the computer store to get the latest $499 upgraded video card I just have to sit in front of my console and start playing right away with no thrill of the risk it might not work.And the PS4 controller.  Who woulda thunk it that Sony took the Dual Shock 2 and actually made it better.  I for one was hoping they'd scrap the silly thing and do a variation of the Dreamcast controller-which for me will stand as the pinnacle of gaming controllers.  But that's just me.  My standards don't stand in the rarified airs of most other gamers.  But I like me so I'm sticking with my opinion on this issue.  Granted, the PS4 controller still isn't a mouse and keyboard but I prefer to use the mouse and keyboard to type up reviews for Amazon rather than hunt down pesky buggy-like aliens infesting my monitor screen as seen in games like Halo 2 or well just about every game that doesn't have zombies in it.On a side note, I haven't put in a Blu Ray yet so I'm hoping it looks good.  I have downloaded the video apps and must say it's a thrill to watch back episodes of Tosh.O off the amazon prime gizmo.  HD has never looked better.And I'm not sure if there is a photo gallery on this console like there was on the PS3.  I probably shoulda checked into that before I posted this review but thoroughness is not my strong suit.However back to the games.  Yep, tasty morsels of silky smooth buttery fast games that just breathe.  There I got in the obligatory cliches that these idiot Gen Y'ers have to put in all their reviews on any tech product.  Anymore I just stop reading the review if they use any of the food references or phrase 'buttery smooth' regarding the frame rate and what the heck is it with the 'needs room to breathe' nonsense.  I bought a box of circuitry magicness, is there really a monkey in the box doing all the work?So before I ramble on I'm gonna end this to get back to a rousing round of Resogun right about now.  Sure, the games out aren't up to the grand expectations of those that want immediate innovations for every game that came out after the last.  To them I say 'shuddyup.'  I grew up on an Atari 2600.  I lived through the excitement of the big leap forward to the Atari 5200.  Innovation was simply having a game that didn't burn a permanent image into the tv screen.  Innovation was the first Activision game that demonstrated the Atari 2600 games didn't all have to look muddy.  Innovation was a hope that one day in the 21st century we'd have something that could do 1/10th of what even that silly Ouya kinda does.  So suck it up, play the games and stop the whining.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2013"}

The game is fast, furious and a great challenge for your reflexes and talents.We have played through the game numerous times now, on various settings. They do a great job of offering a gentle introduction for those who need it, as well as a truly insane mode for those who want the ultimate challenge. I wouldn't say any of the levels are a walk in the park, though. The game is all about tense combat situations. You have bullets flying all around you, noise bombarding your head, people screaming out for help. You have to be able to juggle your priorities, have eyes in the back of your head, and have a good stereo system to help you figure out where to turn.The developers did an awesome job here. From the detail of the graphics, the depth of the audio experience, the checkpointing system, everything is pretty top notch.Single player is really a training ground for you. It just isn't that long - you could play through the entire game in a full day, even on the harder levels once you build up your skills. It is meant to teach you how to play, how to strategize and how to prepare for the actual challenge - live humans.Now that being said, it is a REAL shame that there is no co-op mode. Some of the best fun we have in our gaming household is playing games like this side by side. It is amazingly rewarding. Why can't they add that ability in here? It wouldn't be that hard to integrate and it would make the game SO much more useful for us.They do have an XBox Live component, though. This is where things shine. You can now play literally for months and months without getting bored. However, I am aware that a contingent of people out there simply cannot play on the Live network, for a variety of reasons. For those people I might suggest renting the game for a weekend and see how much it appeals to you. It might be you enjoy replaying the single player missions - but it might be that a few times through is enough for you.Finally, I have to recommend that hard core gamers consider getting high quality headphones if there are non-gamers in the household. The noise level of this game is HUGE and it is just constant - screaming, bombs, guns, more screaming. It is great for the player, but less great for other people who are trying to do their normal household activities :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2008"}

The cell shaded graphics and how they animate in this game make this an unbelievably faithful homage to the Naruto series and just the anime genre in general.  The graphics are so good, they look even better than the anime itself (if you compare with the very first episodes of this series).  And the animation is ridiculously fluid while retaining that hand-drawn look, I don't know how they managed to pull it off so well.  This game was made years ago and just seeing this game run now is a testament to how amazing it was made when it first came out.That being said, there's about an equal amount of utter B.$. I had to put up with to get through the Ultimate Storyline Mode in this game.  It was a design choice by the developers, maybe to give us players the illusion that this fighting game has some depth to it.  And that game element that I am going to be talking/griping about in this next section is the open world.  Oh..my..god.. why do I have to play side quests (e.g. finding and delivering flowers from point A to B in this town) in order to gain enough XP to play the main missions?!  I'd rather just have a quality cutscene that included all the back story leading up to the battle rather than having to perform some random mission before I can fight my arch nemesis.So those two aspects of this game basically canceled each other out in my book, leaving it up to the final aspect that could tip the scales into the \"like\" column or the \"dislike\" side...and that would be the gameplay.  And to say the least, the gameplay is pretty decent.  It's not super deep like a Tekken or Virtual Fighter, but deeper than maybe a Street Fighter 2: Championship Edition.  I wouldn't say all of the characters are really balanced, they are more akin to the skill level how they stack up in the anime.  I really noticed the difference towards the end of the storyline mode when you they make you fight these boss characters with some of these scrub side characters (which are the equivalent of 'Dan' in the Street Fighter series).So in the end, you have amazing cell shaded graphics coupled with a ridiculously pointless side questing system in the storymode, the saving grace that makes this game worth playing through a couple of times is the decent gameplay.  It's not going to change your mind about fighting games, but it may get you either more interested in the Naruto Universe, or give you that satisfying feeling of fulfillment that your favorite anime has been faithfully recreated into a video game.  In either case, I enjoyed it to some degree.I give it a 3.5/5 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2012"}

It is not a \"sandbox\" environment, where you can go and do whatever you want, whenever you want. It does not have an xp/leveling system, like Fallout 3 and many other games do. Character development is non-existent, beyond getting better weapons and recipes for gadgets. And while the graphics are great, the game doesn't seem very realistic. It is often cartoon-like. Enemies can spawn a limitless number of times in many areas. This occurs when you fight the very first boss. While it does have a sneak mode, it often does not work. In fact, some of the enemies can see you from half a mile away, when you're barely peeking around a rock, while in sneak mode. Something most special forces soldiers wouldn't be able to do in real life. The vehicles, while convenient for rapid transportation, seem to be a central part of the game (something I'd rather do completely without). There are many areas where you must be in a vehicle, traveling fast, in order to escape the bandits, who are in fast-moving (and very difficult to target, I might add), heavily armed vehicles. I guess I wanted something like Fallout 3, but it isn't like Fallout 3 at all. It's more like Borderlands, minus the leveling and the random unique weapon treasure generator. I played it for about two hours before I was completely sick of it.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005NZ1G","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play. However you choose to hero your way throughHalo: Combat Evolved, the action should break in your new Xbox in explosive style.","reviewerName":"Wu-Tang_Assassin","summary":"Halo","reviewText":"I got this game the FIRST day it was released a long time ago haha.

The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"B. Convery","summary":"I won't talk about the ending...","reviewText":"...because Jesus Christ is that rude.  NOTE TO OTHER REVIEWERS:  people come on here to get a review of a game because they are interested in buying it.  Not finding out exactly what happens at the end.Halo 2 is an awesome successor to Halo.  \"Combat Evolved\" is what the game is about because you are playing it, not watching a story.  I am of the group who see the journey as more important than the destination.  Off the soapbox now, onto the review.Halo 2 offers many beautiful and varied levels from space, to city, to alien ship, to beautiful outside hilly landscapes.  One of the greatest things about Halo 2 perhaps better than Halo is the AMAZING balance between on foot combat and vehicular combat.  At no time are you forced to use vehicles but at certain parts you'll definitely need them.  In the latter, the game evolves into grandiose scale and before you know it, you've got enemy Ghosts, Tanks, and Banshees swarming around your warthog.  Or if you have the massive Scorpion perhaps you'll feel a little more safe.And are the vehicles ever so evolved in Halo 2.  The boost option on the Ghosts and Banshees is indeed an awesome addition.  Perhaps better than that is the ability to rob someone of their vehicle...  It just feels SO DAMN good pulling an Elite from his Ghost.Added alien weapons are nice... Plasma Sniper is my favorite addition.  Dual weilding weapons is handy in sticky situations, especially if you are low on grenades.  The new Plasma Sword is useful in enclosed areas for ripping skulls.  Some folks online are complaining it too powerful, but the drawback is it's range. i wouldn't think about picking one up in open areas.The MULTIPLAYER mode on XBOX Live is really amazing.  At any time, you can hit the \"Y\" button, even in the single player mode, to see which of your buddies is on.  You can also have a few buddies sit with you and have split screened online games if you choose.  The idea of the party system is a good one.  You basically create a party with people on your buddy list and go to different games as a single unit like a travelling team.  Definitely a nice feature so you don't lose your friends switching games.The random placement of you and your party into games is perhaps one of the most innovative ideas in online gaming.  In many other online games you come across some real PITAs who either team kill, come back under a different screename, whatever.  This randomization gives you the anonymity that is needed in online gaming.The idea of voice in-game activation is amazing as well.  If you talk into your headset, anyone in your proximity can hear you.  This adds much to the intensity of the game because in game, no ONE WANTS TO TALK!!  Also eliminates the fools and 12 year olds who think it funny to curse and use racial slurs.  GONE and for the better.  A HUGE STEP in online console gaming this is.Perhaps the only disappointment is no online co-op feature.  I wish there was one.  The only alternative is split screen co-op, same as original.  But i won't complain.  I'm happy it's still here but ti would've been great to have it online, no split screen.And that's it.  This is a complete package.  Playing the game on Normal will most likely be a cinch if you've beaten the original.  Start of on Heroic or Legendary if that's the case.  It's not easy or short THAT WAY.  ;)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"Beavis \"The Great Cornholio\"","summary":"Very Fun Platformer.","reviewText":"I love the ratchet and clank series because the weapons are sweet,the story rocks,controls are easy,difficulty gets increasingly difficult as you go on,and the game is funny.The story starts off as you,Ratchet,fixing a ship.You are on your homeworld Veldin when you see ship crash to the surface.You go explore and find Clank,a small robot.When he tells you he can get you off the planet you are thrilled.The story takes off from there.As you are on your adventure you collect Bolts that pay for some of your guns and ammo.To aquire Bolts you can do 4 things:Kill an enemy,destroy boxes,participate in hoverboard races,or collect them as you see them.On every planet there are Gold Bolts that help you aquire gold weapons(More on them later).The weapons are funny as well as deadly.There is a Blaster,Pyrocerator(flamethrower),R.Y.N.O.(Rip Ya a New One),Suck Cannon(Sucks up small enemies to be shot at other enemies,a Morph-o-Ray,and many others.There are also gadgets that help you in your journey.There is the Swing Shot that allows you to swing through marked areas,a Hydrodisplacer that allows you to suck up water from certain nozzles as well as place water in certain nozzles,and a gadget that allows you to open otherwise unaccsesible areas.The planets are nice sized with many surprises like Gold Bolts,weapons and Skill Points.Skill Points come into affect after you win the game.You can choose to replay the game with all your weapons and bolts and if you do you can get skill points by completing certain hidden tasks that you must do by either using the strategy guide,or decoding the title of the skill point.Clank upgrades are awesome.You can have a Helo-Pack which allows you to glide across gaps easier,a thruster-pack which is an upgraded Helo-Pack,and a pack that allows you to swim very fast underwater.Helmets are also cool.One allows you to breathe in space or underwater,another allows you to pilot enemy fighters(in certain missions only),and one allows a sandmouse(A floating robot with machine guns)to accompany you for a short time.Missions are fun and varying and help ease the story along.All missions happen for a purpose.There are no worthless missions that are there for no reason which is good.Plus some missions allow you to play as Clank!Now on to the bad.When selecting a weapon the game doesn't pause time so you are completely vulnerable when selecting a weapon.Also you must choose to use gadget from the inventory screen instead of letting you press a button to do so.Those are my only complaints.Go out and get yourself a fantastic platformer and read reveiws on Going Commando and Up Your Arsenal if you like this one!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000088KH9","description":"Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis the third in the successful mission-based stealth series that first appeared on the PlayStation in 1998; few changes have been made to the basic format. Players can once again choose to be either Rikimaru, the silent sword-wielding assassin, or Ayama, the acrobatic younger ninja. Both characters pass through the same game world, but each has slightly different goals that take them on different routes. A third character can be unlocked later on.During the first mission, you're required to choose a number of weapons to aid you in your immediate tasks. Throughout the game, more and more weapons--from melee to ranged weapons--are added to your arsenal depending on your performance during each level; your chosen weapons dictate how you approach the mission goals. The silent approach is always encouraged, and there's a variety of graphically satisfying stealth kills that will only work if you remain elusive and strike unexpectedly and silently.Aside from the stealth kills, the game is a mixed bag in terms of its graphics. Light shimmers off your sword menacingly, but the environments are bland and repetitive, and the game fails to maximize on differences between light and dark areas in ways that might have added to the experience. Also, the stealth dynamic is made less challenging by the shortsightedness and slow reactions of the enemy guards and the iffy AI. Since guards give up searching for you within seconds and are unable to follow you through doors, this potentially atmospheric and tactical stealth game is actually just a hack-and-slash arcade romp. Multiplayer options are included, though, so if you feel the need for a more realistic opponent, you may want to call a friend.Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis still an enjoyable experience despite its flaws. It&#x92;s just a shame that, after doing so much to establish and define the stealth-game genre, it fails to raise the bar or introduce any novel elements. The game feels more like an update of the first Tenchu, and while this is no bad thing, fans will probably be expecting more.--Chris Ryan, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Cim","summary":"One of the best games on PS2","reviewText":"I almost never give five stars but this game is by far one of my favorite if not thee favorite game for my Playstation 2.I really like the original Tenchu on PS1 and then was very disappointed by Tenchu 2 on the PS1 with no sounds and graphics that seemed a tad worse than the original.This game comes back to being like the original Tenchu but many leagues better. The graphics, environments, sounds and music are the best yet behind perhaps Final Fantasy X and maybe a few others.The controls are great and more accurate the the original games and the body language and movements of your character and even the enemies are truly fantastic. The stealth kills will really get you revved up for more.The special moves, the stealth, items and weapons and incredible patience waiting for the next kill is what really makes this game great. The only thing that could habe improved a bit is the ability to retry a level while your playing without having to reset the game, and perhaps adding an extra save feature for those levels that are rather long.Hours of replayabity and simultaneous 2 player modes simply make this game that much more fun.

{"product_name":"B000UW21A0","description":"Sony Uncharted: Drake's Fortune 98103 PC Games","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Best blockbuster not in theatres","reviewText":"Anyone who's ever played games in recent years have noticed an increase in cutscenes and FMV's to tell the story. While there's nothing inherently wrong with it, some might find the gameplay a bit unbalanced and you spend your time watching rather than playing (Metal Gear Solid games for one). But with the advantage of being able to make the story as long as you want in whatever genre one chooses, games in capable hands can rival the best of Hollywood's films and even provide a thrilling narrative you'd get from a good book. While Uncharted admittedly has its problems, it's still one of the premier titles to get for the Playstation 3.Story: You play as Nathan Drake, a descendant of the famous explorer Sir Francis Drake. Drake uncovers a clue that could lead them to the treasure of a lifetime but things of such nature can bring people willing to get it for personal profit and along with Elena Fisher, a TV documentarian and Sullivan, Drake's friend and colleague, Drake has to trek through the jungles and uncover the secret buried within its forests and catacombs.Graphics: Uncharted was one of the first games I played on an HDTV running in 720p and I got to say, this is one of the most gorgeous games on the console. From the realistic character animation (though Elena's eyes look freaky) to the colorful and vast jungle surroundings to the unbelievable water effects, this game is definately a showcase for your brand new HDTV.Sound/Music: Equally impressive is the musical store which gives it that bombast and anthemic scores expectant of films like Raiders of the Lost Ark. While some of the in-game music is used sparingly for more ambiance, it's quite welcome when it's there. Along with the score is some fantastic voice acting with everyone providing non-cheesy voiceovers and it becomes a game great to see as well as hear.Gameplay: Anyone who's ever played Tomb Raider or Prince of Persia will find things similar here. While Drake uses guns instead of swords and daggers, it's the environmental puzzles that will cause some deja-vu. Hopping from stones to ledges and ropes is all familiar stuff though sometimes getting Drake to jump away from the rope instead of just dropping made a simple puzzle aggravating. Some other puzzles pop up now and then where pressing Select will have Drake look in a page of a diary/journal to read clues. They're quite handy though one puzzle involving statues from the Bible were kinda...vague.The other big thing is the combat which is similar to Gears of War in that going out in the open will get you killed quite easily. Instead you take cover behind stones, boxes and columns and pop up to shoot an enemy. It works quite well and save for the lack of a radar when an enemy would all of a sudden pop next to you without you noticing, it's quite fun. But the annoyance comes with enemies' inexplicable ability to take chestful (even headful) of ammo from semi-automatics and handguns and flinch like you just threw a soccer ball at them. On occasion, you'll get an instant kill with a headshot though more often than not, enemies who've had numerous bullets in their chest and head areas don't seem to want to go down. There's some parts that admittedly caused me frustration but some might just work past it.Aside from some parts that made me yell at the screen, Uncharted was quite a blast to play and worth picking despite its rough 10 hour length (though treasures scattered all over will get you hunting).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2008"}

He is in love with this game and cannot stop talking about his pet Bengal tiger cub in which he affectionately named Patrick. Yes, he watches too much Spongebob.The visuals are breath-taking; I didn't expect the game to look this polished as a launch title. The gameplay is fun; you go around learning and teaching your pet new tricks while playing mini-games and unlocking new sections of your island.

If I choose that I prefer a map, I may be stuck playing against 1 to 3 players. The multiplayer maps should be rotated every week in my opinion or allow voting which is allowed in the Operations mode.- the Sharpshooter can be a nuisance on a limited few missions during the campaign (towards the end of the campaign).- long initial start-up (loading) times.Overall, I'm still having a lot of fun playing this game. A lot of my PSN friends won't buy this game because of the science fiction theme (and complaining when they get meleed by an Infiltrator). They are waiting forBattlefield 3 - Limited Edition, and will accept no substitutes. I'm not a big fan of science fiction games myself, but the audio, video, and the way this game comes together for me does everything right.

Loved all the different guns and stuff you got to use along the way. It could be adapted to a movie. It would need some tweaks but I thought it a very cool presentation. It wasn't super long, but then again I wouldn't want a shooter campaign to last 20-30 hours. That would be too much.The multi player is great however I find myself missing a few things from KZ2. I loved all the stats that you could view on KZ2 and now with KZ3 there really isn't much to view of your online career. However the online is still great. LOVE the Brutal Melee system!!!  That alone puts this game leaps ahead of other shooters, especially COD where you can simply slash a guy in the hand and it kills him.I could write a lot more but won't.

This mysterious power forms the beginning of all life, is the source of all magic and the origin of all thought. For eons the angelic Seraphim watched over the T-Energy and therefore over the fate of the entire world. But eventually tiring of their burden, they passed their knowledge on to the High Elves. T-Energy helped the realm of the High Elves to experience an unimaginable boost of prosperity, making it the reigning culture in Ancaria. But a force as powerful as T-Energy carries great dangers. Not taught how to deal with this, no sooner did the Elves take control, then a heated dispute erupted among them as to how and to what purpose the T-Energy was to be used. Dispute morphed into irresolvable conflict, then rift and eventually to a civil war among the High Elves, where all participants were losers. Their realm collapsed and with it the entire power structure of Anacaria. In the turmoil all the peoples of Anacaria coveted the right, either openly or in secret, to wield the power of T-Energy and in the end, unmanaged, the T-Energy raged out of control warping creature and lands alike. Can anyone regain control over the T-Energy. And if so, will he/she strive to prevent the world from lapsing into final chaos, or deepen it?GameplayGameplay inSacred 2: Fallen Angelin divided into two campaign paths: Light and Dark. As the game begins players choose and customize their character and choose the path they will follow. This choice determines the ultimate goal and intentions of their character, and as the game progresses through literally hundreds of quests and side quests, the paths of different characters intersect at different junctions. Choose one way and you may be tasked to defend a town and its people, while another path could result in you attacking the same town. The choice is yours and the fate of the world and your well-being are at stake.Key Game Features:A massive, seamless and dynamic world delivering hundreds of hours of freeform exploration.Two deep campaigns: play as the 'Light' or 'Shadow' side, complete with distinct skills, rewards and story-elements tailored to the chosen path.Six exceptional, playable characters, each with a distinct look, capabilities and in-game motivation.Modifiable combat arts: change, upgrade and link together your alter ego's combat skills to match your playing style.Fight effectively from the back of a number of mounts under your control; equip and upgrade your character's unlockable special mount.Deities offer unique combat disciplines and unlock additional quests.Seamless transition between single and multiplayer gaming modes via Xbox LIVE.Captivating online modes of play challenge gamers in cooperative, PvP and PvE play.Extraordinary, cutting-edge graphics and Dolby 5.1 channel surround sound utilize the latest technologies for a truly immersive experience.Character ClassesInSacred 2: Fallen Angelplayers assume the role of one of six characters -- five of which are new to the franchise -- and delve into a thrilling story full of side quests and secrets that you will have to unravel. Breathtaking combat arts and sophisticated spells are waiting to be learned. A multitude of weapons and items will be available, and you will choose which of your character's attributes you will enhance with these items in order to create a unique and distinct hero.SeraphimOften referred to as 'Fallen Angels,' these mystical and angelic creatures are the oldest inhabitants of Ancaria. Fast, elegant and acrobatic warriors from a technological future they fight with light to medium weapons and, if required, with massive technological support. Players can assume the role of a Seraphim and protect the world from chaos.Shadow WarriorShadow Warriors were originally humans trained as elite soldiers in service to the High Elves. Upon their death their souls were stolen by an Elven general, bound to lifeless bodies and imbued with T-Energy. Now free, they travel between this world and the next as undead beings with only the desire to return to the peace of the golden halls of Elysium.High ElfThe best student at the ancient academy of magic in Thylysium, the High Elf character lives and breathes magic. Her hunger for adventure and her insatiable desire to increase her personal knowledge and the influence of her once-powerful house are the driving forces as she sets off into an Ancaria boiling over with turmoil.DryadMasters of the hunt and akin to the Elves, The Dryad are in tune with nature and are equipped with the strength of the forests. The most powerful and the strongest among them are knowledgeable of the dark art of voodoo and were chosen in order to save their peoples from extinction.

Propelled by T-Energy and devoted to protecting it, they are part of the Great Machine and so able to use the T-Energy for their purposes.A Wide Variety of MountsAcross Ancaria you will find many horse dealers. They offer all kinds of animals, from the simple nag up to a real war horse. You can equip a war horse with bridle, saddle and even special armor. These special items can be found in the game just like player items, ranging in quality from regular to rare and even unique items. In addition, every character also has a unique mount created specifically for their character class. This mount not only fits the personality of the character, but also complements the various aspects of the character's playing style perfectly. All character classes can fight from a mounted position using a variety of tactics that the player chooses depending on the terrain and battle conditions.","reviewerName":"Steven","summary":"Finally a great console Action RPG!","reviewText":"Sacred 2 is a very solid console Action Role Playing Game (ARPG) filled with quests, dungeons and more loot then you can imagine. Yes this game does have its share of flaws but those of us that are addicted to these types of games (aka Diablo clones) are likely to be more then satisfied. The port over to the console has been so good that many reviews - even \"professional\" reviewers say this is better then the PC counterpart.I've been craving a good console hack-n-slash ARPG ever since the days of Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance and Champions of Norrath that came out last gen. The market for these games is so small that they very rarely come out. Sure there are great RPGS currently - Oblivion, Mass Effect, Fallout 3 and other come to mind but we haven't seen a real solid ARPG 'Diablo clone' come out in a long time. Finally Sacred 2 fills that gap - does it do a good job? Absolutely!Let's go ahead and get the flaws out of the way. A lot of what you may have already read is true to some degree. Yes the frame rate does stutter slightly in larger open areas. The character development does seem daunting at first. The screen does tear a bit, enemies do get stuck every once in awhile, you get stuck every once in awhile, the voice acting is pretty bad, and sometimes navigation is a pain because on your way to a quest you will suddenly hit a dead end that isn't really that visible on your mini-map. The default camera is bad (luckily you can change it to a static camera which is much much better - makes the game play very much like BG:DA).All of these flaws are present in some degree. It may sound like I'm bashing the game but really I'm not - I'm just telling you the truth. Also, the truth is that these issues are very nit-picky and in the grand scheme of things, well, they're irrelevant. It seems as though a lot of people are exaggerating these issues. The frame rate stutter is very slight and I noticed it smoothed out a bit when I installed the game on my hard drive. The character development is daunting at first but you get used to it and it's certainly better then having shallow character development. Enemies get stuck but it's rare and doesn't really affect the gameplay. People bash the voice acting and yes it is goofy and over the top - but this game doesn't take itself too seriously, which is evident right away when you read some of the gravestones and the text for the quests. The whole game is a little bit goofy - in a good way. The only significant complaint I have is that there is a complete lack of a pause feature, which is odd. Even if you hit the guide button on your controller the game will still go on in the background. I've read that they may fix this and I hope they do.Some people complain about the interface but I think it's done very well. There is only so much you can do with a controller and I think they did a very good job porting over the interface - once you learn the ins and outs of it you will be flying through it in no time. Some people complain about the graphics saying they are outdated. I don't understand this at all, sure they aren't perfect but the world is vast and beautiful. On the PC this game is a complete system hog and they were able to port it well to the current gen consoles which are now becoming dinosaurs in computer years.Look, it boils down to this. Do you like games like Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance and Diablo? Are you a fan of hack-n-slash, looting, dungeon crawling, character buffing games with massive worlds and hundreds of quests? If this is your idea of a fun game then certainly you will be able to look past the technical nit-picky issues listed above. Sacred 2 offers a massive world capable of eating up hundreds of hours, there is no reason you shouldn't explore it. I am very satisfied with this game - it scratches that console ARPG itch I've had for quite some time now.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2009"}

(First Encounter Assault Recon) is a first-person shooter with a psychological horror spin. Developed by Monolith studios and released in 2005, F.E.A.R.'s story revolves around a Special Forces team who investigates and contains paranormal phenomena. You play as a new but nameless member of the F.E.A.R. team called in to eliminate a cannibalistic killer named Paxton Fettel who controls an army of cloned supersoldiers. After Fettel seizes control of a technology corporation building and murders all inside it's up to the F.E.A.R. team to capture or eliminate him by any means necessary. Here are my thoughts on F.E.A.R.;Pros+ Excellent gunplay mechanics and guns are a lot of fun to shoot.+ Clever and well done A.I.. Enemies flank, duck, cover, vault objects and work as a team to eliminate you.+ Save anytime, anywhere.+ Supports a good amount of Widescreen resolutions.+ Great graphics for a 2005 title.+ Bullet Time/Slow-Mo was extremely well done.Cons &lt;Contains SPOILERS>- Extremely repetitive and bland environments. Endless trudging through sewers, office buildings, steam tunnels, construction sites, warehouses and labs.- Rather limited number of enemy types.- Convoluted story that's easily forgotten. All you need to remember is there's a p*ssed off paranormal girl trying to kill you.- Not really scary at all. Scares are quickly diminished when you begin to receive communication interference, heralding something spooky is going to happen. Really cuts down the eerie tension factor of the game.- Enemy banter and cursing become repetitive and annoying.- Lackluster and uninspired score fails to add to the overall environment of the game.- No real challenging boss fights, just a few tougher mobs from time to time.- Checkpoint Saves black out and pause your screen for several seconds.- Lone Wolf approach that your team directs is completely unnecessary. Often you're not even separated yet they tell you to go ahead on your own. Why?- Predictable and bland ending.In the end F.E.A.R. was disappointing. Perhaps I was expecting more because of all the media this game received when it was released and the fact they just released F.E.A.R. 3. I was especially let down in the little to no scares the game failed to produce. I've played plenty of Survival Horror type games and F.E.A.R. didn't deliver anything new. One of my other big gripes with the game is the continuous and repetitive environments which made the game go on and on. F.E.A.R. had a few fun moments and the gunfights were often fast and frantic but by the end I was glad the game was over.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2011"}

The red faction series has gone in a lot of different directions (FPS, grand theft auto, 3rd person shooter) but maintaining a similar feel over the years.  It's not an extremely well known series but I've played most of them (including the first) and they are decent games.  This is also a decent game despite the fact that it's a 3rd person shooter with a much more limited scope than the last game (which was open world, as I remember).Most 3rd person shooters are \"on rails\" meaning they are very linear; doesn't mean they are bad games but there's very little (if any) room to deviate from going from point a to point b.  The difference in this game is that it can potentially be pretty fun to do that.  The reason why is that the environments are destructible so you can run around knocking down buildings with a hammer (the \"maul\") or plasma weapons (they call them \"nano technology\" but that's basically what they are).  It's a whole lot more satisfying than it sounds though not everything is destructible.Otherwise...this game is somewhat generic.  If you play it with conventional weapons (the assault rifle) you're going to be pretty bored as the combat is just meh.  If you play it with the hammer or plasma weapon you'll enjoy it (at least I did).  Not a lot of games have this kind of environmental physics (the hallmark of the series) so it definitely has the potential to be interesting.  How many games do you get to run around with a hammer and smack dudes in the head with?  Not enough.  It's a bit too easy on normal difficulty though and there's way too much ammo and health in the environment.  It might be a case of a game that they don't want you getting frustrated with the difficulty which is okay because there are harder difficulties but then you might have to play it somewhat differently (without the hammer) which you don't want to do.It's worth the asking price even if you don't choose to go hammer-rific; it'll just be a somewhat generic 3rd person shooter then.  Not as deep as guerrilla but a whole lot more fun; definitely worth 10 bucks or less.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2013"}

{"product_name":"B003S2MXRA","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"An Amazing New Series","reviewText":"This was probably my favorite game of the year so far, and while that's not saying too much October, this is a really fun game. If not for some faults, it could have possibly been the best game of the year. It plays like a combination of Gears of War (without fire behind cover) and God of War, but unlike other games both aspects are accomplished very well. The health system is very original, and an acceptable alternative to the overused automatic health regeneration after a cool-down period. As anyone who plays FPS will know, that health mechanic will inevitably have you hiding from the enemies while you wait for your health to regenerate, which is boring and isn't very bad ass. Alternatively, this game's health system rewards you for rushing the enemy and sawing/slicing/crushing an enemy in half. It also does though, bring up a new series of issues when the only way to gain health is to stun and then grapple with an enemy. The biggest problem being that the developers decided to have the grapple animations take all long time to finish, and you are vulnerable the whole time you are performing them. Consequentially, many times you end up with the same amount of health you had before eviscerating the enemy, or even many times you might be killed while slowly killing an enemy. To me, the grapple moves should either be quicker, or your character should be invulnerable. Problems also arise when you are mostly fighting enemies that are in the distance, as at times you have no way to regain health. I would have liked some system where health regenerates after a fight is over and you've killed everyone, or just very slowly, or you could get smaller amounts of health back after shooting an enemy as well. There were many times where I could finish one battle with depleted health and have to go into the next battle weaker, which occasionally ended with me dying and going back to the checkpoint.The guns have a pretty nice feel to them, and some are pretty original and fun, but I wish there would have been more options for what weapons you can take with you. You have 4 gun slots, that consist of 1 handgun, 1 sub-machine gun, and 2 special weapons. You also can only have 1 melee weapon, which causes problems when you are offered the giant hammer, which is fun and devastating, but you can't use the special weapons with it, making any long distance encounters extremely difficult. It's also strange when you have to run to each weapon and decide which one you want. I would have loved something more representing an RPG system. Where each weapon could be improved with use, instead of occasional arbitrary upgrades. I would have also liked some kind of load-out screen at the weapon/ammo caches where you pick what 4 weapons you wanted to take with you. This also brings out a further problem, I never really felt like I grew stronger or better as the game progressed, I mean you had a few upgrades which made you slightly harder to kill and some weapons that made enemies easier to kill (although they all had features that limited their usefulness) I never felt like my character evolved. An RPG upgrade system would be very beneficial for the inevitable (hopefully) sequel to this game.The other very large problem with this game, is the story. Coming into Space Marine as a guy that has heard of the Warhammer universe but never really experienced it or learned about it, I was totally at a loss in this game. Even after beating it, all I know is that you play as a genetically engineered super soldier (I learned this from reading previews of the game) sent to a world that is being invaded by Orcs. You are there to secure a giant mech (which for some reason you never get to use) and kill as many Orcs as possible, however along the way you unleash the forces of Chaos and have to kill them too. Now I didn't go into it expecting too much, and the general story and plot twists, while generic and anticipated, are decent I just needed more. Even some sort of intro as to who the characters are, why they're fighting, who they're fighting, what they're fighting for would have been welcomed. I also noticed that the pacing was a little lacking, it was almost all non-stop action with sections where you run from one battle to the next. While there are a few sections that mix it up with jet packs and helicopter flying, they were short and sparse. Ever since you saw the giant mech, I was expecting to pilot it at one point, instead there was an annoying mini boss fight on the back of it. Maybe they just didn't have enough time/money, so they had to focus on perfecting the shooting and hack-n-slashing aspects of the game, and if so that's acceptable.Ultimately, this is a great game, and I had a lot of fun playing it, especially at the price tag of 40 dollars. The main story campaign is relatively long, so you'll have hours of fun if you buy this game. However, there really isn't any replay-ability as the multiplayer kind of sucks, and there's no new game plus. For the multiplayer, it's very slow, and the whole verticallity of it makes it very awkward. It's also not kind at all to newbies, as when you start out you don't have anything. You can't even customize your character until level 5, and the levels take awhile to achieve. All you can do is hope to be killed by a high level character which you can then copy their load-out. I really hope that this game does well enough to get a sequel, because if they fix any of the problems listed above, and keep all the things that made this game great, they could have a power house series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2011"}

And when the X-Files: Resist or Serve was announced a few months ago, I was very excited. But eventually, my excitement fell into worrying, and now I really don't care much about the game anymore. But from what I saw in terms of footage of the game made me have even more twisted feeling. the graphics were good, the fighting system seemed good, and the game took place in Colorado, which, living in Colorado, I was thrilled to hear about. In the two minutes of footage that i saw, Scully ran over a zombie on her way into the small town where the game takes place. Then Mulder found her, went to look for help in a nearby diner, and encountered a gruesome zombie-like creature ready to devour him. Sound familiar? I thought so too, being the fan of Resident Evil that I am, and it looked to me like this would just be an X-Files flavored RE ripoff. Actually, I was about half-there. Mulder fights monsters very much the same way Chris Redfield does in RE. In fact, the only thing that kept this from being another RE clone was Scully's role in the game. She really doesn't do much fighting. Instead, she puts on her medical gear and performs autopsies throughout most of the game. The formula seems interesting, but will it work? We'll just have to find out...After 1998 brought us that other horrid X-Files game, fans like me deserve a great new game featuring the world's most famous T.V. federal agents. I really hope that Resist or Serve is a good game, and with some more production work, it is headed down the good road to victory!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2004"}

His wealth, which was once a source of pride, becomes his greatest foe. Now, Wario must scramble to recover his riches.Cranky CapitalistStep into an alternate world filled with quirky puzzles, swarming enemies and lots and lots of loot. You'll learn a multitude of cool moves as Wario progresses in the game. You can punch, kick, jump, grab monsters and objects and inhale surrounding coins like a two-legged vacuum cleaner. The game even has a wrestling game-ish feel, as you can string together combo attacks that The Rock would give his eyebrow for.Early on, you will learn the significance of special sticky balls that dot the landscape. Wario can cling to these balls to navigate tough spots, reach new areas, and even fight bosses.You can freely bash and manipulate your surroundings to discover secrets. For instance, you can pick up a stone pillar and swing it at your foes or spin a fallen monster to activate a switch that raises a gate.Perplexing PuzzlesThe side-scrolling action remains true to the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games that made Wario famous, but Wario's incredible range of motion gives him newfound freedom.Finding treasure often calls for flipping a colored switch, then searching high and low for the activated chest. Considering the size of the worlds and the plethora of hiding places, this can be quite a feat. When it comes to moolah, though, no task is too tough for Wario.Trap doors transport you to hidden worlds that offer mind-bending puzzles. Using your noggin' will yield some important items. A colorful band of fairies offers game info and advice throughout your adventure.GraphicsThe development team at Treasure have stamped Wario's Nintendo GameCube debut with colorful and vibrant graphics. Wario's signature look comes to life like never before. From his arrogant waddle to his purple trousers, Wario is immediately recognizable. Charles Martinet, the actor famous as the voice of Mario, brings a special zest to Wario's growls, chortles and guffaws.From gleaming castle walls to gloomy gravestones,Wario Worldis crammed with beautifully realized details.

{"product_name":"B002I0JBL4","description":"","reviewerName":"Charles \"Altered Confusion\"","summary":"Duke Nukem Forever Review","reviewText":"Let me start off by saying that this is one of those games that had been in development for so long that no one was quite sure what would happen. This game also went into a momentary state of being thought dead as 3d Realms ran out of money. It was through the brave move of Gearbox that this game came into being.In this game you will be playing the part of Duke Nukem, your super badass, monster ass kicking, roid raging hero stuck in the nineties. To be fair though this game should have come out in the 90s which probably would have made this game that much stronger. The Aliens are still hanging around and though you want to kick thier asses again, you've been asked by the President, to hold off. Well that doesn't last very long and you're back to doing what you do best, and leaving quite a few bodies lying around in the process.Graphically this game would have been near the top, if it was 1999. As it is though this game seriously lacks the graphics of a first person shooter coming out now. There's serious texture issues, well everything looks flat, and you're going to be left wondering if the graphics had been improved if the game might have flowed better. There are going to be a wide variety of bad guys to shoot at, and most of them pay direct homage to the enemies in past Duke Nukem games.The sounds are what make the game famous, well I should say the dialog. This is the part where you're going to hear the cliche phrases and the I'm too good for you mentality. At one point they make fun of Halo, which at the time of the original release would have been kind of funny, and true fanboys would have cheered a hearty, \"hell ya\", but as it stands the power that Halo has over the first person shooter world now, it might have been better to take that little bit out.The controls are your average first person shooter controls. You're going to have two weapons that you'll be able to switch between, and you'll also have an assortment of explosives to help clear the way.I really really really wants to like this game, to have the nostalgia been enough to make this game a great game to play, and to tell the world that even absent heroes, when they return, can still be relevant, but at the end of the day this game is simply there so that people can say it came out. There's nothing about this game that warrants the need to play very long. One of the biggest hindrance of this entire title is the load screens, you won't get through much of a level and then you'll be faced with a rather lengthy load screen. The action also doesn't seem to go very smoothly. Sure the dialog and mouthing off that Duke is known for does make things interesting, but there's just not enough here to really say much more about the game.So it is with a heavy heart that I must say, unless you want to have the game so that you can prove to your friends that it does indeed exist,  stay away from this game. There are better indie FPSs that blow this game out of the water. This game gets a 4.2 out of 10.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

Try something, get spotted, reload. Try again and reload again. Hundreds of times. I'll only play a stealth game if it is really good. At FIRST this seemed to be that game. As I came close to finishing the game, I realized that this game is basically broken if you are playing it stealthy.There are a few problems and bugs with the game, I can overlook those. However:(minor spoilers)At the end of each level of the game, you are given a score on how well you did and asked if you want to re-try, if you killed anyone or if anyone saw you, how much money you got and which collectibles. On a mission about 1/2 of the way through the game, this score told me I had killed someone. I had NOT killed anyone. I looked up online and found out that just one death would affect the end of the game. I could have replayed the level, but each level is quite long and I don't do what I call \"boring work\" in games. If a game says I should do \"boring work\", like replaying an entire level for no reason, I say \"no\". If the game decided (somehow) that I killed someone, then it should have TOLD ME AT THE TIME, and I could have reloaded a save during the game. I do not know how anyone died, since I never killed anyone.So I continued the game, angry at it but accepting that I was screwed out of the best possible ending.A couple of levels later, I was told at the end of a mission that someone had seen me. No one had. NO ONE HAD SEEN ME. But it said someone had and would I enjoy the pleasure of many hours of \"boring work\" replaying the level, especially when I would have no idea if/when someone would magically \"see\" me again. My response again was \"no, I don't want the BORING WORK of replaying the level\". However, I did keep playing the game since I was almost done.The final level. I took the time sneaking around, choking people (not killing them) and hiding bodies in places that the game could not reasonably say anyone would find them (for example: in vents that are under the floor). Then a bunch of guards come out of a door and start searching around for an \"intruder\". I assume one of the guys I choked was discovered (under the floor...), or maybe I was \"seen\" while I was under the floor. Or who knows, maybe the guy I choked unconscious had died, and I was seen while I was under the floor hiding a dead body!Whatever. I quit the game, on the last level, and have no intention of ever playing it again.BTW, any game I quit playing I give a very low rating. I consider such a game to possess the same level of failure as a movie that I walk out on. The fact that this game has so much to like about it (and there IS a lot of quality in this title) does not mean it deserves a higher score. Also, I only review things that either I strongly disagree with the prevailing opinion (like this game), or that don't already have many reviews.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2013"}

Batman and Robin have plenty of lives so there are no tears for younger players when they are destroyed (the game does not end).  The controls also follows other Lego games so it makes for an easy transition.  The \"C\" button changes characters, the \"A\" jumps and so on. The instructions are provided on screen to help you.  The different Batman & Robin suits that could be changed into for different powers was a huge hit.I recommend any of the the Lego games.

Jury \"dsunglasses\"","summary":"RPG  ESPIONAGE / SHOOTER","reviewText":"The two companies Bioware and Obsidian have been responsible for most of my favorite RPG games. Add Alpha Protocol to that list.The overall main storyline to the game, is actually not that great. (Spoilers) The real threat isn't the plethora of middle eastern terrorists who hate us and everyone not like them, it's a rich white guy and his evil cooperation who want to sow chaos and war so they can sell weapons and make money. Liberal Hollywood has beaten that one to death, see Ironman and a ton of other movies. I would have had more respect for the storyline had they stuck to destroying a worldwide terrorist network. I enjoy plot twists, but an evil cooperation again? Getting really old.The smaller storylines and characters however are mostly quite good and make the game enjoyable. Unlike in Mass Effect or Dragon Age, you don't build a party of characters. You do however meet quite a few people during the game, some of whom will show up to help you in certain missions. That help however is usually pretty limited.The dialogue, voice acting and music are all are quite good. Graphics and gameplay are good as well, but could be improved upon some.Shooting wise the game is somewhat similar to Mass Effect 2. You can take cover and shoot over or around things, and you can target enemies or shoot blindly. Stealth is similar to Splinter Cell or Batman. You can sneak around taking enemies down silently in either lethal or nonlethal fashion. In fact you can try to get through some of the shooting missions with hardly firing at all. Shooting missions can range from short to long and some missions simply involve meeting contacts and having a conversation.The games RPG elements are well done. There isn't too much character customization regarding looks, though it should be enough for most people. The leveling up of abilities is an important part of the game and not choosing and building up the right skills can make finishing parts of the game a real challenge. Likewise choosing the right weapons and armor is essential. Both individual missions and your skill set help determine what equipment you should be using.You won't have to wonder weather a character likes you. The games tells you immediately whether you have lost or gained likeability points with someone You can view their attitude towards you at any time in the Intel menu. One thing unique to this rpg, is that you have about five seconds to picks conversation choices, so there is little time to sit and scrutinize your response. Also similar to Mass effect, you pick a response along the jist of what you want, such as \"aggressive\", not quite knowing what your character is going to say or do. I like this approach alot better, rather then simply just picking dialogue and hearing your character repeat it. It keeps you guessing.Also another really unique feature to this game is that your conversation choices really do matter. Not just with likeability points, but with how the game builds on itself. Your missions may be somewhat different or not take place at all, depending on choices you've made. Conversations and attitudes towards you will vary depending on your previous actions and choices. Some people may live or die, Some girls, may get with you or hate you. Your reputation really does matter in this game.There are of course things that could be improved. The minigames like lockpicking get a bit tedious, but are not too bad I suppose. The ending varies abit depending on your choices, but should have been longer. The game itself feels a little short, but then again every game does after playing Dragon Age.Almost all mission maps are unique and well designed, which is a big plus.The game has a good amount of replayability Try using different weapons and armor and building up different skill sets. Also try making different choices in missions and conversations to experience all the variations in the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2010"}

Cooper","summary":"Reviving a classic, mostly on target with this release","reviewText":"I will start off by saying that I already owned the Half-Life 2 portion of this on PC - and that as far as the single-player game goes, the controls translate *very* well onto the console, which is one of the main concerns I had about it.  Achievements breathe whole new life into the experience, and the addition of Episode 2 gives you around 30 hours or more of the Half Life storyline.  Half-Life 2 is already a classic, and is an excellent follow up to the first one.The only negatives I have to offer in regard to this are minor.  Half Life 2 Death Match is omitted.  Also - mods, game modes, etc. created using the Source engine will always tend to favor the PC.  This is one of the few IPs that still has an active mod community - so it is worth having on the PC.  Achievements and the controls more than make up for these shortcomings if you are interested in the Half-Life 2 story itself however.Portal is... interesting, but the single-player only offering leaves me wishing it could have a multi-player component.  It is a good puzzle game however, and will leave you scratching your head at some points wondering how to pull something off.Team Fortress 2... I remember playing the mod from the original Half-Life.  For the most part this is a faithful transition - and I really enjoy the game modes and the way that the classes balance and play.  It feels both new and familiar at the same time.  As the only online offering of the package - this is an excellent way to spend 15 - 20 minutes at a time blasting other players in a cartoony fashion.That being said - this is also a weak point in the Orange Box arsenal.  X-Box Live, and the reason I started purchasing more games for the console, is supposed to be a \"seamless\" experience.  I should be able to select a group of friends, launch into a game, and go.  Connecting to the same server as your friends on Team Fortress 2 is a hassle.  You have to coordinate via the microphone and hope that the same servers come up on your list when you click \"find servers\" at the same time.Joining in progress is not always an option, because servers fill up quickly.  As in Halo 3 - I would like the ability to launch with my friends at once, or join servers as a group.Once you get into a game however, it is an absolute blast.  The online connecting issues are the only reason why I would give this package 4 instead of 5 stars.  If the hassle of joining a game weren't there - this would be 5-star material.  As-is, it is easier to join the same server using Steam on the PC.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2007"}

Not only is it slimmer and prettier (take that, Xbox!), but it's also quieter, loads games faster, has better DVD support, and has built-in networking.  The last feature is especially cool for those of us who never bought the network adapter for the original PS2.  Considering old PS2 + network adapter packs are still selling for $180 or more online, the new PS2 is a steal.OK, so PS3 this is not.  It's just a souped-up PS2, or PS2+, perhaps?  Is it worth your $150?  Let me put this way:  if your current PS2 works fine and you have no interest in online play, then don't bother getting this one.  The slim design alone is not worth the price.  On the other hand, if your PS2 is wearing down (judged by game-loading failures, whines from the motor or fan, flashes on screen, ...), or if you want to do online play but never bought the network adapter, here's your chance to get into the action and own a shiny new, prettier-looking PS2.PS2 is still relevant in teh game console world today (Nov. 2004) because of its vast game library.

It has arived with Dark Alliance.I have been reading some of the other reviews. The other reviewers are correct in that the game has limited (literally three) character choices (a dwarf fighter, human archer, or elf mage). You don't even get to choose their name or roll their stats. HOWEVER...the characters are customizeable as you raise levels. Each time you level you obtain feat points which can be added to a skill of your choice. For example, if you are playing the archer character, you can put feat points onto a skill which raises your hit and damage with arrows, or a skill which allows you to carry more equipment, or a flame arrow spell. Every four levels you get to add one point to an ability score of your choice. This in itself allows a lot of customization.Gameplay is comparable to games such as Diablo2, but with much better graphics. I would liken the graphics to the movie Final Fantasy.Now...if you want to replay the entire game with one of your high level characters you can. All you have to do is start a new game and import the high level character from your other saved game. This allows you to raise to as high a level as you want, as you can get experience points galore.There are three difficulty levels to start. If you complete a challenge mode called \"The Gauntlet,\" (which I think is way too hard. ...) you can access two higher difficulty modes. I have not yet unlocked them but I am guessing that they have extremely powerful magic items.One complaint I have is that the game strays a lot from the real rules of Dungeons and Dragons 3rd edition. While many things are the same, many more are far different. For example, you can obtain a weapon which does over 100 points of base damage! The armor class system apears to be the same at first, but later on you find full platemail +5 which adds 44 points to your armor class!If you play the sorcoress, the most powerful spell is a new spell called \"Ball Lightning.\" Almost all the spells are damage spells, such as magic missile, fireball, cone of cold, Melf's acid arrow, and even meteor swarm. This sort of turns the sorcoress into a walking artillery piece. None of the many useful spells which do not damage, such as invisibility or hold person are obtainable.Despite its drawbacks, you just can't beat playing a coop RPG with amazing graphics. I would highly recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2003"}

I like the controls for both Batman and Catwoman, but have hard time taking advantage of all of the moves, unlike my son who seems to have mastered them fairly quickly.

Obraztsov","summary":"Intricate, captivating game by RockStar","reviewText":"When I found out that RockStar, makers of Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto were making a cop game, I was ecstatic.  And honestly, my expectations were not cut short.  It's not totally sandbox like GTA - you can't go around killing people and do whatever you want, but there is still a lot of room for exploration and side missions.PROS1.  Amazing graphics/actors - they copied real actors for this game, and you can tell.  Every movement a character makes, it seems like a real person.  Graphics are absolutely breathtaking and I think are a really accurate looking 40s' LA.2.  Great for sleuths - if you like games where you constantly are searching for clues and like to determine whether or not a suspect is being honest or not, then you'll love this.  And it doesn't come easy.  You have to really pay attention and look back at your clues and notebook all the time to not take a misstep in interrogations.  Sometimes it is difficult to find clues as well.  You have to comb through every little part of a crime scene and really take your time.3.  Great dialogue - the dialogue is fun, witty, and the actors sound like (well, they are) real actors.  You'll be captivated by the dialogue, even at times when the storyline gets a little confusing/weird.4.  Side missions - it has a very similar way of driving (like GTA and Red Dead), so if you already are a pro at those games, this will come naturally to you in a heartbeat.  You can go on side missions, like catching criminals and robbers, and they each usually have a little mini-storyline.5.  Slow moving - this might be a downer for some, but I love it.  The game moves slowly and carefully (kind of like Heavy Rain), yet you'll still hang on to every piece of dialogue and not want to pry yourself away from the screen.CONS1.  Storyline - it's not terrible (at times it's pretty neat), but like most video games, after awhile it just gets confusing and you're like, \"huh?\"  There are some plot holes and the main character isn't even all that likable.2.  Too short - it is 12-20 hours of gameplay, but I don't know if I feel like I got my money's worth.  I wish there was so much more -  I really loved it!Pro/Con - sometimes it's a little repetitive.  You get into a \"rhythm\" of how cases work, and then they pretty much all work in the same style and fashion.  Some people hate that, but to me it's a good thing.  It builds some structure in the game, yet the cases are still fresh and original.  It doesn't feel like you are playing the same mission over and over again, it's just you get use to the structure of how they work.I think this will definitely be a classic PS3 game, and if you love anything else by RockStar or sleuthing - I highly recommend it!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"C. Conard \"ExtremeAvalanche\"","summary":"Um...Wow.","reviewText":"Alright, where do I begin. Well, Resident Evil 4 is the newest game in the legendary series, and possibly the best one too, mainly due to its plot and incredible gameplay. Resident Evil fans, think back. Remember the slow-paced RE games of yesterday? They're gone, and all that is left is the most intense game you are ever likely to play. RE4 is the best action game of the last two years, and will certainly be the best game of 2005. That is, unless, Gran Turismo 4 proves me wrong.Let's start with the most revamped feature, gameplay. Remember those good ol' days when you couldn't see, aimed too easily, and were lucky to fight one zombie in each room? Those are gone as well. RE4 incorporates behind-the-back third-person views, which are an incredible step forward, and now, you aim with a laser sight. This means being able to target the chest, legs, arms, or head, and it means corresponding actions with each one. It also means blowing off heads is easier. Just think about maybe aiming at the chest or legs later in the game. Trust me, you'll see!Graphics are the best in the series as well. The character models are so astonishingly real that your eyes may bug out. The environments look great too. And don't even get me started on how good fire looks! Every little thing about this game is gorgeous.Sound has always been a successful trademark for the series, but you've never heard anything like this! The music is awesome, perfectly fitting the surreal mood! And the voice acting is terrific. We'll just leave it at that. Nearly as good as the graphics, please don't mute this game!Resident Evil 4 is so chock-full of surprises, I never wanted to put the controller down. It is an amazing achievement in game making, and now that I have completed it, I feel like a gap is missing from my life. Do yourself a favor and purchase RE4. And if you don't have a Gamecube, this is more than reason enough to get one!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2005"}

It was kind of an arbitrary \"different for the sake of being different\" type of feature. The weird alien weapons are nothing more than uninspired sci-fi versions of sniper rifle, shotgun, machine gun, rocket launcher. Lots of big alien space ship environments.

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Inspector Gadget \"Go Go Gadget Reviews\"","summary":"Very summery game","reviewText":"SMS is definitely a gorgeous game to look at and a perfect game to get you in a summertime mood. The perfect blue skies, glorious sunshine and beautiful water effects make you just want to pass through the screen and into the Isle of Delfino in the game itself. Mario vacations in this sunny resort only to find it's covered in pollution when he arrives. So now it's up to him to clean it up across the various levels and worlds.It's one of those games that you can just keep on playing over the years and even put aside for a while before going back to it. It doesn't really have the same charm in the winter months however. The music, the graphics, the humor are all cute and colorful. It makes for perfect escapism.However, the designers have simply tried to cram in too many controls on the Gamecube pad and, as a result, it's a very hard game to control. Many levels and missions require precision manoeuvring and can often take several minutes of painstaking balance and ascension only for it all to be undone, as Mario plummets several hundred feet, by a tiny little flaw in your button-bashing. It will seriously drive you C-R-A-Z-Y.Had it not been for this, I would probably have stuck with SMS to the end, but I had to just be done with it once and for all, otherwise I would have chucked my Gamecube at the wall.Graphics ASound AGameplay CLasting Appeal B","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2007"}

Either way, everything I had heard about 4 suggested I would like it, especially when I heard it had a great story.So I picked up Yakuza 4 and after less than an hour of play decided I liked what I had seen and played. Since the series is basically one big story I decided to hunt down another game in the series, which was this one, Yakuza 3.Over the course of about a week I put almost 33 hours into the game and finished it on the normal difficulty. Having done so I promptly went out a picked up a copy of Yakuza 2 and ordered a copy of the first Yakuza. Obviously, that means I'm giving this game a high rating, and here's why.While I have not yet played the first two games in the series I was able to get some idea of what happened thanks to the inclusion of story overviews, presented in video format, in both the main menu as well as when the game begins. This allowed me to get some idea of what happened, despite not having as close a relationship with the characters as someone who played the previous games in the series.The story itself is rather robust, and ties together rather nicely in the end (although I'm on the fence about how the ending worked out). The main character doesn't always tie things together as quickly as I'd expect, but I suppose he does have to play dumb a little so the slower players can catch on. I'd argue that the story is on par with Metal Gear Solid 4 (although not so difficult to understand, especially if you didn't play the other games in the series like I) and Lost Odyssey.The characters within the game are all very life-like, making it extremely easy to like, or at least understand, them.The audio is almost entirely Japanese, save when an American speaks in English, and the entire game (with the exception of bits spoken during battles) is subtitled. I like watching movies in their original language with subtitles, so I liked this presentation.While I've only put 33 hours into the game I only touched upon the amount of content within. From what I can tell I did less than 40% of the optional substories and played only a handful of the games within.The game also features a rather robust new game plus system where you can start a new game with some amount of stuff, but with substories and other completion lists reset. You can also continue playing after the game has ended to complete items beforehand, as you can create new clear saves in this extended play as well. This is actually the first game I've played where you can do that (normally clear saves are created only when you finish the last boss, if at all).One might argue that combat is repetitive, but it was only near the very end of the game, when I was tracking down locker keys and unlocking secret menu items, that I started running away from fights. At least on the normal difficulty the majority of the fights are not that difficult. In fact, I had to continue more during segments that required I chase someone down or escape than during fights. You can use normal or strong attacks, block and dodge, or use a variety of special attacks, as well as use items within the environment. As you walk around you'll be challenged by various people. One could argue that this is what gets repetitive, but, again, I had no difficulty making this enjoyable by changing up what I did to defeat these enemies. Defeating enemies also allows you level up your character's abilities, which makes for more variety.As already noted above Yakuza 4 is actually why I picked up this game, and I've purchased the first two in the series, so I'll undoubtedly be playing this game again. For these reasons I give Yakuza 3 a 5 of 5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2011"}

My friend Alex is a big fan of the Civ series so like any good mate I thought it would be a nice gift suggestion.If you enjoy turn based resource management, battles, and forming lucrative social alliances throughout many historical time peroids it may seem like at first Revolution provides that in spades. The visuals are nice and crisp with a lot of character. Believe me when I say Civilization has never looked better than it does on the 360.However the problem is alot was taken out. Alex can complete a whole campaign in roughly an hour and a half. (And by that I mean literally beat the game) A glaring flaw is unlike other Civilizations that continued on after the space age that is the point where Revolution abruptly ends. On top of that there are no story driven missions revolving around famous historical characters. The only difference between a choosen leader is that it gives you slightly different unit types and a few unique options on how to utilize resources and social skills.Honestly I'm a little mad at Sid. He seems to have underestimated the \"intelligence\" of X box 360 gamers. To me it does not matter what the genre is. If you can beat a game in under 2 hours something is seriously wrong, especially if it is suppose to be an in depth turn based strategy game.If you can snag this game for cheap by all means do so otherwise save your money and rent it over the weekend. For those that enjoy stream lined simplicity Civ Rev might be up their alley but if you are a true fan of past Civilization games do not expect this one to hold up to your expectations.Pros+Nice comical graphics with people that pop up and talk in a Sim-ish like language.+There are a few more modes and multi-player options beyond the core game that can add a bit more enjoyment.+The game is easy to learn.+If you have just a bit of time to kill before going into work or taking the kids out to the ball park it is an easy game to jump into and jump out of.+Somewhat educational and a friendly game for all ages with hardly any violence or profanityCons-Much shorter than the original Civ games. You can beat the main campaighn in under 2 hours.-The game abruptly ends after the beginning of the space age. In other Civ games it continued onward after man-kind reached the stars.-The leaders do not have personal story lines and self tailored mission objectives as they did in past Civ games. The only variance between each leader is certain unit types and socializing options.

{"product_name":"B0050SZE2G","description":"","reviewerName":"StephLadder","summary":"Pretty bad...","reviewText":"They did it right this time - mostly. (Far Cry 2 was a real disappointment). Although FC3 is not at all like the first FC, except for being back in the tropics, it's a refreshing combination of FPS and RPG. You can go as far either way as you'd like... gather items, craft items, build points and personal resources... or just sneak around and pop off the enemy for as long as you'd like. Graphics are beautiful if a little bit 'choppy', and I find the AI pretty darn good! I've been dying quite often. The game is huge... I've barely scratched the map surface! But what I've seen in my first several hours is impressive! The story holds my interest enough and the characters are well developed. It's quite addictive, and find myself coming back in - shortly after leaving - to finish a mission - which can be difficult on just 'normal' setting! I guess the old 'hit F5 to save instantly' is gone for good in these modern games, so it does get VERY REPETITIVE on more occasions that I care for. NOT GOOD. I've found there is a bit of a learning curve at the beginning... and am still learning. It appears the game could last for many days... not just hours!!! Replay-ability is a given, IMO. Loads quickly, easy controls, very smooth (i7, 16 gigs, Asus mb, 250 gig ATI, etc). No problem with Uplay - although next to Steam it looks like it was built for 12 year olds (I'm an older long-time FPS fan from way back, I can be very critical, so my 5 stars should mean alot ;-)  Good job Ubisoft, but bad save system IMO!!!UPDATE: OK... THE BAD: I find the save intervals very frustrating. I almost get thru a very looong intense mission only to 'die' at the very end then have to RE-PLAY the whole episode! I know: typical. But I'll be taking a solid star off of my review.UPDATE: Uninstalled from my computer. Sorry... I gave it a HUGE chance. After 'swimming' to the pirate ship and undergoing at least 8 re-tries, and mashing 'space bar',  'C' and 'E' keys as much as I could, I always drown and die. Perhaps it's me... but having to re-do after MASHING the instructed keys over and over again sucks big-time. Tiresome. Boring. Etc. THEN, after I quit in frustration (at this point, the game does give you another chance to 'not' drown thru mashing and re-mashing keys)... and return to try again: I'M BACK IN THE WATER SWIMMING TO THE PIRATED SHIP needing to redo the whole 'mission' episode again... and again... and again. So long Far Cry 3. I don't call this 'fun'. (Ubisoft... what were you thinking?).","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2012"}

Besides, has anyone actually looked at the game? Gorgeous! I realize that you die-hard Zelda fans may be a bit discouraged with the graphics style, but deep down, y'all have a soft spot for the Hero of Time.To anyone who's played through Ocarina of Time, this game takes place 100 years after Link defeats Ganon in that story. A young boy named Link is thrust into a quest he never expected when his sister is taken by a large bird, who first tried to kidnap a female pirate, who was dropped into a forest. Link goes to save her, and that's when his sister is taken. That same bird has been abducting girls with long ears, like a certain princess with an alter-ego. So that's how it begins, and later, Link gets the Wind Waker, which, like the Ocarina of Time (from that game) will play an integral part in his quest.The graphics are amazing, and complimented with Progressive Scan support. Dolby Pro Logic II is a great bonus, the story is epic, the control is tight, the gameplay is unparalled, and just playing it is sweet.Don't listen to what the detractors who bash this game because of the graphics say.

{"product_name":"B0050SZ836","description":"","reviewerName":"Chaz Ashley","summary":"Solid game","reviewText":"Really enjoyed Borderlands 2, they fixed many issues with the first game that I had personally, there's more variety not only in visuals and gun stats but gun feel, characters and so on.For instance all the guns seemed to reload the same way in 1, in 2 you have a few different ones including throwing the gun away and teleporting yourself a new gun (same one) reloaded, often the thrown gun explodes for extra comedy.The cars were a major problem I had in 1, they were bad, got caught on everything and the weapons felt underwelming especially if you used the machine gun. Totally re-tweaked despite having the same cars visually, and another car to top it off.I'm not really in this game for the story, more the fun with 4 friends via co-op and it does that terrifically well. I can't say I see myself playing it alone but with a friend or 3? Yes, much fun involved there.It's also one of the better PC ports I've seen with a range of ways to tweak the game to get it running well on your system, it's a worth while buy.The only major cons I can think of, is the DLC pricing, at time of writing 1 character is valued at 1/4th the cost of the game itself, and they're not available in the Season Pass so it sorta makes you scratch your head. However that is optional content and doesn't really effect the game so negative as that may be the game itself stands on it's own merit.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2013"}

Rose \"Blu Aficionado\"","summary":"Wow, what a game!","reviewText":"OK first of all I have to admit I've been an Xbox user exclusively since the first Xbox was released.  I never purchased a Wii, and haven't owned a Nintendo product since Game Boy when I was a young lad.  I played Mario Kart at a friends house on the Wii, I loved the game but it just never grabbed me enough to purchase a console to play it on.  Recently I sold my Xbox 360 and PS3 to get an Xbox One...never made the purchase and have been console-less for a quite some time.I just noticed Mario Kart 8 was coming out for Wii U and I decided to look in to it.  The visuals look amazing, and there is no denying the amount of fun you can have with \"party\" games like this.  I went ahead and purchased a new black Wii U, and Mario Kart...I never thought I'd say this but its a game changer!  First off the game looks much better when you actually see it on your HDTV, everything is crisp and colorful...vibrant is a word that comes to mind!  The gamepad is honestly one of my favorite parts of Wii U so far, the second screen just adds so much to the experience, and being able to see the track in my hand is awesome!My girlfriend and I played for a few hours, just checking out the tracks and characters (we both grew up with Mario on NES).  The competition is fierce and with so many characters and tracks to choose fun we only quit cause we had to head to work.  I'm not a Wii advocate, and I've literally only owned the console and game for a few hours so I cant provide a full review.  From what I'm seeing so far whether your a Mario Kart connoisseur or a first time player you will love this game.  I will update here if I find anything that could change my vote from 5 stars, but honestly the fun I had in those couple hours well warrant the 5 stars and make me happy I purchased both the Wii U and Mario Kart 8!Update (6/2/14)  So I had a weekend to play with my Wii U (I know I know) and I gotta say I should have bought a Wii U when it was first released.  We packed the Wii up and brought it to my girlfriends parents house.  First off her nephew had a blast playing his old Wii games, and the family was blown away by Mario Kart!  I had originally planned to \"show off\" the game, but it ended up being a 4 hour 4 player split screen grudge match!  Everybody had a blast and it reinforced my decision to purchase the Wii.  Her dad was also impressed by the game pad screen and ability keep playing if the TV was needed for something else.Don't even think about purchasing Mario Kart, and if you don't have a Wii U purchase Mario Kart the same day you pick up the new Wii U :)  Awesome console and game...both made me a believer!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2014"}

Besides the setting, (Killzone takes place in realistic, war-torn human worlds), many elements that defined Halo are here as well.  You get a limited weapon carry limit, (three here, compared to Halo's two), you'll be fighting alone and alongside a few others depending on the situation, and you will find yourself locked up in an intense fire-fight almost all of the time.  You can wield enemy weapons in addition to your own, and if you get within arms reach within an enemy (the Helghast), you can melee attack them with your weapon for an instant kill.  Like Halo, mission objectives are simple, and are more a reason for explaining why you need to gun your way from one end of a level to the other - there is not anything complicated to do here that might interrupt the shooting and killing.Not that that is entirely a bad thing.  The action in Killzone is fast, and intense, from the minute you pick up the controller.  Enemies are smart, even on Easy mode, and will pick you off with fire before you can even locate them.  They will attack you in groups, outnumbering you, and they will drop in from dropships in the sky.  Once you fix the aiming controls, (which are ridiculously overesponsive on the default setting but can be altered with a simple venture through the options screen), the controls will feel comfortable.The problems with this game are as follows: only one enemy throughout the entire game, the Helghast, and one variation on the basic Helghast soldier that is tougher to kill.  Fighting the same thing over and over gets repetitive, and I found myself wishing there were other enemies with different strenghts and weaknesses, like in Halo.  Also, the farmerate will occasionally drop, which can easily be dealt with, but might annoy some.  The graphics are very impressive indeed, particularly for the PS2, which porbably explains the slowdown.Multiplayer is fun, though I am unable to talk about the online gameplay, due to the fact that I cannot play my PS2 online.  However, if the online gameplay is anything like the two-player matches, and there is not too much slowdown, I would imagine it would be fun and strangely addicting.My advice: either rent it, or wait for it to drop in price and pick it up then.  It is a fun game that kept me coming back until I finished it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2004"}

Groh","summary":"True 3D in an Amazing Collection of Technology","reviewText":"This is the gaming console that you've been waiting for a long time.We have played with Nintendo game systems for many years starting with the color Game Boy and finally advancing to the DSi and now the 3DS.It is a lot of money to put out for a new system but Nintendo has packed a whole ton of new features into this little portable system.The 3D is amazing, everything you could image it to be and more. You have to be looking at it pretty straight on and about 12-14\" from your face or the 3D gets difficult to keep clear. You have the ability at all times to turn off the 3D with a slider switch on the side of the top screen. Beyond the 3D there is added gyro feature that moves the system control as you move the 3DS from side to side.The controls are smooth and include the new joystick, the + bar,the A,B,Y,Z buttons, L/R buttons and a set of three button at the bottom including select, home and start. You can use a stylus (a much shorter version from the DS but one that telescopes out if you pull on it, it fits from the top down so it is no larger that the vertical height of the DS, not the longer width.) The touch screen is very sensitive and for screen controls and getting around menus, you don't need the stylus.We have set up our WiFi account but it says that you cannot connect to the internet yet and prompts that a software update will be available to enable that feature.Since we had a ton of downloaded games on the DSi, I'm still not sure if those will be downloadable again onto the new system (at no added expense.) I've read that you can though. My son was leery to trade in his DSi for this reason but I'm sure there is a workaround.You can play your regular DS games on it but your Game Boy games will not fit. However, many of those titles will be available for download once the internet connection is up and running.There are games that come preloaded that show off the 3D capabilities. One of them is Face Raiders which allows you take a picture of someone, or yourself, and then the game morphs that face into your enemy that you have to pop with balls to eliminate. It is really funny to play and the faces become these odd caricatures of the original picture. All the time you are playing, the DS displays whatever is directly in front of you as the backdrop to the game.Which brings up the ability for this console to take 3D photos. There are two cameras on the outside that can take a live shot in 3D. There is an additional camera that points to the player. You can switch between those cameras to change what the DS is taking a shot of.There is an SD card slot already loaded with a card. The overall feel of the console is sleek and easy on the hands, not much bigger than the DS or DSi in fact it feels about the same weight. It doesn't charge directly with a corded charger but it sits on a charging dock while the dock is plugged in. It doesn't really stay tightly to the dock but I guess you wouldn't want too much resistance or it will eventually break from being pulled out.A great system that really adds so much visually to the gaming experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2011"}

Unfortunately, this game ends up short-circuiting almost immediately. While the story, memory-altering mini games, and visuals are stunningly thought-provoking, there's little more to praise about this game. The dialogue and voice acting are absolutely laughable at best and cringe-worthy at worst. Most of it sounds like it was written to entertain morons. The gameplay is absolutely mind-numbingly simple and repetitive, with long chapters of run, climb a predetermined path, button-mash combat, and repeat. You can customize a few moves, none of which really amounts to anything resembling a creative or fun way to customize the character.

Mario and Luigi BIS carries the quality that we've grown to expect into another good role playing game.Mario rpg's have always been known for the fun dialouge. Of course, BIS keeps the fire coming with more witty dialouge, and fun characters. Bowser has sucked the Bros inside his body in a hair-brained scheme to take over Mushroom Kingdom (that went horribly wrong, as usuall). They must work co-operativly to retake the Kingdom from Lord Fawful. All characters dialouge is well written, especially Bowser, but does tend to drag on more than it's needed.Combat varies from fun to tedious. The mechanics are classic turn-based Mario rpg attackes, but another trend BIS brings with it is too common enemy encounters. The fun sucks out quick by not necessarily hard fights, but long ones. Thankfully, whenever the game reaches a lull (whether in combat in or bland level designs) the pace does get mixed up nicely with constant new mini game mechanics.Mario and Luigi BIS sticks to it's core basics, whether it be in combat, the writting, or in length (20 hrs plus is what I think I'm gonna be looking at), but if you are looking for a good DS RPG, this is the hottest game on the market....Love that box art too, by the way.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2009"}

It does this well, from the unique VATS system, to the SPECIAL stats distribution, the game, despite appearing as an First Person Shooter, has the feel of an RPG game. Attacking opponents have HP. You can disable their weapons, injure their extremities, or just go for a headshot, which can be performed in a slow motion cinematic sequence which often shows lots of guts and gore. Sometime it shows you shooting, sometimes it shows the bullet flying, sometimes it shows your opponent disintegrating. Some people have reported getting bored of this sequence, which you may choose to perform on most of your enemies, since shooting the old fashion way can lead to a lot of wasted ammo. I have never really gotten bored of it, and I take it in stride, just like the end credits at the end of a random encounter in the old Final Fantasy video games.Graphics and Glitches: Graphics of this game are suburb. This game, I should warn, is incredibly gory, consisting of grotesque scenes of mutilation, blood, body parts, carcasses, torture, drugs, and prostitution. The language is bad to, as bad as it can get, so if that is something that would bother you, stay away from this game. Yes, I understand M ratings, but there is M ratings like Gears of War, where you got blood and can cut your alien enemies in half, and then you have this, human beings being savagely murdered, and their carcasses strung up on hooks. Anyway, the VATS kills are incredible, the graphics show at the far edges of the screen, you can literally see a tower from a 15 minutes walk away, as opposed to some games love of fogging out the area in front of you. Absolutely beautiful game, you know, in that dreary depressing post apocalyptic kind of way. The game does have many glitches; many of which force you to reload from a previous game cause you can't get out of it. Typically, the errors are getting stuck, you jump somewhere, and gt stuck, you fall somewhere, and get stuck, and my personal favorite, fawkes( your giant traveling companion) stands in front of the door entrance and won't move.Music: The game really only delivers music via 2 radio stations (and a third unlockable one) One plays old patriotic music, the other play 50s and 40s music, nothing famous or popular. It is kind of lacking, Fallout makers really needed to step up and add a couple more music stations, or quests to increase the music selection, perhaps and in game CD player, and you find CDs around the world, or mp3 player if you wanted to be more update, with mp3s that you can download from computer terminals, you could even create your own playlists, but a man can dream, can't he?Story: The story was pretty good, if not pretty short. This is where I felt the game fizzled, Just as the story line was starting to go somewhere, the story ended, in a rather crappy way. Don't get me wrong, the climax was amazing, epic, and hilarious, but the game just ends without too much warning, and gives you no ability to continue to play, which it makes kind of impossible with the way it ends. They really should have put more thought in to ending the game in a manner in which you can continue on to play, and see people praise you in the aftermath, and find out how their lives are after all the stuff you have done for them. The 200+ endings is true, but kind of an embilishment. The ending is pictures complete with narration, what you did effects what pictures you see and what narration you get. The ending is in 4-6 parts, with 2-3 possible outcomes (such as good vs bad vs neutral karma effects 1 part), thus you have 2^6 or 3^6 or whatever, which gets you your many many endings, but it won't seem like it to you, and most anybody should not waste their time to see anymore that the basic big 2, bad or good.The Failure: So I teased you with the reasons to why it is a measly 3 stars. In truth, Fallout 3 is lacking. The greatest things it is lacking in is reason. Past level 10, every enemy falls down easily. I had massive amount of caps, the loose story lines of the side quests where barely enough to keep me playing. Any new area I visit just doesn't matter, you go their, find ammo (sorry got tons), find healing supplies (72 stimpacks and counting), find money( already got 15,000 caps I don't know what to do with) and gain experience (ok I like experience, but level 20 is not that far away). I would run to any city I could, sell what I could, which as I started to get laser rifles and plasma rifles, was never really worth it, unless I wanted to buy a bunch of junk I don't need. The game just lost it's edge. There are no super hard ultimate weapons to defeat (in fact, the hardest enemy in the game I have fought thus far is fawkes, and he is on my side), there really are no bosses at all in the game except the behemeths, which don't really get you much (although I hear anchorage dc has a bosslike enemy.) None of the armor acquired from side missions is particularly better than what you get from following the main story line, the \"special\" weapons are only slightly better than their normal counterparts, and don't really add anything to the game. By adding things to the game, for example, you could get a grenade launcher, which allows you to shoot frag grenades more accurately at a longer distance, upgrades that can improve your weapon; such as attaching a silencer to the weapon of your choice, artificially increasing a weapons power or efficiency, or given it more stats, such as poison enemies. They also needed to introduce elemental damage, in my opinion, so there is actual reason to pick one weapon over another. A quest to find a weapon that does not wear down would be cool, or, you know, just more. Also with perks, maybe you should have special harder to get perks that actually alter the dynamics of the game, so that upon getting them, you can have fun playing a little differently, like something that lets you jump higher, which would be required to get to certain other areas in the game.Formations: Your followers in this game are also pretty crappy. While potentially powerful and useful, you can't give them orders in the heat of battle, which sucks. Also, they get in your way, and can potentially block your ability to move somewhere. They continually repeat the same pieces of dialogue over and over again, which is kind of annoying, and their presence creates several continuity errors in the story, such as you being known as the lone wanderer and for those of you who know the ending, I mean, seriously, how stupid is that?Finishing Up: So in general, I did love the game. But once you become powerful enough that the challenge is gone, which occurs around level 10-12 if you do a couple side missions ad end up with a special weapon or 2, there is little to really keep you interested, unless you just LOVE exploring, the game just doesn't offer the incentive to continue playing. I also must mention the lack of minigames. You have the computer hacking game, and the lockpick thing which is 10 times easier than oblivion and thank you for that. I mean, they should allow you to play pool, maybe get an old arcade galliga shooter or pacman up and running, or other mini games that potentially reward  you with stuff and maybe gamerscore points. The stuff does get kind of repetitive, go to new place, pick up every gun, ammo, skill book, and other useful items you find, kill every bady, hack every terminal, pick every lock, sell your items, unload your inventory, rinse and repeat. The game was great, however the more I played, the more I realized I just needed more.Update:I have played 4 of the 5 expansion packs. Several of the packs actually offer me a challenge. When you lose all your equipment in The Pitt, it was incredibly fun for a couple of hours. Mothership Zeta offers a couple of alternate styles of gameplay that break up the monotomy such as controlling a ship and blowing aliens up by touching buttons. Broken Steel naturally fixes the end game issues and level cap problem. At level 30, Point Lookout has given me enough challenge that I am considering lowering the difficulty level off of hard. Had this game came with these expansion packs (say a game of year edition that will eventually come out) I would consider it a 4 star game.My BIGGEST problem with the game, which I did not mention in my review, and will restrict me from giving this game five stars, is the fact that the game centers around caps. Half the decisions you make are to earn caps. The only advantage of being bad is to get caps, and 90% of your motivation is for more caps, yet they serve virtually no purpose, since you will find so much ammo, stim packs, and other random junk that you will never need to spend your caps after 5 hours of gameplay. They need to throw in some ultra unique weapons that cost 10,000 caps, buy properties in other cities (there is an empty room in rivet city that would have been so easy to program into a room you could purchase), buy mininukes, so I don't feel bad every time I use the incredibly limited supply, even if they cost 1000 caps a nuke, I have plenty of caps sitting around, and trading my growing supply of plasma rifles for mininukes would be great. Buy vehicles, even if it costs 20,000 caps, what else am I using them for? So if they fixed that problem, I would bump the score up a star, and with the expansion packs included (free not $50 more), I bump it up another star, so that is what it takes to reach 5 stars in my book.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2009"}

Groh","summary":"A 'Step' Up to the Original Wii Fit","reviewText":"I really liked the original Wii Fit but after a few months, many of the 'fun' balance games felt like a 'been there done that' kind of thing.They were still fun but many of them needed to go to another level. Additionally, the other fitness selections also were limited in their variety and difficulty.Wii Fit Plus is a great way to take your Wii Fit program to the next level. Nintento has obviously looked at the popularity and flexibility of some other Wii fitness programs likeMy Fitness Coach. My Fitness Coach is a much more extensive workout program than Wii Fit Plus but does not offer the fun balance games that Wii Fit offers.A great plus is that Wii Fit Plus transfers over your data from your original Wii Fit workouts.They both have their positive aspects and it is nice to have both in my Wii arsenal of programs.I love the new addition to the 'fun' games. There is an additional table tilt, a snowball fight, a flying bird 'bullseye' game, Rhythm Parade and Segway Circuit and others that have all added more fun to the experience. There are also additional yoga and aerobic exercises.Wii Fit Plus adds a lot of variety and flexibility to its program now. You can customize your own program or follow some short sets that Wii Fit Plus already has programed. Everything has the ability to be customized, reordered, remixed, etc.The biggest thing to keep in mind with the Wii Fit (either original or Plus) is that there are limitations. There are exercises that would normally be done with a wider stance but because you need to keep your feet on the balance board, it is a little unnatural. There is limited actual exercise benefit although after 30 minutes, one can work up a small sweat. For those who do not usually exercise at all, it is at least something to keep moving and work on balance and strength. For those looking for an intense workout, this is not going to be it.What I am most pleased about is that Wii Fit Plus is available for a very reasonable price if you already have Wii Fit and the balance board. They could have pushed the price up knowing that we were a captive audience but this price point is fair and reasonable.I would recommend this as an upgrade to Wii Fit.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2010"}

Or a simple test-and-tune of my favorite car has turned into an extensive experiment with Forza's newest ability to add all-wheel-drive to various cars in the lineup.  Also new with this version is the \"conversion\" which, including the aforementioned all-wheel-drive, allows you to swap engines (though only within the same manufacturers lineup) or choose between turbocharged or supercharged add-ons.  In short, if you can dream it, chances are good Forza 3 will let you create it.The online racing isn't as easy to access - it's a major beef with gamers.  Personally, I'm an older gamer myself, so I started my own discussion on the [...] website and now have over 30 people to race with!  Someone is usually always online, and joining into a race or inviting friends to yours is just as easy as always.There's a few issues: some paint glitches with various cars, the AI controls your engine speed until a half-second before the race starts, and the \"livery editor\" can get a little confused when handling large numbers of graphic layers.  But these issues hardly hurt the game.  If anything - it shows how good this game is - that's all we can find to complain about!If you enjoy racing - even just a little - you'd probably be pleased with Forza 3.  It connects you to the sport, to your cars, and to each race.  It is easily the best racing game to exist - at least until Forza 4!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2009"}

{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"BassJas","summary":"Consider this...","reviewText":"Let me start by stating that I have been an ME nut since the first game. In fact, Mass Effect is the only game, rpg or otherwise, that I have played 3 times in a row. Once I finished one play-through I would play another. The same can be said for Mass Effect 2.ME 3 starts off a little jarring. The story does not pick up immediately after ME 2. Instead, some time has passed, you're back with the Alliance instead of Cerberus, and your mates have been scattered to the fringes of the galaxy. So of course you must assemble your team again. I'm guessing that the lapse in time for the story is probably explained in the ME novels or comics but I haven't read any of them. Onced I got past this jarring plot start things started to pick up. The story goes where'd you expect. True, the ending isn't the best in the history of games or movies, but it's not the worst. And it is an ENDING. I like the fact that the series ends here. Some franchises have a tendency to outlive their attraction by releasing game after game (think of Final Fantasy or God of War). I respect and admire the fact that this is the end. Also, even though the ending could have been better, I'm not going to let a lackluster ending kill my enjoyment of everything leading up to it. I do think that Bioware could have differed the endings a little more than they did. There are 7 possible endings and each one is basically the same with only a few minor differences.The graphics are the same as the previous two titles. Graphics whores will not like this fact, but I admire it as it gives amazing continuity to the series. The game is a little glitchy but I think this may be due to an update I need to install and haven't been able to since I haven't had network access during my playthrough.The design is consistent with the previous two titles. All alien species look like they should and act like they should. However, it seemed to me that all female characters that came back from previous titles (Ahsley, Liara, and Jack) were designed in an overly sexualized style. Their boobs seemed to have gotten larger and Jack always has hard nipples. The only ones to miss this change were Miranda and Shepherd. Did someone at EA think this would add seriousness to the game? If anything it actually makes the game lose a little seriousness. Also, if you import a character from ME 2, the stats will import but you will have to re-create your Shepherd. ME 2 did not have this flaw.Sound and gameplay are great. The weapons in the game are interesting but I would have liked to have seen the heavy weapons back. In ME 3 they are there, but only as pickups that you get in the field and once you're out of ammo, that's it; back to normal weapons. Also, a minor let down for me is in the squad selection. The character present are great, but in the first two games my favorite squad members were the Krogans. ME 3 has no Krogan squad members. Although it fits into the story to not have one, my geeky admiration for the Krogan would have liked to have had one in my squad. Although I must admit that the further exploration of Tuchanka was perhaps my favorite part of the game.All in all, this is a good game that grants finality to the series. Playing through with all main and sidequests complete put me right at 40 hours of total play. If missions were managed a little better on my part this might have been shaved by 3 or 4 hours. Don't let all the negative reviews of this game's ending prevent you from playing through the game. Play through it yourself and see for yourself what you think of the ending. I feel that too many fanboys out there in review land wanted a better ending that would leave the franchise open for more games (still possible for prequel stories). I for one, think sequelitis is running rampant in games and movies. It's time for things to have finality. Mass Effect 3 grants us finality.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-02-2013"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed.

Washington \"CogsnWheels\"","summary":"No split screen two player ability, so what. This game rocks!!","reviewText":"I am still playing this game & haven't finished yet, but so far I think this game is awesome. I don't understand why people are giving this game 1 and 2 star reviews based on the fact it doesn't have the split screen two player offline co-op option as the first RFOM. I enjoyed that feature too, as my sister & I went through the whole game together & it was really fun, but it got a little confusing at times viewing the split screen. Anyway, I can see where Insomniac made upgrades to this game as the graphics & playability is really smooth & it definitely does justice to the first installment of this game.I agree with others that have the dislike in the fact that you only keep two weapons instead of being able to keep all of your weapons like you did in the first RFOM. However, I do like the new weapons that I have gotten so far. The Magnum revolver with exploding bullets, the Splicer which shoots out saw blades that literally cut your enemies to pieces, the Pulse Round energy gun that packs a serious punch, the Wraith which is a portable Gatlin gun that in my opinion is the best weapon in the game, & finally the fully automatic sniper rifle that comes in handy. The Bull's-eye I and II, the Auger(which has a cool upgrade this game where you have x-ray view that allow you to see through walls to kill your enemies), the carbine machine gun, missile launcher, & the shotgun are back as well. I haven't made it to the end of the game so there could be more weapons.What impressed me in this game also is the wide variety of enemies that are in this game, Not only do we have the Chimera foot soldiers & ALL of the goons from the 1st game, but we also have the Grim that hatch from pods who attack you in large numbers, The Chameleon who is invisible & kill you with one swipe, & they have Chimera that are jacked up that carry pulse round weapons. There are also HUGE enemies that are reminiscent as the monster in Cloverfield that you have to fight as well as other large mammoth sized creatures. I like the detail that they added to this game. The way the pods that hold the Grim can be destroyed before they hatch & a dead grim pops out, & like the 1st installment, if you listen close you can understand what they Chimera are saying to each other.Another disappointment is they should of added a level that you get to man a tank or a vehicle as you could in the 1st RFOM. However there is a short part of the game where you are in an airship where you have to sniper Chimera that are on the ground. Reminds me a lot of COD4. I also like the functionality how your character regenerates his health just like COD4 instead of those pesky little health packs I you had to pick up along the way in the first one. And you also have the ability to sprint in the offline single player campaign, which was only available in online game play in the first RFOM. This is also a plus that is in COD4. I also like how the game automatically saves your progress at the exact checkpoints instead of having to start from the beginning of each chapter if you quit like you did in the first RFOM.Since the Resistance Fall Of Man series has such a big legacy on the PS3, maybe Insomniac can go back & add downloadable levels on the PS3 network that will include the split screen game play that has everyone so upset. But as far as I'm concerned, this game gets 5 stars from me because I plan on going through it a bunch more times after I beat it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2008"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Douglas Sourbeer \"Latro\"","summary":"Not Great but Better than One","reviewText":"Yes console games have become too popular and this game was dummed down for the console.

The medium helped establish actors like John Wayne and Clint Eastwood as pivotal, household figures part of an ever-evolving art form. Eventually what started as movies branched off into different types of outlets including cartoons, comics, radio shows, and video games. Rockstar Games latest release, Red Dead Redemption, serves as a love letter to the genre by paying homage to the concept with the signature style that the company is known for. Here are a few reasons why you should pull the trigger on picking up this title.Red Dead Redemption is a compelling action-adventure story of revenge and reaffirmation set in the west during the year 1911. The player takes on the role of John Marston, a retired outlaw turned bounty hunter who is separated from his family and forced to capture or kill members of a notorious gang in order to get them back. The only drawback is that he too was once part of this gang and is faced with the dilemma of hunting down savages he once called his friends. Throughout his journey, he experiences several trials and tribulations all reminiscent of the violent past life he use to live. You're also introduced to a wide variety of secondary characters that each have distinct personalities, but are essential to your progression through the story. When it comes towards expressing the dynamics of character development, Rockstar nails it best in the supporting cast by offering up memorable performances that each commands a certain response from the main character. People like Bonnie MacFarlane, Landon Ricketts, and Luisa Fortuna are believable characters who you'll have a profound emotional connection with.As for Marston himself, he is portrayed as a drifter of sorts and you only know about his past based on dialogue he shares with others. With no flashbacks provided this concept somewhat disconnects from the story and doesn't quite express why you should care about this character. Perhaps if the character had an ornament that reminded him of his wife or son then the sense of conflict would have made you want to root for him more. All criticism aside though, the lengthy story varies in hours of gameplay based upon all that you decide to do and has enough twists and turns to keep you satisfied day in and day out.When it comes to the open sandbox environment in which you play, the creative team has worked ambitiously to capture the true essence of a world with no limits. Your quest will have you start in the town of New Austin and travel to the deepest parts of Mexico. The map system works similar to the GTA games in the sense that you can establish your waypoint early on and use it to reach your destination. The only drawback here is that the location may not always be accurate and instead you'll be in the vicinity of where you want to be, having to figure out the rest of the way by yourself. Luckily, you'll have the option of a horse, stagecoach, or train to aid you in your travels. Riding the horse is an easy task just so long as you don't overuse them by tapping the button too quickly. Once you do commit this error, the horse will abruptly stop and knock you off his or her back without a second thought. However, you'll gain access to general stores which not only will offer you supplies, but also adrenaline pills to help speed up your horse and get you to your destinations quicker without sacrificing their exhaust meter.One aspect worth mentioning in regards to the world is in the way the surrounding people are portrayed in response to the hardships of the time period. There is a deeper sense of government unrest and political corruption that dwindles down to what you see. There will be instances where you will see people being robbed, raped, beaten, or killed right in front of your eyes, instantly giving you the choice to act accordingly. Even more interesting is that you'll also see hitchhikers on the roads supposedly needing your help, but quickly robbing you instead. A.I. aesthetics like these aim to keep the difficulty at a steady pace while also testing the player's morality to situations. Even the use of newspaper impresses by giving you clues as to what is happening with other characters you have or will interact with. All these steps are a testament to the depth of detail Rockstar goes to create a living, breathing world.The core elements of gameplay are based on missions, side-quests, and free roaming. The missions start out as favors that you do for other characters that are later returned when you need their help. Some of these missions can be repetitive when they involve getting into shootouts with enemies, clearing enemy hideouts, or participating in horse racing competitions with the local talent. There are also herding missions, which involve you taking care of and preserving large groups of cows and cattle. While I'm an animal lover and I appreciate the diverse array of missions, I have to admit that the herding tasks were a little tedious and boring. They do more to convey the care and concern of other cast members, but not so much John Marston himself. Also the night-tracking jobs wouldn't be half as bad if you didn't have to wait so long for the dog to sniff out the criminals.On the other hand, the side-quests by themselves were quite enjoyable. You can respond to bounty posters left throughout each location and receive cash rewards for your efforts. This can also be tricky because every criminal that is wanted usually has a posse of followers you'll have to deal with beforehand. Once you apprehend the culprit you can either hog-tie and ride him back to the sheriff, or you can kill him. Capturing him alive would double the cash amount you would be offered for the job. By the same token, if you choose to commit crimes then you would have a bounty placed upon your head. You then would have the option to pay it off, or risk being captured every time your near the authorities. The next best bet would be to either pay off or execute a witness who saw the crimes, which would make your bounty essentially disappear. You'll also be able to play several fun games like Poker, and Liar's Dice. Participation in certain events also open up challenge modes which help you gain achievements and fulfill tasks. Just be cautious that you aren't caught cheating because if you are you'll be summoned to a duel with the person you cheated against.The duels capture all the drama and suspense of the same type of standoffs you've seen in every type of western movie known to man. You'll have a set amount of time to build up your gauge meter and aim appropriately at your adversary before he shoots you. One of the strongest aspects about the combat system comes in the introduction of the Dead Eye attribute. By holding down the right trigger button, the screen color fades and actions slow down temporarily allowing you to mark your target or targets before firing away. This mechanic is especially beneficial in face-offs, and encounters where there are multiple enemies gathered together at once. Aside from this feature, the targeting system varies based upon the situation your in. If you're close enough to an enemy there will be a gruesome scene of you either shooting him in the face, stomach, or back. However, if an enemy were at a distance away from you, better aiming would require finesse and precision on your part. Once again, this is where the enemy A.I. constantly challenges you, which in the end only makes you a better gunslinger.When deciding to free-roam you'll encounter strangers who require your assistance. You'll know who a stranger is on your map when you see a purple question mark, indicating their location. These encounters also offer up both interesting and diverse characters and serve as good tests for your loyalty and honor meters. Ultimately doing a combination of all these elements would allow you to unlock various costumes for John as you move forward in the story. Lastly, when it comes to money and survival you'll be able to gather and sell different types of flowers, as well as hunt and skin all types of animals. I'm pretty sure PETA would ban the game alone for including this segment, but personally I find nothing wrong with it. Once again, the realities portrayed in light of the environment are significant and it's essential to express these concepts so that the game feels believable to its core audience.Red Dead Redemption offers up an array of multiplayer options for the ambitious gamer. The fun begins in free roam mode, which acts as a hub that connects you to different game modes. Once you begin each mode players have a Mexican standoff to determine the last man standing. If you survive the shootout then you can get a head start on finding a hiding space to set up shop. The single player game modes include Shootout, and Gold Rush. Shootout is a variation on Last Man Standing, meaning that whoever has the most kills at the end of the session wins. In addition to stats, you'll also be able to level up your player based upon how you do in each round. It's worth noting that these modes offer everything you unlock as you progress through the single player mode, with the one exception of the Dead Eye. This specialty trait can only be acquired if you are able to find it in any of the various crates located throughout the warzone. Another single player online mode I enjoyed was Gold Rush. This competition is in many ways like capture the flag but the objective is to capture as many bags of gold as possible and deposit them into designated crates. Your opponents can make this especially challenging by killing you and thus stealing your bag of gold at any given time.The real meat and bones of the multiplayer lies in the competitive team match modes, which include Gang Shootout, Hold Your Own, and Grab The Bag. Gang Shootout and Grab The Bag are team versions of the single player online modes listed above but with the addition of more players. Hold Your Own is a team based capture the flag were territories are set, invaded, and marked. This can account for both chaotic and fun battle sessions providing that you have a great Xbox live, or PSN connection. Another plus to having these sessions lies in the skills that your prospective posse members can contribute to the battle. If you have a higher ranked player on your team then it will sometimes make it much easier to face-off against the opposing team. As of this writing I am still forming my posse and will enjoy the results once I have paid my dues. Overall, the online components of this game are rock solid and with more multiplayer DLC promised in the near future, I believe it's safe to say that this game will keep you busy over the traditionally slow summer gaming months to come.Red Dead Redemption is an absolute gem of a game, which portrays the love of western cinema in all it's dignified glory. While I pointed out a few flaws, I don't believe any of these are critical enough for you to pass on this game. Chances are if you enjoyed any of the GTA games that this company is famous for, then you'll feel right at home with this title. Rockstar has truly crafted something special with Red Dead Redemption, a game you wouldn't mind riding off into the sunset with.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2010"}

With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story.

I will say that first off, while you can start a new character w/o having to play part 1, you will get more out of the story if you have already played part 1.**SPOILER ALERT!**First off moving your character save is a breeze and even with the prologue, you can still go back in and tweak your character's appearance and class if you weren't too happy with what you had in ME1.As far as the controls are concerned, it's come a good little ways since the first one as you have more of a Gears of War approach as this game is more combat heavy and tactical heavy. A lot of the inventory has been streamlined to help the player enjoy the game more and worry less about equipping your character.The story itself so far is also engrossing. Sheppard and crew are facing off against a threat of the Collectors while at the same time working for a mysterious organization call Cerebrus who managed to not only treat her like Ripley in Aliens but also rebuild her ship (once you play it, you will see) you will meet new characters who you will find are hard to trust as well as meet up with old characters that you will have issues with as far as your alliances.There are also many moments even early on where you get to do things that will cause your paragon or renegate ratings to change based on those action and that includes saving someone or killing someone!That also is another part to this game. Based on some of your decisions. your crew's loyalty will change. I haven't gotten far yet to see how this works but if it's anything like Dragon Age, I will bet that it's a doozy.Another major improvement is the art of the game. Out of the places I have been to in the game, a lot of artwork and design of planets, characters, city structures etc, feels as if it's giving Mass Effect 2 it's own identity and not just look like another static Sci fi game. I would comment further on your ship's desing but I think as a player you would have to see it for yourself. I think that even the music is better this time around and the voice dialogue is still top notch like the first.Even as far as traveling in the game, so far, there is a lot more to do. You can travel to different systems and scan moons to mine for ore from orbit and also you get 2 peices of free DLC which you can use immediately. Also instead of just highlighting a dot and going, you can 'fly' your ship where you want it to be on the map and then tell it to go there. One other small mechanic  you may want to keep an eye on is the fuel gauge as you have to buy gas to get where you are going. That could be a plus or minus depending.Character leveling as in the first game is not complex at all but you may want to try different classes to get an idea of what you like as newer ones have been added. One of the additions that I like is that you can upgrade weapons, armor and ship systems as well as do some customizing of your own personal equpiment.There really aren't too many minuses in the game except for one, I don't like the fact that if you are docked in a city or station and you want to get something on your ship, you have to undock (to load your ship's level up) and then redock to continue. This to me breaks the flow of the game. Also in some parts where you are talking to NPCs, the lighting could be a bit off.Some people may have issues with the new \"Halo style\" damage indicator where you take damage, the screen gets red and then you run off and heal.  I think I liked it the other way from the first one.But all in all, if you are a fan of this title, pick it up and play it and on a scale of 1 - 5, I give this a 4.5.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2010"}

I don't regret it one bit. I played this game 3 times, roughly 25 hours each time. As far as I'm concerned, the best class is the Sentinel. You're pretty much ready for ANYTHING with that class. I didn't enjoy the planet scanning, mainly cause I'm very impatient, & that takes me out of the action. I'd dedicate like 30-60 minutes to planet scanning for minerals that you use to upgrade your stuff/moves. I like the fact that you can hold RB to assess the situation, decide what move you wanna use, who to focus your squad's aiming on, etc.When it comes to weapons, once you get the Particle Beam, you don't really need any other Heavy Weapon after that. The thing is prolly the strongest weapon in the game, & you don't have to use minerals to unlock it like the other Heavy Weapons. I COULD play it again, but I don't have the patience to sit through the cutscenes that I've already seen lol.

{"product_name":"B0050SZ0SY","description":"","reviewerName":"AeroEngineer","summary":"Stunning to play and look at, seems a bit on the short side.","reviewText":"This is a fun game to play with great graphics, great controls and a decent story. My one problem is that it does seem on the short side to me although I do play much more than most people do at this point in time. I think Far Cry 3 is a much more in depth game than this one as far as length and things to do outside the main storyline. If we are just judging by cost to amount of novel game play experiences then FC3 beats this easily. So it's recommended at used prices not new. It does seem to scale pretty nicely to those of us who don't have the latest systems as mine is a few years old with my graphics card being about 3 years old. It ran OK on the games auto settings but I turned that down to medium levels and a lower resolution than my monitor to get a more fluid experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2013"}

Yet with the release date oh so far away, I decided to take advantage of the recent price drop of the Call of Duty PC game hoping that it would tide me over. However, after playing countless hours of the game on my PC, I'd have to say that Call of Duty: Finest Hour is a bit of a disappointment. I understand that a console has nowhere near the processing power of a PC, yet I couldn't help but feel underwhelmed by FH's graphics which were simple and bland at best. However, I was mostly disappointed in the lack of save points throughout a level. That meant after spending ten minutes or so blasting your way through a difficult level, you would have to start the campaign all over again from start to finish if your player is killed. I always appreciate a challenge, yet not when the odds are overwhelmingly stacked against me. The one aspect that the console version did translate well was the \"war is hell\" theme. The beginning level featuring you as a Russian soldier taking back Stalingrad from the \"steeking Germans\" was intense with gunfire raining all around you and enemy soldiers around every corner. The death animations are overly exaggerated which made in difficult to distinguish whether or not an enemy was either wounded or dead only to have them shoot you in the back. I played this game for only an hour before I filed it away with my other games. I imagine that I will someday go back, but in the meantime, I'm having too much fun with the PC version.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2004"}

Anyway this is a great gun. I wish all first person shooters will start implementing the move.

The graphics are absolutely gorgeous, and it runs in full 1080p (not scaled) at a constant 60fps.My wife insists on hogging the GamePad so she gets to play as Murphy on those levels. This is the one sticking point. In two player, one person playing as Murphy (drawing on the screen or rotating the screen to help Rayman) is a LOT of fun, but in single player, where the game controls Rayman and you control Murphy, it can be quite frustrating on since Rayman will often just stand there or not jump when he's supposed to. Gah! This is the only (comparatively) minor flaw in a real gem of a platforming game.Really, I've found co-op is the most fun for this game anyway. It's a total hoot, and then there's no Murphy issues, yay!An absolute favorite in this household is the soccer mini-game, called \"Kung Foot.\" It's pretty hilarious, and my wife gets surprisingly competitive as we battle it out for goals. I also really enjoy platformer-racing for best times etc in the rankings online. Really excellent.Overall, the gorgeous graphics, wonderful soundtrack and super-smooth gameplay garners this game an easy 5 out of 5. Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00005ULXN","reviewerName":"David Kauffman","summary":"Some levels are tedious and cheap, and then the games over.","reviewText":"Sonic made it's debut on the Sega system. Ever since, it has been the corporate icon to sega. Just like Crash Bandicoot is to Sony, or a more prominent example, Mario to Nintendo. When X-Box and Gamecube came out, Sega was, how should we say it, in deep trouble. It conceded, giving the rights to games away, such as Crazy Taxi. It also sold some gaming rights to select companies, either Nintendo or Microsoft. Sonic was handed to Nintendo.They took Sonic, Tales, Knuckles, and Dr. Eggman, and worked out a plot and made some new characters. All together, a good idea, but it needs some work still.The gameplay is very odd. You can be on the Dark Side, or on the Good side. The good side is Sonic, Tales, Knuckles, etc. On the Sega, the bad guy was Dr. Eggman. Knowing you can't build a game mainly on one player, they added 3 other people. Rogue, a copy of knuckles, and Shadow, a copy of Sonic. Each level is identical for both Good and Evil, but the story line is different. Also, it has the gameboy advance link. I don't own Sonic on the GBA, but what I know is that you can import \"Chao's\" sort of like pokemon, and be able to interact with them, all in 3D on the gamecube. All in All, a good idea. The problem? If you ask anyone what the most boring part of the level is, they will say the Hunt for the Master Emerald Series. Every 2 or so levels, you go on a quest to find 3 objects, hidden. It is so incredibly boring, you will give up have the time. Also, some levels are unfair, and involve Trial and Error methods. You are \"invincible\" in a sense too. You collect rings, but when you are touched by and enemy or an object, you lose all your coins except for 20, that will spring out from you and you must get them. If you are hit when you have 0 coins, you die. You can also fall down, which happens all the time, and you will immediately die. Those 2 parts alone make me so angry. It is also too short! The multiplayer could use a definite upgrade. There are not many options to use, and some of them are pretty much one sided. Such as, should I choose Tails with 5 stars, or the chao robot with only 3? Hmmmm.... With all the problems, I can do nothing but give the gameplay a 6.5/10.As all my other reviews state, Gamecube graphics will knock your socks off. Sonic Adventure 2 Battle stays true to the promise of killer graphics. Everything is in 3D really. However, there are Camera issues. You cannot really pan around to well. You cannot set the camera to one spot, making backing up dangerous, for you don't know what's behind you. Because of the Camera issues, I'm going to give the graphics an 8/10.The sound itself is not that great. There are no many sound effects. The music and voices though are fantastic. All players have perfect casted voices. There is also great music. All players have different sound tracks. The best thing is you can hear all of them from the sound test option. Despite the bad sound effects, I can't complain about anything else. Sound gets a 9.5/10.When I say speed I don't mean how fast Sonic's feat are. I'm talking loading time. It takes a while to load, a medium time. It would have been nice to see it go faster, but it's not painfully bad. Speed gets an average 8/10 grade.The controls are above average. They do have some bugs in them though. You also have a problem with choosing what you want. You have a varius amount of moves to do, and you must perform all of them with the A and B button. Some special moves are hardly performed because of the confusion of button control. If you decide to buy the game, you will immedietly notice something is \"just not right\" With the issues, controls get a 7/10.Replay value is easy to execute. You can replay any mission differetly 5 times. You play each level with a select goal, then you can play is 4 more times with a different goal each time. Such as, in the first level, you slide down the streets on a snowboard. Your object is to avoid the bad guys. After you beat it, you may play it again, this time you must collect 100 coins. Multiplayer always adds more points to the replay value, but I still suggest you don't buy it, because when it's over, it's over. Replay Value gets a 7/10.Sonic Adventure 2 Battle (Which is technically 1, not 2, because a previous game doesn not exist) is a nice game to play, but becomes boring when you beat it. There are not to many levels, and by playing about an hour a day, you should be able to beat the entire game in 2 weeks. If you have Sonic on the GBA, you probably may want to buy it just for the special things it gives you for your Chao's, such as power ups and special chao's only found in the GCube game.Let's review:Gameplay: 6.5/10Graphics: 8/10Sound: 9.5/10Speed: 8/10Controls: 7/10Replay value: 7/10Total: 46/60 giving Sonic Adventure 2 Battle a 76.67.There are cheats, but only for the Chao world. I'll give it an extra .5, because of the cheat.Sonic Adventure 2 Battle's new total is 46.5, giving it a 77.50, a slightly below average game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2002"}

Any software engineer can tell you that the idea that they NEED this game to run through a server is complete bullox. People have already figured out how to run the game offline without those precious servers rendering EAs statements to the contrary look like pathetic lies. Attempts to cover their backside for the \"mistake which were made.\" The firing of their CEO tells you how they really feel about the whole thing. So why continue to make &$#! up?Be honest EA: The ONLY reason you want to use those servers is to prevent piracy of the game (and good luck with that--every game gets pirated whether you like it or not). Once again EA has managed to take one of the best games of all time and find a way to ruin it. Screw you EA. I'll never give you another dollar of my money. You should be ashamed of yourself.In the interest of fairness, let me state clearly: I HATE EA. I hate what they've done to gaming, I hate their asinine \"phone home\" model of leasing games rather than selling them, and I hate that they've grown too large for their own good and have systematically ruined good game franchises like those created by Maxis.As consumers, it is our responsibility to speak up about things like this. Even more importantly, it's our responsibility to NO SPEND OUR MONEY on this trash. Give your money to INDIE developers who care about their customers (I sent $75.00 in a Kickstarter campaign to help fund Hidden Path's Defense Grid: Containment).

{"product_name":"B0050SYUSU","description":"","reviewerName":"&#308;&#308;","summary":"Ridiculously fun but becomes boring","reviewText":"The cover of \"Rabbids: Alive and Kicking\" just hints at the quirkiness that is contained in this game. Nearly everything you will be required to do while playing involves embarrassing or ridiculous movements. The entire game creates an atmosphere that will allow you and your friends to have a ridiculously good time for a few hours; although, most likely, you will be bored with this game by the end of the night.\"Rabbids: Alive and Kicking\" is composed of various minigames that you undertake in the attempt to stop the rabbids from taking over your city. There's no real story other than the idea of this Rabbid invasion.The minigames vary in length, style, and exertion. Some games will be done in ten seconds, while other games may take you five minutes to complete. In addition, the games may be specifically multiplayer or solo; they also may require you to do an action vocally as opposed to physically. An example would be a certain game that requires you to yell at rabbids and scare them away. It can be difficult to complete some such games if you're playing at night while others are sleeping nearby or in a location where yelling is not conducive. Also, some of the games will require you to run as quickly as possible or swing your arms in a rigorous swimming motion while other games will just ask you to wave your hand or stick out your tongue. It was often underwhelming to go from a high-adrenaline game to one where you mostly just stand there for a few minutes.Overall, some of the games were winners while others were boring duds. There's enough variety for everyone to find something he or she likes, but since most of the games are ridiculously silly, they will probably be enjoyed most by children and people who host game night parties. Even then, the games aren't engaging enough to keep excitement up for very long. The boring factor sets in pretty quickly.Space is definitely something you need for this game. With some Kinect titles, you can get away with just using a small square on your floor; but in this game, you will need a huge amount of area so that you can move side to side, kick, and run around.The loading screens are the biggest pain! They take a significant amount of time, and when you're playing one of the quick 10 second games, the loading screens will take the short experience and force to take about a full minute. After every game, there's a loading screen; after every menu selection, there's a loading screen. It gets annoying and detracts from the fun.The actual menu setup is fine and easy to navigate through.  I rarely found myself incorrectly selecting things.There is a reward system in place that awards rolls of toilet paper for doing well in games. I haven't found anything to do with the toilet paper, so it seems to be just a point system of sorts that really doesn't serve much purpose other than setting records.Graphically, the game is pretty darn good. The areas are vibrant, cartoony, and give a happy atmosphere that almost makes you want to jump in and start playing. The music is also very happy, but it tends to be forgettable and doesn't add much to the game.It's difficult to say definitely whether or not YOU personally will like this game. I'm a silly person; I love playing ridiculous games, but this just bored me after playing it for a while. I tried playing it with some friends who also enjoy silly games, and although some of them got into the minigames for a bit, others didn't find the game appealing at all. The menu loading is obnoxious, but the graphics are lovely. The gameplay is OK, and the music is bland. This is a game I'd recommend trying the demo for or looking up some gameplay on YouTube before deciding to buy it.The game has potential and will most likely be more fun for kids, but I honestly didn't find it much better than a short distraction that was fun while it lasted.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2013"}

R. Jeanclerc \"Reader, Listener & Obsessive...","summary":"\"Pure\" - as in Pure Arcade Racing Fun","reviewText":"\"Pure\" is an off-road ATV racer that plays like a top-tier coin-op from days gone by.  The racing itself is big, fast and always enjoyable.  You bump around massive (and beautifully rendered) natural tracks with 15 other rigs, looking for opportunities to pull off insane jumps and motocross-style tricks along the way.  The more tricks you pull off successfully, the more boost you've got to blow by the competition.  It's a good thing that the arcades didn't have anything quite this addictive when I was growing up or else I'd have ended up on the street begging for change - hopefully in quarter form!After selecting one of the ready-made, cartoony riders, you build your ATV.  This is a pretty involved process for the first-timer, and I was worried that the game might have abruptly gotten itself bogged down in gearhead details.  But the build process is easy to learn - just select a part from the menu of options and then what color/finish you want.  You can evaluate parts based on their impact to your ATV's performance via a series of 0-100 scales for top speed, acceleration, handling, tricks, etc.  Basically, top speed and trick capability are tradeoffs for smooth handling and acceleration.  If you don't feel like going through the complete build process, you can also opt for a ready-made ATV with either a racing or trick focus.Once you're ready to race, you can select the Pure World Tour (career mode), a series of standalone races & freestyle events, or else go online for some multiplayer competition.  World Tour moves along at a good pace, mixing up races with freestyle events and never getting hung up on a particularly impossible stage.  The further you progress, the more upgrades you earn for your stable of ATVs (and unlike some other racing games, it's easy to find the newly-unlocked parts in your garage - you hear that, NFS?)The races themselves are the crown jewel of \"Pure\".  You'll race up and down alpine mountains, desert sand dunes, muddy rainforests, and ancient ruins.  They are all beautiful to behold, with lighting and water effects that are very good.  Each track has an established course but also a lot of freedom to try different racing lines and even find hidden shortcuts and trick opportunities.  There are hills, ramps and cliffs all over for you to grab some air - while airborne, you can perform motocross tricks.  If you successfully land it, you get a boost to your turbo reserve.  The controls for performing tricks are a well-designed combination of the analog sticks and buttons.  It's easy to pull off satisfying stunts from the get-go, but you'll quickly want to explore new combinations and string together moves for massive results.One minor disappointment is the freestyle events, where you compete not to win the race but to put on the best show of stunts.  There are bonus tokens all over the course (on the ground and in the air) during these events - some double your trick score, some unlock more complex tricks, some extend your on-track time, etc.  However, with a full field of 16 ATVs running the course at once, there's often just too much mayhem to really get a good string of tricks going, especially while trying to hit the tokens.  It might have been better to have just one ATV at a time during freestyle events and then judge you based on a target score.Speaking of the other racers, I was pleasantly surprised that the game never shudders or bogs down even when you're in the thick of a massive 16-ATV pileup.  This one has nice smooth gameplay throughout.  And the AI for the competition is no pushover, either.  You'll quickly reach a point where you need to really work in order to finish near the top of the standings.  Plus, the other racers interact in interesting ways - they don't seem rigidly scripted.  I've lost races before where the finish line was in sight but then another ATV fell out of the sky in front of me to steal the victory.  I'm guessing that he found a huge jump/shortcut - I'm still looking for that one!\"Pure\" is a great racer because of the immediate fun that it offers.  There's no worrying about gear ratios or tire camber - just wild action on a wide variety of beautiful and interesting courses.  And the addition of the trick system sets it apart from other arcade racers.  Tricks are rewarding and easy to learn at first, although more and more complex offerings become available as you progress.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2008"}

Simply put, this may be one of the best, if not the absolute best, role playing games I have ever played.There is so much to see and do in this game that I just don't have the space to write it all out here. Besides the main quest, you can join guilds, help out the citizens in the towns and cities with favors, scour the land for a cure to vampirism, steal for the poor, kill an entire village... and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Endless amounts of treasure, weapons, items and monsters to dispose of make this game an experience in its own right.This game really succeeds in creating mood and atmosphere. Whether travelling across an open field or exploring a dark dungeon underneath the city, the graphics and surround sound will help put you right in the middle of the moment. For example, the world of Oblivion is a world where portals to another dimension and the creatures coming out of them threaten the lives of its inhabitants and of all existence. Whenever you come across one of these Oblivion gates, the music slowly becomes more menacing and the skies slowly begin to turn red with thunder and lightning crashing overhead. If you really let yourself get taken in by this game, just the sight of one of these gates will send a little chill down your spine.If there are any problems I have with the game, it's that the loading can get a little annoying at times. Sometimes it'll load quickly and sometimes it'll go quite slow. There are plenty of load times in this game and I noticed on some spare occasions that the game crashed on me in the middle of a load. Thankfully, the game autosaves quite frequently, so in the case of a game crash, you won't really be getting screwed by losing hours and hours of playtime.I haven't even mentioned all the downloadable extras that you can get from Xbox Live, especially the just released expansion pack, \"Shivering Isles\", which I have just started playing and promises well over 30+ hours of game time. Add this to the 200+ hours you can get out of Oblivion by itself and that's a lot of time you'll be spending with this fascinating adventure. That's the great thing about this game. Even when you think you're done with it, there's still much more to do.If you are in any way a fan of RPGs, this one is well worth it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2007"}
{"product_name":"B002BSC54I","reviewerName":"researcher","summary":"Ocarina of Time Dethroned?","reviewText":"To say that Ocarina of Time was the best game ever made would not be a crazy statement. Sure Sony and Microsoft fanboys might not say it was the best, but at least they would respect it as a masterful game. \"Was\" the best. It almost feels wrong to say it, but Skyward Sword is of an equal echelon to The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.Presentation / Finished Product:No glitches from what I can tell. Nintendo obviously did their part in thoroughly alpha, beta, and RC testing this game. I particularly enjoy the scores that have been implemented in this episode of the Zelda series. All seem to be fully orchestrated. It almost seems like they were trying to 1-up OoT. However, two things come to note: relative atmosphere and voice acting. While it is still excellent, SS does not have the same captivating atmosphere as does OoT. Not once did the music or SFX make me feel like I was thoroughly engrossed in the environments or temple-areas as much as I was in OoT. Dark, obscure, haunting atmosphere of the Shadow Temple? Flamboyant, active Fire Temple? Whimsical and mysterious Forest Temple? Not exactly. Again, it's there, but I would have to go with OoT's overall tone. On the graphics side, SS wins on style. OoT was merely a proof of concept that a Zelda game could go in 3-D (not to discredit it), but it is apparent that SS took a cue from Wind Waker and decided to craft its own artistic direction.EDGE: Ocarina of TimeGameplay:SS has plenty to do. From the typical gather items to improve your stats, to side quests, to the main quest, to an almost sandbox-like overland. The size of the world in SS is definitely a step up from OoT and much improves on the lack of activity density that the immense size of Hyrule Field had in Twilight Princess. The dungeon/temples are challenging and brought me back to OoT (I just flashed back to the Water Temple, sorry). The mini-games are back and each has their own interconnection, if you will, but I'll let you discover that. I do take one bit of concern. The Wii-mote controls are very innovative. Finally, the enemies are smart and they just do not maintain the typical pattern of GUARD and STRIKE. No, they actually seem like they have a human-intelligence to them as to their attacking/behavior algorithm. However, while it is an improvement from the Wii-mote controls from Twilight Princess, I must say that I find myself growing tired of the 1:1 swordplay after awhile. Sure, it's a great idea, and I hate to knock it down on its pretty much flawless execution, but I guess due to my own personal preference, it doesn't exactly add a whole lot to the gameplay. To reiterate, the vastly improved enemy AI is a welcome addition, the 1:1 is remarkable, but in the end, I feel that it does not add too much.EDGE: Skyward SwordLongevity / Value:It's really simple here. As with pretty much all Zelda games, there is a lot to accomplish and explore. While it is not exactly an open ended game, once you complete it there is a sort of satisfaction that is akin to... well... finishing Ocarina of Time. You feel fulfilled and sad and it is a bittersweet goodbye. It was a challenge (unlike Twilight Princess) and you will remember it as THE game. Skyward Sword is outstanding, however, I cannot shake this feeling that I am betraying Ocarina of Time with this following statement. I guess and old vet like me cannot believe it, but I would end with this:My mind says Skyward Sword is the fuller and richer experience vs. OoT.But my heart belongs to the Ocarina.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2011"}

{"product_name":"Logitech G600 MMO Gaming Mouse, White","description":"","reviewerName":"Ammy_Evaluator","summary":"Definitely a try-it-first mouse","reviewText":"I am a huge fan of Logitech mice, in particular the G500, which is my all-time favorite. While I was very excited by the G600, in the end it just wasn't good enough to unseat the G500 as my mouse of choice.Note that this is a mouse that you absolutely must try out for yourself. Relying purely on product photos might not convey the full picture here (no pun intended).Let me start with the negatives.[1] The G-Shift button doubles the number of programmable commands. While a G key triggers a primary action, a secondary action can be triggered by pressing it while holding down the G-Shift button. Unfortunately, its location under my ring finger meant that I could not avoid inadvertently pressing it. Fortunately, you can simply unassign the G-Shift button, which leaves the mouse slightly crippled, but more usable.[2] The first row of buttons (in particular, the G10 key) is impossible for me to use. I invariably also press the left click or G-shift buttons.[3] Hyperspeed scrolling, a key feature of the G500, is not supported here. (I realize this isn't useful in a MMO, but I'd rather just have one mouse for all uses).Conclusion########This mouse looks very elegant, feels solid, and fits my hand well. Unfortunately, the above negatives were more than simply trivial annoyances, and I couldn't give it more than 3 stars (It's okay).Happy Mousing!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2012"}

U.\"  So far I'm glad that I did.  Mario and company are back in beautiful HD, and so far they are an absolute blast to play with.New Super Mario Bros. U is a treat beyond the updated graphics because they stick to tried and true formulas that have made 2D versions Mario so much fun over the years.  No, you won't get to enjoy a fully 3D environment like you did withSuper Mario 64.  You do get an enjoyable side-scrolling experience much like the previous generations of Super Mario for Wii, DS, and the early console systems.  Also much like recent versions of Mario you are presented with a map of the world and you get to decide how you're going to traverse the levels.In single-player mode Mario has a number of friends and power ups along for the ride.  You can still find old-school power ups like the red and green mushrooms, and the fire flower.  The blue ice flower also makes an appearance, as well as the new (to me, at least) flying squirrel Mario.  Flying squirrel Mario looks much like raccoon Mario did, except your winged arms give you the ability to glide through hairy situations in the game.Yoshi is there for you to ride through levels (pretty standard),and pink baby Yoshi is looking to be escorted through the world to find food.  Babysitting pink Yoshi sounds like kind of a pain at first, but when you carry pink Yoshi through the world you can inflate baby Yoshi into a giant balloon and sail across large distances.The GamePad controller is a bit under-utilized (seemingly not using features such as the camera or accelerometers), however the very basic screen mirroring that it does proves useful at times.  I don't have to bore my wife by having Mario take up valuable screen real estate.  Instead I can choose to start up and play the game using only the tablet while others in the room choose to watch something else on the big screen.  Here you get all of the benefits of a console game and a handheld at the same time.  Mario and friends look almost as good on the bright and vivid GamePad screen as they do on the big screen.New Super Mario Bros. U brings back many classic aspects of the franchise while adding a few new dynamics to keep things fresh.  I would recommend that any new Wii U owners pick up a copy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2012"}

The game was developed by SEGA which I found to be cool. Which now its becoming more common for the big N. Graphically F-Zero GX was one of the pretty Gamecube games that really stood out upon its release to the market. Interesting art style mixed with high quality grahpics. The vehicles are not the most detailed but they look good enough. In the sound department I have no complaints. It seems everything dealing with the sound from the music and special effects were a well coordinated effort. Gameplay is fast and fun. At times the game can be tough of a rediculous level. But this difficulty adds to some frustration but it also adds the depth of replayability. What this means is sure you are going to get frustrated at times but that frustration is either going to make you do one of two things. 1. throw your controller on the ground or 2. Keep trying and trying to get better. There is enough tracks on here and theres 3 cups in grand prix. Theres time attack,vs and one of the more unique is the story driven one which is a blast once you get underway. Theres quite a few modes for an arcade racer and I suggest you try all of them. All in all F-Zero GX is a solid effort of an aging franchise and granted this game came out back in 03 if I remember correctly it is still fun to play to this day. If you can withstand challenging gameplay your gonna fall in love with this title. I do not know if there will be a sequal on the Wii or not but I def. recommend this title for anyone with a Gamecube or a Wii.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2009"}

When it first came out, it automatically had great games to start off with, which normally a system doesn't bring in the good batch until a few months later.  This game, Contra III: The Alien Wars, is among the first batch of Super NES to be released into the market.  And how did this game turn out?  Nothing short than a gaming masterpiece.THE GOODContra brings back the elements of the original games, such as the \"one hit equals death\" aspect that many dislike, infinite ammunition and the variety of guns, and good ol' fashioned beatdown that can either be taken solo or you can bash your enemies with a friend in its two-player mode.  In addition to this, you have the ability to \"switch\" weapons using the L and R buttons and when you hold onto both, you fire each weapon simultaneously (you can have two different or identical weapons at a time).  In fact, if you wanted to keep the weapon, you can always select the other one in case.  Also, the graphics are quite good for the time period, but really, if you're a true gamer you could care less.The difficulty is a major point for me in the Contra series because the enemies keep coming at you and then at the end of each stage, you fight a humongous boss.

The game begins with Goku at Master Roshi's as he watches his son get kidnapped before his eyes. It's up to you, as Goku, to get your son back and that takes you to several places in the storyline. While not a lengthy RPG(it's a 10 hour trek), by any means, it does have its' moments. Yet, those moments are marred by the games' inability to be clear as to it's objectives to further progress through the game & the fact that the action in the game isn't as 'over-the-top' as the anime is. Considering it is an action-RPG, I figured the fighting would be done in a style similar to Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories but without the card- battle element and you'd have to do a button/directional pad combination to execute your special moves & a shoulder-button to charge up the move. Sadly, it wasn't like I envisioned it to be. On a side note, none of the games in the Legacy of Goku trilogy was like that. Still, despite its' uninspired and unclear gameplay, Dragonball Z fans will like this game. I did. The quest is enjoyable and the storyline is good.

The online multi-player is fun and very chaotic, but the experience is unbelievable. There are so many type of soldiers and weapons you can pick from; however you'll need to rank up to unlock different classes and weapons.The game comes with 8 maps, however you can increase it to 14 if you purchase the dlc (downloadable content)for this game. Most of of the new maps are good, but now Sony is offering a bundle map pack (Flash And Thunder, Steel & Titanium, and Napalm and Petrusite) for the price of two map packs. The latest map pack comes with two new weapons; there are a flamethrower in the Napalm map and a boltgun in the Petrusite which every player will try to fight to get their hands on them. I have to admit the flamethrower is one of the best addition to Killzone 2, because you can lit up anything on fire including your teammates. The boltgun is basically a staple gun, you can staple someone to the wall and it's a one shot kill. If you have not purchase of any of the maps, I recommend to purchase the map pack bundle via the PSN (Playstation Network store) to experience a plethora of replayability.As for 7.1 surround sound, where do i start, you feel you're right there in battle. I don't know if there are any other games on the market that offers this feature. It's outstanding when you can hear every bullet or explosion in battle. if you own a home theater system that is equip to handle 7.1 surround sound don't hesitate to buy this game.In regards of the campaign, I found it somewhat boring but if you want a challenge play the game on Elite difficulty (you'll need to beat the game first to unlock elite) because it's by far the hardest game to beat on the hardest difficulty in the First-Person-Shooter category (in my opinion). The AI soldiers in this game are very smart, they just don't stand there to be killed, they actually duck and cover, and seek you out to eliminate you. Be prepare to spend a lot of hours if you're seeking out to get every trophy in the campaign especially complete the game on elite difficulty.With that said, killzone2 is an excellent game but some FPS fans may disagree because they like to compare to other first-person-shooter games, such as the Call of Duty series. Killzone2 has it's own unique gameplay style--it should not be compared too. Once you get the hang of the game mechanics of the game you'll be addicted to play for long period of time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2009"}

Definitely the new standard","reviewText":"PSN ID GremDUDE. I played this game way back when it first came out and must say that it was an impressive game worth playing if you own a PS3. Never did a review for it so here goes. The positives include...1) Amazing photo realistic graphics. There are very few games which can even compete with Modern Warfare 1 or 2 but this one literally blows both of these games away. Awesome explosions, Helghan death animations are awesome. Great facial features(they are all ugly but remember this is not a beauty contest.)2) The first person cover system is very well implemented!! Why can't they do this in the Call of Duty games. It is a sticky cover system and it is so fun to pop and shot a helghast in the head!!3) Amazing guns which have great detail, kickass reload animations and great variety. I especially love the Electric gun. AWESOME. Shame you can only use that gun in one level.4) Very stable frame rate. Despite all the explosions going on on the screen, things never slow down during the action. There have been some complaints about the small freezes while saving checkpoints. These always happen before the action and never interfere with game play. Guess what? Gears of War 1 and 2 had the exact same thing and no one ever mentioned it!!! Xbots....5) Very epic story spanning and entire battle. Similar to Call of Duty games, you really feel like you are part of a huge comflict. THis was one of the problems with the first Killzone game. It really felt like a small conflict--mainly due to limitations with the hardware..Now the negatives1)Difficult level is kind of high. This game has 4 difficulty levels. I had it on the second level through the entire game and died a lot. The last battle in the palace, I had to lower the difficult level as I died 40 times. Makes no sense that you have an entire game where you use a great cover system which you cannot even use on that final battle on the balcony.2)Movement is kind of sluggish. If this game would have had the feel of Resistance 2 with these graphics and story, it would have been one of my favorite games of all time. As it is, you just move too damn slows sometimes and this just adds to the difficulty.3) Unlikeable characters with poor AI of team mates.. Rico is an absolute IDIOT who pisses me off more times that not. YOU are going to spend lots of time healing this moron as he just runs right into gunfire. His dialogue is dumb and he would not last 2 hours without getting shot in the head by one of his team mates!!4) No Cooperative mode? WHY? The entire game, you play with an AI partner with a couple exceptions. Co-op would have been awesome and really should be in all games these days.In conclusion, a game worth playing and a must buy if you love FPSs!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2010"}

For starters, they only put on four games, FOUR, & didn't even take the time to do it right. I've got rom versions of these that play better. Four 16-bit games & charge an arm & a leg. People bought into the scam because of the flashy case & booklet inside, which is sad. The content on this game disc amounts to 18MB. Wii uses 4.37GB discs, when it's Dual Layer, Wii discs hold up to 8GB. They could've slapped on the entire Mario collection from the NES all the way up to the GameCube & still have space to spare if they wanted. So why dog us with only what is actually ONE game, yes one. It sounds nice when they say 4 games but Mario All Stars was actually a Super Nintendo game. A game that came with these for games. So basically, you're paying over $50 US for ONE outdated cartridge game they slapped onto a CD. It's embarrassing. Die hard fans may wanna defend this but I know people with common sense get where I'm coming from. They could have made this a REAL collection & fully utilize the Wii's discs, but instead they do this. I can't support this...","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2012"}

It is incredibly fun, can be played co-op, and exposes players to all sorts of great music. Guitar Hero III ups the ante with even more fantastic songs plus a new battle mode for fun head to head gameplay!Once again you're a small time band starting off in your garage - or make that, your back yard. As you play through songs on your guitar controller, your career begins to take off. You make videos, play larger arenas, and earn money. The money lets you buy yourself new outfits and guitars. As you battle special players, you unlock their characters - like Slash from Guns 'N Roses.In every Guitar Hero game there have been songs I've liked and other songs I haven't liked. That's going to be true pretty much no matter who you are. They try their very best to provide a wide range of music to suit all guitar tastes, and they do an excellent job at it. Some of the songs are SUPER in this set and got me up off the couch dancing around while I played along.The new battle mode is a ton of fun. Before, you'd get a simple encore at the end of each set. This time you occasionally have to fight a newcomer for guitar supremacy. In battle mode you earn \"attacks\" that you can then lob at your opponent. These do things like break strings, make you play double notes, make your screen shake, and much more. It is super fun. Near the end of the game when you're down in \"Hades\", you have to battle the devil himself playing ... Devil went down to Georgia!There are of course the extras to unlock by doing things like playing 100 notes in a row, the ability to play against friends head to head locally, plus the new ability to play against others online! Talk about a true challenge! It was always scary enough looking at XBox Live and seeing how amazingly high some of those scores were. Imagine trying to play those people live?The graphics are great. Each location is fleshed out in fantastic detail, from the flickering flames of Hades to the glowing red lanterns of your back yard. The audience always seems a little robotic, but heck, how much do you want from a guitar game?Many of the songs are now original band-sung songs - including a Living Color song that the band re-recorded specifically for this game! There are still a collection of songs that are \"in the style of\" - some are good, some are really not so good. The Stevie Ray Vaughn song stands out as the not-so-good reproduction. Still, what can you do. Why aren't those bands giving the Guitar Hero guys permission to use their real tracks? Don't they know how immensely popular this game is?The wireless guitar controller and it's worked pretty flawlessly so far. We've noticed a tiny amount of 'misses' with the red button, but that may be us getting used to it, we'll have to see.Highly, highly recommended. It was so much fun that my boyfriend, a guitar player, would occasionally try to play the \"real notes\" rather than the Guitar Hero game notes. It really is absorbing!Make sure you get TWO guitars to go with it, so you can play with a friend!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2007"}

The kinetic worked like a charm and we had no problems with the voice commands or channel surfing.  I then tried SKYPE, the SNAP feature, and switching, and it all worked amazingly!With the XBOX ONE, i purchased RYSE (reviewed).  The graphics are awesome and smooth.  I also checked out some of the online titles and was amazed.  Like the first XBOX i bought, the titls were few and far between but what i have played, i am very pleased with this console.  With this bought Dead Raising 3 and i cannot say enough, it was smooth and amazing!  Great launch titles for the system to hold you over for the summer titles!on a side note, since all my games and XBOX Live arcade are on my old XBOX 360, i simply plugged my old 360 in to the TV output on the XBOX ONE and played that way.

Yes i had to remove the TV feature but its nothing more then swtiching the HDMI from 360 and TV.Overall, i had no issues with the XBOX ONE.  the media streaming works well.  The streaming movies from my Computer and XBOX ONE works flawlessly. if i am using the TV Feature, it works like a charm.  When using the 360 plugged in, i can play my old games through the XBOX ONE.  The games are amazing and look great on my 70&#34; TV and the future looks bright with the coming titles. The Kinetic is a big improvement as well from the last one!!! clearer picture, more precision, and works great!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2014"}

I personally like it better than Return to Castle Wolfenstein just because its so much more realistic.  No zombies or whatnot in this one.  The graphics could be a bit more refined but still they are very good.  I was reading some of the other reviews and I noticed people saying that lines were taken directly out of Saving Private Ryan from the d-day scene.  This is true.  In fact its almost funny how similar the d-day part is to the d-day part in Private Ryan.  Its not just the dialouge either, its also the events.  You reach the top of the beach, blow the shingles, go through, snipe the Germans hiding behind the sandbags (sound familiar?).I was dissapointed also with the lack of blood.  Blood and even dismemberment would have made this game so real.  It would have put you into world war II (..or saving private ryan).Graphics and gameplay aside, the sound is terrific.  I loved the effects and just switching weapons was a joy for me (I don't know why but I have a thing with sound effects and sound quality).

It claims loudly on the package that it has some new and easy way to install it.Installation was pretty easy, though the directions for the top filter (which I did first) are a bit obtuse. I actually gave up trying to figure it out and simply peeled the thing off, sticking it on the old-fashioned way. To the product's credit, this worked just fine. Following the directions does make it less likely you'll have to deal with air bubbles afterward, but it also means you have to tape it down pretty securely to make sure it stays aligned.The package includes a small square of cloth with which to clean dust off the screen and a piece of cardboard to press out bubbles if they do turn up. Whether you use this or another cleaning cloth, it's of course recommended you make sure the screens are totally dust-free first. When applied, the protectors essentially serve as an antiglare filter. It doesn't make the main or touchscreen any more visible from a bad angle, but it makes them a bit easier to view in bright light. With the protector applied, both screens have a distinct purplish hue when viewed at an angle. I suppose this product might also offer some protection against scratching, but from their thickness I'd say not a whole lot.I've also tried the screen protector made by ICON, and this one is a bit better. It has more space on the edges so it won't be a pain to fit it, and there's a hole for the camera. I also had less trouble getting rid of air bubbles with this one. On the other hand, it is also a LOT more expensive than any other protector on the market- and even some hard cases. I'm not sure if the ease of application and quality make it worth the price, seeing as how a hard case probably offers more protection and can be easily removed and reapplied.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2011"}

But the \"haunted house\" feel of the first game is missing here.  It is mostly an action game played in dark corridors.  In fact this game reminds more of the \"Fear\" shooter series of games than it does anything else.  Normal difficulty is perhaps easier than it should be. Just conserve your ammo, upgrade 2 guns and not all of them, and you'll be fine.  I really enjoyed paying it through, but there's way too many standard shooter \"corridor levels\" and that means one level starts to play like the level just before it. It lacks originality in level choices: I cannot believe we get a shopping mall level and an apartment complex level in an outer-space game!  Couldnt they have thought outside the box a bit more when coming up with level choices?  It doesnt help that the enemies are basically what you already encountered in the first game.Graphically there's _lots_ of volumetric fog effects used and it looks great and adds some spookiness to the levels.  But, in order to generate all of that nice fog, the developers clearly scaled back on other graphical niceties like bump-mapping and reflective surfaces.  Everything metallic for example looks dull and lifeless when there's enough light in the area to see the bitmaps.  This is a shame because DS1's bitmaps actually looked rather good even in lots of lighting.Definitely a solid game, but there's not one thing that stands out about it either. Not sure it is worth full price.  On sale it might be worth picking up.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2011"}

Perhaps in 2005, the game was something to be reckoned with (mostly from a graphics point of view), but everything else is fairly typical. The setting and story are uninteresting, and you're almost constantly under pressure to keep moving throughout the game... very seldom do you get the opportunity to explore and ENJOY the game - it's just a constant race to get to the end. On the plus side, the graphics are pretty good, as are the physics, and the game can be maxed out quite easily with today's computers.The first Half Life, while not as visual appealing had a very intriguing story and setting.

{"product_name":"B00FM5IY0Q","description":"","reviewerName":"ReToM7 \"Patrick\"","summary":"My favorite Xbox One game so far!","reviewText":"I realize the Xbox One is new, but I am going out there and saying that this game is my favorite game in a long while. As far as the Xbox One goes, I also have CoD: Ghosts, Forza 5, and NFS Rivals. All of those games look pretty, but this game just works for the next gen console.Everything about it is well done. I will start with my complaint, and that, like the other Dead Rising games, revolves around the time limit. I don't mind life bars for people you need to save or side quests as that makes sense. However, for a game that rewards exploration, you really don't have the time when you are trying to focus on beating the game.When this game trailer premiered, I was concerned that they were taking a light hearted zombie game and turning it into something much more serious. This grease monkey dude running through crowds void of humor had me scared. However, once you get in the game and see some of the customer weapons, psychos, dialogue, etc, you quickly realize that they just removed the cartoonish art from the game to make it grittier. I am a fan of that.The controls in the game are dead on. When you want to jump, you jump. When you want to roll, you roll. So often, games focus on graphics and content but forget that at the core of any game is the functionality of it all. Nothing is worse than looking at something that should be great but having no way to execute it because the controls blow. The camera can go a little askew from time to time when you are in a tight area, but it has never actually created an issue. I expect a certain amount of that with a 3D open world game anyway as you can ever only see 180-degrees of the world anyway.The combo weapons are great. Be prepared to utilize them frequently if you want to level up. Going on killing sprees with combo weapons is really the only want to level up. A good spree, even late in the levels, can net you almost a full level up in a few minutes. Without giving anything away, you will find some amazing combo weapons that will let you achieve long kill streaks. The special moves are easy (press B+Y when it appears on your screen) and will give you bonus experience (PP) when successful. I urge you to use this on the special zombies in the crowd (fire fighters, police, prisoners, etc) as they are worth extra PP and ALL zombies are one hit kills with special moves. The ability now to make combo weapons on the fly, as well as access any piece, part, prop, or combo weapon you pick up along the way from lockers, is awesome! If you are playing with friends, you can drop your weapons to them and they can pick up to add to their inventory. I also urge you to pick up everything you can as it will make it easier to build some of the combo weapons later in the game when that can of gasoline or battery is nowhere to be found.The story is fun. It's not great, but it's not bad. It's just a fun story with a few little twists. Nothing here will blow your mind, but it's entertaining enough. The side quests are worth doing as they are worth a lot of PP and generally pretty easy to accomplish. They will unlock new areas, reveal new weapons, and point you towards new safe houses.When you die, restart, or whatever you need to do... you get to keep everything you've worked so hard for. This is the best feature of Dead Rising 3. Given the fact that there are HUNDREDS of items, weapons, combo weapons, collectibles, and survivors, doing it all in one play through is going to be tough without a guide or prior knowledge.There are also different difficulty levels, which makes the game replayable.To sum it up: single player is fun, co-op is AWESOME!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2013"}

MacMahon","summary":"Playling Like An Offline MMO, Reckoning Misses the Point of Singleplayer","reviewText":"Have you ever looked at an MMO like World of Warcraft or Star Trek Online and thought \"I wish they could patch this so I could play it as a singleplayer game?\" Reckoning heard your pleas and decided to make a singleplayer RPG that feels just like an MMO but without the other people. Ends up that's not the best foundation for solo play.I've played pretty much everything that's called itself an RPG and released on the PC since Betrayal at Krondor. The best in the genre have always managed to combine a lot of different elements into a cohesive whole that overwhelms players with things to do, but also a drive to do them. Reckoning offers a pretty world, decent console-style combat and a ton of quests and lore. In the end though none of it ends up being that fun, and most of it feels tired and repetitive. I've heard games like Morrowind, Gothic 2 and Skyrim called \"fetch quests\" and \"hiking simulators\" but Reckoning is a whole new level of mundane tasks for mundane NPCs.It's a little extra disappointing because the lore and core story are both great twists and explorations of the fantasy genre. I really wanted to know more about the world and conflict, even as I found myself skipping dialogue for the first time ever in an RPG because it was so banal and monotone. The quest design, dialogue and world just copy and paste MMO design so much that there is no real immersive feeling or drive to continue on. There is no raiding at the end of the tunnel, the gear doesn't matter since there is no competition and the quests are easy. You're just grinding for... well, for nothing. It ruins a great world and great lore.On top of story, NPC and questing issues the game world is also a little flat. It's pretty a lot of the time, and I respect how colorful it is while most modern games obsessively focus on realism. At the same time though it is broken into small chunks, likely due to console RAM requirements, and even inside those open chunks it feels a lot like a bunch of hallways and repeated textures. The first 20-30 hours of the game can end up looking practically identical as you quest through an elf jungle with minor variation. It's a pretty world but not the best world to explore. Again it feels like a collection of MMO zones rather than a cohesive singleplayer RPG realm.The combat is very different from most PC RPGs. It feels more like a God of War or Devil May Cry, and this seems to be why the game's fanbase praises it. I was never much for these hack n' slash combo-driven action games however and while fun it didn't keep me playing in spite of all the other faults. Your experience might differ, I know people who love this game because it finally gave them an RPG experience with combat they enjoyed. It probably depends on the kinds of games you enjoy beforehand.The PC port is fine. Despite the console-style combat I actually found mouse and keyboard to be my preferred control method over my Xbox controller. It has a hotbar, fully customizable keys and the camera feels smooth and responsive with the mouse. The graphics options are fairly limited but the game still looks really nice, especially with AA forced through your GPU. The worst part of the visuals is how closely things can pop into view, something done because of low console memory that could have been extended on PC if they cared.One important thing to note is the game requires internet to work if you buy the DLC. Both DLC packs authenticate when you launch the game, which is common for Origin and EA, but unlike Mass Effect 3 and others I have played through Origin Reckoning's DLC needs to authenticate every single time, which is not possible if you're offline. The game will tell you it cannot load your save as it relies on DLC which has not been authenticated. I googled a lot and discovered this is a known issue EA are not fixing, so it basically makes the Origin version an always online game. The Steam version does not do this but the version here on Amazon is the Origin one.I personally had a two-star experience with Reckoning, playing for about 30 hours before the boredom got to be too much to bear and constantly annoyed by DLC server issues. I switched to another couple RPGs and instantly had more fun because of better designed worlds, quests and story moments. If combat is your focus however and you like console-style hack n' slash games, you might find Reckoning a lot more entertaining than I did.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2013"}

A decade has passed since the events of the first game, and the face of E.D.N. III has changed dramatically. Terraforming efforts have been successful and the ice has begun to melt, giving way to lush tropical jungles and harsh unforgiving deserts. Players will enter this new environment and follow the exploits of their own customized snow pirate on their quest to seize control of the changing planet.GameplayLost Planet 2, like the original game in the series, is a third-person shooter featuring huge boss battles, challenging terrain and the ability to pop in and out of battle mechs, known in-game as Vital Suits. The primary difference in gameplay this time around hinges on the inclusion of RPG gameplay elements. Players can now customize many of the aspects of their playable snow pirate, including his physical attributes, clothing and to a certain extent, weaponry and gestures. Players will control these customized heroes across 6 interconnected episodes, creating a truly unique and interactive experience that changes depending upon the actions of the players involved. With this concept, players will have the opportunity to engage in the story in a much more dynamic way as plot threads evolve from different players' perspectives.MultiplayerBeyond the deep single player mode,Lost Planet 2is loaded with extensive multiplayer modes and play options. This includes 16-player online versus action, as well as a 4-player online co-op support and two-player split-screen functionality in local co-op play. In addition, the intense and action packed campaign mode allows for 4-player online co-op play to clear mission objectives with friends, unlockable weapons and the ability to resurrect fallen comrades.Weaponry and GadgetsNo action game would be complete without an arsenal of weaponry, and to that endLost Planet 2comes loaded with a huge variety of hardware for players to unleash on unsuspecting enemies. Machine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers, lasers, sniper rifles, grenades and a host of other weapons are scattered across the game. However,Lost Planet 2's biggest weapons come on two legs: the heavily armed and armored robotic Vital Suits return in greater numbers and variety than the first game. There are Vital Suits that transform into other vehicles, and even some that hold up to three players and take multiple players to operate. Also, the grappling hooks that made the gameplay inLost Planeta true 3D experience are back, allowing gamers to gain tactical advantage by quickly scaling buildings.Key Features4-player Co-op Action- Team up to battle the giant Akrid in explosive 4-player cooperative play. Teamwork is the player's key to victory as team members are dependent on each other to succeed and survive.Split-screen Functionality- Share yourLost Planet 2adventure with a friend locally with split-screen co-op play.RPG Elements- In addition to RPG elements like character customization, and experience points, the single player game evolves based on players decisions and actions.Deep Level of Character Customization- Players will have hundreds of different ways to customize their look to truly help them define their character on the battlefield both online and offline.

My experience with it is limited to Co-op story mode only, however there is no way any other portion could be decent enough to redeem my opinion.My main gripe is control.  When your character is in mid-run animation, and you attempt to switch weapons, nothing happens.  You must first come to a standstill and then make the switch.  This doesn't happen every time, but probably 30%, which is enough to make it extremely frustrating.  For some reason you're equipped with a grappling hook in this game, the length of which is a whopping 10 feet.  This can only be fired at objects higher than you, not level, and results in you hanging on the the ledge awkardly.  You must then execute a perfect jump to land atop your planned destination, but still you might end up doing a backflip back to where you started.  The entire grappling hook gimmick was completely unnecessary. Sprinting is a copy-cat of the Gears of War \"roadie run\", except you cannot enter into cover or jump over obstacles, you know useful things to do when being shot at.  And speaking of cover, your only ability is to duck behind things by holding down (not clicking) the L3 button down (ooops but don't move it in a direction while doing so or you'll dash into the bullets).  Overall it feels like slow-motion.  Nothing is very responsive, and even without lag there seems to be a delay after button presses, or no response at all.The second reason I HATE this game is stupid/cheap AI.  The enemies will actually juggle you into the air.  Grenade after grenade will rain down, and since it takes you a good 3-4 seconds to recover, your character just blasts up into the air until dead.  The game is so bad that it allows enemies to get away with stupidity.  They hid behind explosive barrells, and as I approached they detonated them by trying to shoot me.  This resulted in only my death which the game deemed a \"suicide\".  Other countless levels feature the cliched oil rig/catwalk/steel walkway fortress, and you'll find yourself fortunate to locate a sniper rifle.  As you zoom in on the next area you'll be traversing, you find multiple enemies, standing around for target practice.  But wait, you shoot them right in the head and nothing happens!  That's because you haven't yet triggered the stupid event that sends them all swarming at you, basically rendering the sniper rifle useless.Last of all is the absolutely unintelligible storyline.  Yeah I know you don't always need a great story for a great game.  But this thing is BAD.  I don't know if something was lost in translation or if no one cared, but my co-worker and I beat the game and I cannot tell you if that was a good thing or bad.  I don't know what side we were on or who we were killing other than one level it was space humans and the next was crazy aliens.  The entire experience was just irritating: Sci-fi helicopters that look like flying dumpsters, lame timed button-pressing to force you to watch the ridiculous cut scenes, A TRAIN LEVEL??If I had to point out any positives, I guess I'd go with the graphics aren't terrible, the huge alien boss fights are challenging/interesting, and you can play split-screen co-op (which is the only reason we were playing).  Unfortunately, even the split-screen is pretty stupid. It's more like you each get a 4th of a screen, upper-left or lower-right, and the remainder is used as individual radar for each player.  We played on a 55\" hi-def television and it was difficult to see from 4-5 ft away.I simply would not recommend this game to anyone. It is in my top 5 for the worst I've played on PS3.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000G7PMXC","reviewerName":"J. W. Mullins","summary":"The best 360 game to date","reviewText":"Rainbow Six Vegas is, by far, the best and most realistic military shooter available on the Xbox 360. The realism is a hallmark of Tom Clancy games and it in top form in this title. The gear you are allowed to use is all current or based on what may be actually used in the near future. The weapons are all very good representations of their real world counterparts. And despite the great selection all of them seem to have their own feel and style to them. The reloading drill animations are spot on and you learn early in a tactical reload will save you a good amount of time over an empty reload.The story can be a bit cliche and predictable, but is very serviceable. And it is unlikely you are looking for a Clancy RPG anyway. But the ability you are given to customize your character and gear online has a very RPG approach to it. The online play is amazing and the different modes keeps it exciting and fresh. You are able to play through against the enemy AI with your buddies or go head on head against real players. I don't understand why all current shooter's don't have a coop mode. Even then few have one as good and as well thought out as RSV's. This game also has healthy Xbox Live support with several map packs and game modes being released for it.The graphics are great and the environments amazing. The environments are not completely destructible but you can cause enough damage to make it very believable. The computer AI is spot on and very tough at times, as is the dialog they use. It is also wonderful to find the AI for your squad members is also very good. I have been playing this game since its release date and it is still extremely fun. There have been a few FPS games released since then that are as good but none are better.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2007"}

I ended up buying this and theHORI screen protector, figuring I'd keep the nicer of the two.After a few infuriating moments with the Hori protector, I found the genuine Sony protector was the easiest to put on, and offers decent screen coverage (though not full-face coverage like the Hori).Initially, I thought that the protectors came with specks of dust already stuck on. Thankfully, it was just some air bubbles, and once the protector was on my Vita, the application was dust-free. The protectors come with an attached stencil that goes around the right side of your Vita, so alignment is really easy. (Though the Hori comes that way too, its size makes it difficult to apply.)Does it look great? Well, not exactly. Though, it does look intentional, almost like the bezel around the touchscreen on the NDS. The glare isn't any better or worse than if there was no protector on, and while it feels a little different than a naked Vita, it isn't nearly as rubbery as theZAGG invisibleSHIELD for Sony Playstation Vitaprotectors feel.At nearly ten bucks, I'm not sure I have the \"THIS IS THE BEST VALUE EVER!!1!!\" warm fuzzies going on, but you get two protectors, so it's an okay value.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2012"}

There aren't any generic Diablo characters here either - you don't just pick a pre-made warrior, sorcerer, or rogue and begin hacking away mindlessly at your foes. You get to fine tune so many aspects of your characters that just creating a party can take hours (and it's bloody good fun!). Despite the battle-oriented gameplay (which requires considerably more strategy and brainpower than anything in Diablo), this game is a pure RPG all the way. My only complaint (aside from the game actually ENDING eventually) is that the game design is somewhat linear. All the same, the game is masterful at hiding this fact, and indeed, this element keeps the story strong. Icewind Dale is a brilliant game. Period.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2002"}

Yet out of all of them, none of them has ever been as interactive as the Mario Party franchise. Since its debut for the Nintendo 64 back in 1998, it has arguably been a well-recognized institution that has still gotten better with age. The last one, Mario Party 6 was arguably one of the best editions ever, with the interactive voice recognition of the microphone to the mix. Now, the question that is asked is that could Nintendo develop a better Mario Party than before? Here is the answer.Mario Party 7 for the Nintendo Gamecube, really shows a whole lot of growth from the previous Mario Party games, by placing Mario and company into a imaginative around the world cruise, where each of the games are parodies of exotic locations like Windmillville for Holland, and the Grand Canal is to Venice, Italy. The game also highlights over 80 different mini-games like Take Me Ohm and Bubble Brawl and Tunnel Of Lava, and some of them by using as many as eight different players to the test. The game also has even more unlockables including 2 characters, Birdo and the return of Dry Bones who had a comeback with Mario Superstar Baseball recently, and unique games as well. Mario Party 7 also does do a whole lot more by placing nearly a dozen more games with the microphone to the test with memory and racing games to, as well which comes with the game, which people who've bought the previous Mario Party 6 know isn't a must but for those who didn't get it is.Yet, with all the improvements, there is one disadvantage to the test, and that is the solo mode. Unlike Mario Party 6 where the solo mode you could play all the different various games,you only have a limited number of games you can play with like the duel mini-games, the Bowser and Donkey Kong games, and the mic-games, which is unfortunate. Also, you have to tackle certain number of challenges which can be confusing to conquer and takes awhile, but it is worth the effort to play.All in all, Mario Party 7 is a premire title, and is really a must have for anybody who owns a Gamecube. Although this might be the last Mario Party for this system, considering Nintendo's interest in their upcoming revolution system, it truly is worth the effort of this dice.Graphics: A-Sound: B+Games: APrice: B+Fun & Enjoyment: A-Overall: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2005"}

Not only that, I can learn yoga and dance/exercise routines that I've been meaning to try out for years but never got around to. Now I can save time traveling to the gym, money (classes aren't free) and embarrassment! I knew I looked bad doing poses and steps, but seeing myself onscreen really drives the point home. I'm punching left when the onscreen boxing instructor is punching right.Upon starting, the Kinect analyses your body for user recognition and calorie calculation purposes. In yoga, it analyzes your limb configuration with a stick figure drawn over your onscreen image, telling you which parts of your body are in or out of alignment. When you've got it right, the white lines turn green, checkmarks accrue and there's glitter and sound effects everywhere up in the HUD. It's a great feedback mechanism and makes exercising feel more like a game instead of exercise. Nothing beats having a human fitness instructor guiding you, but this is about as close as it gets doing it in your own home. The body recognition technology is the most advanced one I've ever seen in a game. Most games just track where your hands, torso, and feet are, without regard to orientation of hands and feet, whether your fist is open or closed, etc. YSFE does it very well in yoga.There are plenty of exercises and activities to do, so this software is well worth the small cost. Think of all the money Americans waste on gimmicky get-slim-quick fads, pills, diets that don't work, and exercise equipment they never use. There's no secret to fitness and health: you have to eat right and move your body. YFSE lets you set goals and tracks your progress. It's a fun and engaging way to get fit. My only gripe with it is the load time between exercise programs. It takes maybe 20-30 seconds, but feels like an eternity. Also, it's not possible to end an exercise once it has started. You have to step out of the camera's viewbox and wait for the computer to say something like \"Hey, where are you going?\", then a menu option comes up to go back to the main menu. These are my minor complaints.I could not recommend this software more enthusiastically. It's an outstanding production and really refreshing to see so much value packed in here. A single session with a fitness coach at my gym costs this much.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00DBRM3G8","description":"","reviewerName":"Mark Twain  &#34;Steve&#34; \"Rumors of my dimise\"","summary":"No competition leads to these types of games","reviewText":"For some reason there are a ton of glitches/bugs in the game, that they never tested or just didn't care.  This is the first game in the series I've played so I can't compare it to other years.I only bought the game to unlock the real life shoes you get, and am relieved to trade it back in now that I did.For reference I played the My Career mode, on Pro difficulty.Biggest flaws:Passing - When you have the ball and a guy is wide open instead of passing to him it will pass into traffic or a guy double teamed.  To make it worse it charges you for a turnover when it gets intercepted.Layups-  You WILL miss 9 out of 10.  The only time you will make a layup is when you are wide open or on a fast break.  Even WNBA or High School players will make 9/10 of these shots not miss.CPU Alley Oops! - 5 or 6 times a game the computer will just do a random pass from the 3 point line to a guy for a dunk.  No way to defend it and if you try it you will fail 9/10 times.Shooting- Wide open and think you will score?  Think again.  While the computer nails 9/10 open shots you will be lucky to make half.  Even I can hit a better percent at the gym when no one is guarding me.  I have max shooting attributes and still miss tons of open shots even on the 2nd lowest difficulty rating.Cpu layups - Just like the alley oops 5 or 6 times a game the CPU will blow right past you and there's no way to defend it.  To make matters worse your teammates never help defend the basket.Steals-  9/10 times you try to steal the following happens:  1.  Foul 2. Deflect the ball out of bounds 3. Deflect the ball right back to them 4. Get a phantom kick ball violation.  I have max steal attribute and still this happens all the time.If you like NBA and basketball it's a decent game, otherwise stay clear because it's too frustrating.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0009Z3HXI","description":"Players wield the ultimate power as a rogue street cop in True Crime: New York City. Gamers assume the role of Marcus Reed, a former criminal turned cop, and use and abuse their authority to hunt down the murderer of Marcus' mentor while also cleaning up Manhattan neighborhoods from Harlem to Chinatown. Undercover investigations weave players through a murderous web of gangs and deceit as they battle crooks, Marcus' past and everything else the city throws at them.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"The Truth About True Crimes: New York City...","reviewText":"The only true crime here is the shoddy work done on this title.  True Crimes: Streets of LA was like many Grand Theft Auto rip offs.  Big city, plenty of running around to do.  Except instead of working for the mob or whatever, you're actually a cop.  It may not have been the best game, but it was a start.  Some of the mechanics weren't bad.  Some were actually fairly well done.  I guess one could only expect a sequel.  In hopes that True Crimes: New York City would be better, I seem to have had my hopes up.You play as Marcus Reed, a gangster who has just become a cop so he can clean up the streets of New York.  And as Marcus you'll take on the assignments given to you by the police department.  They're all pretty straightforward.  Each mission is divided into parts.  Each part consists of you gunning down all the thugs, and finding the bad guy.  Rinse and repeat.  The missions, like Streets of LA, are very simple and don't really call for any real strategy at all.  And the bad guys are as stereotypical as the main character himself.The game is pretty simple, and should you only do the missions, you'll complete it in fairly short time.  The same thing plagued the first True Crimes game, and I was hoping there would be an improvement here.  Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case.If you don't want to do the main mission though, there are alternatives.  Much like GTA there are side missions you can do.  You can street race, go off and stop other crimes, and you can frisk people for contraband, including drugs, obscene pictures, weapon parts, stolen license plates... and the list goes on.  You can either turn these things into the station for Career Points, which help your rank.There are five ranks in True Crimes 2, and they're all based on whether or not you're a good cop or a bad cop.  Unfortunately, there's nothing special about the ranking system until you become an extremely bad cop, and that will overall lower your ranking.Being a good cop simply means you've taken the proper precautions such as frisking your suspects, clipping them in cuffs and not killing anyone needlessly.  Bad cops are obtained the exact opposite way.  It's a lot easier to be a bad cop than a good cop, but it is still one of the points of True Crimes that sticks out as being plesant.  You just won't notice until you're an extremely bad cop, or an extremely good cop.The gameplay is simple.  You shoot or strike down your enemies to death.  You can lock on to them, but for some reason Marcus isn't always accurate in doing so.  You can also pick up weapons your enemies drop but there isn't much variety in them, and in the end you'll most likely find yourself picking them up because you're low on ammo in one weapon, so you need more.Melee combat isn't bad.  You'll probably only do it because it looks cool, but it's almost suicide in some cases.  You can pick up objects and lug them at your enemies and whatnot.  You can also snap their necks if you're good enough, or throw them up against the wall.  There's a lot of variety there.  Hey, you can even do it to random pedestrians, but it isn't much fun (especially when they, for whatever reason, don't die).The vehicles you drive around in are pretty realistic, based off of real cars, but you can't help but look at how messed up some of these mechanics are.  A slight tap on another car will send it flying into traffic, without a doubt.  It doesn't matter what the car is, it sends it out there!  You'll also run into a moment or two of floating cars, and that's another of many bugs this game has.There are more bugs than one can imagine.  For example, you may just randomly fall through the ground into eternal darkness.  You'll eventually die, but you'll wish you hadn't stepped on the crack when you do.  Some of the scripted moments for whatever reason just stop, cars changing colors... the list goes on and on and on.Surely the graphics will save this game right?  Naw, and if you think they do, something is seriously wrong with you.  This isn't up to the standards of this generation at all.  The character models are blockier than a cube of ice, and the framerate is terrible.  Every five seconds or so the game will freeze and then resume.  This very apparent when you're roaming the streets of New York.  In the indoor areas it's less frequent, but you'll lose several boss fights because of that.  The game freezes for that brief moment, but the action does not.  Not only that, but sometimes the sound will cut out.As far as the music goes, it really isn't too bad. You can rank your songs so that the ones you want to play actually play, and if there's a song you completely hate, you can rank it a zero and it'll never play.The voice acting isn't bad.  Christopher Walken lends his voice, but sometimes the celebrity voice actors feel like a waste.  Especially with the poorly written script.  Now, I can be a good sport about cusswords, but not when they're used as senselessly as this.  They come as sounding like little middle school kids saying these words just to \"be cool\" rather than to be serious or tough.Truthfully, I think this is a game that isn't worth getting.  Way too many bugs, the game is short, the dialogue is bad, is there really any reason to want to get ths game?  Even the graphics lack.  This isn't worth your time.  Even if you like True Crimes: Streets of LA this just isn't worth your time.The Good:+The sound, for what it's worth, isn't bad.The Bad:-Choppy graphics-Terrible framerate-Bad dialogue-Way too stereotypical-Way too many bugs to enjoyJust avoid it.  Not worth your time.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2005"}

However I had high expectations for this game because I had to wait so long for it to be released. In my opinion this game should have came out at least 2 years ago since it was in development for at least four years. I was really hoping to see a one player friendly versus mode like Soul Calibur 4 and Street Fighter 4 have. It turns out that you can only access the versus mode with another controller and you can't fight any computer opponent that you want at any time. I also thought that a computer vs. computer mode would also be nice but was lacking. But what I really wanted to have happen was to have a create your own character mode like in Soul Calibur 4. This would have been worth the long wait if it was put into the game. Being able to edit the existing characters is great and the depth of it especially in the scenario campaign mode is deep(similar to Soul Calibur 4 in some ways). There are at least 40 characters in the game. The fighting is very deep and there are a lot more combos to try to learn which is a great thing and should add lots of replay value to the game. The final boss is very cheap just like in other fighting games. He has these long range attacks that are hard to block and he is just too powerful overall. The scenario campaign mode is pretty cool too. I think it would have been better if ALL of the characters spoke in English however. The game also has a custom soundtrack feature which I thought was great and rare for a PS3 game. Just push the PS button lightly and then go to the music section and you should be able to access it. This is still a great game that all fighting game fans should at least try out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2009"}

As much as I love FFX-2 and really like so much of FFXII, to this day, I still feel Final Fantasy X is the last real Final Fantasy.  I have played just about every single Final Fantasy.  Not Final Fantasy XI since it's online and a couple off titles like Tactics Advance and Crystal Bearers for the WII.  But I am a HUGE Final Fantasy fan and love FF's VI through X-2 the most.  I'm not going to go into a too long detailed review but I have to mention some very important things.First, I have to completely disagree with what Amazon has in it's cons about little innovation.  That's so not true.  There's a lot of innovation and some things here I wish would return in future FF's.  The whole battle system with the CTB is so unique and never used in a FF before.  I love being able to use more strategy and use that CTB window to determine when the next enemy will attack and which character will go next depending on what I do in battle.  And being able to switch out characters in battle.  This was such a genius addition to the series after having the traditional turned based from FFI and the ATB from other FF's before FFX.  I really love the CTB and it wasn't used in enough games.  FFXII should have had the CTB as well.  It really needs to return for at least another true FF.  It's such a shame that it hasn't been used in FFXII or FFXIII.Which brings me to another point:  a lot of people are complaining about the random encounters and calling this boring which couldn't be further from the truth.  People just don't understand what Final Fantasy is supposed to be.  It's a RPG, NOT an action game series.  As much as I like FFXII, the removal of the traditional turned based system is a great downfall.  That's another thing that makes me love FFX and FFX-2 and how they are the last TRUE FF's.  They have that Final Fantasy feel that has been missing since when FFXI first appeared.But another main thing is the storyline in this game.  From the very opening credits, to the very last part with the Game Over screen, this game pulls you in and never lets up.  You feel joy, excitement, amazement, sorrow, sadness and so much more and you actually care about the characters.  It's more than just a game.  It's an experience.  It's like reading a book and watching a movie but it's not just that because mostly it's gameplay but you know what I mean.  You get so engrossed that you end up playing this game for days without even realizing it.  You want to know who Tidus is and where he came from.  You want to know if Yuna can save the world from 'Sin.'  And who or what is 'Sin' anyway?  That's for me to know and you to find out and much, much more.  This game has so much to offer and I love it so much, I'm on my 6th playthrough and counting.I'm just so amazed at the amazing graphics and voice acting too.  The chocobos are so cute and adorable and I love dodging lightning in the Thunder Plains.  Amazing caverns, swimming and battling underwater, riding chocobos, the gorgeous, GORGEOUS town of Guadosalem (you'll see what I mean when you get there) and the Farplane. The music is incredible.  So many different emotions you feel in the music alone.  I love this just as much as Final Fantasy VI through IX.  Please, please, experience FFX.  It's not just a game.

I do like the length of the cord but still, compared to ones without wires it feels slightly constricting to total freedom and movement within the room and house space. Though that is only a minor issue as its completely offset by the quality and clarity of sound coming from the headset. The various sound settings on PS3 and suggested ones provided in the instruction manual here led to an excellent experience when watching various Blu Ray anime on my PS3 as well as experiencing The Last of Us (PS3) in all of its excellent sound. I must say that game and the 13 hours of use with this headset, was a great experience. Somehow through the devices usage it was able to exactly simulate where the sounds were coming from in the game (versus just using my tv speakers) and led to an enhanced gameplay and ease of gameplay type of ordeal. I rather like this headset and will definitely use it for all of my gaming needs. For microphone use it works great and doesnt have the annoying buzz or hum that the official playstation 3 wireless headset has. Additionally it feels rather sturdy, fairly stylish (blue is a great color) and really comfortable compared to the Sony branded wireless headset (The Sony one always felt as if it would break if I was to lay down while listening to media on PS3 and what not).All in all PX22 is a great hedset and goes well with games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2013"}

Of the last three games (MM4 thru MM6), this is pretty much neck and neck with MM4 in terms of quality.  Good game, but it has that whole we've been here done that feeling that drags the whole enterprise down.  It's yet another remake with the same gameplay of the first MEGA MAN.The plotline of this one (like NES games really need plots, but I digress) is Proto Man has gone bad, set himself up as the new current megalomaniac trying to take over the world, and programmed eight robot masters to be evil (why is it always 8?)  Maybe Rincewind has a right to fear that number (sorry, Terry Prachet Discworld reference).  If the plot feels a little overfamiliar, that's  because it's the same as MM IV.  And just like MM IV, it turns out when you fight Proto Man that Dr Wiley was behind it all and you must fight him.You played the other Mega Man games.  You know the drill.  Select a robot master, see what weapon can beat him by beating other roboatmasters, beat all 8, proceed to Proto Man.Fortunately there aren't as many tired or rehashed ideas in Mega Man 5 as far as level design and bosses go, unlike Mega Man 6.  The Robot Masters are fairly original, especially Gravity Man, Napalm Man, and Charge Man.  Charge Man has a nice railroad themed level.  Crystal Man is a little like Gemini Man from III.  Still, the game's level design is pretty good for the NES.  Gravity Man and Star Man have fun stages, and they're pretty innovative for Mega Man.Another new feature of the game is each stage has one letter, which you must obtain to get the robotic bird Beat.  You need Beat to beat Dr Wiley at the end, because if you don't it'll be really hard.  The letters spell out MEGA MAN V, and they are part of the challenge of the game to get obtain them.  Trust me, when you get to the end battle, you'll be thankful you took the time to collect those eight letters.We also get a new an improved mega buster, even though when it is charging if you get hit you will lose the charge as well, which sucks royally.  We also get a new weapon called the Super Arrow, which is pretty cool as well.The challenge is up there. While not damn near impossible like the original MEGA MAN, MM5 has its fair share of challenging sections, but if you persist you will come to the end of the journey.There are some flaws in the title.  Capcom changed the Rush Coil, much to its detriment.  Passwords don't save everything, which really sucks. The Super Arrow is an interesting idea but not very well implemented.  The storyline is the same as IV.The biggest damage this game has caused is how it confused a lot of people about Proto Man.  They think he is evil, but is in fact a good guy.  Naturally, Dr Wiley is behind this, and the storyline is just like MM IV.Of the Fake Villain or Fake Bad Guy Trilogy, as I refer to Mega Man 4-6, this is pretty strong, and for oldschool platform fans there's a lot to recommend to Mega Man 5.  The real problem with Mega Man 4-6 is that everything it does, the first trilogy does better, and the first three games are a lot fresher, before Capcom drove the series into the ground with endless sequels.  MM5 is good, but only play it after you played the first three games.This is my order of Mega Man NES titles from best to worst.  II and III are the best, though I give a slight edge to II because this is the game that really redefined the Mega Man formula, but III is just as good.  IV and V are about the same as well, though neither approach the sublime quality of the first three.MEGA MAN IIMEGA MAN IIIMEGA MANMEGA MAN VMEGA MAN IVMEGA MAN VI.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2007"}

McBeth \"PSN/XLive/Steam: DirkPittSpawn\"","summary":"Close, but non-realistic, and Very Fun","reviewText":"Based on the other reviews you might think that this game is either great or horrible. I think it's actually a fun game to play and experience.The Single Player:The story is fun to play, yes it's missing that co-op option, but it's an interesting story that jumps from person to person's viewpoint with a couple of fun little encounters along the way.There is some leeway in playing (it is linear but you can stray a little from the parameters) but you have to remember some of the aspects are disturbing. Namely, sometimes you HAVE to hit a certain spot for the next part to advance (or automatically save). In other cases this certain spot will trigger the stop of the flow of endless enemies. This can be annoying because you have limited ammo and have to reach that \"checkpoint\" to stop the flow.The story can be completed in about two nights on \"Regular\"/Normal difficulty if you're like me and don't play straight through. So fairly short, but some fun missions to go back and try on \"Arcade.\" With the AC-130 Gunship and Ghillie suit missions being my personal faves.The Multiplayer:This may very well be the reason to get the game.I say this because of the many variants/options that can be exercised. The PERK system is a neat addition, allowing for you to customize the type of soldier you're sending out there.It may take a few games to unlock the other modes of gameplay, but once you do, you'll have plenty of options to pick from (not just Team Deathmatch and Free for All). The rank also unlocks weapons, perks, and challenges. The challenges allow for you to gain additional points (experience needed for rank) and are also fun to try and obtain. So many kills with a certain weapon, headshots w/ that weapon, etc. etc.It's true that the game does look good and plays well. Sometimes in multiplayer the connection is lost, but that is very rare. The Lobby for matchmaking can be frustrating at times trying to find an online game to join, but with a little patience it usually comes up with no problem and you're off in no time. (Update: with a recent update/patch to the game seems the wait time is even decreased for matchmaking)The Multiplayer portion is definitely the meat of this game. A shame that there aren't more maps, but the ones that they do have are pretty fun. A person can spend a LOT of time online.Try messing around with the \"Create a Class\" option, and set up a couple different profiles for you to pick from during an online game. This is where the choice of weapons and perks really comes in handy.For instance if you've unlocked the \"Dead Silence\" perk, you can couple that with a silencer on your weapon and the enemy won't see or hear you coming (until the UAV is enabled, but you can use the UAV Jamming perk to block it if you wish).Another really nice perk I'll mention-- just as another example-- is the \"Sleight of Hand\" for faster reloading times. This REALLY comes in handy for the LMGs that have a long reload time. But basically, customize your class the way you'd like. There are a lot of options once you've unlocked enough of the ranks to be able to utilize all the different weapons, weapon customizations, and perks.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2008"}

I had a one year love/hate relationship with MW2 - that game is so addicting, fun, and maddingly frustrating.  It was my first online multiplayer game ever (I've since gone back and played MW1; man, that was a gem!).  However, I was getting very annoyed with all the exploits of certain perks and attachments (you should know the ones I mean).  And the two overpriced and blah map packs further drove me away.But, after two months with Black Ops, I find that I'm being driven back to MW2.  Even as far back as MW1.  Yes, the perks and attachments are more balanced, but just not enough to overcome the game's flaws.  I find the graphics and colors to be dull and unexciting, the sounds underwhelming, and the physics engine/gameplay slow and boring.  And I've discovered that the pro versions of certain perks are those that frustrated me the most in MW2 (unlimited sprint and no damage falls).  Instead of eliminating the throwing knife, we get the tomahawk AND the ballistic knife.  Instead of eliminating the noob tube, we still have it and it's stealthier cousin the exploding crossbow bolts.  The list can go on and on.  Well, they did eventually nerf the panic knifing to bearable levels.  And then the problems with the matchmaking lobby, seemingly endless connection problems, and issues with playing with a party.  Granted, Treyarch is working on that, but couldn't they have released a fully operational product after SOME beta testing rather than sell us a beta product at full MSRP and have us suffer for a month or so?  It got so bad that I could not play BO even if I wanted to.  Another reason for going back to MW2.Bottom line, the formula came to this: BO=MW2a.  It's just an interative change from MW2, but with degraded gameplay, graphics, and sound.  Playing Black Ops seems more of a chore that I have to do to build up my perks (getting those pro versions are a real pain).  I play MW2 for fun.It's going to be a LONG 10 months before the next COD comes out.  If there will be one this year.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2011"}
{"product_name":"B007V9QKH0","description":"","reviewerName":"G. Denick","summary":"Fans of Golden Axe, rejoice!","reviewText":"I spent countless hours playing Golden Axe on my Sega Genesis when I was a kid in the 90s. I played it pretty much every day after school, and it got to the point where I could blow through the whole thing in under twenty minutes, achieve the A+++ ranking upon completion, and only lose one or two blocks of health during the entire campaign. So why did I keep playing it, long after I had mastered it? The game was outrageously fun, that's why.Dragon's Crown recaptures that type of fun for me perfectly. It's like Golden Axe, but with infinitely better graphics, sound, and most importantly: depth. Separating itself from the much older Golden Axe, your characters level in this game, they develop skills just like in any modern RPG, they acquire loot, and the techniques with which you combat the enemies continue to evolve as you become more experienced with how to play. Like Golden Axe, this game might seem like a mindless, button mashing brawler, but that's not true- for those who wish to develop their technique, this is a game that has oodles of depth and begs to be mastered by the devoted player. And, needless to say, nobody will be blowing through this game in twenty minutes - it's a lengthy, fascinating campaign.Also noteworthy is the variety available in the character class selection, which will add tons of replay value for people like me who love to play these types of games. I'm currently using the Amazon, who is awesome, but I look forward to developing an enormously powerful wizard, and experimenting with the other classes as well. Like Golden Axe, this game is FUN - it's just that simple. I don't know if younger players who have been raised on different genres will enjoy it, but for anybody who was a fan of brawlers and beat `em ups, Dragon's Crown is a dream come true.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2013"}
