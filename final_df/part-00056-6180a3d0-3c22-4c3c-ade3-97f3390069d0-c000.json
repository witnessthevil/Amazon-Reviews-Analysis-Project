I'm leaning towards 15 year old boys.It has a distinct Japanese pop culture flavor.  This librarian fox appeals to girls as well,as she floats like a butterfly, breaking stuff to reveal fairy-like witch ingredients used to concoct special items.There's a good old-fashioned Sonic influence, as you collect golden halo's from fallen enemies.Witch time (you move fast while they move slow) is a nice combat design, and gives you a much needed edge.There's a palpable element of time in Bayonetta.  While in witch time, you fear the abrupt end of being in it, but relishthe opportunity for invincible mayhem.  The boss fights are epic to say the least.  That's usually when I was forcedto use special items, such as health, invincibility and increased attack power.  The combat is pretty good, but I tendedto sthilleto my way through the game.  It's cool when dark magic (huge fists and boots) comes to play, crushing your enemies.The graphics are pretty good, and the frame rate's awesome.

If you don't know what that is, it's the huge black bars that run across the top & bottom of your screen while you're watching a DVD. This is due to the Wii lacking HD, so Nintendo tries to make up for it by scaling all their games in 16:9, which is retarded, because their console is a 4:3 piece of equipment. They made their console for SD TVs, but make their games for HD TVs. It's absurd because it's not like they make games with both 4:3 AND 16:9 compatibility (though it's easy to do), No lets through the aspect ratio for SD TVs right out the window even though those are the TVs our console is made for. Way to go Nintendo. No matter what the aspect ratio is, HD TV users never get the black bars, all they need to do is change to widescreen from the menu however, us SD TV users have to either suffer from the letter boxing or use a malformed version of the game by setting OUR SD TVs to 16:9. I'm fed up of it. ALL the biggest 1st party games are sucking because of this. Mario, Kirby, Donkey Kong, now they do it to Zelda. How am I suppose to enjoy my games like this? The writing is tiny as hell due to the letter boxing & strains the eye to see at times.For people complaining about the controls always needing calibrating, don't use an old model wiimote with the motion plus adjustment, get the new wii remote plus controllers that have the motion plus built into it. You'll have little to no problems at all. Besides that, this game is wonderful. Just some tiny bumps but it's alright. Still 5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2012"}

One thing is certain, in this city, you will learn how to run.","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Innovative Gameplay","reviewText":"Mirror's Edge is a fairly unique game that's all about the gameplay style. You are running, jumping, sliding, and moving towards a goal, no matter what the obstacles.A critical thing to understand here is that the start-up period of the game is ROUGH. You are expected to be able to wall-jump, balance on thin rails, jump over chasms, and do other challenging things. The controls are going to be hard to get used to. Don't give up. It could be frustrating. Stick at it, and give yourself time to get used to those controls. Keep working through the initial levels. The reward is well worth it.Once you become used to the controls, the game really becomes captivating. You're expected to race top speed through a variety of obstacle courses. You have to think on the fly, react instantly, and pay attention to clues. It draws your mind in to focus on the moment.You can replay levels to try different paths, to try to get a better speed, and simply to have fun. So even if you \"solve\" a level in one way, there are reasons to go back and replay them multiple times.This isn't a long, drawn out epic game that requires 80 hours of in depth juggling of stats and memorizing family trees. You can get through a complete start-to-finish run of the game in about ten hours. So you can learn all the basics in the game in a long weekend of playing - and then replay given levels that you love as you have time. So on one hand you can rent the game to see what it's like. If the gameplay is a style you adore, then you can keep replaying levels to your heart's content.I think it's important to mention two things.First, again, the start-up challenge is there. Some people will have issues making it through the first level or two. The controls are not \"natural\" for many players to master. Stick with it. Give yourself kudos for trying, and keep at it. It's well worth it.Second, if you get motion sick in games, this game might trigger it. There is a lot of fast movement, deep chasms, and swirling skies. So if you tend to be prone to those issues, you might want to try the game out first to see how well you do with it.So with those things said, this game has an enormous amount of fun to offer. Well recommended!Rating: 5/5I purchased this game with my own funds in order to do this review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2012"}

Rhodes","summary":"A Fun and Engaging Game","reviewText":"Zelda games are usually good.  And this time Nintendo has decided to put a spin on the series by making a game that is controlled entirely by the touch screen.  The result is a game that's good, but not perfect.  While it still has some pretty great elements, you can't help but wish you had a D-Pad option as well.Link and Tetra are hunting for a Ghost ship as the game begins.  The ship appears and Tetra boards it.  When something goes wrong, Link attempts to save her, but instead falls into the ocean.  He washes up on the shore of an island where a fairy named Ciela agrees to help him find Tetra.  He'll have to be prepared, though.  He's about to go on a long journey.Phantom Hourglass is a great addition to the Zelda library.  The story is a good one.  Carried out, of course, by dialog boxes.  Much like many of Nintendo's franchises, there isn't really any voice acting here.  Not a problem.  The presentation of the game is good enough.  Actually, in terms of bringing out 3D effects, this is probably one of the DS's best looking games to date.  There are moments where some things look a little pixilated, but it still looks good.  It doesn't play like the 3D adventures, however.  No matter how powerful the DS is, this game still plays similar to the other handheld games.  That is to say you're not in a 3D environment.  It's an overhead view of everything.  So it's not an entirely 3D world.The control scheme is what makes Phantom Hourglass such a unique experience.  The game is entirely touch screen oriented.  You'll use the stylus to lead Link around.  You can make him pick up pots and barrels by tapping on them and tapping on an empty section of the screen to throw them.  By tracing a quick ring on the screen you can make Link roll.Even better is swordplay and using items.  You'll tap on enemies to make Link stab them.  You can perform a horizontal slash by drawing a straight line.  You can perform a spinslash by drawing a quick circle around Link.  Even using items is put to good use.  You'll draw a path for the boomerang to follow when you throw it, for example.  You can make Link toss bombs to certain locations.  Using the bow and arrows has never been easier.A lot of the games challenge comes from the puzzles rather than the enemies, though.  The touch screen controls make taking out most enemies, including bosses, relatively easy.  The game may introduce a new mechanic but its entirely too easy to take advantage of.  Along those lines, the controls are sometimes a bit touchy.  It can be taxing to make Link roll, for example.  It can also be annoying when you do something you don't mean to do at all.  It's a pain when you want to make Link do one thing and he does something else.  So while the controls are good, they can be a bit touchy at times.During play, the map is displayed at the top at all times.  During play, you can bring it down and mark on it.  Throughout your journey characters will constantly be telling you where to go and show you on the map.  It helps to mark it.  It also helps when solving certain puzzles as well.All these controls are tight and intuitive, but they're not for everyone.  It's a shame Nintendo didn't put in the option to switch controls to the more traditional D-Pad and buttons.  There are some gamers, without a doubt, who would've loved to have this option.Phantom Hourglass is a great game.  The controls work well.  They can be touchy at times, and its a shame Nintendo didn't put in an option to change them up, but at least the end product is one that many Zelda fans will enjoy.Pros:+Good storyline+Fantastic graphics+Good music+Intuitive controls+Great dungeon designsCons:-There's no option to switch to the more traditional D-Pad and button controls-Sometimes the controls are quite touchy","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2007"}

Use the brand new Glyph attack system which has more than 100 different combinations to battle Dracula and his minions throughout 20 explorable areas. Take part in side quests and collect items to power up your character in the next great Castlevania game produced by Koji Igarashi.","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"Possibly, the best one of the Castlevania DS trilogy","reviewText":"Konami finally closes the trilogy of their best selling Castlevania games with Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia for the Nintendo DS. Released in 2008, it takes the best elements of the previous two games, brings a new story and main character to the table, retains the classic \"Metroidvania\" gameplay and tops it off with the usual bonus content to bring us, possibly the best one of the Castlevania DS trilogy. It's a great way to end the series on the DS and we all can't wait to see what's in store for the 3DS.Order of Ecclesia follows the new female main character out to defeat Dracula once and for all. Players who went through the previous 2 games know what means: new story (with twists), new castle, new side quests, new & classic enemies/bosses to defeat, collect and equip weapons, accessories & items and the ability to unlock bonus content within the game. Other than the new female main character, you can now collect \"glyphs\" (magic spells you absorb into yourself) and can mix and match two at a time to unleash special abilities to attack enemies or help you overcome obstacles. These glyphs can be obtained by defeating most enemies and bosses. As usual, your can save your progess in save rooms marked with a red square on the map screen.The PROS: With each new Castlevania DS game, there are bigger and better improvements seen and somehow, Order of Ecclesia boats better graphics and music than Portrait of Ruin. Playing as a female character is fun and the new castle/areas are huge and exactly what you want to see in a Castlevania game. The story comes with twists and the side quests return and completing them will net you money and extra items. The difficulty level is gradual and some bosses are harder than others; it's still as challenging as ever. As always, beating the game and fulfilling certain conditions lets you unlock bonus content in the form of extra game modes and a new playable character.The CONS: This game won't change the minds of those who stayed away from the handheld Castlevania games. As good as the game improved on everything here, making it the best Castlevania game on the DS, it's still more of the same which is fine for some people but not for others. While I like unlocking bonus content tucked into the game, it's nothing that you haven't seen before in Dawn of Sorrow and Portrait of Ruin. Hopefully, the 3DS iterations of future Castlevania games will shake things up even further.If you must pick one Castlevania DS title to play, it should be this one. If you have any interest in playing the Castlevania DS titles, start with Dawn of Sorrow and work your way up to Order of Ecclesia. It is clearly the cream of the crop and belongs in your DS library. What an excellent way to end the DS trilogy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2011"}

The story should have been better developed instead of focusing on all these dramatic unrealistic scenes. The individual character storyline is missing.Multiplayer Mode:Good: The new maps are bigger, tons of rooftops, with a bunch of new perks and killstreaks to unlock, which can keep folks pretty busy. New 3rd person mode, not for everyone, but something for everyone (I'm thinking Warhawk fans).Bad: Too many pop-up alerts when taking down opponents, it's a bit distracting and makes the game too arcade. The maps are better but the respawn spots still need work. The current set of maps seem to be better for snipers than everyone else who does not play that class.Spec Ops is a nice addition to all the game modes, plus there is split screen.The PS3 version seems to lag a bit on network connection issues. Games still end early much like COD4 with network issues. This would have been a better game if the mechanics like connections were ironed out. It seems like the network connection still does things like let you get taken out with a single shot while you unload an entire clip due to the lag.

The game has great graphics and runs smooth on a high end system. The game play is intense and visceral; it's hard not to get a gut wrenching feeling in the pit of your stomach when fighting your way through some of these levels. And as a FPS fan, I guess this is all you could ask for in this genre of game.In the single player version, this is a game of team co-operation (and even more so with every higher degree of difficulty); in fact you'll not get very far if you attempt to just go in with guns blazing. Some planning and patience are real assets for success in this game.The game has a lot to offer, for instance...1.)Some intense alley to alley, building to building, street fighting.2.)A couple of stealth and execute missions.3.) A couple of vehicle segments (in the air and on the ground), with use of your weapons.4.)You get to operate any of 3 different gun turrets on a hunter warplane using nighttime infrared vision. (this segment was a great deal of fun)5.)Many different weapons; several automatic rifles,  a  RPG launcher, anti-tank weapons, a sniper rifle, explosive charges and  an assortment of  grenades.6.)An excellent compass/distance indicator to help guide you in the right direction (it is easy to become disorientated (direction wise) in the heat of battle).7.)Enemy AI is fairly good; some stand up unprotected, but many do hide and use cover; level of game difficulty has an influence on this.8.)Unexpected events at the end of some levels, have an impact on levels to come; a nice change from your usual mission endings.A couple of minor concerns...1.)There were no player controlled game saves; game saves were automatically generated at specific spots (and some were far enough apart, to make it a real challenge to get to the next one).2.)If you wish to play the game again (i.e. on a different difficulty setting), then you have to go through the 'training' session again AND the entire opening movie/credits scene (which is tediously long) that begins a new game; I could find no way to skip these segments.Conclusion:COD 4 was a FPS that I really liked and I feel it easily qualifies for consideration for single player Game of the Year*. It has excellent graphics, audio and most importantly, game play. Also, the different types of missions really added a nice variety and balance to the game; you needed to use different combat techniques and skills to get through all levels and eventually finish this game. An all round excellent effort.  5+ Stars.*Other nominees for single player, 'Game of the Year' would be 'Bioshock' and 'Half-Life 2 episode 2'. Close contenders would be 'Timeshift' and 'STALKER-Chernobyl', followed by a more distant 'Crysis'","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2007"}

{"product_name":"B0030MQPQ8","description":"","reviewerName":"All Powerful Wizard Of Oz","summary":"If you are a fan of Tron this is a must buy and 3D review too.","reviewText":"Reading over the various reviews of this game both from critics and some of the reviews I've seen on Amazon I was hesitant to pick this game up. However due to the fact that I am a HUGE Tron fan I gave in to my inner child and decided to take a risk with this game and boy am I glad I did. This is the world of Tron!Now this is not like the game for PC called Tron 2.0 which in itself is a fantastic game. What this game is though is great mindless fun in taking place in the world of Tron and for me that is enough. The game looks fantastic and there is quite a bit of challenge in the game to keep me interested enough to want to progress to the next level to see what awaits me. For those who complain that there is no variation between levels is a silly statement IMO. It's pretty simple, if you're not into the world of Tron you will not be into this game as the world of Tron has a VERY distinct look to it and this game captures that spot on.Not once did I find myself bored with any of the missions and I think the way it fills in the gap of what happens post the original Tron movie to set up Tron Legacy is great. Very pleased with the story. And the light cycle parts of the game were mind blowing.As far as the 3D goes again, the critics are WAY off. One critic said he said he saw the main character in the game floating while playing and I will tell you that statement is utter BS. The 3D is spot on. In the options you can adjust the 3D to your liking and for me I set my 3D level to the highest depth possible and this really brought me into the game. Amazing 3D graphics and I did not notice any real downgrade.It's pretty simple this game is for the fans and not for the average gamer and while that may be a turn off and won't make Disney a lot of money on the game I applaud them in how they have handled this because for me this is a real tip of the hat to the fans of the original movie and great way to set up the sequel.Highly recommend for any real Tron fan.Do not recommend if you are not a fan of the first movie.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2010"}

I've played hundreds of `em. This one does not stack up and brings nothing innovative to the table. Button (trigger) mashing when you struggle with a Nazi for a gun a couple of times in the game is not a brilliant game innovation. It's a tiny little gimmick.PROS:- grenade catch and return is cool (although an exact grenade arc throwing system is not used). We've seen this happen in dozens of movies.- some minor ragdoll physics- no bad glitches or something that makes you consult the internet to see what the hell you are supposed to do- fairly good score- allows for subtitles- some decent mass firefights- some well-placed jeep/tank missions to break up the regular shooter monotony.CONS:- when I started playing, I thought I'd put in COD2. looks like many of the exact same bombed out farm houses. Just very derivative.- graphics are only mediocre despite what anyone else says. Colorless and lifeless. If you think this thing has the greatest graphics ever, you haven't played a lot of games. It simply doesn't. This game uses the rarely known, rarely used in-house developed NGL engine. Not an engine that is used in first or maybe even 2nd tier quality games.- character physics (movement) is a little jagged, not as fluid as in other FPS and other engines (Unreal3).- uses the INFINITE HEALTH system of COD2, Splinter Cell DA, GoW, R6Vegas, etc. Get shot a million times, move back, no problem.- annoying repetitious voice acting (JERRIES!!!) What is this Seinfeld?- cannot bypass cut-scenes. UNFORGIVABLE!- uses bad grenade throwing system that most next-gen games now use instead of an exact arc system.- AI = average to dumb, some guys stand there waiting to get shot.- game is so colorless it's hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys a lot of the time- vehicle driving is not the intuitive RTrigger = forward, LTrigger = reverse of all other games; it uses some moronic RTrigger = forward and then makes you press a button to go backward. NOT INTUITIVE!- no real upgrades or innovations from last title other than those previously mentioned- the WWII game genre is boring, overdone, oversaturated and tired so much to the point that it is one of the only genres that is routinely ridiculed (for example, by the folks at x-Play). It is done to death to capitalize and exploit the last good war the US fought in, which was so long ago (well over half a century) it has no bearing on the current political climate and dirty oil and strategic wars that the US currently fights in, nearly anyone that fought in it is dead, and none of the gen X'rs playing this game have any connection to it at all. The movie industry is no different; churning out 1 WWII film after another (Clint Eastwood even spewed out 2 in 1 year and people laud him for it). In other words, I'm saying it's an easy and convenient softball genre.My guess is that when EA's Medal of Honor: Airborne and more importantly, Ubi's squad-based FPS Brothers In Arms: Hell's Highway (both using Unreal3) are released, this title will be left in the dust.Give me the LAST-GEN Halo/Halo2, Doom3, Half-life2 any day of the week over this FPS. For military shooters, give me any Ubisoft title (GRAW, etc) over this. For historical shooters, I guess this is as good as it gets for now on the 360. You have to go into an alternate WWII/sci-fi genre and/or off this platform to get a good one (Resistance: Fall of Man for PS3).","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2007"}

If it's been a while then you might want to give Rayman Origins a try. For me this game brings back a lot of fond memories of a time when side-scrolling games ruled the consoles and controls were not overly complicated. At the same time though, this game has a pretty good amount of depth.Upon initially looking at the cover art it might be easy to dismiss this game thinking it's just cartoony and only kids would enjoy it, but there's a lot going on here! Rayman Origins has very beautiful graphics throughout. The art and level concepts really kept me wanting to see what was next. Each level brings something new and sometimes hilarious. Another standout feature of this game is how perfectly the music and sound effects match Rayman and his lovable team. Thankfully there are some challenging levels that test your'e ability and timing when it comes to running, jumping, floating and the occasional puzzle. The co-op feature is a blast and perfect for playing with my nine year old. Being able to drop in and out of the game without having to quit and go back to the main title screen really helps the experience.Having never played a Rayman game before I was a little hesitant to spend $49 on it. Especially this year when there has been a major game release almost every couple of weeks. I'm really glad I bought this game. Playing through the tons of levels has brought back my appreciation for games that do everything right. If you're looking for a fun game at the perfect price then you won't get much more value for your money than with Rayman Origins. 5/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2011"}

Also, using the stylus to fight with a screen that measures 5\"x6\" wasn't fun either. The stylus and my fingers were always in the way of the game screen, blocking my view of \"someting,\" so I couldn't see well enough to do things, and just like the Resident Evil series games, not being able to move and shoot at the same time is no fun at all.Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Wind Waker, and Twilight Princess are Zelda games that I really enjoyed playing, and I like using regular controlers to play video games. With the Nintendo DS, Wii, and Wii U game systems going in the direction of using a stylus and motion controllers, I guess the Zelda series is also going that direction too.

Planet Minigolf seems promising but the demo does not support the move while the full game does.  R.U.S.E is a promising RTS with full move functionality, Raquet Sports is an average Wii Tennis clone, Eyepet is a family oriented game that makes you point your camera at the floor my setup didn't want to cooperate with this one.  Kung Fu Rider is a decent crazy taxi/tony hawk downhill style title with fun move controls, but it seems overpriced.

The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance.

Footprints will be left in mud, for example, but only until it rains and then they will wash away. Lara's shirt will also get wet, and she's more likely to lose her grip if she is standing on a slippery, rain-soaked ledge. When the sun comes out, her shirt will dry and the slippery surfaces regain their friction.In Underworld, Lara also has a lot more flexibility in how she makes her way through a level, as there is often more than one way to get from here to there. She can now climb walls with texture and rocky outcroppings to reach areas she previously wouldn't have been able to access.All of these additions have been made to give the game a non-linear, open feel. Players can interactive with the environment by doing things they find to be intuitive, and the game will respond in an appropriate way. When Lara interacts with trees, for example, she will push aside leaves using either one or two hands depending on whether or not she's holding something. These details give a lifelike, immersive sensation to the game.New Melee Combat SystemUnderworld introduces a new melee combat system that requires players to strategically strike with offensive, defensive, and evasive maneuvers. Lara can now attack enemies with different punches, kicks, knees, and other acrobatic onslaughts. Items lying on the ground, such as poles that were previously walked on, can be picked up and swung at enemies. Players can also perform a greater variety of actions with weapons; for example, Lara can now hold onto a ledge with one hand and fire a gun with the other.Realistic Enemy and Animal AIThe AI in Tomb Raider: Underworld has also taken a big step forward--both enemies and animals now make independent decisions based on their surroundings, employ ambush and squad tactics when fighting, and will retreat if deemed necessary.With updated graphics and a more immersive and realistic gameplay, Tomb Raider: Underworld will have both fans and newcomers excited about the newest installment in this popular video game-pinup franchise.Tomb Raider: Underworld is loaded with a new melee combat system, various weapons, and smarter AI for both enemies and animals.","reviewerName":"Mohd Alabbasi \"Abbasi\"","summary":"No Regrets but could have been better!","reviewText":"Ok first of all I am a Tomb Raider fan and enjoy playing it very much.This is a good addition if are NOT looking for next gen gaming.I liked:- The sceneries of all the different places around the world.- Story.

Footprints will be left in mud, for example, but only until it rains and then they will wash away. Lara's shirt will also get wet, and she's more likely to lose her grip if she is standing on a slippery, rain-soaked ledge. When the sun comes out, her shirt will dry and the slippery surfaces regain their friction.In Underworld, Lara also has a lot more flexibility in how she makes her way through a level, as there is often more than one way to get from here to there. She can now climb walls with texture and rocky outcroppings to reach areas she previously wouldn't have been able to access.All of these additions have been made to give the game a non-linear, open feel. Players can interactive with the environment by doing things they find to be intuitive, and the game will respond in an appropriate way. When Lara interacts with trees, for example, she will push aside leaves using either one or two hands depending on whether or not she's holding something. These details give a lifelike, immersive sensation to the game.New Melee Combat SystemUnderworld introduces a new melee combat system that requires players to strategically strike with offensive, defensive, and evasive maneuvers. Lara can now attack enemies with different punches, kicks, knees, and other acrobatic onslaughts. Items lying on the ground, such as poles that were previously walked on, can be picked up and swung at enemies. Players can also perform a greater variety of actions with weapons; for example, Lara can now hold onto a ledge with one hand and fire a gun with the other.Realistic Enemy and Animal AIThe AI in Tomb Raider: Underworld has also taken a big step forward--both enemies and animals now make independent decisions based on their surroundings, employ ambush and squad tactics when fighting, and will retreat if deemed necessary.With updated graphics and a more immersive and realistic gameplay, Tomb Raider: Underworld will have both fans and newcomers excited about the newest installment in this popular video game-pinup franchise.Tomb Raider: Underworld is loaded with a new melee combat system, various weapons, and smarter AI for both enemies and animals.","reviewerName":"T. Soatthiamroong","summary":"Great ideas, but poorly executed","reviewText":"I just got the game today and played for a few hours. And these are my opinion on the game.Bad:- Environment collisions are bad. You could fall quite easily even from a simple ledge, due to bad collision detection. And you often bump into invisible walls, or even stuck on them, in stupid places that they shouldn't be there.- Animations look bad. The poses are alright, but timings and in-betweens are bad and too fast. I feel like watching a speedy Charlie Chaplin's film. Lara looks like a monkey when she does wall-climbing. And too-fast animations also cause very annoying errors in controling the character.-  Camera sucks. They make the camera follows Lara too much and track-in too fast. It could cause controling mistakes and a headache. Especially when you stand too close to environment collision, the camera will shake like crazy. I feel dizzy after playing for a few hours.- Combat system are pretty bad. The gunplay doesn't include cover system, which makes you take the bullets too much. Dodging moves don't help much because a lousy camera don't stay still, so you lose track of enemies very easily.Good:Well... it's Tomb Raider after all. That means the story and puzzles are still interesting enough to keep you playing, even with lousy controls and camera. The models, textures, shaders, and lighting look great.In conclusion:The developers tried to put new things to keep the series fresh. Unfortunately, they don't really work. On the other hand, the weak points destroy what made the past games in the series so great.I wouldn't recommend this one to anybody new to the series. Judging from this one, you might hate the entire series all together. Tomb Raider Legend and Anniversary are better than this one.For average fans, you might want to download the demo and try it first, or wait untill the price drop.For die-hard fans, well, it's still Tomb Raider. If you're dying to collect every Tomb Raider games, it might not be so bad for you. Just don't keep your hope up so high.Actually, I wanted to give it 3.5 stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2008"}

The basic gameplay - a first-person shooter with vehicle elements - is intact, albeit with some minor changes. These changes include new abilities (though only one can be \"equipped\" at a time), some new guns (most of which are functionally identical to older ones), and a few short sequences in helicopters or spaceships. Playing the actual basic game feels almost exactly like playing old Halo games, with basically the same weapons, vehicles, enemies, etc. Because it's a prequel, they couldn't really add anything substantial - not that this stopped them from putting in a few new guns and vehicles that never show up in later installments.One of the things that is, in a way, \"new\" is the customization of the main character. Previous Halo games have had customizable characters for multiplayer, starting with picking a color in Halo 1 and developing into different helmets, shoulderpads, and so on in Halo 3. In \"Reach\", the option has become available to pick a female Spartan (this option technically existed in Halo 3, but only affected the character's voice). In addition, the changes made to the model reflect in single-player, as well, since the Master Chief is no longer the main character.A lot of the multiplayer modes from Halo: ODST have been brought over, including the cooperative Firefight mode. Other than that, it seems to be the same mix of multiplayer modes found in previous games - deathmatch, CTF, and so on. It's not bad, but it's not really original, either. ODST at least tried to do some new things with the hub concept and so on. Halo: Reach is just a retread. While this might not be bad, necessarily, it just seems like a lot of effort to go to make a new game with no real new characteristics. Even the voice actors seem bored at this point; all their performances are flat and dull, with hardly any emotion put into it.There's an easy way to determine if Halo: Reach is a game that you, the consumer, will like. Did you like the previous games? Then you will like Halo: Reach. Did you dislike them? Then you will dislike Halo: Reach. It's almost more of an expansion than a new game. It's not a bad game in terms of design or graphics, but it's the same game as previous installments.Rating: 7/10.We purchased Halo Reach with our own money from a gaming store.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2010"}

{"product_name":"B004QEWVLC","description":"","reviewerName":"icomputered","summary":"So much fun!","reviewText":"As someone who is a fan of the GTA series, I went into this game thinking that it would a filler for my open world cravings until GTA V came out. But it turned out to be one of my favorite games of all time. I think it's worth noting that while this game and GTA games are similar in a lot of aspects (they both are open world games with stories involving criminals), they are also very different. GTA tries to remain somewhat serious, Saints Row the Third is just full on craziness.The story of the game takes place after SR2 in a new town called \"Steelport\". You're gang is now very famous, but the government and various other gangs are trying to take you down. From the beginning of the game you are thrown in crazy situations, from robbing a bank to stealing a penthouse. And throughout the game's story you will explore a futuristic computer world as a toilet, fight off zombies, go to mars, and so much more. Aside from the story there are also countless activities to take part of, from Tank Mayham (where you try to cause as much damage with your tank in a limited time) to my personal favorite Professor Genki's Ethical Fun time (a TV show where you have to survive hordes of enemies and earn a certain amount of money to win). There are also a lot of collectibles scattered through out the city which are very fun to find. Finding collectibles and participating in activities help you take over the different parts of the city from other gangs.This game has an immense amount of customization. You can create your character any way you want: male or female, black or white, fat or thin, strong or weak. You can even choose the voice acting from 7 different options (including a zombie voice). The character customization reminded me a lot of the Sims 3 character customization. Cars can also be customized to your liking. Most of the cars in the game can be taken to the car shop where you can choose the colors, tires, upgrades, etc. Cars save in your garage, so if you destroy a car you can just go back to the garage and retrieve it again. You can also customize your gang's style, the clothing you are wearing, the music that plays on the radio (the game has a wide variety of music) and the weapons you have. Lastly you can chose what your characters strengths and weaknesses are by earning \"respect\". \"Respect\" can be earned by completing activities, story missions and challenges. The \"respect\" can then be used to unlock upgrades, which you can then purchase. Upgrades include everything from health increases, to damage resistance, to more \"homies\" (or fellow gang members) fighting with you.On of my favorite parts of this game was the ability to take screenshots whenever you wanted. The screenshots then get uploaded to saintsrow.com, where you can view them and save them to your computer or share them with others. I loved this feature; it was so fun to take pictures of my character doing random, crazy things.There are some flaws with this game, however. Steelport is a rather bland town. Sure, it looks nice and the graphics are pretty good, but the majority of the town looks the same. It's easy to get lost because the houses look similar, the buildings look similar, and the stores look similar. The pedestrians don't really do much either, and you will see many of the same pedestrians over and over again. The games story is also a bit short, so don't expect to put a lot of time into this game unless you want to tackle all of the challenges and activities.Overall, if you like fun and over the top open world games, then Saints Row the Third is for you. The most important thing for a game to be fun, and boy is this game fun!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2012"}

This one comes from the designer of Final Fantasy Tactics,and his stamp can be seen all over this game. Still, to keep this review from waxingover long, I won't go into that here. Instead, I'll stick to the game itself.Is it a masterpiece? Most certainly. But is it FUN? That's always the issue with the FFseries, which has pretty much guided RPG's for the last 15 years, for good and bad.And all in all, yes, this is a fun outing. The battle system, which certainly differsfrom previous outings, works pretty well, in my opinion. Unfortunately, the encounterrate is far too high, and the frustration factor can really kick in (\"Why isn't heattacking who I want? Who turned off my gambits? Why is this freaking explosion trapright in front of a door, and why can't my characters get around it without my havingto remove them from my party?\"). I enjoy the fact that there is no transition fromfield map to battle screen, and I love being able to set up 10 or so independentcommands for my other party members to work on AI, but at the same time, I hate thefleeing mechanism (why do they need to take time to resheath their swords?), and ittakes so LONG to level at times.As for the story, I don't care for it. It is hard to feel any compassion or empathywith the main character, simply because his objective for the adventure is so obscuredand itis difficult to like any of the royals due to their stilted speech (it's likesomeone decided, \"Hey, people sounded cool in Lord of the Rings; let's carry that tothis game!). And as for the story itself, been there, done that. Final Fantasy 10 wasa nice change of pace, story-wise. Here, we return to Evil Empire taking over theland. Heck, I'm waiting for Golbez from FF2 to show up (many of the characters looklike him anyway).Moving around in the field is a chore as well. One may ride a chocobo, but if youwant to explore, this is NOT the way to go (you can only ride chocobos for a limitedtime, and then they leave you high and dry). Unfortunately, the field is so big, itis difficult to motivate yourself to search for, say, a hidden Esper or 10. Citieswould suffer from the same problem, except that one may teleport around cities byusing the Moogler (or whatever the heck they call it), so that experience is farpleasant.Of course, I gave this game 4 stars, so there must be something that I like. Indeed,the above are what I find to be the only bad points. Juxtapose that with the good(which includes a fantastic mini-game of hunting monsters, incredibly fun, anddifficult, boss fights, and for the first time, a sense of exploration that wassorely lacking in the other FF titles, particularly FF10, and ultimately you have awinner. In fact ,were this any other RPG title, it would knock my socks off. However,expectations for the FF titles runs high, and this one, while good, just doesn't seemto be of the caliber of past titles...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2006"}

Let's start with the good...1) I am a huge fan of what they did with the battles. A lot of people aren't. I appreciate that they tried to go in a completely different direction from the previous FF's. Setting up what you want your characters to do during battles was kind of fun and did take some thought. The hunts were fun but could get rather annoying and most of the time weren't worth the reward.2)Graphics were great. Slightly improved over FFX (my favorite FF and video game BTW). Some of the cities and areas are some of the best looking places and interesting places in all of video gaming IMO.DONEThe bad...here we go1) Oh my God this has to be the worst cast of characters ever to be created in any RPG. I kept hoping the main character would just die. He is the worst main character out of every final fantasy. He is completely and totally pointless. The rest of the characters were really bad but I kept hoping that one of them would kill him and take over as the main character. Any game that I have to play some pre-pubescent kid that just tags along with more important characters is not a good game. He was so bad, I used the same three people through the last half of the game, and he wasn't one of them. The only character more useless than Van was his little friend Penelo. The rest of the characters, to me the only one that was worth a crap was Balthier. He was witty and had some backstory to him. His playboy bunny fran, was the equivalent of FFX's Kimahri, but less interesting. Ashe was an attempt to copy Yuna, but instead of a good backstory and personality, just remove both and make her completely uninteresting. Basche was decent as the \"strong guy\" of the party, but still not that great. The enemy? Basically a human Seymour Guado with less style and once again, less interesting.2) The story? Where was it? Basically a hodge podge of people trying to overthrow the emporer who has invaded their country? That's it. No real plot twists, no real \"Oh man I didn't see that coming. Now I HAVE to finish the game to see what happens.\" I kept waiting...and waiting for a good plot twist. But no...Once again..disappointment. Want me to sum up the story for you? Country B invades Country A. Country B's emporer is killed by his son. Group of uninteresting people from country A unite to try and overthrow the new emporer. The party finds out about these rocks that augment your power and magic ability. The new emporer is using them and he goes kind of mad. Party is able to overthrow the emporer...Yep that's about it. Oh..and there are some box shaped God like creatures in here too that play a small role. Anyways, I found it to be similar to FF2 (which i consider the worst FF of all).3) Gameplay? A license board? Really? Talk about your carbon copy of FFX but removing everything good about it and replacing it with bad stuff. Talk about destroying the classic \"jobs\" that FF does so great. Once you get to a certain level/half way through the game, every character is basically identical. Need a mage? Put on a robe and give him/her a staff. Change your mind and want a warrior? Well give him/her some chain mail and a sword. This might sound cool but really it's not. Take Ashe, the princess. You might think \"hey she would be a natural white mage\" and you would give her a rod and a robe. But give her a sword and some armor and she is just as good as Basche \"the knight\" as a warrior. Give me a break. It's not realistic. No high and mighty princess is going to be able to cut someone up just as good as a Knight. Don't get me wrong. I know this is a game. But I do like a little realism in my games. The sidequests...all pointless and annoying except for the hunts. The hunts were cool but most of the time even those were not worth the effort. I can't even remember any of the sidequests and that should be evidence how bad and pointless they all were. I can still remember some of the awesome sidequests from FFX and IX and I played those before FFXII. The ultimate weapon was a spear...what the hell? The ultimate weapons are a huge factor for me and this one was a stupid spear? Bahh. Gilgamesh. He's in this one (I know he's been in others too). I'm a big Gilgy fan. I liked that they returned to the comical Gilgamesh (unlike the uber serious summon from FFX). But what was the point of fighting him? He was a hunt and I was so looking forward to fighting him the last time...but I didn't get anything for it? The strongest sword was a sunflower? There were so many cool things they could have done with this game, but they all just seemed like they were going somewhere then just stopped. The item creation thing had some potential but a lot of the items were just ridiculously hard to make.Overall, I almost suggest just not playing this game. That's hard for me to do since it is a FF and it's one of the numbered FF's and not just a spinoff. However, I think you should play it just to maybe get an idea of what they were trying to do. Also, it makes you appreciate the other FF's more. This game is basically for the person that wants something pretty to look at and be fooled into a game that has a story. It's basically FF's version of an FPS. No story. No character development. Pretty visuals. I can't say enough how much I hated this game. I'm really hoping 13 is a great game...or at least decent. Squeenix has a lot to salvage, especially since FFX was a homerun and this was...well..someone that shouldn't have even left their house and went to the ballpark.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2009"}

Not only will it provide you with countless hours of gameplay (well, actually about 120+ hours), the game remains interesting so that you will want to keep playing for those hours.  Plus, the game can be different each time you play, due to 'Houses', of which you may only join one per game.  This game has almost no guidelines.  You can kill who you want, take most of what you want, and go as far as you can see.  This is a game that had it cost $50 instead of $30, I still would have purchased.  The storyline of this game is intriguing, taking a whole new path, one not tread on by past games.  The graphics are good, but not something to write home about.  Sound effects are about the same as the graphics, average.  But what sets this game apart from otthers is the fun factor and replay value.  I have played through the game, and I would gladly play through it once more.Technically, this game does not have an end.  Once you beat the main quest, you are able to continue playing, performing freelance missions or whatever it is that you would like.

I recommend downloading the demo first from xbox live.  I did and boy it didn't disappoint.  I recently ordered the game from Amazon and I am glad I finally did!The gameplay is third person action.  Its set on Arkham Asylum (as the title explains).  You start out with the batarang and a few fight moves, but you have to \"find\" and earn his other gadgets, but the storyline and gameplay make it interesting.  You also have the Riddlers riddles to find throughout the entire game (240 of them which include find \"Question\" marks that unlock trophies, \"Paitent\" tape interviews, Puzzles, etc.) which will keep you going.  You earn points by finding riddles and completing tasks that allow you to apply towards the upgrades of gadgets and combos.  In fact the gadets coincide with finding additional riddles/puzzles because the new gadets allow you to explore new areas that you were unable to get to at first.  The developers also did well with storyline and integrating Batman's features, skills, and the villians into a long single player campaign.The game also has a Challenge mode which is separate from the single player mode where you are tasked to take on henchmen and preform certain combos or takedowns, etc to gain enough points to gain a medal.This game is well worth the time it will take.

You&rsquo;ll get a competitive advantage by hearing sound cues that youcan&rsquo;thear with speakers, such as the soft footsteps of an enemy sneaking up behind you, or the loading of a weapon far in the distance, regardless of the direction. By hearing sounds others can&rsquo;t - and by knowing where they&rsquo;re coming from - you&rsquo;ll react faster and take them out before they takeyouout.If you&rsquo;re serious about XBOX 360 gaming, get serious about the sound. Invest in an Ear Force X41 and experience the game the way it was meant to be heard. It will help you to become a better player and you&rsquo;ll have a lot more fun enjoying your XBOX 360.&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround Sound Technology!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Take your gaming to the next level by experiencing how your Xbox 360 was meant to be heard!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Enjoy late night gaming without disturbing others!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround SoundThe Ear Force X41 transmitter uses a 150MPS Digital Signal Processor (DSP) to deliver genuine Dolby Digital sound, Dolby Pro Logic IIx, and Dolby Headphone surround sound processing technologies - the industry-standard formats for encoding multi-channel sound in XBOX 360 games and DVD movies. The X41 uses the latest version of Dolby technology to create realistic game sound in 7.1 channels for improved surround sound accuracy.Dolby Pro Logic IIx and Stereo EnhancerThe X41 transmitter incorporates the latest Dolby Pro Logic IIx decoding system for surround sound realism from Dolby Pro Logic II encoded audio. When used with stereo sources, the Dolby Pro Logic Decoder also enhances the sound by spreading the stereo signal to provide a &ldquo;wider&rdquo; effect. This results in a richer, fuller sound than normal stereo - almost as if it originates from outside of the headphones.2.4GHz Wireless Digital RF TechnologyThe Ear Force X41 transmits game audio to the headset with an uncompressed wireless digital radio frequency (RF) signal to deliver CD-quality sound that rivals professional-grade wired headphones. Best of all, the wireless RF signal does not require &quot;line of sight&quot; to operate. That means you can stand anywhere near your XBOX 360 and hear a clear, noise-free signal.Chat Boost&nbsp;Dynamic Talkback&nbsp;ExpanderIf you&rsquo;ve ever had trouble hearing teammates on XBOX LIVE when the game action heats up, then you know how frustrating it can be when you have to keep adjusting the chat volume. Chat Boost fixes this problem by automatically adjusting the XBOX Live chat level when the game gets louder, so chat from teammates isn't lost in the exciting parts of your game. As the game sound gets louder, Chat Boost turns up the chat volume automatically so you can still hear what everyone is saying.It's a simple solution to an annoying problem, and it all happens automatically - so you don't have to adjust anything!Microphone MonitoringIt's hard to hear yourself speak when a headset is covering your ears. The X41 corrects this annoyance with its microphone monitoring feature. The X41 adds a portion of the microphone signal into the headset signal, so you can hear a portion of your voice along with incoming chat and game audio. Microphone monitoring not only prevents you from talking too loud or accidentally yelling into the mic, it also eliminates that annoying &quot;clogged ears&quot; feeling when talking while the headset is covering your ears.Bass BoostThe X41 headset DSP also lets you turn on a Bass Boost feature that produces deep, rich bass tones by increasing the volume of low frequency sounds - just like turning up the volume on the sub-woofer on your home theater system. Bass Boost improves your gaming experience by kicking-up the sound level of explosions, gun shots and other deep-bass sound effects, making them even more dramatic.Wired Headphone ConnectionThe X41 transmitter includes a headphone output jack with volume control to connect an optional pair of wired headphones in addition to the wireless X41 headset. This jack outputs the same high-quality Dolby Headphone 7.1 surround sound that&rsquo;s being transmitted to the wireless X41 headset, which allows two people to hear the game sound at the same time.Independent Chat/Game VolumesSeparate volume controls let you adjust the game and chat levels individually, so you can easily balance them and never have to worry about missing a cue from your teammates.Advanced Battery Booster CircuitryThe X41 has a &ldquo;battery booster&rdquo; circuit that squeezes every last bit of power from the batteries and assures high quality sound until they&rsquo;re completely dead. This allows a pair of AAA Alkaline batteries to last for as long as 25 straight hours of game play. You can also buy standard rechargeable batteries in place of Alkaline batteries.Powered By USBThe transmitter is powered by a single USB port on your XBOX, or from a nearby PC or laptop. So there is no need to fuss with a separate AC power adapter.","reviewerName":"Michael Laferriere","summary":"A good alternative for those who don't want to or can't set up a true 5.1 system","reviewText":"I have been using this head set since purchasing not only for playing video games on the Xbox but also for watching movies on my PS3's bluray. The sound while not loud does certainly have a 'spatial' aspect to it unlike a traditional headset. It takes some getting used to but after a few days you will easily be able to hear footsteps behind or to the sides of you when playing first person shooter games or race cars about to bump into you when playing Gran Turismo.The device's transmitter uses a TOSlink (S/PDIF, optical digital audio etc.) connector so it should work with any device that has this output. It also has an optical pass thru port so that you can place it in line between your player or game device and audio receiver/amp. You may have to tweak some of the settings on the PS3 audio out to block settings that are incompatible with this device. I have tried it on the Xbox 360 (original 360's without an optical out will require aadapter), PS3 and a Sony DVD player without issue other than having to lock out a few formats on the PS3 audio out.The microphone will only work on the Xbox as it is a mini plug which fits into the Xbox controller. It will likely be useable on a PC that has an optical audio out and mic jack however.The biggest issue is more of an annoyance as when the batterys go dead you won't get a warning. The sound may pop once or twice (same as the occasional wifi or cordless phone interference) and then go dead. It also seems to know when the least convenient time for this to happen is as well. If you are playing an fps game with a good group you can however keep a pair of AAA batterys near by and just switch between rounds.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2014"}

Same thing happened when i played the first five minutes of Ratchet and Clank 2 back in it's glorious PS2 days.  Its a very lovely experience when the studio has taken a really good game and perfected it with the look and controls of the sequel.The pacing on Killzone 3 is perfect.  This game is the best FPS on the PS3.  Dare I say I prefer it to any Halo game then I dare nay I mightily say yes it is.  But that's just my preference.All told I think the campaign on easy setting for me lasted a tad under 3 hours; or maybe 4-my addition is suspect.  But it's plenty good for me.  The missions are very innovative and diverse throughout.And I loved the Space Nazi's story.  The whole Helghast vs Vekta universe is fascinating to me.  But during the Killzone 2 experience I didn't really care for the actual story though the Helghast characters were a blast.  Maybe that game was just too dirty, concrete-y and dark/grey, gritty for me.  This game really POPS POPS POPS with colors and fun places that aren't just repetitive corridors in darkened buildings/warehouses like Killzone 2.And the guns-unlike the last game I could hone in rather quickly on an enemy, get off a few quick shots and kill them.  The Killzone 2 guns had horrible recoil and took half a clip to put down a Helghast dude.Of the great PS3 exclusives I say I'm putting this right up near the top.  The PS3 exclusives really delivered in amazing ways throughout.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2013"}

In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead.

As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system.

{"product_name":"B000ZKDOV2","reviewerName":"Vynny \"Vynrod\"","summary":"So close to being perfect","reviewText":"Saints Row 1 had many of the ingredients needed to 'beat' the GTA franchise; more cars, more variety, more fun and I especially liked the unique activities (insurance fraud was my favorite). But it didn't have everything; it didn't have the unique jumps, the stats, the planes, bikes, huge playable area and so on and in my opinion just missed the mark of greatness.SR2 addresses a lot of that and it's great to see bigger and better and more varied activities along with a much bigger sandbox and considerably more vehicles. Add to all that you also get the diversions - kind of like mini activities, they're simply things you can do any time without going anywhere to start it off - car surfing, base jumping etc. In fact, I've only completed 4 missions so far with 11% of the game completed, but I've being playing for nearly 20 hours, bumming around jumping off buildings with my parachute, wheeling, flying, stunt riding. Since the entire area is available to you off the bat, the missions aren't initially as important as they are in GTA.SR2 also employs a stat system similar to the Burnout range - getting a near miss, bike flips, multiple pile-ups, headshots or driving on the wrong side of the road gives you gold stars and can reward you with clothing, permanent reduced damage, better accuracy and so on. The game encourages you to have fun going crazy as every rotation, flip, and angle of a crash is recorded and displayed on screen. Even being thrown through the windshield during a high-speed crash can garner extra bonuses! In fact, pretty much anything you do in the game results in these stars. Unique jumps are also included, although you only have to find them, whereas in GTA you have to perform them well.So really SR2 should beat GTA IV as the car-jacking sandbox game of the year right? Well, despite it being massive amounts of fun, with more to do than ever before (more than any GTA title) there's a couple of very important problems with SR2.Firstly, the graphics aren't very good by today's standards, and by the standard set by GTA. It looks strangely washed out and flat during the day and boring at night. The level of detail isn't any higher than SR1 (which came out three years ago), and putting in SR2 into your 360 right after playing GTA IV is a big step down.Secondly, and this is the biggest sticking point I have with the game... the physics. You're simply spoiled by the engine in GTA IV. Walking through a crowd of peds in SR2 is like hitting trees and the basic ragdoll of your main character is no better than the first game. In other words it's kind of lame. The killer though is the car handling. I get the feeling the programmers looked at GTA IV and its 180 spin outs when taking turns and said 'let's get rid of that', leaving you with very wooden, on-the-rails handling. Seriously the cars can turn 90 degrees on the spot and the bike handling is bizarrely bad. The driving mechanics in SR2 is worse than SR1 - gone is the real-feel of driving only to be replaced by crude, unrealistic motion. Come on, you spend a lot of time in vehicles in this game and sure GTA IV's cornering could be frustrating, but some semblance of realism is vital. And in SR2 it's obviously missing.So I love the stuff you can do, the variety, the stats and I embrace the character creation and ultimately the game is a great deal of fun. But the car handling ruins any chance of this game being anything close to a GTA killer. Shame.*** Additional *** Since I wrote the above review I've put in around 40 hours on SR2 with over 50% completion. I still stand by my comments on the graphics and car handling - in fact I noticed exactly what is wrong with the driving aspect; it's digital. Gas is on or off, as is the brake. Sure you can configure the controller to use the left and right trigger buttons to accelerate and brake, but the car/bike/plane is still being propelled digitally. It's a major issue for me in terms of control and so that's still bad.But the reason for this update is to say how much I'm enjoying this game. The missions are massively varied - you take hostages, steal cars using tow trucks, take out farms from the miniguns of helicopters, get into brawls, and so on. The missions are a joy in SR2 and make GTA IV's \"drive to location X and kill guy Y\" look positively boring. And man - missions checkpoints! Yes! Love it!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2008"}

Theres an appearance by a weird Darth Maul esque Locust, and a new species of Imulsion eating creature that also fight the Locust, as well as a few new characters which are shuffled around with a little to much speed.The problem, and really the only problem, is that this is by and large Gears of War version 2.0, or better yet, Gears of War Episode 2. Theres not enough new material to justify the full price. Sure theres some new toys and skins, and the storyline is gripping, it has plot holes you can drive a 20-meter wide worm through, and WTF moments abound during some of the explanation, but otherwise, the game is a rehash of encounter by encounter fights we all know and love. Again, this is not to say the game isn't fun, it is, but its all more of the same. Theres no new sequences like we've gotten from Half-Life, no interesting new game mechanic to change it up any, and while the levels are pretty, some have a problem with flow, and theres that nagging feeling of repetition.All told, it plays good and it looks good, but has a faint overarching taste of bland and uninspired. I didn't go into this expecting revolution, and there wasn't any, but there was a genuinely fun game that can kill quite a few hours, but the difficulties been ramped down and the story is starting to grind. While being kept in the dark is a good way to stretch out a good plot and keep players interested, keeping the player totally blind gives a feeling of annoyed helplessness, rather than the overwhelmed feeling they were able to create in the first installment.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2008"}

And while your ears are ringing, a new Splatterkill System lets you get your hands bloody!Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"Steven Herring","summary":"A Fun, Gory, and Flawed Ride.","reviewText":"Splatterhouse came out to mixed reviews. I can't say that I disagree with them but they were a little too harsh as overall it is a fun, gory, and exciting experience.  Let's start with the bad first. The combat does get a little monotonous from time to time. Every room must be cleared like the room before and the room before that. This gets to be a little boring after a few hours. Yes there are weapons but they are few and far between. You rely on some combos and the masks rage power to defeat your foes. You unlock new abilities but they are not that diverse and are basic attacks nothing exciting. Though I loved the Mask's rage ability.Another weakness is the story. Though the game comes out of the gate quickly the story doesn't. It takes most of the game just to find out what happened to Rick that he needed the mask in the first place. I thought the story would drive this game but you only get some brief instances of good storytelling just a lot of stalling most of the game.  And to top it off it ends on a cliffhanger. The final weakness is the last mission. I won't give anything away but it is a protection mission. You have to protect someone for a certain amount of time. I always hated missions like this and putting it at the end simply left a bad taste in my mouth.Now onto the good parts of the game. The controls are tight and you always have great control over Rick. Another great part of the game is the boss battles. Yes they are a bit simple once you get down the pattern but they are epic. The graphics are well done throughout as well. The cutscenes especially look very nice. The regular game play has a comic like drawn affect that works well for the feel of the game. Oh yeah and did I mention this game is really gory. It's a bloody game that screams for and receives an M rating.  There are also side scrolling missions that harkens back to the classic splatterhouse games of old. Not to mention there are some interesting platforming sequences that add some variety to the campaign along with diverse level environments to keep you visually stimulated.There are collectibles to pick up such as journals and photos of Jennifer scattered throughout the game. They are fun to find and Jen leaves naked photos of herself all over the place for anyone to find. Also when you beat the game you unlock all three of the original Splatterhouse games which is an awesome inclusion.Overall Splatterhouse is an exciting ride but not perfect. It is worth the reduced price it is now offered for. After all it includes the original three games to play on your PS3. I wish the story had been better and the combat more varied but in the end I enjoyed myself and towards the end I could not put the controller down.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005B8G1","description":"The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

Yes, the plot is stereotypical, the quests all similar, the puzzles highly repetitive -- and yet somehow it works brilliantly.  I particularly enjoy the spell-casting aspects of the gameplay, as well as the \"side games\" (more Bejeweled variants) to upgrade your mount or learn new spells.

It's not a console port, so expect to make your GPU really work for it. My GeForce GTS 250 couldn't handle this game on max settings, which was a first, not counting Amnesia: The Dark Descent, which is probably the ugliest game to feature a million different special effects, still be ugly and have a horrible frame-rate (very scary game, though; just bad graphics).GameplayThe battle system is much improved over the first game: no more awkward button-timing. The prevalence of ingredients for crafting returns, however, and you will often have to drop items to make room for the next item. It is very annoying. I am aware that this genre is known for this, but that fact doesn't make it a good thing, or even acceptable. Let's think outside the boundaries of genre stereotypes and conventions. Devs need to either increase the inventory limit, or decrease the amount of annoying little items that you don't need. Also I beat the game in 20 hours. I thought about replaying the game, but thinking about the annoying item-management in the game prevented me from doing so.StoryThere are a lot of proper nouns thrown around: one thing I hate about fantasy fiction. The plot is fairly good, with requisite twists and turns. The best thing about this game, besides the graphics, is the ability to choose your own adventure. You can choose whether to kill someone or not, etc. and get 16 different endings.Sexual ContentThere is full-frontal and posterior female nudity, however only topless male nudity, as well as implied heterosexual intercourse in various positions (nothing more graphic than an R-rated movie).Closing ThoughtsThis game draws you in with some of the best graphics out right now. Everything has been improved in this sequel, however it has some ways to go before it becomes the best fantasy RPG on the market. I think it can get there one day; perhaps in Witcher 4 or 5.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2011"}

Cor Bliemy!  People who love games with lots of hours with things to do are gonna have a ball(Well, it might be shorter for people, I spent like 32 hours finding mini-Medals, looking for monsters, and leveling up.-When you have trouble it's cool to have you crew tell you stuff you might be able to use-The monster arena is nice while it lasts-Side quests can be really helpful(One can give you the abiliy to ride a sabercat, and it's about 4x the walking speed)-Nice set of fighting characters:--Hero(Nothing really interesting)--Yangus(The oversised bandit who can put out a bit of laughs)--Jessica(well, Va, Va, Voom, is how someone mentioned her as, meaning she's just plain out hot, and she can change costumes)--Angelo(The pimp, just like Jessicas beauty is needed in RPGs, every RPG needs a ladies man)-Setting skills and stuff is pretty cool-Everyone has their own personal skills, I like hero's because Omniheal is freakin' sweet, and Jessica's because he can charm an enemy.-Phsycing up is very handy on boss fights(Cept fpr the ones who use waves of Ice)-I love zoom(It helps out with traveling to previous place a whole lot)-The alchemy pot is nice after grabbing some recipies-After completing the game you can enter new dungouns with your completed game data(Ah, just like Radiata Stories)-This game is a must for any RPG fanCons:-I can't stand that the best way to level up to to fight slimey piles of metal, who are hard to penetrate, and most likely rin off during the first turn(The huge ones give away more EXP than 2 bosses would, and I mean near final bosses)-When you need weapons that cost around over 20,000 gold, and regular enemies offer around 100-200 gold, it can be a mojor drag(Unless you fight gold golems, but they aren't always promised to show up)-I hate going to a church everytime to save(No more save points in front of bosses, that sucks)-I hate going back to a previous dungen, and Yangus says there's one piece of treausre left, and it happens to be a map-The casino sux mad bootie crack!(What casino doesn't have blackjack or poker.  That really blows)-I wish there was more interaction with the characters(Too much of random other people talking, random fights, and not enough voices from your party talking)Neutral:-balancing weapons is cool, but after finding all 110 mini medals and finding out flails of destruction is a good weapon, it makes me a little mad that I didn't upgrade fistcuffs for Yanghus-If only Red could be a member(She's hot, sexy, bad additude, but she pissed me off on one or 2 ocasions, and fighting isn't her cup of tea.  Sad-Hero is sort of a blend of Jak from the first Jak and Daxter, and Tidus from Final Fantasy X: He can't talk, and his name isn't mentioned at all througout the game.  A veeeeery intersting guy, don't you think?Dragon Quest VIII is a good ol' traditonal style RPG that definitly has a story to tell, and places to explore.  It is the first Dragon Quest to make it over to America, and it has gave me and other gamers a great ride to remember: an epic full of wonders and exeitment to journey through as you play it.  Any fan of RPGs should definitly give Dragon Quest VIII a shot.peace","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2006"}

{"product_name":"B0009UBR3A","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Absorbed in Twilight (Review includes differences between the Wii and Gamecube Versions)","reviewText":"This is a review written by someone who has played both versions.  In this review I'll not only touch on the aspects of Twilight Princess, but also tell you a few differences between the Wii and Gamecube versions, because some will most definitely be curious.The Legend of Zelda is one of the most popular games of all time. When a new Zelda game marches forth, the fans are always there. Now, after spending years in development, with delay after delay and ultimately being pushed onto the Nintendo Wii, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is finally here. It's pretty generous of Nintendo to keep the game on the Gamecube as well as pushing it to the Wii.  It's great that even those without the Wii can experience this amazing game.Twilight Princess is by far one of the most instantly absorbing in the series. The game begins with you as Link in the village of Ordan. Things are going well for Link and his friends until a band of monsters riding a boar come and kidnap two of his friends. When Link awakens, he's suddenly thrust into a twilight realm where he meets a creature named Midna, who decides to aid Link on his quest. From the get go, The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess is instantly absorbing. The storyline is by far one of the best in the series and is very engrossing and absorbing.The first major difference between the Gamecube and Wii versions are the controls.  On the Wii you swing the remote and Link swings his sword.  Here, it's just the press of a button.  For anyone who played the Wii version, it's surprising how much time it takes to get used to the control scheme.  When using the slingshot or hero's bow, aiming also feels strange.  It's far easier on the Wii.  The controls for the Gamecube version are good, though.  It's just that if you played the Wii version you have to adjust to it.  However, it actually is an entirely different experienece all together.  This doesn't mean if you have the Wii version you should go out and buy the Gamecube version.  They are, after all, the same game.The heart of the challenge from the game mainly comes from the puzzles rather than the actual dungeon crawl itself. Most enemies are easily taken down by a couple of sword swings.  Some of the puzzles, however, can really throw you for a loop.  This also brings about another key difference between the Wii and Gamecube versions.  The environments are completely mirrored.  In other words, Link holds his sword in his left hand instead of his right.  A path that was on the left in the Wii version will be on the right in the Gamecube version.  Anyone who played the Wii version first will no doubt find this to be rather confusing.  However, most of you are probably getting the Gamecube version because you don't have a Wii.  So this is really no problem at all.A unique twist to the gameplay of Zelda is that Link not only goes around in his normal form, but can become a wolf as well. As a wolf the controls are virtually the same with the exception of Link being able to use senses and dig. You'll also be forced to solve puzzles in wolf form as well, and it does indeed add some variety to the game. As you progress in wolf form, Midna sits on your back and is there to offer advice for you. Gameplay wise, Twilight Princess knows how to keep you immersed in the game.Visually a Gamecube game has never looked better than this.  It's fairly lifelike.  It also looks very identical to the Wii version.  However, the Gamecube version doesn't play out in widescreen so there's letterboxes whenever you view one of the cutscenes.  The game sports some amazing detail, though.  Link has never looked better. The land of Hyrule has never looked better. Your enemies and some of the cinematics also sport some awesome detail.The music still sounds pretty good. A lot of tunes you'll recognize from previous Zelda adventures, but the new stuff sounds pretty good too. There's no voice acting, though, and that still bothers me about Zelda to this day. The Windwaker could've used voice acting and so could Twilight Princess. The story is so absorbing, and it probably would've been better had they added voices to it. Link grunts and such and from time to time one of the NPC characters might yell something, but there's really no spoken dialogue throughout the game. It would've been really exciting to see some of the cinematics brought to life through fantastic voice acting. In the long run this probably won't bother anyone, and its a small price to pay for a game that's as fantastic as this.For what its worth, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is very good. Its by far the most absorbing story in the entire series, and its gameplay is unmatched. Fans who have followed Zelda since its days on the NES will be pleased at just how far the series has come with Twilight Princess. Its one of the best in the series.On a final note, the Wii version is superior to the Gamecube version.  While they are virtually the same game, the controls of the Wii version are better, and some of the environments look smoother.  The control scheme and mirroring of the environments alone makes playing both versions a different experience.  However, if you own the Wii version, this different experience isn't so different as to warrant the Gamecube version a buy.  The reverse is also true.  If you invest in the Gamecube version, it's hard to say, \"Get the Wii version too.\"Whichever version you get, however, you'll be satisfied either way.The Good+Absorbing story+Fantastic Gameplay+There's a lot of great detail given to the game+The puzzles are quite challenging+The game still sounds goodThe Bad-All this time and the series still lacks voice acting","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2006"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXLQC","description":"","reviewerName":"Gargus","summary":"A needless sequel that is more of the same, only not as good.","reviewText":"Ill skip over a lot of what's been said and try to keep this short and concise.I truly felt this game was an utterly pointless sequel to a franchise that has been going steadily downhill for years now. It adds nothing new, nothing interesting or fresh to the series at all. It is basically just resident evil 5 all over again, only it somehow feels more stale, less interesting and less like resident evil. Its action based over scare based. They removed over the years any sense of terror or suspense instead going with the modern day version of horror being loud noises and stuff jumping out like it's a carnival spook house.The game literally feels like a 3rd person version of house of the dead where you basically move from linear corridor to linear corridor where monsters popup and you shoot them, that's it. A lot of times you'll stand there and there is obviously nothing at all in front of you, then lighting flashes and suddenly there is a zombie there. You're walking along and they slide out of dir ducts, popup out of the ground or a body just laying there leaps out at you when you get close. And the worst part about that is its all so predictable, you can see everything long before it happens.The story (I won't go into details and spoil anything) is horribly bad and needless. It feels so forced that it's just plain awful. It's an obvious poorly conceived notion put in place just to make another sequel and nothing else. It has no originality, nothing that actually adds to the resident evil mythos, nothing is explained that needs to be explained. And the characters are either ones from previous games used purely because they are recognizable or new ones added that haven't the slightest shred of originality to them or intrigue and are basically just cookie cutter characters that are very two dimensional. Everything also happens so fast and with no logical or even reasonable reason I can't get into it. Oh no I'm trapped, wait this stranger says a bus is coming to save us, and look here it is, now were driving down the road and crash. That's essentially how the entire game goes along. It's like each section and each scene in the game are broken up with no fluidity between them. If you ever heard an 11 year old kid try to tell you about something that happened to him when he is all excited that's what resident evil 6's story is like.The quick time events are back and worse than ever. You are constantly waggling a stick, button mashing, pushing button combos or whatever for no reason at all. Even something as stupid as during a cut scene you're getting away in a car and during the scene you have to push a button to make the car move. You don't steer, you don't drive, you don't do anything because you're not controlling anything but it still makes you push a button, just one button just so the cut scene will continue.The combat is awful. It's basically just like gears of war, only with less polish and it's harder to use because it's so clunky. You're body takes up too much of the screen, especially when backed against a wall. The shooting feels stiff. Trying to hit something that is close but not directly in front of you is a pain. Just all in all the combat is horrible and I don't know how many times I died simply because moving around and shooting were so sluggish and poorly designed.I can't recommend this game at more than 10 dollars and even then I'd just say \"if you played resident evil 4 and 5 then you played this already\". I paid 20 and I feel like I wasted my time and money on it.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2013"}

It has no proper multiplayer and the small problems at the core of the gameplay really hinder this from being as fun as it was on the Console versions. Unless you really want Modnation Racers on the go, I'd probably skip this one unless you can find it for under $18. I paid $19 on launch day so it didn't hurt as much.

I loved the previews and it seemed like it was going to be a good mix of combat and exploration. I was worried when I first took control of the main character and I thought that the whole game was going to be killing ghost-like creatures that moan and chasing down a guy in a red rain coat that carries an axe. Once that scene was over and I got to meet the town Sheriff and his hot deputy woman, I knew I was going to like it. It is not a constant Resident Evil survivor horror game. It is a good balance of combat, exploration, investigation, and side quests. Now I'll break down the aspects of the game.Story: Well, the story is very engaging from the beginning. It draws you in and just like a murder mystery, you start to think of potential suspects and it is very hard to guess \"who dun it\" in the end. The story unfolds well but it takes a huge syfy leap at the end. It is not bad by any means but it wasn't how it thought it was going to end. It did do a great job of explaining everything. I don't want to give away any of the story because it plays out so well but basically a girl has been murdered and you are and FBI agent and sent to this small town of Greenville to investigate a murder that may be related to other murders you've been investigating. At each chapter heading and each time you start your game, you can view a \"previously during the investigation\" short that highlights what took place during the chapter.Combat: This plays out more like Resident Evil. You have your projectile weapons like a handgun, shotgun, rapid-fire, magnum, etc. then you have your close combat melee weapons you can use like steel pipes, golf clubs, pitch forks, etc. They tend to break quick so you only get limited use of these. Each weapon needs ammunition (except the handgun, it has unlimited ammo) that you can buy, find, or dropped from downed enemies. (Hint: check mail boxes for free ammo and hit the targets 6 times in the shooting gallery at the police station). You can't move and shoot but you can move while using the melee weapons. The enemies in the game are ghost-like creatures that come from black holes in the ground or walls. They make moaning sounds and some incoherent babble. They move rapidly and appear to teleport (like in the movie Gothika) as they move towards you. If they get close enough to you, they will grab you and drain health. Some of them have melee weapons they can hit you with or throw at you and later in the game, they can shoot a projectile weapon at you. If you shoot them in the head, it can stun them for a few seconds to keep them from advancing. Most enemies won't re-spawn but later levels, there are areas that enemies will keep re-spawning. The other enemy in the game is the creature in the red rain coat with the axe. There are some chase sequences where you have to run from him and push certain buttons to dodge his attacks. It can get tricky.Gameplay/Exploration: You have access to any police vehicle. The game operates on 1/3 normal time. Meaning a full 24 hour day in the game will take 8 hours of gameplay (although certain events speed up time). The time of day will be displayed along with any major/minor event you need to attend and what time frame you have to get there. Like free lunch at the police station or breakfast at the hotel, etc. When you are driving to plot-advancing locations, your car has unlimited gas and won't take damage. Normally when you drive, you have a gas meter and a car health meter. I never ran out of gas but I did take enough damage to know that if you blow up the vehicle, the game is over. You can fill up at a gas station or grab a different police car before you run out of gas. Driving is a small aspect of the game and can be a little frustrating until you get the hang of it. (Hint: Try not using the emergency brake and use an overhead view of the car) Every NPC in the game has a real-time location on the map and a schedule to keep (when they are at work, at home, at the bar, etc.) You can interact with them throughout the game to help gather information. You can collect cards of all the people in the game and get special rewards for them at the gun shop. Some of the side things to do in the game are fishing, darts, shooting range, talking to all the characters to rule them out as suspects, and tons of side quests. You have a sleep meter and a hungry meter that you need to pay attention to during the game. You will come across safe rooms even in combat areas that will allow you to sleep (short nap, moderate, or deep sleep - the longer you sleep, the more health you will recover but at the cost of your hungry meter draining more). Coffee and other items will replenish your sleep meter temporarily. You can replenish your hunger meter by collecting food items and consuming them. They range from small amount items (suckers, pickles, tomatoes, etc) to large amount items (fish, beef, sandwiches, etc). You can get free breakfast at the hotel, free lunch at the police station, and sometimes free lunch at a diner if you go with the sheriff's staff). You also have 3 suits you can change into. The suitcase with the suits in them will be in your hotel room and at most spots you can rest at. It will tell you if the suit you have on is getting dirty so you know when to change. You can have your soiled suits cleaned for a small fee. The other thing you can do during the game is shave. Your beard will actually grow out during the game. I never let it get to long but people will react differently to you if you let it grow too much or if your suit gets really dirty. Look for the razor by a sink in most sleep rooms or your hotel room. I didn't find myself worrying about my sleep and hunger meter that often. Most of the game, the normal events will take care of both. If you choose to sleep to recover your health rather than first aid kits then you will need to carry a lot of food items in your inventory.Inventory/money: You are allowed to keep a certain amount of weapons and a certain amount of items. Special items won't take up any of your inventory spots such as keys to the police vehicles and items found during missions like door keys, objects you need to advance, etc. You also have what is called a toolbox. If your inventory is full, you can send the item to your toolbox. Your toolbox can hold a lot more than your inventory but there is a max of each item it can hold. It will tell you when you try and pickup an item if your inventory is full or your toolbox is full (for that item only). You can purchase additional inventory spaces during the game. It will be needed to keep all the weapons and ammo you need. You can access your toolbox from most sleep rooms. You do get money throughout the game from everything you do. Each enemy you kill, headshot bonuses, driving long distances, changing clothes, shaving, saving the game (called \"reporting in\" bonus). After each chapter, you will collect your basic salary for the time past and any bonuses. I never ran out of money in the game but I didn't usually spend any until the last few chapters when I needed better weapons. Most of your weapons you will gain during the game but some you need to purchase.Sound/dialogue: I loved the music in this game. It was not typical and stuck in your head. It played at weird moments in the game and at first it appears to not match but it grows on you and you learn fast that it suits this odd game. The horror music is great when fighting the ghosts and chase scenes with the axe man. The dialogue is awesome as people try and respond to you as an FBI agent. Your methods are bizarre and the sheriff and deputy won't hesitate to let you know. The voice acting is great even if it doesn't match the lip movements all the time. If that bothers you enough to skip the game, it will be your loss.Conclusion: This game is just amazing. It is definitely worth picking up. I am anxious to try it again and do more side quests. It is very unique and one of the best low budget games every made. I wouldn't change a thing about it. Game informer talked about this game becoming a cult classic and I can see why. I think ghosts are creepy and there were several moments during my play through that made the hairs on my arm stand up. Don't miss this game. It is worth taking time out from all these big budget games to experience this diamond in the rough.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2012"}

I had played the original on Gamecube a lot, but had traded it in a long time ago. Sometimes you wanna play the games from your past. So if there is anyone like me in the world, who is mulling about whether to buy this or the Gamecube original, I would say, \"Get the Gamecube original.\" Sure, there is widescreen, but as far as improvements, that's about it. The controls in the Gamecube version are superior. All things considered, however, this is still a highly playable game, and still a masterpiece.If you have never played the GC original, you probably won't even notice that the controls are slightly janky. So if the Gamecube controls were a 100, this port's would be a 95.In the GC game, you could control your aiming cursor and the Pikmin independently, with the left analog stick and the C-stick respectively; in this port, you cannot. \"Down\" on the Wiimote's d-pad orders the Pikmin to move in the direction of your aiming cursor: the cursor you use to throw Pikmin and change the camera. In the GC game, you could aim somewhere (using the analog stick), and have your Pikmin move in a completely different direction at the same time (using the C-stick). In this Wii port, you lose that functionality. In this port, however, you do gain slight quickness in manuevering your aiming cursor, because it's faster using the Wiimote to point, than it is to move the aiming cursor with the Gamecube's analog stick.When aiming and throwing Pikmin, it is slightly difficult to keep the Wiimote steady while you're holding it up, and at the same time mash the \"A\" button; so your aiming cursor will fidget a little bit and some of your Pikmin probably won't end up where you wanted them to.In the GC game, you could throw your Pikmin at a faster rate by guiding them to Olimar with the C-stick while mashing \"A\". You still can do this, but it's a little trickier. Since the d-pad's \"Down\" button and the \"A\" button are both on the Wiimote, you will have to let go of the Nunchuk with your left hand (right if you're a lefty), and then use both hands on the Wiimote. So this functionality is possible, but was too cumbersome and I barely used it, saving it for rare occasions when I wanted to throw 100 Pikmin.Also, in this port, sometimes the camera acts by itself, when in the GC game, it did not, except for the first day in \"The Impact Site\", when you first learn how to play the game. It involves the camera stealthily zooming out to the max, and angling to an overhead view. I like to play at medium distance and the 45 degree-ish view. At first I found myself wondering, \"What did I press?\" when I had not pressed any of the camera buttons.This is still a masterpiece. I love natural environments in video games, with asymmetrical levels and objects, and as few right angles as possible. This game is a visual masterpiece. It still looks good. The leaves look like leaves, and the water looks amazing (something Nintendo is still very good at).Conceptually, this is a very harmonious and cathartic game. You are a tiny being on an ominous world, but it really isn't that bad. Creatures attack you only to eat or in self-defense, and though you are hopelessly outmatched physically as well as in size, using superior numbers and your brains, you are able to overcome obstacles - not for global domination, superiority or mindless killing, but to simply return to your wife and son. It is a very beautiful story, written with care and detail. In fact, I suggest you read all the little things Captain Olimar has to say. Not only will he help you play the game, but will inform you of his back-story, his motivation to keep on going, and tell you about the new world he has landed in. The writing reminds me of the end-level snippets from Super Mario World, combined with the monologues of Samus Aran in Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion.The soundtrack is good, with one masterpiece: \"The Forest of Hope\", one of my favorite tracks in a video-game.Thanks for reading, and God bless.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2012"}

Ghostbusters did.  Well, for the most part.  The graphics are amazing, the voice-acting is top notch; especially with the old cast resuming their roles.  The plot, although not anything that will blow your doors off, certainly had that hint at the once great films, uncluding some rather enjoyable references to the other films and some easter eggs hidden throughout.  The challenge was just enough to keep me playing although I did have some gripes.  All in all, this game delivered to my less-than-enthralled expectations.This all being said.  This game can and probably will be beaten in one afternoon.  Worse case, a couple days of playing.  Some folks may not see this as a problem, but as someone who wants some substance from my games, this was a major eyesore.  Problem two, near as I could tell, there is no map.  Early in the game this isn't a huge deal, but when you are running around some of the later stages, it gets to be downright frustrating.  The controls, while excellent all in all, tend to be rather unforgiving in close quarters.  Frequently, I was finding myself stuck on a wall or worse still, IN walls, trying to navigate around to find my way through the maze that was the stage.This game was a load of fun and worth the time and money I spent to RENT it.  Had I forked over full price for it I would have been much harsher on this game.  This is a renter for sure, but no matter how much I loved the Ghostbusters, I couldn't justify paying full price for it.  No matter how fun it was to trap ghosts, there just isn't enough to keep me entertained longer than a day or two.  Even as I tried to play through again to find all the hidden items and get all my scans, I got bored again.  The online may be a saving grace for it, but what should be the body of the game is a tad frail.  Basically this should have been a Stay Puft of a game.........we ended up with a Slimer.  Wait for the price to drop, and if you are like me and are itching to charge up your proton pack and give it a throw, I would suggest renting it.  I will be buying this game one day, just not TOday.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00005V6BB","description":"Medal of Honor: Frontlinemarks the debut of the Medal of Honor franchise on the PlayStation2. InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"Nick","summary":"Very Good First Person Shooter","reviewText":"You'll probably be hooked after the first level throws you into the middle of the invasion of the beach at Normandy on D-Day.  After this intense battle the game gets a little bit less hectic, but there will always be planty of action to be had.In terms of first-person shooters, the structure of Medal of Honor Frontline is fairly typical.  It is a linear, corridor shooter, but the mission objectives are clever and the World War II atmosphere really sucks you in.The control scheme is clever, although it may take some getting used to, (I personally prefer an inverted Y-axis for aiming which you cane set in the options menu), and once you adjust to it everything feels very natural.  The melee attack comes in handy while you're reloading in the middle of a firefight.The graphics are very impressive, and again, draw you further into the World War II setting.This game is recommended for First Person Shooter fans, although you may consider renting it first to see how you like it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2003"}

Take note and take heed of The Conduit.  Yes, there is a market out there for gamers like me who like to play FPS games.  Of course, I did get the Wii console to be family-friendly, but there are the after-hour times when I want to let loose and play Resident Evil 4, etc.Of course, there has not been much in the first-person shooter fare and then The Conduit came out.  What an awesome game!  All of the Wii remote buttons and Nunchuck buttons are utilized to make you jump, run, strafe, change weapons, activate the All-Seeing Eye (a very cool feature that other reviewers cover here), chuck grenades, change grenade types, activate weapon scopes, etc.My only gripe about The Conduit was that it was SHORT.  But being that the game's duration is by far my only complaint, it's minor to say the least.  The multi-player aspect (up to 12 online) coupled with the ability to use Wii Speak (communicate with your teammates without a headset) if phenomenal and makes up for the short campaign.Some have complained that there isn't much to the story (and not original at that - alien invasion?), but I didn't feel that it detracted from the experience all that much.  It drops you right into the middle of the action and it never lets up one bit.  It has the qualities for a first-person shooter with the quick hard-hitting action that you might see in a light-gun arcade game.  It's an awesome blend with a music track that will keep you tense.  Some of the story elements were pretty cool especially with aliens using Conduits to bridge their world to ours through walls, etc.  And the hatchery concept was cool as well - you need to destroy them or aliens will keep coming through indefinitely.While another cool aspect of the game centers around humans being subjected to mind-control, it somewhat falls flat because there aren't any other humans around who are not under control.  Wouldn't it really have ratcheted up the tension to have humans in a room and you're not sure who's ok and who's under mind control until they pull a gun on you?  Unfortunately, you're safe to assume that EVERYONE is a bad guy...so the paranoia route is sadly unexploited.Despite the shortcomings in story and concept, the action is great and the Wii graphics are well-utilized and it doesn't look like a half-baked job.  Also, the degree of control customization is almost to the PC degree in terms of adjusting how fast you want your character to move at full bore, changing button commands, etc.  FANTASTIC!Buy The Conduit and you will NOT be disappointed.

I'm saying this up front.  If you have never enjoyed an RPG, then you probably won't like Tales of Symphonia.  Also, as is pretty much standard for RPGs, if you don't have many, many hours to invest in this game, it probably isn't a good purchase.  That being said, Tales of Symphonia is an amazing game that I thoroughly enjoyed.  First, the combat system is different than any other RPG I've ever played.  It's done in real time and you actually physically control a character, using standard attacks and skills at will.  You control the other characters in your party by using pre-assigned hotkeys or by going through a menu and individually selecting what you want them to do.  This gives the combat an almost fighting game feel.  It also makes player skill and important factor in success.  As you get better at the combat system you'll find yourself taking down harder enemies very easily toward the latter part of the game.  But seeing as it took me over one hundred hours to complete the game the first time, it'll be a while before you start destroying everything around you.  But those hundred plus hours were completely amazing.  The graphics look very nice, and the game is voice acted pretty well.  The story is complicated and has several major twists, so I won't tell you anything about it.  Suffice it to say this is a fantasy RPG complete with elves...and angels.  Yeah, I know.  Angels.  Trust me, it makes sense after playing.  Which is something that I definitely recommend.  I got several play-throughs out of this game and you probably will too.Bottom Line:If you like RPGs, and have plenty of spare time, then this is the game for you.  The combat system, graphics, voice acting, and story combine to make this one of the best games the Gamecube has to offer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00149MEWI","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"They say you can never really go back home again...","reviewText":"Silent Hill 2 is on my short list of favorite games, as it is, I'm sure, on most Silent Hill fans' lists.  It, and the first game, are shining examples of why this series is spectacular.  Unfortunately, they are the only two games that I feel are great in the series.  The third one felt more like a coda to the first (and was way too short), while the foruth one had more than a few design flaws that made me lose interest.So, now the torch has been passed to Double Helix, an American developer, and the result is Silent Hill: Homecoming.  Even with its flaws (and boy does it have some), Homecoming has become my second/third favorite game of the series and bodes very well for Silent Hill's future.The story begins with you, as Alex Shepherd, tied to a gurney and being pushed down dilapidated halls of some hellish hospital.  Looking to your right and left, you see even more disturbing sights as doctors drill into a patient or drop a body down a large and presumably deep hole.  Eventually, you're led into an observation room and left alone.  The doctor that left you is murdered, you break free of your bonds and have to make sense of where you're at.Right away, the game had its hooks in me.  This first level terrifically set up the rest of the game, but also presented some genuine frights and more than a few disturbing sections.  From here, you'll go back home and try to figure out why Shepherd's Glen is cloaked in fog, where your brother left, why your mother seems catatonic and what exactly lurks in your flooded basement...From a story perspective, Homecoming feels like a mix of Silent Hill and Silent Hill 2 (with a splash of Saw thrown in the mix), which is definitely a good combination.  Unfortunately, the story is also the most straight forward of the series (it's a Western game now) and while they try to mimic the essence of Silent Hill, they lose the ambiguous feel that tasks you with putting everything together.  By the end of the game, you pretty much know all there is to know.  Some might like that, but it was a sore spot for me.The combat system, which was supposed to push Silent Hill into this new realm, isn't very good.  In fact, I found myself trying to avoid enemies more in Homecoming than in any of the previous titles.  On paper, it sounds good: light attack, strong attack and dodge.  But the problem is that you absolutely have to dodge attacks or even the lowly dogs will eat your face.  The problem is further amplified by the small, claustrophic areas you are in.  A lot of battles take place in very tight corners, making dodging very difficult.  And even when you successfully dodge in the small rooms, eventually you'll run into a corner, the camera will go wacky and you won't be able to see what you're fighting or, more importantly, see when to dodge.Then, when you're in the big rooms, Double Helix is kind enough to throw two or three (or five) enemies at you at once.  Dodging one is a pain in the butt as it is, but trying to juggle three enemies is...well, it's hell.  Add to this some enemies with their gaseous breath that I could never seem to dodge and halfway through the game I never wanted to see another monster again.  And don't get me started on the boss fights...So, why the four star review?  Because of what happens halfway through the game.  At the halfway point, the game ratchets up the tension, brings the story into new light and really made me want to play more.  In fact, I played the last half of the game in one sitting because I had to see how it was going to end.  The last half really makes up for any of the deficiencies in the game.  And the story, while not as great as it could have been, was still incredibly engrossing and moving.  It made me want to continue, even after the fifth time of dying from a cheap shot.Graphically, Homecoming is obviously the best in the series.  The new sheen of gloss mostly works, though some of the monsters with the more colorful highlights (the gaseous monsters, for instance, with their red chests) look fake and break the color scheme.  Taking a page from the movie, the transitions to the other world are real time, with the paint flaking off and floating into nothingness.  It's cool but it's not as terrifying as waking up or just finding yourself in the other world.And, of course, the music is phenominal.  Akira Yamaoka, series music/sound effects creator and producer, returns to craft a haunting score that mixes industrial with noises, rock and some heart-pumping effects.  Very awesome, some of the best of his music in my opinion.In the end, Silent Hill: Homecoming is a great addition to the series that retains some of the best of what the series has to offer, while simultaneously trying new things.  Some things work, some don't.  But it is a step forward, in the right direction.  It feels like the most cohesive Silent Hill story since the second game and tries to branch into new territories.  Having a new developer really helped the series avoid becoming stagnant.  And even with some faulting moments, it really is an involving and engrossing trip into hell.  And I can't wait to see what they do next.Definitely recommend giving it a chance.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2008"}

The multiplayer online maps are way too small and messy and the sound is pretty bad.  I like some of the killstreak weapons simply for their innovation, but it's still a little boring.  The fact that you can buy upgrades in any order you please is cool, but it doesn't make up for lousy graphics and boring characters.  Modern Warfare 2 was far more exciting, realistic and fun online.  This step-back in the series very well could have been a PS2 realease it is that bad for graphics.  I'm not too fond of the team types on it either.  In the Modern warfare series, the teams were more developed.  In this one, they all look the same, which can be frustrating when trying to track down the enemy.  And, I don't know if it's just my copy or what... but the game freezes a LOT on both campaign and multiplayer.  This is the only game I own that has ever done that.  Unless you are a die-hard COD person, save your hard earned cash and wait for the price to drop.  Rent it and you will see what I am talking about.  TIP:  If you want to unlock a cool zombie arcade game which is like Total Carnage... on the main menu, click R2 and L2 as fast as you can until your guy is free from the chair, then walk around the room until you see the square button asking if you want to use the computer.  Use the computer and type in DOA and you'll jump to a somewhat amusing old-style shooter.  That is a cool plus but it doesn't rescue this mediocre heap.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0009S4UOA","reviewerName":"Michigoon \"tech geek\"","summary":"It really is just that good.","reviewText":"There's not much else you need to say about Call of Duty 2, except that it's just really good.Graphics: Splendid. The guns look great, the locales are highly detailed, and everything down to the stubble on a teammate's face looks great. Especially to note is the framerate- the game basically never slows down, no matter how many people are on screen (read: dozens of baddies storming your position), and no matter how many smoke grenades they're lobbing around. Speaking of which, CoD2 officially has the most amazing smoke effects in any game I've ever played. Ever. Firefights as you stumble through smoke and strain to determine whether the shadow ahead of you is friend or foe are both bewildering and incredibly rewarding, and it's something all gamers should try out at least once.Sound: Assuming you have at least a basic stereo setup, you'll quickly find yourself locating snipers by where their gunfire is coming from on an audio level. Teammates yell out comments that range from the comedical to the incredibly helpful, and enemy soldiers yell an appropriate amount of near-gibberish as you cut into their ranks. With a full surround setup, you might find yourself ducking under invisible bullets mid-battle as you hear them slice the air above you. Again, amazing.Gameplay: Are we seeing a pattern? Everything here is brilliantly done. Everything in CoD2 is available at the touch of a button. Helpful reminder text frequently keeps you up-to-date in case you forget a button, and it never gets in the way of a battle. All of the weapons feel \"right\" when wielded, and everything down to the Halo-inspired health system just works. Some gamers criticize the move to the \"regenerating\" system (stand clear of fire for a while and you'll go back to full health), but I'm personally glad I'll never have to hunt down health packs.Now where are the problems? As said, some people are a bit miffed at the lack of 16-player Xbox Live, or at the lack of custom games... personally, I'm still a fan of hauling my system to a friend's house and playing a System Link game. Link play has the full 16 players, custom gametypes, and so on. And for anyone maddened by the difficulty, the game has settings from extremely easy (Recruit) to nearly impossible (Veteran). On the highest difficulty, you get a full appreciation for just how impossible survival would seem for a real soldier in a war. On the easiest, your body will soak up a dozen rounds from a machinegun and keep on ticking. The final note is that, while CoD2's Campain mode is pretty short (~10 hours on standard difficulty), every single moment of it is comprised of some of the best gaming ever seen on a console. Perhaps it's quality over quantity, although some gamers will be understandably turned off by the short duration.Call of Duty 2 has emerged as the \"flagship\" title of the Xbox 360 launch, and for good reason. It's not that anything about this game is that new or inventive- most of this has been done before. But like Halo was for Xbox, originality isn't the key here. The reason this game is so succesful is because all of its features are integrated so well into one intensely succesful experience. If you own a 360, and you like shooters at all, there's no reason at all not to own Call of Duty 2 (unless you plan on petitioning for 16-player Live before you buy). It's just that good.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2006"}

Raillard","summary":"Recaptures the Far Cry magic... and adds a ton of depth.","reviewText":"The first Far Cry pretty much blindsided gamers when it came out in 2004.  From an unknown studio, here was this game with stunning graphics (which still hold up, by the way), an original setting for a shooter (a tropical paradise) and a sandbox-style approach.  Unfortunately, Far Cry 2 was a big letdown for most gamers.  While the graphics were pretty, it felt bland and repetitive, and never really immersed you in the environment or story.Far Cry represents a return to the roots of the first game, and adds a wealth of new features and option, adding to this First-Person Shooter a number of RPG elements.  You can now conquer outposts and create safehouses, where you can buy guns and sell loot.  The addition of a crafting feature (think Skyrim or World of Warcraft) adds the ability to make syringes, bigger gun holsters, bigger loot bags, etc.  It's integrated with the hunting aspect of the game, which allows you to kill and skin most of the wildlife on the island.  It's a nice addition, and the best part is that there is no real required order in which you have to do things.  If you want to get the best guns right away, you can buy them right away, with cash you loot from corpses and chests.  If you want to craft everything before starting the main mission storyline, you can.  One of the best addition is the bow and arrow - silent, mostly one-shot kills are a ton of fun.  That dovetails nicely into this game's emphasis on stealth.  Many missions can be done your way: you can run in, Rambo style and blow everything up, but it's also feasible to skulk around the shadows and pick off the baddies one by one.The main story is a mixed bag.  The voice acting is mostly very good, and the story is interesting- you and your friends were on some spring break tropical getaway when things go very wrong.  The problem is that you and your friends are annoying frat boys and girls, and it makes it tough to care whether I save my \"bros\" or not.  After a while the main story can become a drag, though they do keep the missions varied.The graphics are topnotch, especially if you have a newer PC.  There are no perceptible loading times between zone, and the island is huge.  The sound is also terrific, and if you have 5.1 sound you will love the ambient effects, animal noises, etc.  It really does add to the immersion and tactical feel of the game.There are a few things that could be improved.  1)The save game system is awful. It's essentially a checkpoint system, and you CANNOT save anywhere.  While on a mission, you must complete the mission or start over before you can save.  Why they wouldn't let gamers save anywhere is beyond, especially in an open-ended game.  2)Looting corpses is annoying.  You use the same button (E) to loot corpses, switch weapons with dropped guns and skin animals.  Many times you'll be standing over the corpse, jiggling the pointer until the magical \"Press E to Loot\" prompt comes.  You should simply be able to click on the corpse and loot, like in many games, instead of hunting for the one spot you have to hover over to get the prompt.Overall though, this game is a ton of fun!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2013"}

There`s certainly nothing wrong with that approach because this new Wii Sports Resort improves on the original game in more ways than one. In Resort you can select from 12 sports games to play, including 10 new games like Basketball and Frisbee or the improved Bowling and Golfing games. You also get a Wii-MotionPlus that goes on your Wiimote with the game, you will probably want to pick up another or a few more depending on how many Wiimotes you have but I`ll tell you right away you can`t play the game without it. If you think you`ve played this game before because you played Wii Sports think again, it`s not the same as you play different sports and each game has different controls and there are more games here than Wii Sports had.The new games are Table Tennis, Cycling, Sky-Diving, Basketball, Canoeing, Frisbee, Swordplay, Archery, Wakeboard and power cruising. All make great use of the MotionPlus on the Wiimote which is a good thing, you don`t feel like you paid for something extra that won`t get used with this game. My favorites out of these mini-games as I call them are Basketball, Bowling, Swordplay and Cycling, there are so great games and some so-so games but everyone has their favorites out of the selection. I spent many hours playing Wii Sports Resort and it`s always a challenge to me! One thing I really liked is that in this Wii Sports once you`ve played each games you can unlock other categories for the same game ex; after playing bowling you unlock the 100 pins bowling and so on, there is a lot to unlock for these 12 game they will keep you busy for a while before you complete everything.The MotionPlus was first introduced with Wii Sports Resort, I have to say it works very well and it does make the Wiimote a more precise controller and it`s very interesting. My only problem with it is that they get you to buy this great game with the MotionPlus, you are likely to get more of those for your controllers at around $20 each only to realize that you can only use MotionPlus for a few games including Wii Sports Resort. I wish that more Wii games could make use of it because unless I play Resort or one of the very few games (which are mostly sports) using the MotionPlus it`s practically collecting dust. MotionPlus is definitely fun so it`s unfortunate that there are not many games supporting it.There are many great Wii games out there (even if there are many not so great games as well!) and I feel that this is one of those great games. Is it better than the original? Well I kinda miss boxing and tennis from Wii Sports to be honest (they will keep me playing this game) and wish that Nintendo would have come up with improved version like they did for bowling on Wii Sports Resort but overall I think it`s a better game than Wii Sports is. It`s another hit for Nintendo`s Wii, another great game that can be played by the whole family that is non-violent, entertaining an provides exercise (some game make you work more than others but it`s not as intense as one of the fitness game for the Wii but it still makes you move!) what more could you ask? I would say it`s an improvement on the original though there wasn`t much to improve in the first place, if you have a Wii strongly consider getting this for your game collection it will be worth it and hours will be spent playing it which is not a bad thing because of the exercise it gives you! 5 stars all the way!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2010"}
{"product_name":"B003Q53VZC","description":"","reviewerName":"Brendan Foy \"Foy\"","summary":"The Comprehensive Homefront Review","reviewText":"First let me start and say that I had high hopes for Homefront as a game ever since I played Frontlines: Fuel of War for well over a year thanks to its highly addictive multiplayer. Frontlines was clearly a first effort from a young studio, but it showed promise and had a charm that many big budget games from publishers with deeper pockets don't. When I heard Homefront was in development by Kaos Studios and THQ, I was overjoyed and fully expected a further realized and more polished spiritual sequel to my beloved Frontlines. Upon completion of Homefront single player and spending over a month with the multi player, it is clear that this is not a sequel to Frontlines and must be judged on its own merits, as its own game. This is not a review of what I hoped Frontlines 2 would be, in that regard I am disappointed in the direction they chose to go in, this is a review of Homefront as its own game and series. Homefront is in fact quite fun, it is more of a mix between Call of Duty and the Battlefield: Bad Company franchises with influences in both the single and multi player portions of the game.Homefront is clearly a multi player centric game, as was Frontlines before it. I always knew this but many will pick up this game primarily, if not solely, for the single player so the campaign must be weighed accordingly. THQ and Kaos Studios have pushed the single player hard, put quite a bit of work into it and throw around John Milius' name and previous work such as Apocalypse Now and Red Dawn quite liberally. The single player is not meant to be a throw away campaign yet when all is said and done it is quite forgettable. On the back of the Homefront case is written, \"From the writer of Red Dawn and Apocalypse Now\", there is even a book released to lay down a backstory for the game. Kaos even went on record citing Half-Life 2 as an inspiration for how their campaign was put together yet after having completed the campaign you will be wondering just how much John Milius actually had to do with this project and how long it has been since anyone at Kaos has played either of the Half-Life games.The single player campaign is not terrible by any means, but it certainly isn't great either. The biggest problem is the pacing, which is ironic considering the mentioned Half-Life influence and anyone familiar with Valve knows their approach to developing Half-Life involves making sure the pacing is just right to always keep the gamer interested and immersed in the experience. The Half-Life games are the video game equivalent of a page turner, Homefront is not. John Milius' work has the tendency to conjure up all sorts of emotion within you yet Homefront fails to do so in its campaign. The game is one action set piece after another with rather straight forward and at times generic First Person Shooter gameplay. There is no meaningful character development, no ups and downs in the story telling and no real build up to the climax; there isn't even a proper ending as the game just sort of stops after 7 chapters. Homefront does end strongly with a rather intense finale, but it was not enough to save the campaign from being an average overall experience.The game starts off promising where you wake up in your dingy apartment in a Korean occupied America. You have a brief moment to look around your apartment until you hear some loud and determined knocking on your door from soldiers of the Greater Korean Republic. As soon as you walk to the door it triggers an in game cut scene where the soldiers kick the door in, have a few words for you about needing your services as a pilot and haul you off to a bus which will take you to a re-education center to ensure your loyalty to the Koreans. In this bus you are free to look around as it drives by the ravaged and occupied suburban town that could easily be any one of our neighborhoods. You see some pretty disturbing stuff on this short bus trip until a resistance cell, also in need of your services as a pilot, interferes with the bus trip and frees you. From here on out you basically follow Rihanna, an attractive but feisty femme fatale, Connor, a brazen and gung ho fighter, and Hopper, a tech geek Korean-American through 7 chapters of firefights.The core gameplay consists of following them and shooting enemy soldiers, making your way to highlighted objectives, standing your ground at a highlighted point of interest and essentially fighting your way from point A to point B in each chapter. The game is heavily scripted, which is normally perfectly fine except in Homefront it often intrudes on the gameplay. You play for a bit, complete an objective and the action stops while the characters talk or something happens. It is frequent and interferes with the flow of the game. The game is linear, which is also perfectly fine, except the actual shooting can be rather bland where you take some hits, find cover to regenerate health, pop your head out to find the enemy, wait for him to pop his head out and shoot it off; it is the whack a mole approach to the FPS and it feels dated. There are moments when you get to control a remote controlled drone called Goliath which consists of pressing the right trigger to highlight enemy targets so Goliath can shoot rockets at them, which does mix up the gameplay somewhat and is relatively fun, but you're limited to what you can do with Goliath and it would have been nice to have more drones at your disposal as single player went on. There are some segments where you serve as the gunner on a Humvee, nothing that hasn't been done before, and there are a couple pretty cool but all too short Helicopter flight sequences where you serve as the pilot in one and a passenger in the other. You have your standard sniper level and night level but nothing truly stands out. The final two chapters in the game offer a nice change of pace where the action really gets going and flows quite nicely, but even here the level design can get somewhat derivative.The game uses the same control scheme as the Call of Duty games which I am sure most people here are familiar with so I won't get into it too much. Right trigger shoots, left trigger aims down the sight, Right bumper throws grenade which you can hold to \"cook\" the grenade so it explodes quicker after release, left bumper throws secondary grenade/explosive like C4, Y button switches weapons, X button reloads, B button is to crouch and you hold it to go prone, A button jumps, click left stick to sprint and click right stick to melee, standard dual analog movement and aiming. The controls work and are responsive but it would be nice to see one developer, one of these days, try to do something different in this genre so their game feels different.The graphics in this campaign look fine to me, nothing spectacular but attractive enough and the sound is decent, though grenades didn't seem to make the appropriate clanging sound they should have when landing near me. No real environmental destruction here either like in Red Faction or Bad Company unless it is scripted destruction.As mentioned before, the campaign is laid out where you move from one action set piece to another. It's like a Michael Bay film with one in your face high explosive moment after another neglecting both character and plot development. I could not really form any emotional attachment to any of the characters and though I did not like seeing my country and innocent civilians terrorized, I really couldn't feel much as I'm constantly being lead (or dragged) by a leash to the next action set piece. There was a lot of potential in the story too, John Milius' involvement aside, but I just felt rushed the whole way through. One big appeal of the Half-Life games is how the whole experience was all so seamless, like you felt you were really progressing towards something big, but Homefront is divided up into 7 loosely knit chapters and they just didn't flow together smoothly. I would say the single player is worth a rental, it has its moments, but the game is not worth a purchase for the single player alone. I completed the game in 6 and a half hours on the second hardest difficulty setting, a lot of trial and error dying took up my time so I would imagine on the easier settings that each chapter is quite short.Multiplayer is what Homefront is really all about. KAOS comes from a multi player centric background with their Battlefield: Desert Combat Mod several years ago and their first full retail title in 2008, Frontlines: Fuel of War, which was heavily inspired by the Battlefield franchise. Homefront serves up a complex, balanced and very fun multi player experience which holds its own against the competition from other console shooters.The Homefront multi player takes place before the Korean occupation and pits American military against KPR forces. You will have access to a wide range of vehicles, drones, weapons and perks to use as you see fit on rather large maps which average around three times the size of your typical Call of Duty map and compare with those of Bad Company 2. The action is pretty intense and fast paced, much more so than Bad Company 2, but surprisingly balanced considering all that is offered and feels like a great mix of both Bad Company 2 and Call of Duty; it's basically what Medal of Honor should have been.The multi player experience centers around Battle Points which you earn for completing various actions such as killing an enemy, assisting with an enemy kill, EMP assisting a vehicle kill, destroying a vehicle, protecting a teammate, avenging a teammate, capturing an objective, protecting an objective, going on a kill streak and even going on a death streak (for those who are struggling but still want to earn points to get in on the fun). Battle Points can be used to \"purchase\" certain special weapons such as an RPG to help take out an enemy vehicle, personal support such as a personal UAV or flak jacket, a drone when needed for scout or assault, calling in air strikes and yes, calling in vehicles such as heavy tanks. Battle Points have often been incorrectly compared to Kill Steaks in COD since both are a point system which unlocks special abilities but as just mentioned, you get these points for doing much more than just killing and if you die, your points carry over into your next spawn. Aside from the obvious thrill of unlocking a Heavy Tank or Apache Chopper when you save up enough Battle Points (BP), there is a strategic element to when and how you use your BP; do you want to wait until you have enough BP to spend on a powerful vehicle to punish the enemy team with or will you spend your BP early on RPGs and proximity launchers to take down enemy vehicles or purchase a light armored vehicle with an anti air attack to take down the enemy chopper? Perhaps you should spend the BP on a personal UAV to help you defend or secure an objective which is undermanned or call in a scout drone to mark the enemy's position on the map to help your team push them back and win. Sitting on your BP and waiting for that chopper may cost your team a victory while spending it when needed helps everyone out and can actually accelerate your BP gain as you become responsible for more and more positive results which the game often astutely recognizes and rewards you for. I've been playing the game for a month now and so far everything seems appropriately priced when it comes to BP. The only real gripe I have right now is that there is a bug which needs to be patched for vehicle assists. If you EMP a vehicle and it gets destroyed, you get an assist, but if you do most of the work destroying a drone or vehicle and someone else gets the final shot which destroys it, you get nothing. KAOS said they are aware of this bug and working on it, otherwise the game rewards you when you deserve it.Another benefit to the BP system is the lack of static vehicle spawns which means no vehicle camping. In Battlefield games or Homefront it would be a common sight to see as much as half of your team hanging around the chopper spawn just waiting for their turn to fly while the rest of the team gets slaughtered in battle. With Homefront, your team is forced to take part in the action if they want to earn any of the cool toys (emphasis on the word EARN). There are still camping snipers as there are in any game, but they are more pests than game changers and don't rack up the BP points as much as you'd expect. The downside to no vehicle spawns is you can't rush behind enemy lines and steal unguarded vehicles as you often could in classic Battlefield games or Frontlines, and though it's nice the enemy team can't do this to you either, I still miss the added threat and responsibility of having to watch out for our own vehicles being used against us.A major draw to the multiplayer is the use of vehicles and drones during battle. There is a respectable variety to choose from with 2 different types of Helicopter, 1 Heavy Tank, 1 Light Armored vehicle and 1 Humvee for each team and for drones you have two flight based and two ground based. Each vehicle and drone serves its own purpose and when used correctly, everything has an answer for something else. Add in air strikes such as a Hellfire missile or White Phosphorous and you have quite a bit to work for in a match in addition to the different weapons and perks you earn for leveling up over time (a system lifted right out of COD).The weapons and perks are typical of what you would see in a military shooter such as this, if you've played COD then you pretty much know what to expect here (Assault Rifles, SMGs, Shotguns, Pistol, Sniper Rifle, Knife). Some complain that the weapon sounds aren't all that satisfying or that there is not enough to choose from but I personally thought they sounded just fine and would take weapon balance over weapon quantity any day. The perks are again pretty standard fare but work well with the game without anything jumping out as being too outrageous save for the knife lunge perk which isn't as bad as it was in MW2. If you get high enough kill streaks with each weapon you can pimp out your gun Army of Two style with some wild designs. It might not be particularly inconspicuous, but it's a lot of fun to use the \"I love my gun\" design which gives you a hot pink gun covered in hearts.As far as multi player game modes, Homefront claims to have 4 different modes: Ground Control (GC), Ground Control with Battle Commander, Team Death Match (TDM) and Team Death Match with Battle Commander. Battle Commander is a variation on the GC and TDM modes where an A.I. commander will mark specific targets for you and some others on your team to destroy to gain extra BP to spend. It definitely adds to the experience of each mode but it is more of a variation than a whole different game mode. Ground Control is the meat of the multi player, it is to Homefront what Rush is to Bad Company and Conquest was to classic Battlefield. In GC each team starts off battling over 3 objectives while a points bar fills up for each team. The more objectives you secure and hold and the more of the enemy team you destroy, the faster your bar will fill up and once full the enemy gets pushed back to another set of 3 objectives. If you beat them down a second time you win as it is a best of 3 for each match. In each match of ground control you have 3 sets of objectives: the starting set, one you push your enemy back to and one your enemy can push you back to; matches can often end where you don't ever get to one set of objectives as one team was never pushed back to it. The battles for these objectives are pretty furious and each map starts off slow and quickly builds the pace until it's a complete clusterfark at the end with vehicles, drones and explosions everywhere. Ground Control is fun and strategic, but it's not quite strong enough of a mode to carry this game.Many matches often end too quick, sometimes as quick as 10 minutes. The battles are concentrated on the objectives with little reason to rush behind enemy lines (no vehicle spawning so no need to steal or sabotage enemy vehicles) or hang back behind your lines (to prevent enemies stealing or sabotaging your vehicles) which takes away the quasi-sandbox feel of KAOS' previous game, Frontlines: Fuel of War, which had many little side battles in addition to the main battles over the objectives. All you can do with an objective is stand there and secure it, there is no demolition or hacking or any other requirement to take an objective which would mix up the game play some. Ground Control just doesn't feel as open or expansive as Battlefield's Conquest mode or Frontlines' Frontlines mode. It would be nice if there was an enemy base of sorts that had to be conquered after you push the enemy back to it, but instead you spend your time usually fighting over 2 sets of objectives back and forth which means Ground Control plays smaller than the maps they take place on. The spawn system is a good example of this as there is no squad spawning or spawn selection, the game picks it for you. I suppose they didn't want too many people spawning right on the objectives but at least let me choose which objective I can spawn near, I'm just going to run across the map to where my friends are anyway as I trust them to watch my back than some random without a microphone. The nice thing about the spawn system is as you are zooming in to your spawn point, you get a brief glimpse of the map and locations of your enemies and allies; this is handy because you can easily spot camping spawn killers. There is a nice tug of war feel to the GC mode, but it is nowhere near as rewarding or intense as what Frontlines had.The map selection is also limited with Ground Control. There are 8 listed maps, but only 5 are available with regular GC and with others opened up for GC:BC. Each map is well designed but they all play very similar. One thing I loved about Frontlines was how each map not only had its own distinct personality, but also offered up its own gaming experience with certain vehicles being exclusive to certain maps, different ways to capture each objective and even one different game mode for a specific map. One map in Frontlines would be infantry only while another would be massive with Jets and landing strips, it did much to add to the re-playability of that game where every map almost felt like a different game. The maps here, with the modes provided, just don't offer up the same diversity which is a shame. Judging Homefront as its own game, it is fun, but judging it against its spiritual predecessor it can come up short. The other mode, Team Death Match, is your typical Team Death Match except vehicles and drones are introduced. I am not a big TDM player, but it is well done for what it is and quite challenging.The graphics in the multi player have been criticized by many reviewers but I personally think they are just fine considering the player count, large maps and amount of mayhem which takes place on the screen. The lack of destructibility of any kind is a real drag, especially when a tank can't destroy a picket fence, but there really isn't any other game (save Frontlines) on the 360 which offers this kind of selection in terms of vehicles and drones. 4 Apaches in the sky with 3 heavy tanks and drones aplenty is a pretty impressive sight, all with 32 players on one server. The graphics may not be great, but they aren't terrible either.I have written this review after a month of play, so I have a good feel for the game and have witnessed its launch issues and the subsequent patches. As I write this, one official patch has been released with many smaller server side patches snuck in as well, and many new servers have been put up. At launch people had difficulty getting into a match because of lack of servers, this was pretty much fixed a week after launch in North America. Some people were getting a freezing bug which rendered the game unplayable; a patch was released 2 weeks after release. Others have had difficulty forming a party and bringing it into a match and while this is still an issue, I can regularly get a party of around 6-8 into a match and have gotten as many as 11 in (the max is 16, a second patch is supposed to address the party issue so 16 players will be able to get in). When in a match the game runs smooth as silk and has been since 2 weeks after launch. As far as connection and stability go, the game has been no more troublesome than any other big release as of late and I would argue has had less problems.Homefront is a good game, Homefront is a fun game. The single player is short and fails to live up to what it could have been, but it has its moments. Considering how it is marketed as being from the writer of Apocalypse Now and Red Dawn, it is a disappointment. The multi player is definitely fun and more than makes up for the single player, but the lack of maps, game modes and limited nature of Ground Control means I may have had a blast playing for this past month, but I don't see this game having anywhere near the legs that Frontlines or the classic Battlefield games had. I wanted this game to be Frontlines 2, a sequel to Kaos Studios' previous effort on the 360, but it came up short. I can judge Homefront as its own game, and have done so in this review, but in the end it's not as good as what a Frontlines 2 could have been. Still, if you enjoy Call of Duty and Bad Company 2, you might as well pick up Homefront as it offers a pretty fun mix of the two.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"AeroEngineer","summary":"San Andreas is still better","reviewText":"It goes like this:1. San Andreas2. GTA43. you chooseA. Realism is great but I think the thing that what makes GTA awesome is the fun factor, like the Wii has in this generation. They lost some fun factor here with vehicle handling, wonky controls and frustrating cameras during combat and chases. San Andreas is not realistic graphically but is much more fun to play and I feel the controls were better, that being said the cover mechanic is a nice addition to the realism of the combat in this game. I don't like having to babysit the camera more, like when I step into a car it does not snap into the forward looking mode until the car is going already. Also stealing a car is a much more involved and slow process here, taking some fun out of it. Car handling is more realistic but much less fun, if I wanted that I'll play my car sim games.B. Replayability and Variety of Missions. I see playing this through 2-3 times missions only, San Andreas I played through 6-8 times. With 85 missions it's a lot but SA had over 100 and had a greater variety not to mention a much bigger world. The side missions in SA were more fun and varied. I find myself not interested in the side missions much like killing pigeons that will sometimes get you police coverage, so it's just the missions and out. There's just not enough wonder there to explore like in the previous games because there's nothing to do most of the time. The constant calls for eating/shows etc are annoying, this is not why I am playing and seems to have minimal to none as far as the story is concerned. Most missions are drive somewhere and kill someone granted but SA just had more situations and settings than this one. There is not the wonder factor, anybody remember the bigfoot rumor in SA? The value as far as gameplay is just not up to SA in my opinion.C. Setting and Story. NY is cool but come on let's go to a new place. I think Chicago would be good as the midwest has been forgotten here. New Orleans would be cool, London even. Or a regional thing like SA had. The story is not as satisfying and epic as San Andreas' was. SA's story all fit together well. This story is mostly just a guy looking for money with annoying relatives mixed in. I'm about 50% done so this could change though.Conclusion. This is a great game, the best sandbox in this generation of consoles so you should get it, but comparing it to the last one just leaves me wanting. Everybody knows that Gran Turismo 3 on PS2 was groundbreaking and the best sim on consoles but since then Forza and other similar games have taken it's place. I think GTA has not advanced much overall with this installment, just sharper graphics and that's too bad as that's not what made GTA great. So I think that, like Gran Turismo 3,  GTA hit it's peak with San Andreas.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-10-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"Too Old for Games \"casualgamer\"","summary":"Not my deal","reviewText":"This is the first GTA game I've played so I didn't know what to expect.  All the critic reviews are so impressive that I decided to try it out.  Well, after playing for about a week, I can understand why it got the high scores.  There was a lot of development that went into the game in terms of detail to the massive scale of the city and living environment, which impressively includes weather changes like rain and fog, to what you can do, e.g. you can watch tv in your room or play pool or bowl, etc.  But I found these things tedious and just skipped them throughout.  Even the cutscenes I skipped because they were drawn out. Somewhere around hour 8 or so, the game just kind of dragged for me.  The whole sand-box novelty wore off and I was just hoping the game would end soon. (note: I hate long games, so I'm not into rpg's or I guess these type of games; I'll never be one to complain that a game is too short like some other reviewers.) I realized I wasn't close to finishing the game so I just returned it.  Maybe the game gets better later, but it's already eaten up enough of my time. Glad I rented it instead of buying first, which is something everyone should do nowadays.In conclusion, if you have the time and the interest in these virtual worlds, it's definitely a cool game and pretty amazing considering what you can do in it. Just be prepared to do them umpteen times.Other notes: Regarding the graphics, they are pretty good, just what I expected from looking at the box. The driving isn't so bad, you get used to it quickly.  I've heard about the freezing issue with the game, but my copy worked fine.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00000JRSB","reviewerName":"FicktionPhotography","summary":"So Called the \"Best\" for Good Reason","reviewText":"There is very little about this game that can't be enjoyed.  Because of that simple statement and resident fact, the game has become an absolute joy and cultural icon in the gaming world.  If you've gamed, you've heard about FFVII, if you've played Final Fantasies before, you've most likely been inundated with information about this FF.  Ten to one, you've probably played it.  Over and over and over again.  And for good reason.If you're a stickler for graphics, this is not your game.  True, there are patches for the computer version that makes the graphics of the characters a bit more bearable, but half the charm is the ludicrously sharp angles and style that was just pulling out of 16-bit gaming.  The cut scenes, for its time, were remarkable and had blown our young minds away all those years ago.  Now, however, it pales in comparison to what is being put out on next gen software.  Still, if you can look past the blocky animation the game will still blow your mind.It's a game that you actually, go figure, have to WORK at.  The easiest route is not always the most accessible and you'll spend a lot of time bashing poor Cloud, the main character, into walls trying to find the damn door.  On top of that, you have to battle beasts that aren't going to level up or down with you to present a challenge.  They are what they are and if you can't beat them you better be ready to run around the world a couple hundred times leveling yourself and your characters.  But, the upside to that is the convenience of crap to do!  There's a whole world of mini games and side quests that take up a majority of your time and energy.  The main story is captivating and you wish to see it to its conclusion, but at the same time Gold Saucer and Chocobo Breeding might very well make you into an addict.  This makes the game, in the later hours, a bit easy to beat since you might very well grab every summon and every materia known to the Planet, which will make your characters into walking, talking nuclear bombs without the fallout.The characters are all very rounded and all have a depth of story to them that is very typical of Final Fantasy, but they are not loosely connected by coincidence, but rather a drive to see the world saved.  Their reasons are all unique to them and it makes the story as believable as any since we all know what it's like to be part of a group that stands for something, even if it's something small.  The antagonist is just as round.  Sephiroth is as complicated as the rest and will present quite a challenge to you as you progress through the game.There were many breakthroughs with this game that helped to pave the road for future FFs and separate future RPGs, but it makes it no less fun to play because it's so called \"old\" or \"outdated\".  A definite gem, worth the time and effort, and all kinds of fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2013"}

It was good fun because it had a simple 2 button control scheme, and was accessable and fun enough for a beginner to come play and win. Well, Mario Power Tennis is now available for the gamecube, and Im glad to say, it is just as fun, and even better than before.The basics are the same: Run around the tennis court as one of your favorite nintendo mascots, hitting A to deliver a topspin or B to slice, or a combination of the two to either lob or drop. If you hit the button before the ball comes, you can charge your shot, as well as aim it to make it harder to hit. The system is a lot deeper than that though, because shots accurately move depending on how fast the ball was traveling, where it was hit, and how high it was hit. The system is deep, but accessable.There are new features, one of which is the ability to do powerful, game-stopping super moves once your character has charged up. Each character has 2 power moves, offensive (super powerful only near the ball) and defensive (retreives the ball if it is far away). These for the most part add to the game, adding a layer of strategy. The animations of the character's power shot are zany and funny... for the first few times. After a while, stopping the game to watch these moves gets sort of annoying, bt fortunatley, there is the option to turn them off during exhibition mode.Another change is the new \"gimmick\" courses. Besides the standard courts, each themed court has a obstical or hazard to face. Some of them work well and are fun to play on, such as the blooper stage where the stage is constantly changing shape depending how you play, or the Wario court, which is made entirely from moving conveyor belts. Others are annoying and not fun, such as Delfino Plaza where slime covers sections of the court and ou have to push a button on the court to clean it, or the Luigis mansion court which has ghosts who like to terrorize you while you are playing.You might go through tournament (single player) mode a few times to unlock characters and stuff, but it is not interesting enough to keep your attention for very long. What will keep you coming back is multiplayer mode. Playing with fiends is always fun, and you can even play some tennis themed minigames with friends. There is enough characters, modes, courts, and variety to keep you busy for a long time.As for the technical side, graphics are good, but they are very bright and kiddie. You wont really notice the graphics while playing, you will almost feel like you are plaing the n64, because the games are so similar, and characters look the same from afar. Music is good, sounds are accurate, but character noises can get a little annoying. If you have ever played a Mario game before, you should be fine.Overall it is a fun game that does enough right to warrant a purchase for those who like to have fun.

The driving really is technically perfect, and the best simulation you can get on consoles. However, the downsides start to rear their head.First off, the game is totally soulless. 1,000 horsepower monster cars just drift forward, when they should be shaking your driver's teeth loose. The system fails to model the complex bumps and divots that real race tracks have, so the car just floats along. Before the developers patched in an update, your driver didn't even shift when using the first-person mode, the computerized hands just stayed glued to the wheels. This was okay in previous installations in the series since few games could manage that level of realism, but in the time since the last Forza many other titles (Project Gotham racing, GRID...) have better captured incredibly intense bumping and jarring and terror of driving a race car at speed. Driving a million-dollar supercar in Forza 3 is, frankly, just boring.Multiplayer is awful, and this affects the singleplayer game. In most singleplayer or \"career\" modes, you win a number of prize cars through the game for completing various challenges. Normally, you can resell these prize cars for a good chunk of change, in order to upgrade cars you want. Instead, the developers decided to integrate selling cars into the multiplayer experience, so you can only auction off cars to other people. Since everyone wins the same cars, you're basically stuck with whatever you get and it's much harder to earn money toward things you really want to do in game. The online racing is also awful. As an example, the developers also pulled support for playlists for anyone who wants to race sub-A-class cars, meaning online racing is basically limited to race-tuned and supercars against strangers, there's nothing catering to people who want to race regular stock cars in leagues, which is a massively popular demographic.And the grind. As mentioned, you can't resell prize cars for money, so you're stuck grinding away getting cash from race prizes. Races only really grant money if you finish in the top 3 and specifically in first place, so you'll basically have to win every single race to build money. A normal race might net you up to $20,000 of in-game cash, when there are cars that cost $20 million. That's 1,000 races (and you have to win every single one, while avoiding damage to your car). There are longer races that net more money, but then you could wind up spending literally hours to finish a single race, for only a fraction of the money that you need. It's basically impossible to net all the cars you're going to want, unless you're going to spend a ridiculous amount of time playing and manipulating the online auctions.The damage modeling is laughable. The developers did a great job modeling small bits of damage, like windshields cracking from impacts or bumpers crumpling from a hit, so things look impressive at a glance. However, you quickly learn that all damage is preset- if the front corner takes (x) damage, it will look like crumple effect (y). And if you take a big hit, prepare for the surprise. The front bumper of your car might crumple when you hit a wall, but the chassis will be fine even if you slam facefirst into concrete at 200mph. If you manage to flip your car, it rolls around like a children's toy, and you can hold the left stick to make your car roll itself back over like a turtle shaking its flippers to roll over. This is just plain stupid, and it looks ridiculous in game.So the final impression I was left with, is that that developers spent tens of millions of dollars scanning every lug nut on a car to ensure total accuracy, but then they let you roll your flipped car over with the flick of a magic wand. It's just... dumb. So much money and effort is spent on such a lifeless package. I'm totally underwhelmed by this entry in the series, even though I loved the previous installments.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2010"}

I apologize if I'm not creative enough to add anything new into the mix. My main concern is giving this game the stars that it deserves so that others may know how truly awesome this masterpiece is. I love this game! I wasn't for sure if I should buy it because I remember what Demon's Souls did to me last time. Luckily I haven't broken any controllers or tvs yet out of pure hatred and frustration. Honestly, this game isn't all that hard. Granted I had to fight one enemy boss about 30-40 times (until I finally summoned a couple of helpful phantoms into my world) to beat him, but other than that this isn't all that hard of a game as long as you learn from your mistakes. This game is VERY enjoyable to play and is VERY rewarding as well. You will actually get adrenaline rushes and find yourself shaking with excitement during some of the boss fights. There's nothing like it out there that even comes close to feelings of ecstasy and anguish that this game produces.This game is put together beautifully. The worlds are amazing and the controls are superior to any 3rd person game out there. Your character does exactly what you tell it to do every time regardless of what is going on around you. The feel of swinging different weapons around is astounding. You actually \"feel\" the weapon in your hand. The sound and graphics are superb too. Not many games keep me in awe for long, but this one manages to do just that. This is the best game I've played in a long time. It was just what I needed. If you have problems staying focused, keeping a positive outlook, or giving up easily you should probably skip this game. You must stay driven and motivated to keep pressing through this game. Sometimes you'll just have to go to a bonfire and step away from the controller for a few hours so you can mentally regroup and refresh. That's a very important part of playing a game like this. Take a break every now and then to keep that noggin from frying.Lastly, the challenge of this game is what keeps me glued to it longer than most games. Dead Island is a fun game, but there are no repercussions if you die besides losing a few bucks. In most games it feels like you're just plowing slowly through the game knowing that you'll eventually get to the end. In Dark Souls the feeling of elation I got after defeating the Capra Demon, for instance, cannot be measured. It feels like you've just won a race both mentally and physically. This game definitely gets my blood pumping. It's a great break from all of the other regular games out there and I think the replay value will be tremendous. Do yourself a favor and buy it (unless you're a quitter). You won't regret purchasing this masterpiece.Update: This is one of those games that you think about when you're not playing it. It's that great! Seriously, I love the game more the farther along I get into it. This is definitely one of the top games EVER! If you haven't bought it yet (and you're up for a challenge) buy it today! It's hard, but not impossible. Don't listen to those people who frustrate easily and give up because something's a little difficult. By the way, spend those souls! Don't save them up unless you're planning on buying an expensive item. DO save up and buy the seal for the door (you'll know when you see it). This item will pay for itself over and over again if you farm in such a way that makes your enemies in hot pursuit run up and over you off the side of a cliff. I don't want to spoil much. Look it up and you'll see the info. You'll get thousands and thousands of souls this way.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2011"}

WHen they hit $299 it was enough for me to make the plunge.  WIth this game in the &lt;$20 range it's a great pick up and a no brainer.  Content wise it will keep you going for hours and a great use of all the main features of the controller + system.  Multiplayer is still alive and well and it was easy to find a group of people to run around and shoot at.The story line was a surprise to me as I had not read any reviews and had only played it slightly in the store years ago.  Having it set in the 1950s was a surprise and a welcome treat because I'm a fan of alternative history speculative fiction.  The bad guys are pretty tough in the PVE mode and include teaming up on you and going for cover.  Very creative for FPS even with the newer titles out.The opening chapter/massacre was pretty intense considering how blind I went into it.

{"product_name":"B000066RKC","description":"Based on the same elements that made the movie so enjoyable--fear, suspense, and the possibility that your teammate might be infected--The Thinglets players slowly creep into the action with the help of several nonplayer characters (NPCs), whom you control and use to protect and aid you and your group. Using a core team of engineers, medics, and soldiers, players must manage and control their level of trust in, and fear of, you. They react to your actions, and might betray you if they think you might be the Thing. Conversely, you must constantly monitor which one of them might be infected and dispose of that person. Other characters must trust you, but if they fear you, actions as drastic as coercion might be necessary. For example, if a soldier doesn't have confidence in you, you may have to put your gun to his head to convince him you're not the Thing. For his sake, he'd better believe.","reviewerName":"Matthew R. Sullivan \"cupsncakes\"","summary":"A Disappointment","reviewText":"I like the idea of a video game based on the movie \"The Thing\" by John Carpenter, and I was excited to see how they would play on the fear the players had toward eachother- \"Is he the Thing?

The graphics are a bit dated, and if you walk close to wall, you may get a piece of the other room on screen.  In addition, it really didn't follow the movie at all.  It seemed closer to a sci fi shooter like Cold Fear or Extermination, rather than the mind games I assumed it would contain.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2008"}

Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience. Merging blistering 2D action with meticulously rendered 3D environments, players race through intriguing locations across the globe as Sonic to save a chaotic world.The other side of SonicSonic and his alter ego Werehog.View larger.Collect rings for Ring Energy.View larger.Swing into action with Werehog.View larger.A NewSonica New StoryOn a quest for world domination Sonic nemesis Dr. Eggman has managed to steal the chaos emeralds once again and this time drained them of their power. As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new proprietary &ldquo;Hedgehog Engine,&rdquo;Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other next-gen technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.","reviewerName":"J. Van Wagenen","summary":"I can't believe they could make a game this good so soon after the failed \"Sonic 06\"","reviewText":"This game is so underrated it's ridiculous. If you're a Sonic fan in any way, just buy it. The price is so low, you have almost nothing to lose. Compared to the Sonic the Hedgehog game from 2006, which was probably the worst game I ever purchased for the Xbox 360, this game is amazing. The levels are fast-paced and actually fun. Being the werehog is obviously not as fun as levels where you are normal Sonic, but it's not as bad as some people are making it out to be. I would love if they made another game very similar to this, but without the werehog gimmick.The real fun of this game is replaying levels to learn the paths and ins and outs to it. When you can race through a level from beginning to end while holding boost down the whole time, you just get a very awesome feeling of accomplishment. I will admit though, the later levels become a lot harder to do this on, and can be frustrating at first while you take time learning them. For under twenty bucks though, it is a definite BUY.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2013"}

As much as I love GTA games, I usually only get a mild feeling of that somewhere after the first fifteen minutes of gameplay.With RDR, that feeling hit me the second I had a horse, a gun, and an amazing view of the western world Rockstar had created.Secondly and most importantly, I like RPGs to keep me interested and busy, preferably simultaneously. RDR did it again. Between the &#34;Stranger&#34; missions, the main story, hunting bounties, duel challenges, and exploring the vast western world, I could tell this would be an addicting game for a long time.If you like games of freedom, and you've been looking for the authentic western gaming experience, look no further.

{"product_name":"B000BWZY7Q","reviewerName":"bixodoido","summary":"Worth the wait","reviewText":"Well, it took 2 years for the first expansion of World of Warcraft to be released.  The game promises only 10 new levels to existing players, which means anywhere from about a week to a month of play (depending on play time).  After that you're capped at 70 again and busy yourself with new content while you wait for another expansion.  So why the hype, why is this game so great?  It's quite simple--the new content is amazing.  The Outland is a great new place to quest, the zones are huge, and, unlike parts of the original game, it is easy to level all the way from 60 to 70 just by doing quests alone.Leveling is much more fun this time around (that's not to say it wasn't fun before, but it's moreso now) and the new world is so much different from the old that it's difficult to imagine feeling that its \"more of the same.\"  One of the best parts of the expansion, though, and one not to be missed, is the addition of two new races, Dranei and Blood Elves, and the storyline that accompanies the respective races.  The new starting areas are remarkably well done and the plotline fantastic.  Even if you're a veteran player of WoW, don't pass up the opportunity to explore the new zones.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2007"}

I found this collection on here and it looked like an absolute dream come true!  I had just obtained Mega Man 9 and 10 via downloads, so I figured, get this and complete the classic collection right?!Well, on that note I'm very happy with this collection.  Mega Man 1 through 8 are presented here in their original 8, 16 or 32 bit formats, and there are even two previously unreleased Mega man arcade titles on there!

I'm definitely glad I have it now!But how does it play?  It really doesn't feel too bad--EXCEPT FOR THE REVERSED BUTTON ORDER!  Jump and Shoot are completely switched!  'B' is for Jump and 'A' is for shoot, which made it extremely uncomfortable for me because I've been used to the default 'B' for shoot and 'A' for Jump from the get-go.  Suddenly doing that kind of switch on us old-school players is very annoying to me, and as I've seen here to many others.  The only way I can see someone getting quickly accustomed to the control scheme here is if they've had little or no experience with the classic Mega Man series, and on that note I recommend this for beginners.Yeah, it's annoying.  However, I was having such a blast playing 7 that I'm gonna pretty much force myself to get used to this style, because I definitely picked this up to play the older games I missed before such as 7 and 8, and that's what I intend on doing.  Giving an awesome collection of classic games like these a terrible rating over an odd button order is sorta ridiculous.If you're enough of a Mega Man fan, I recommend sucking it up and getting used to it.

I could never find in the keyboard set-up. What a convenient bonus this feature this would have been to speed up game play.4.) many long cut scenes have no skip feature (a few did)...this includes the credits that you encounter at every start-up.5.) confusing, layered maps. I'm not sure if this was the intent or not. I know I probably spent as much time just trying to get to my objectives as I did actually achieving them.6.) really, really stupid AI opponents.Impressions...I'll be honest, I loved the original 'Deus Ex' and I really looked forward to playing this latest version. However having played co-op L4D 1 and 2 for the last couple of years or so, has apparently jaded me to all other computer games...especially my once favorite FPS with RPG upgrades.Conclusion:The long awaited Deus Ex follow-up has arrived. To me an OK-ish game. Several of the Cons mentioned above really took away from what'd hoped would have been a rewarding gaming experience.I had the feeling that they may have released this game a little early...it needed some refinements to get rid of some of the glitches.Decent, but not great...as it is 3 Stars.Ray Nicholson","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2011"}

The setting was fascinating, but the gameplay got to be kind of repetitive after a while.  The second game was literally just more of the same.  This game, however, kind of blew my mind in many ways.First and foremost, I have never seen such loving attention to detail paid in the creation of a game-world before.  Columbia feels like a living, breathing, authentic world full of interesting happenings, and I feel like I would be happy spending the entirety of my playtime just walking around in the introductory chapter seeing the sights, playing the carnival games, watching the kinetoscope films, and so on.  It's a gorgeously designed world, and every corner you turn presents new breathtaking vistas and fascinating ideas.  But the way the plot creeps into your initial exploration is nothing short of genius.  It's hard not to be shocked and pulled into the twists and turns as it goes along.  I clocked 19 hours from start to finish, and I was constantly being surprised every step of the way.  That's all I'm going to say about that, because it's best that you experience it for yourself.All said, I think this game has something for everyone.  It's got tons of excitement for action junkies, a great story for the thinking person, beautiful level design for those who love good graphics, lots of tangential content for the explorers, and if you're like me and love all of these things, I think you'll come to the same conclusion that I did - that this game is a total home run.I've never been as convinced that video games can be as effective as a film for telling a story as I am since playing Bioshock Infinite.

Combining a wonderfully cheesy grindhouse presentation and some slight tweaks with the classic gameplay that fans of the series know and love, House of the Dead: Overkill is a sheer blast.  Taking the roles of AMS Agent G and foul-mouthed Isaac Washington, Overkill features plenty of frantic shooting action, ridiculously bloody violence, and enough over-the-top moments to keep you interested.  Overkill also boasts some of the best graphics to hit the Wii yet, despite some moments of clipping and slight graphical glitches.  The game also boasts a killer soundtrack, and the game's areas and enemies are well-designed as well, but it's the grindhouse-style presentation in terms of cut-scenes and voice work that really make Overkill worth playing.  The only real flaws in the game lie in its disappointing frame-rate, and the fact that the game ends up being too short, which in itself isn't much of a surprise considering that the House of the Dead games have never been known for being lengthy.  Also, the game's dialogue borderlines on obscenity overkill (no pun intended) which cen be a distraction.  Flaws aside, House of the Dead: Overkill is a sheer blast from beginning to end, and is by and far the most fun that a House of the Dead game has been in quite some time.

The world itself has a lot going on for it. There is plenty to explore and gaze at if you just pause to look around. Detail is everywhere and it really helps with immersion into the game.Storyline 5/5 they spent time developing a story that gives you options and keeps you following along instead of just leveling and doing mundane quest to end game level. The world changes and the quest line progresses so that in itself is engaging enough to keep you replaying the game trying different characters for different questlines.Gameplay 3/5 It's flashy and simple but not very challenging. Compared to GW1 where people complained it was too hard (believe me it could be dreadfully hard) this game holds your hand. It's hard to be killed when fighting normal level bosses. The game is much more generous to you as it has no Death penalty. When before if you were killed on a hard boss it only became worse as you lost about 10% max health each time. The game is very forgiving now and that takes away from the challenge that Guildwars used to offer.Gameplay Part 2cont. 3/5 the skill sets you use are very watered down from the old format of building a unique set of skills. Each character has 5 main moves and 5 secondary moves. The main attacks alter between weapons and the secondary attacks you can pick and choose. There is a lot less freedom than before when having hundreds of skills and combinations to choose from. That is a main drawback for those that enjoyed the variety of the old game. As there are different skills and weapons there is a set number of skills that you use and after the 100monster or so you kill it's quite redundant. For other games no big deal for guildwars it's a kick down from what we once had.The game community 2/5! As an MMO the idea is to play along with other players. Over time this concept has changed from people being sociable to Soloquesting Online. Most players in GW2 play alone and rarely interact with other players unless they need too. There are guilds as this is \"GuildWars\" but despite the name it's never been \"Guild\" dependent unless you were doing PVP. I haven't gotten too far into PVP yet but plan to engage in that later when my computer is better capable to handle the lag.The games community is there but it's non existent as most people just stay to themselves. Even in guilds people will do their own independent tasks and join up for a mission or dungeon and that's about it. So maybe it's a change in MMO behavior or the idea that MMO's are no longer that interesting and new anymore since the idea of playing with someone else online is rather old now there just isn't a need for grouping or playing with other players. For myself as well as old guild wars players its a bit of a let down. After years of playing in instanced worlds with NPC's you finally get a true MMO of your favorite game only to have the actual players run around not engaging with other people and just soloing content. At points I found myself wishing for the Questing NPC's back just so I wouldn't have to quest alone and be so bored. So what are all these people doing? They're \"farming\" which means they're running around to map area's and gather materials to get achievements and make items later on. When people say this game is a \"gear grind\" It's those people that are doing it. The truth is that this game is not a \"gear grind\" it's just the behavior those people choose to engage in when playing this game. They choose to not really be social, they choose to rush the game by not exploring or experiencing the content but just getting from point A to point B, and they choose to make the game all about getting the next piece of equipment. The reality is that the game is amazingly large and detailed and as I said before there is a lot to take in and discover beyond the points of interests listed on the map.In the past I made the mistake of blaming the game itself for being boring or tedious and casting these people into the grind of this mundane behavior but the truth is that these people do it to themselves. In just about all of these MMO's that have come out. The get into the concept of turning a game into a chore and they stick with it no matter what game they play. Rush to max level, grind for the best armor, then complain about being bored. The community is very different from the old GW community that wasn't so much \"grind\" oriented but \"game\" oriented. If you quested you quested well, if you PVP'd you PVP'd well, You were just playing the game and not necessarily chasing accomplishments they just came with it. The concept of the old GW community is completely gone in the new world. It's been modernized to cater to the grinding crowd which isn't very enjoyable because they never add any substance to the game other than their characters solemnly playing in the background.The world of Guild Wars 2 really feels split. On one hand you have the backdrop to a great story and goodtimes but on the other hand you have a community that doesn't want to engage in those things. It's somewhat like driving to an amusement park and instead of getting on any of the rides you just walk around the park looking at idle roller coasters and decide to pick dandelions laying about instead. No one seems to take advantage of what the game is offering instead they choose to turn the game into something that's not fun at all to play.Overall my opinion of the game after some time in it has me not disliking GW2 but coming to the realization that the MMO phase of gaming has come and gone because the mindset of the current players has changed it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2012"}
{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"Matthew Maples","summary":"Alright casual game","reviewText":"Leaning on the success of Guild Wars 1, ArenaNet tried to make a worthy successor, but failed. The original was a true MMO which took a bit of skill and practice to master, whereas Guild Wars 2 makes me feel as if I am playing a &#34;The Elder Scrolls&#34; game. Pretty much everything is done solo, WvW is more about getting the largest group rather than individual skill, and the extremely limited useful skillset means each class only has one or two (exception being Engineers, three) viable builds. Also the first 50 or 60 hours you play you are grinding enemies, map areas, and &#34;dynamic events&#34; to level up.There are many worse games for the same money, so you can't go wrong if you like the MMO or &#34;The Elder Scrolls&#34; type of game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2014"}

I THINK NOT.  7.5 OUT OF 10","reviewText":"Yes, I'm fully aware of mixed critical response (56 out of 100 on Metacritic), and I'm fully aware of the negative reviews from many gamers about this game. When I bought it, I had read a good portion of these reviews, thinking that I was getting myself into a horrible, glitch-ridden mess. In fact, some sources said that this game's critical response was so disappointing to Universal Interactive (Now Sierra Entertainment), that they canceled the Xbox and PC versions of the game. I was left thinking, \"Is this game really that awful?\" To my surprise, this game was actually good. I found nothing that would suggest that this game was \"horrible\" or \"the worst game ever.\" If you think that this game is bad, you have not experienced the meaning of a bad game. Before I get into the basics about this game and why I enjoyed here is a list of bad games you should play before you call this one bad:1.Superman(WORST. GAME. EVER.)2.Drake(25 missions of absolute hell... and I finished it!)3.Chicago Enforcer (Xbox)(Who thought a game about being a mobster for Al Capone could backfire so horribly? And I finished this one too!)4.Bad Boys Miami Takedown(If Michael Bay, Martin Lawrence, and Will Smith stayed away, what does this tell you? I finished this one too!).5.Trigger Man(Not quite done, but try and keep your sanity with its insane difficulty topped off with terrible, aggravating gameplay).6.Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal(Finished this game as well, despite the fact it crashed eight times and it's loaded with numerous glitches. A terrible third-person shooter/platformer with a Looney Tunes skin).There, those are some of the worst games that I've ever played, that you should play if you want to get the true meaning of what a bad game actually is. Now, let's move on to the review.WHAT THE GAME IS: A platformer similar to the PSone Spyro trilogy. Taking place right after the events ofSpyro: Year of the Dragon, a party is being held in the Dragon Realm for the passage of young dragons and dragonfly guardians for the dragons. Out of nowhere, Ripto (Who seems to have come back to life) appears and takes all of the dragonflies (Minus Sparx). But, due to his negligence, the 90 dragonflies are scattered throughout the nine levels of the Dragon Realm. Now Spyro and Sparx must travel through these levels, collecting the dragonflies, jewels, and defeat Ripto once again. The story isn't exactly remarkable, if you haven't noticed. But for older Spyro games, you didn't come for story, you came for the gameplay.GRAPHICS: This game has colorful and creative level designs, but the textures and animations for the characters looked bad. For a game that came out in 2002, this really doesn't look that bad. It's not great, but it's adequate, thanks to wonderful level designs.MUSIC: This felt very similar to the music in the original PSone trilogy. It was calm, soothing, and very nice to listen to. I loved this music, even though The Legend of Spyro trilogy has the best music of the series. Overall, I have no gripes with this area.SOUND: Spyro's voice actor isn't bad, but he's given terrible dialogue to work with (Thank God, for The Legend of Spyro series they chose Elijah Wood to play Spyro). The other actors are awful, especially the voice actor for Hunter, who for some reason sounds like he's high. Sparx's buzzing voice was annoying as all hell to listen to. The other sound effects, like when Spyro attacks an enemy with his powers, sounded good however. Overall, this area is a mixed bag.GAMEPLAY: This game is a platformer, as were the previous entries. You spend your time looking for dragonflies, collecting jewels, playing mini-games that are in the nine levels, and accomplishing whatever task assigned to you on each level. This area is pretty fun for what it is, and I never really got bored wandering through the levels exploring and finding all the hidden items. The mini-games were also really fun, such as the levels when you compete in races or a tank level. The controls work just fine, they're not perfect, but they work as they should. This game also isn't very frustrating either. I almost never died, and I spent my time enjoying the game and less time screaming at the annoying jumps that most platformers are plagued with. This area however, is dragged down somewhat by the load times. These are certainly not the worst load times ever (Try sitting through Chicago Enforcer's 45-90 second load times after every cutscene and after every level). These can get annoying at times, especially when you want to get to or back to a level or a mini-game. I only encountered one glitch that forced me to restart, but other than that I found no glitches that crippled the game that many people claimed to have encountered. This area for the most part, is flawed, but well-executed and relaxing to play.OVERALL: A rental because of the negative reviews, but if you're looking for a game that's not frustrating, then this game should provide mostly good times. It has load time and graphical problems, as well as minor glitches, but they can be overlooked if you give this game a fair chance. This game really is not bad, I feel that it is an unfair victim of PSone trilogy fanboys who hate any Spyro games that came after the trilogy.THE GOOD: Wonderful level designs and music, good controls and gameplay, and fun challenges and mini-games.THE BAD: Some annoying load times, sloppy textures and animation for the characters, and some small glitches.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2009"}

James Bond","reviewText":"I'll be darned, this really DID make me feel like James Bond! I found it a couple of months ago on sale and have always liked the Bond games so I gave it a whirl, but truth be told I wasn't expecting much. The games after Goldeneye were really good, I had fun with them, but they couldn't touch Goldeneye. Well it's been a very long time and there STILL isn't a game that can touch Goldeneye, but this is the absolute best effort since. Boy did I have fun with this game. It's like playing a movie. The graphics are superb but some of the design choices are just odd...like a previous reviewer pointed out: exploding cannisters in a library?. However they are some of the best looking exploding cannisters in a library you are likely to see  :-)  The fighting handles awesomely and the gun play is beast. The games does falter a little about halfway in when you realize that though good looking and exciting to play, the environments and objectives feel a bit too repetitive, even for a shooter. There were a few times when glitches forced reloads for me too, falling through the floor a few times and a couple of other times where my character would just walk into a wall no matter which way I steered him and just stay there. These issues didn't happen often though and were easily cleared with one reload, so at least they weren't game stoppers.Single Player is the cream of this game in my opinion but the multiplayer is sharp enough to keep me playing it for a while. Its standard multiplayer fare but it's done very well. This game could have benefited HUGELY with some local co-op, I still have friends whom I've enjoyed all nighter co-op sessions on the couch with since our teen years, I would have loved to go through the campaign or even some extra co-op only missions with them.Overall this game rocks pretty hard. Despite a few quibbles and it not being up to par with Goldeneye (but lets be fair, what Bond game HAS? That is one tall order.) this is the best Bond game since. If you like the Bond games at all you are gonna LOVE this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2011"}

Yes, she's still quite busty, but she's actually admired now for her ability to shoot, think and puzzle her way out of solutions.Many of the puzzles she faces are traditional. You climb up pipes and walls to reach higher areas. You push boxes in order to block spinning fans of death or to cross flaming passageways. You kill off bosses in a variety of ways.In addition, you have timed sequence actions. These are much like Bond Moments from James Bond games, or the gameplay of the old classic Dragon's Lair. In these games the game makers would create gorgeously fluid sequences of animation and you would be instructed to hit buttons at precise moments in order to keep the animation flowing. I always found this style of gameplay to be a bit hokey - it took you out of the 'immersion' of the gameplay - but on the other hand it does mean you can view some fantastic cinematics when you get the timing right.The game is relatively quick on the first pass, but there are plenty of secrets and items to find to get you to go back and replay a number of times. Still, for the high price you pay for 360 games, I really would have expected this to be MUCH longer. On one hand, you have games like Elder Scrolls Oblivion that you can literally play for months and months and enjoy it. On the other hand, you have games like this where you could play through in say 6-8 hours and be completely done. Surely there was plenty of room on the DVD to fit more levels.The graphics were quite impressive - from the lighting to the flickering flames and dark tombs. The way in which you light up your world as you look around really added to the feeling that you were down in a dark world, with perhaps new secrets lurking just around the corner. Little touches like the swing of Lara's braid added to the realism.The sound was reasonably good; the voice acting wasn't Drama Movie quality, but it certainly did well as a fun action game atmosphere.I would really recommend renting this one first to see how much the game grabs you. If you're a real Tomb Raider fan, you might be thrilled to have this in your collection. However, if you're not sure, it's best to give it a quick try before you pay out the full price for what amounts to a weekend game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2006"}

There are so many wonderful things about it that others have gone into before me.  The BEST aspect, in my opinion, is the fact you can play two players online at the same time in your household.  I have never seen this before in any game.  This is a wonderful concept.  Usually you're forced to watch someone play online while you do nothing, but this allows you to compete against each other as well as 10 other players online, for a total of 12.  The tracks are so varied and numerous, that you never get bored and it takes a long time to really master each one, if you ever do.But.......the reason I subtracted one star.  CHEATING!!!  There are sooooo many people who cheat online that it has really begun to affect my enjoyment of the game.  It started kind of slowly, where I noticed a few funky things going on in each room.  But once I started looking for it, wow!!  You will find at least one-two people in any room cheating.People who obviously lack game skill, and are apparently basement dwelling losers, have managed to obtain horrible cheat codes and ruin the experience for honest players.  If you pay attention, you will observe people with funky names like $$betty*&&^##=++ or (SCsam[^^}.  These are usually (not always) the ones to watch out for.  I have seen glitches and cheating in so many ways, including but not limited to....Having an endless supply of items (red/green/blue shells)Being invincible right from the starting gate without getting a boxFalling off the edge of the map then reappearing far ahead of the spot they fell offTotal immunity to other's items (i.e. not being able to be hurt by shells/bullets/stars etc..)There are many more cheating tactics, but these are enough to ruin it for me.  There is nothing more frustrating then fighting your way to an over 8,000 VR, only to be beaten by a guy that you watched fall off the map only to appear in front of you.Nintendo MUST address this issue in either this game or the next installment.  If they don't I'm sure a lot of people will pass on purchasing it.I just can't understand what pleasure people get from cheating in video games.  Do you really feel good about yourself when you win a race by using glitches when you obviously lack pure talent at playing it??The only positive thing about these cheaters is how fun it is to beat them playing the right way.Overall, this is one of the greatest games I've ever played.

So, whta do we have...Roster Update? Check. Improved Graphics? Check. New EA tracks? Check. In short,Madden is getting there...it's slowly but surely starting to get up to the standards that NFL 2K5 set FOUR years ago.Is it me, or do you have a feeling that this SHOULD have been Madden 08?Let's quickly talk about some of what EA finally got right...and believe it or not a lot of those things are small nitpicky things that have bugged me for years.1. Commentary....FINALLY after 3 tries they finally have 2 man play by play and it's decent! I still think Visual Concepts did it a bit better but in most ways, EA finally gets this one right and Cris Collinsworth and Tom Hammond sounds pretty well together but it also does need some work as they hardly ever say the names of players during the game.2. TV presentation style - EA got it right but you still have to ask the, if they have access to the ESPN licence along with exclusivity, wny not rip the page out of 2K5's book and run with it? But...you can't complain too much as what is given this year still feels a lot less clunky than last year and marshall Faulk's pregame crap is gone...however, they still could have left in the pre game intro.Also, Chris Collinsworth with the telestrator is a welcome improvement and gives you more of a feel of 'watching' the game.3. More animations and enhanced graphics- by far this is one of the nicest looking games released in awhile....the stadiums look more alive now that they have varied the look and AI of the crowds. There are more on field animations from the players and a lot less broken animations from broken up plays...but...where are the refs?? The lighting effects are nicer this time around really giving you a feel of 'being there' at the prescribed time of day...even the weather effects as stated really do have an effect...a lot more sliding around and uglier games in worse weather and of course uni's getting dirty. The sidelines also show a big improvement.4. The AI is getting better on D as some plays that were easily paydirt plays are constantly getting shut down and the D will definently adjust more as you keep using certain plays so it's wise to learn to use audibles a bit more especially in hurry up situaions. The AI also seems to be getting better managing the ball in late game situaions...I have seen too many times in past maddens when the AI attempts ot run the ball late in the 4 the quarter when they need to be throwing it deep and this iteration, you really do and some teams depending on the QB is also going to stretch the field on you if they can.What are some things that still need improving on.1. The franchise mode - There was so many things that Madden 04 and 05 did right that made the franchise mode fun and I still can't see why they won't bring it back to the next gen systems...I kind of enjoyed managing my team syadiums and tix prices and so on....but none of that has made it back....and BTW until or unless EA comes out with a roster update, you will have to manually make changes to Favre, Thaylor and Pennington. Also I still would like to see other game highlights and scores while my game is playing...I mean come on EA...that's going to determine how much harder I am going to play if I can see how the rest of my division is doing thru that Sunday!!!2. The halftime show.....ok...so they finally got rid of the cheerleaders last year...but come on now, 2K5 had it down to a T....EA get on the band wagon...again you have the ESPN licence...what are you guys waiting on?3. More Realism - Where is the cart for injured players? Where arethe refs? Where is the chain gang? EA we are 4 iterations into the NEXT GEN...get with it!! Speaking of the refs...is it just me or can I barely understand him at times?4. Sound - sigh....when is EA going to stop using the SAME CANNED crowds sound from 199X??? again, this is something that 2K5 had a bit more on the right side that EA really needs to improve. Crowds boo at dumb plays...they get seriously hyped as a great play goes...if Adrian Peterson breaks out into an open field run on the way to a TD, I should hear the stadium explode...not the same sounding static.Finally some things EA needs to dump.1. The rewind mode - 'nuff said....you didn't want that play broken...you shouldn't have picked it...suck it up. Thankfully you can turn that feature off.2. Madden IQ - if you play one really good game, the next one rachets itself up too high for you to keep up plus you can adjust your diffulty level so why bother? Definently the gimmick for this year.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2008"}

Aside from the Start and Select buttons, all of the functions are analog for greater control, a wider variety of operations, and a more compelling interactive experience.

E Jackson","summary":"brilliant 20 years ago, brilliant now, and probably brilliant forever","reviewText":"I don't understand why some people have a problem with the original Metroid.  There's really only ONE minor flaw- on more than one occasion, you'll find yourself inside a room that appears to be exactly the same as a room you've been to before, but with very minor changes separating the two, such as enemies in one room, and nothing in the other room.  That's it.  Some occasional *minor* confusion understanding the difference between a few of the rooms.That's the only problem with the game.  Even then, the game is pretty small so you shouldn't have THAT much of a hard time with it.  You shouldn't be spending THAT much time confused and scratching your head where to go and what to do.There's nothing else to complain about.  The original NES Metroid *is* a classic.  The excellent theme music in EVERY SINGLE AREA OF THE GAME, the constant arcade-style shooting action (and need I remind you that NO other Metroid game gives you *this* much shooting action) the creepy atmosphere of being stuck inside a dark planet with enemies that seem to crawl, fly, or zig zag all OVER the place, constantly.  It's a lot of fun shooting or avoiding these enemies, and the game is so much fun words can't even describe how GREAT the experience is.  Replay value indeed.I was a child in the 80's and remember playing this game over and over as I found new areas and felt the excitement when I finally figured out what I was supposed to do.  Remember the first time we reached that part near the beginning where we had to work our way UP that lengthy blue-colored area with spikey creatures crawling around and rippers flying back and forth?  Remember when we said to ourselves \"Man, is this thing ever going to END or am I supposed to keep climbing forever?\"  And remember when we finally found a door after all that climbing and breathed a sigh of relief?  Didn't you realize this game was something much different from the other NES games at the time?  THAT'S what makes a game a classic.There was nothing else like this game back in the day.  A space shooter that was ALSO an action game with fantastic gameplay, and even a platformer for that matter.  The game requires lots of climbing and exploring.  The music in the more maze-like areas fit *extremely* well with the confusion of trying to find your way out of each area.  Absolutely a great game.Sure, it's short by todays standards, but the two hours it takes for me to blow through the game is time well spent.  The password system was also really cool because you had to write down extremely long passwords.  This is a good thing because there's a mysterious feeling to the dead quiet sound of a password appearing on screen after you were killed.People who dismiss this game are spoiled by either Super Metroid's superior graphics and gameplay, or even worse, spoiled by the drastically different Metroid Prime games.  Remember, I was AROUND in the 80's and got to experience this classic game when it was brand new.  That's why I can appreciate it for the masterpiece it is.  Atmosphere, gameplay, music, memories, that dreaded feeling of hopelessness and fear when you believed you were stuck in certain areas, you name it.  This game has it all, baby.Don't be afraid of a challenge (though I've never believed the game was as difficult as most people) and don't be afraid of a game that's old.  EVERYTHING will be old one day.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2008"}

I saw my parents playing it, and I had to play it of course. I think the thing that took my breath away the most was the idea of being able to play in one huge world and gain abilites by finding items. The difficulty was very high, so I had plenty reason to come back for more, as well. The GBA version of Metroid is much easier, in my opinion, due to the fact that you don't need to imput the passwords over and over again. That is the only flaw in this game: the passwords are confusing as heck. It uses lower and upper case letters, as well as a plethora of numbers and punctuation marks, so it is easy to write down something and get confused later on ( zeros look like o's...). Anyway, next to Super Metroid this is probably the greatest video game ever made, and expresses what a good video game is all about: Using your brain power to achieve something that is not only complicated, but fun. This is an open-ended game which is one huge level. Unlike Contra, Adventure Island and all those classic NES games, Metroid was one huge level which was intertwined and allowed the player to interract with the environment (ex: shooting a creature with the ice beam, then blowing a few blocks away above your head to reveal a hidden passage). It's hard to express how fun this game was, and still is.Graphics- 10/10 When it cam out, the graphics were top of the line and the environments look pretty awesome, especially the Norfair, Ridley, and Kraid environments. The backrounds are in many different textures and colors. Some environemts are downright creepy (the purple orbs in Norfair, and the purple drooping rock-esque things on the ceiling for example, or the big structures of the alien heads on the walls before you enter Kraids and Ridleys lairs, also the creepy structure before you fight Kraid and Ridley.), while others just fit in perfectly with the enemies and music themes. Each of the enemies has an interesting designs, and for its time the bosses were pretty cool.Music- 10/10 The Brinstar theme has got to be the catchiest and most memorable music theme out of any video game...ever. The other themes are great as well, especially the Kraid, Norfair, and Ridley themes. The music is quite atmospheric and sets the tone for the exploration quite perfectly, making it not only fun to explore, but pleasing to the ears as well. Music plays a big role in this game.Controls- 10/10 For its time, Metroid played extremely smooth, and Samus controlled great. It was one of, if not the first game to allow you to aim upward, making it a lot better. Sure you can duck down or aim diagnolly.. but this was NES, not Playstation 2, remember?Gameplay- 100/10 One hundred out of ten. This game took the idea of gameplay which was created by titles such as Super Mario Bros and just blew it away. There are countless items and powerups to collect, each uniquely hidden and well worth it. Metroid was the first game to really utilize exploration, unlike other games which were purely level-to-level. Sure, sometimes things are hidden in a ridiculous manor compared to games these days (having to blow away some random block to unveal the next room), but I think this only made the game more unique and durable. I mean, having to search for new rooms was not only thrilling, but it really made it feel like you were Samus embarking on a bounty hunter mission against the aliens of Zebes. Gameplay is absolutely flawless.Overall-10/10 This is probably the greatest NES game ever made, and I think everyone (kids or adults) should play this game, for it is not only brain-teasing, but is also quite fun. If you can look past its dated graphics and what-not, you will see that for its time everything was great, and to me it still looks as good as it did before. I cannot recommend this any more.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

The freezing can be frustrating, but is still playable and beatable.If you are wanting to play the 3rd chapter of the series, this game is mandatory, as the third title picks up exactly where this one leaves off. So, don't go trying to skip ahead or it won't make as much sense.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2013"}
{"product_name":"B003O680ZY","description":"","reviewerName":"W. freeman","summary":"Fun and Exciting with flaws","reviewText":"The first thing you'll notice right off the bat(if you've played the old Motorstorms) is that it now has somewhat of a non-story. Tries to but fails. There is no point for a racing game like this to have a story, no one cares, i just skip through the little cut scenes in between races. The game is very fun, and keeps you on edge with all the chaos it inssues, that's not a problem at all. The problem is the game is way to short and you can open every track without having to qualify, which can be tough, or very easy. The graphics look good, but from what i've heard a lot of different people stepped on board this time, some makers of 2k games Borderlands being the most obvious, from a graphical perspective. The game really looks nothing like the others, but then again is the Apocalypse, so it's suppose to be totally different. I find it very tense making buildings fall, tornadoes throwing things at you, helicopters, waves, and just an over sense of pure chaos. So that's why i give it a thumbs up. Thats for gameplay. Graphically it's one of the lesser good looking PS3 exclusives to hit the console. Rushed perhaps? The steering control is much better, but the over the top psychics when wrecking are totally gone. GrrrOther than that it is what it says, racing with things crashing burning and falling all around you, nothing more nothing less. I dig it just because it's a welcome change, i just wish more time had went into the car designs(which look awful) and the overall detailing and textures of the scenery. Sometimes it looks good, others it looks almost like the GOOD PS2 graphics. Oh well, it works for me, although it should be 30 bucks, not 60. But luckily i had lots of games to trade in, and only paid like 10. Enjoy if you will.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-10-2011"}

Its useful and it works, for a pretty long period of time, but when it does stop working (and it will), everything you had saved on it, is never recoverable (as far as I know).  Memory cards for game consoles are certainly something of the past, and for good reason.  I wish the PlayStation 1 and 2 had internal hard drives to store the data on, but the fact they didn't helped attribute to their cost effective pricing to reach a wider market of consumers at the time.  I'm sure there are some modifications you can make to a PlayStation 1 or 2 to give it a internal hard drive to store data such as save games, but because it was never released that way, I don't plan to attempt to modify it like that.Essentially, get a memory card if you need one, because they work and they're pretty much all you can use anyway.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2013"}

Players will find familiar names like Glass Joe, King Hippo and trainer Doc Louis. These boxers come to life again in cell-shaded 3-D, complete with hilarious fighting animations and backstories that capture all the fun and flair of the originalPunch-Out!!games.The Wii's Motion SensitivityThe motion-sensitive controls of the Wii console mean that when players throw punches, Little Mac throws punches as well. Additionally, you can control hooks and jabs by combining motion control with control-stick movement. The motion-sensing Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers turn real-life swings into on-screen punches, so anyone can play. The game can also be played with classic NES-style controls by turning the Wii Remote sideways.CharactersPunch-Out!!features a total of 13 opponents for Little Mac to step into the ring with. 12 of which are returning from previous games in thePunch-Out!!series. Each have their own backstory and patterns of attacks to learn and learn to counter. Just a few of the characters you can expect to see are:Little MacSmall but extremely game, Little Mac is a young, up-and-coming fighter, who with the help of his trainer, ex-champion Doc Lewis, has set his sights on working his way through the ranks.Glass JoeA fearful French fighter due to his extremely weak chin, Glass Joe will crumple to the mat quickly with just a few well-placed shots, making him an easy mark and a good warm-up for the fighters to follow.King HippoKing Hippo is both huge and an immensely powerful fighter, but can be weakened with the right combinations to the head and body, giving you time to go for the knockout if you can survive his onslaught.Von KaiserAn old-timey fighter whose rumored childhood difficulties have left him eager to dish out punishment in the ring, Von Kaiser is a dangerous opponent, but one who will turn tail if you can find his weakness.Special AttacksPlayers can obtain special 'Star Punches,' which allow Little Mac to take more health from his rival in a single punch. Players can now use multiple stars in a single punch for an extra-powerful attack.Controller OptionsPunch-Out!!features multiple controller options. For players looking to take advantage of the Wii's motion control capabilities,Punch-Out!!uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers to simulate throwing punches. Use the Nunchuck to throw a left punch and the Wii Remote to throw a right punch. Fans of the NES version and core gamers will be excited to see Nintendo has also included the option to playPunch-Out!!using the classic layout from the original NES controller. Use the 1 and 2 buttons along with the cross pad to throw hooks and jabs or to dodge.","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Punch-Out is back!","reviewText":"Who could forget Punch-Out for the NES?  I know I can't, playing as Little Mac and getting my butt handed to me by Mike Tyson over and over again.  Well, let's fast-forward to 2009 now, and Nintendo has brought Punch-Out back for the Wii, minus Mike Tyson of course, and the kind of oh so fun gameplay that made the original game so good is wonderfully re-created here with this new Punch-Out.  The themes of the original game are re-vitalized, with the same presentation of the original Punch-Out re-created with some modern 3-D elements that end up making the game look surprisingly great in the graphics department, and the fluid animation only adds to the visual experience.  Gameplay wise, the formula remains the same, as Punch-Out requires having quick reflexes and recognizing your opponent's fighting patterns is the big key to success.  Once you manage to grasp those elements, the game becomes a blast to play through.  The lack of online however is a gaping hole, but there's enough replayability here with the main three circuits, facing tougher versions of previous fighters, and of course, VS mode.  All in all, the new Punch-Out for the Wii is a blast to play, and fans of the original should definitely pick this up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00C7103JI","description":"Warner Bros. Batman: Arkham Origins 1000381344 PC Games","reviewerName":"Da Jester","summary":"Batman: Arkham Meh","reviewText":"Of course it's going to be hard to follow up on Rocksteady's track record after two critically acclaimed game titles that invigorated the Batman franchise back into this entertainment genre. This entry in the Arkham franchise is one attempt after the other that honestly does not serve more than just to kill time for the next Arkham game. Yes, I understand that this is an origins story for the Arkham game versions of Batman, but there is nothing really special about it. You can honestly skip this entry altogether.Because to me, it's barely an Origins story. Arkham Origins suffers from the same issues that most movie prequels or game prequels do: looks too clean and has better technology than the source. It tries to be more advanced because it's a newer entry, but fails at the purpose. I just find it hard to understand that Batman already has all of his gadgets at his disposal, including a version of the Bat Wing, but not the Bat-mobile? WB were challenged to bring an experience that will ultimately just be more familiar, rather than a new feat. Parts of the open world \"Gotham,\" you will recognize immediately from Arkham City. Boss encounters were marketed as a highlight, but they are nothing but just filler. Heck, one of them literally is a press a button press. It's actually humorously done, but also a disapointment. Seaking of, I'm not spoiling anything here, but they did market the heck out of Deathstroke (which makes no sense why he is here and not attacking the Teen Titans). Overall, he's wasted here eventhough he was the best encounter of all of the assassins. Don't expect too much from the rest. These are more thought out than the previous two games, but most of them are QTEs and minion zerg challenges. In fact two are just plain aggrivating instead of fun. Also, I noticed some parts either boss or regular thug fights that I think the game was still not polished. There are bugs, but I swear the game cheated me out of Perfect Dark Knight combos.Now, I will point out that I was impressed by Troy Baker's job on the Joker. You can honestly say that he sounds like a younger version of Mark Hamil's voice. However, I personally wished they shouldn't have bothered with adding the Joker in this title. Batman has so many in his rogue's gallery, but WB decided to include the normal few we have dealt with twice by now. Even Joker has an \"origin section.\" And when you think WB actaully entered new territory, it becomes another \"meh, oh well. same 'ol, same 'ol\" situation. Don't worry, I didn't spoil anything really, Joker is marketed as well and it just feels tacked on instead of uniquely dark and insane. All of these attempts to \"explain the relationships\" are like Star Trek into Dorkness's ending. It's too forced and kind of misses the point rather than be meaningful. This new voice for a younger Batman....eh, it was okay, but you'll miss Kevin Conroy immediately. The game is created with the Unreal engine and it just shows here. WB created cutscenes this time to push the story and they are nothing special. Unless you perfer more \"GRR I AM ANGRY, I SMASH THE COMPUTER! GRR\" moments.If you thought Bats was bulky in the past two games, this suit reminded me of something from Gears of War. Fat-man.Even the side content is more forced instead of a fun distraction. For example, we have the Riddl-I mean Enigma trophy collecting...again. Even Anarky's content didn't make me want to get side tracked (honestly, he wasn't that great of a villian in the 90s). Another feature they added was the crime scene investigation parts. I hate beating a dead horse but they are not that interesting or unique. It's more of \"hold the button down and have Batman figure it all out for you\" situation. Instead of being interested in why and how the crime happened, it's just more filler content for WB to tack on \"he's a detective!\" The attempt for Arkham Origins side content is appreciative, but done poorly. I ended up just playing the story and barley touched some of the side content. I didn't find it as interesting as trying to 100% Arkham City or Asylum. Multiplayer was skipped completey. I Was never interested when it was annouced and I still don't care. I did put a good 17 hours total into the campaign before uninstalling (that is also counting the Cold, Cold, Heart DLC and trying out Challenge Maps).And see, that brings up my point. I kept both copies of the previous two games because they are fun and amazing Batman games to play. This one, a DC or adventure video game fan will most likely trade thier copy in or uninstall to save HD space for Arkham Knight. Arkham Origins really tries to stand out from the rest, but it's attempts are just in vain. Buy this one cheap and play it as a filler. That is all it's worth, honestly.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2014"}

It pushed the limits of the system in terms of graphics.  While the visuals for wandering around seem rather easy for the system to create, the battles are a spectacular achievement.  Even though the characters and enemies are shown as animated sprites.  The sprites themselves are not much to write home about, but regardless they are quite convincing and suit the battle setup more than you might expect.  The battle screen is sort of a \"quasi-3D\" setup.  The background and sprites are 2D, but they are executed in such a manner that they look 3D.  Not only that, battle effects, such as spells and simple attacks, add wonderfully to the setup.  The only real problem I can see is that some spell effects slow down the framerates (how fast or smoothly it runs) noticably, but it's all handled so well that it doesn't even seem like a glitch, and out of sheer irony it adds to the effect of some of the spells (hence, it may have been done that way on purpose).The sound is a mixed bag.  The music score part is excellent.  Everything from the main menu music, to town themes, and the grand world map music is great both technically and melodically.  If any songs do get on your nerves, they either won't last long or are done in such a way that you can tune them out while playing.  Sound effects, however, are very standard.  A lot of them are recycled so much that it's practically mind numbing.  However, none of it seems completely out of place, and there isn't much that will hurt your ears, so that's something to be happy for.The gameplay itself only has one real flaw in my opinion.  The battles are too easy.  With the exception of most of the boss battles, regular battles tend to be so easy that the thought of using the run option will never occur to you (they also go so quick that there's not really a time issue involved either).  There's also an issue where, if you set all of your characters to attack one enemy and that enemy is destroyed, the characters that attack him later have their attack wasted.  This really isn't too much of an issue, though, and Camelot was smart enough to make the character automatically defend if that should happen (which means damage to that character would be halved... though I think that only refers to physical damage).The story has gotten a lot of bad press in my opinion.  However, it should be noted that if you play this game, the story alone may persuade you to buy the next game, GS: The Lost Age (which is already out).  While that's not particularly a bad thing, as the combination of the two stories is really awesome, just be aware of the extra expense that may cost for your wallet.  Also, it should be noted that this game is a bit on the short side (roughly 20-25 hours), but that's still not much of an issue in my view (just so you know, the second game in the series is roughly 40-45 hours long, so that one is lengthier).All in all, the game is quite fun.  However, there are a few quirks that I mentioned above that may get on some people's nerves, so just know what you're getting into.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2004"}

{"product_name":"B0002SQ0BS","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"Game greatly improved on all aspects.","reviewText":"Sam Fisher is back once again.  This time he must find the source of the barrage of information attacks causing blackouts and unexplained attacks on US targets.The first thing you will notice about this game is that it is huge compared to the first two splinter cell's.  Look at the manual and you will notice it is unbelievably thick.  This is because there is so much things that Sam can do.  All of Sam's tools and gadgets carry over to CT, but he now has some new ones.  He can use his pistol to disrupt the functionality of most electrical components.  No more having to fire your pistol to shoot out lights and making a lot of noise as the glass breaks.  With the EV, Sam can just shoot a laser at the light and the light will flicker off within a few seconds.  He can also do the same to computer screens, TV's and radios, which drives the enemies mad. Perhaps that coolest new thing he can do in this area is that he can wirelessly hack into PC's even while someone is sitting at the desk.  Now is that cool or what?Sam's SCK-20 has a few upgrades that allow you to use different attachments.  In addition to the launcher attachment that allows you to fire camera, shockers, grenades, etc, there is also foregrip, sniper and shotgun attachments.  The Foregrip allows Sam to aim the SCK-20 with more accuracy.  The sniper attachment turns the gun into a Sniper rifle.  I haven't used it yet, but will choose it on my next mission.  Finally there is a shotgun attachment for the times when you just want to let the enemies know you mean business.  Its very noisy, but if you get to point where you have to use it, you probably don't care anyway.  The only drawback to these new attachments is that you can only choose one per mission.  So you can't go into a mission with both the sniper and the shotgun.  It kind of sucks, but I suppose it wouldn't be very realistic anyway.Sam this time now has a lot of lethal moves in addition to his non-lethal attacks.  When you grab and enemy from behind, you can elect to choke them until they are unconscious, or perform a lethal, like ramming a combat knife into his back or push them off a balcony sending them to their death.  Sam can also perform attacks without having to grab an enemy, you can kill them by slitting their throats or stab them in the heart.  Or you can elect to knock them out by hitting them in the head or kicking them.  I recall one level where I kicked this guy so hard he went flying head first into a nearby fire extinguisher causing it to go off.  Yes Sam is RAW in this game.  If this wasn't enough you can also kill (by breaking their neck) or knock out enemies while you are hanging upside down from a pipe!!  One of my favorite things to do however is while Sam's hanging off of a cliff or balcony, he can reach up and grab an enemy and toss him over the railing sending him to his death!  I think UBISOFT got a lot of requests from SC players requesting more lethal attacks and they responded brilliantly.  Sam's demeanor has also changed, in judging from his conversations with Lambert.  However you don't HAVE to kill to advance in this game.  If you like you can go through most of the game without killing anyone, so the stealth aspect is still there and is still encouraged in many levels.  I still prefer stealth, but will occasionally kill depending what kind of mood I'm in.  I like the fact that UBISOFT now gives players a choice.  One thing I forgot to mention is that Sam can now also bash a door in, almost certainly knocking out the person on the other side.The graphics in this game are much crisper than Pandora tomorrow and look a lot better than the graphics on the original SC.  The environment movements are so life like, it's almost scary.  The lighting is once again done brilliantly, allowing you to still be able to look at shadows to estimate where the enemy is standing just around the corner.The sound is also a step above the previous two installments.  Depending on what country you are in, the locals and enemies accents will change.  The environment sounds are also very lifelike.  On certain levels, you can hear the annoying sound of mosquitoes and flies buzzing around your head.  High pitched buzzing from flies and mosquitoes always makes my nose itch, and when I heard those sounds while playing the game I, had to constantly pause the game and rub my nose.  I was glad to get off that level!The story this time around is better than PT, but still seems to jump around a lot and is kind of hard to follow.  I still think the original SC had the best story line.  With that being said, the story line is still very good, and I like the fact that UBISOFT went back to full news broadcasts, instead of cutting them off constantly like they did in PT.There is also a Co-op mode in this game which allows you to play story mode with someone else simultaneously.  That's right two \"Sams\" on the same mission at the same time.  After I finish single player,  I'll try to convince the wife to play Co-op with me.  If you are unable to find anyone to play with you in person, there is also XBOX Live.  I cancelled my XBOX Live account 3 months ago, so there is no need for me to review that potion of the game.My disappointments in the game are as follows.  1)  The manual doesn't do a very good job in telling you how to use your new weapons and moves.  I couldn't figure out for the life of me how to use the shotgun attachment, until finally I went online and asked somebody.  The manual did not mention how to do this it all!  In addition it does not tell you how to use the laser mic.  I will be going online to figure out how to use this as well.  A training mission would have been perfect, but for some reason, UBISOFT felt that it they didn't need to include it this time.  I feel sorry for the person who never played SC before; they will almost certainly be lost and confused.  2). While some comical dialog is welcome in some aspects of the game, sometimes it just goes too far and ends up being corny.  For instance, the enemies that have no problem killing you at a moments notice turn into complete p****** when you grab and interrogate them, they whine entirely too much saying there going to piss their pants, or they should have stayed in bed this morning.  It would have been cool if some people did that, but it seems that every guy you grab and interrogate does the same thing.One thing I must mention is that UBISOFT got rid of the checkpoint system!  FINALLY!  You can now Save your game whenever you want.  No more redoing a section over and over and over again just because you got killed 2 feet from the checkpoint.  This is a welcome addition by myself and I can imagine many more gamers.  If they do the same in the new RS3, then I will be doubly happy!!Overall, this game is very good being ALMOST as good as the original.  While this game improved in all aspects from the previous two installments, I can't play it for very long periods of time.  Don't get me wrong, this game is fun, but I just can't play it as long as I could with the first SC.  Maybe I am just getting old. I generally don't give 5 stars unless the game is 99% perfect, but because I want to distinguish this from PT which I gave 4 stars (rounded up from 3.8). Had this been a 10 scale rating system, this game would easily get a 9.5.  But because it's only a five scale system, I have no choice but to give this game all five stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2005"}

I didn't like it.  I'm not a fan of trial and error gameplay and the game was completely filled with it.  And, while realistic I'm sure, setting off alarms was too easy and unforgiving.Splinter Cell 2 did a better job of smoothing out the problems of the first while including a cool online portion but it still had trial and error gameplay that I couldn't get into.Finally, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is out and it is grand.When I first started to play the single player game, I was amazed at how much more forgiving the system was.  Not to say it was dumbed down or easier, I still got my ass handed to me, but it was more fair.  And if I made a mistake it didn't necessarily spell total disaster.  Overall, it's still a lot of the same from before, except that in this case you are given much more freedom in how you want to go about your missions and you can, in fact, use those high-powered weapons you were given without worry.Then there's the multi-player portion which is amazing.  The co-op mode is fully fleshed out, allowing two people to play either split screen, system link or through Live.  New moves are given for team attacks and for various ways of solving situations.  Gameplay is fun and exciting, it's a natural extension of the single-player experience and makes me wonder why it took for the third game for them to include it.  My only complaint is that there aren't many co-op levels but hopefully this will be remedied through downloads through Live.As if those two modes aren't enough, there's the merc vs. spy multi-player from the second Splinter Cell.  Maps from the second game and new ones are included.  Very awesome.  Nothing like going up against real people for a change.Astoundingly, the graphics have been increased in this game.  I didn't know how they could do it, but they did.  Environments are more realistic, the shadows are better, everything is much much better.  Audio is also stellar and if you have the ability for 5.1 you will be in for a treat.I don't like repeating other reviewers out there so I don't think I can say much more.  It's a fun game mostly, that incorporates some real cool moves.  If you liked the original two but wanted more freedom in how you go about things, then this game is for you.  It took three games but I am finally a Splinter Cell believer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2005"}

Doesn't Use it.","reviewText":"The way over-hyped game Haze is worth checking out. It is similar to Halo. If you enjoy Halo you will probably like Haze. The co-op option of the game is fun. My biggest gripe about this game is it gets quite repetitive very fast. The dialog and little in-game movies are stupid and get annoying within the first few minutes.I was looking forward to this game and was disappointed. Graphics are good, but not as amazing or quick as I expected for a high-def PS3 only game. Here are the pros and cons...PROS:-Sound is pretty good.-Control isn't bad once you get used to it.-Graphics are pretty good, but not as great as expected.CONS:-Graphics are just ok. For what else is out right now, these graphics are a little plain and not very creative.-Maps are boring, repetitive and plain.-Game play has been done over and over again.-Nectar is a cool touch, but not used to the extent or creativity that it could have been.-The game gets very repetitive very fast.-Teammates are idiot jocks that get annoying real quick. And they swear a lot.-No sprint option. Really really stupid. It is 2008 and we can't run in a game. What the heck.Over-all this FPS game is worth checking out. It is entertaining at parts but Haze does not use its full potential. If you are used to good games like Half-Life 2, Uncharted, Resistance or Gears of War you will probably be disappointed. Not a horrible game but don't expect to be blown away.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2008"}
{"product_name":"B004X56PWK","description":"","reviewerName":"The_Scrutiny","summary":"Easily one of the best Sonic games ever made","reviewText":"Sonic Generations was made to please fans of both classic and modern Sonic. You'll race through levels from various Sonic games throughout the ages, experiencing waves and waves of nostalgia as you go. But this game relies upon far more than fond memories. Here's my breakdown:Story:If you must know, Dr. Eggman and Dr. Robutnik have teamed up to mess up time. As the 2 Sonics, you'll race through the worlds at top speed to restore places and rescue friends. Speaking of Sonic's friends, you'll cringe every time they have a dialogue. It's that bad. Anyways, no one plays these games for story, so I'll just dock a point for lame voice acting.Score: 4/5Graphics/Setting:What I've always appreciated about Sonic games is the fact that they don't follow the whole photo-realistic craze. You'll dash through bright, refreshing environments that take you all over Sonic's history, starting with Green Hill Zone way back from Sonic the Hedgehog 1 to Planet Wisp from the recent Sonic Colors. The more familiar you are with Sonic games, the more you'll get out of Generations because of nostalgia, but anyone will enjoy it regardless. Speaking of nostalgia, this game does NOT play it safe by merely copying and pasting the levels it draws from. These are levels with obviously similar themes, but redesigned structure, so they feel both old and new in the best possible ways. And it's always a pleasure to play modern versions of classic levels and vice versa. The levels feel just right no matter which Sonic you play as.Score: 5/5Gameplay:As classic Sonic, you'll utilize the famous spin dash, smash in TV boxes containing rings and powerups, and bounce off enemies on your way to the familiar banner at the end of the level. As modern Sonic, you'll boost at break-neck speeds, homing-attack bots, and stomp your way to the giant ring goal. A quick note: don't worry about moving so fast that you won't be able to see obstacles coming; the game is pretty fair about reaction time. However, you'll still need to know levels inside and out for a smooth run, and this applies to both Sonics. The game mixes things up by giving you optional skills. These are welcome enhancements that do things like give you the signature fire/water/lightning shields or make you brake faster. The number of skills you can equip is limited, so you'll have to strategize which skills to use for which levels. Levels themselves are a blast to play. You'll never tire of discovering and taking shortcuts, all the while listening to the incredible soundtracks provided for each version of levels. Even better, YOU CAN CHANGE the soundtracks for levels by choosing from unlocked music in the gallery! If you're still not convinced about this game I have 2 words for you: Super Sonics.Score: 5/5Missions:And here is where Sega could have gone with the policy \"less is more.\" When you're not zipping through the 18 main levels, you might be engaging in not-so-fun side missions. These have you collecting a certain number of rings or making it to the goal with limited time. There are even some that feature a friend. These missions are nowhere near as fun as the main stages and there are 30 of these that completionists will feel obligated to muddle through. At least they offer soundtracks and artwork upon beating them. One of my favorite things about Generations, though, are the red rings. There are 5 of these in each main level and collecting all 5 yield skills to use. The best part is that you'll get hints on where these are found, and they usually are found on shortcut routes, serving as a guide for the quickest way through a stage. Very clever, Sega.Score: 4/5Overall:This is such a remarkable game, and it's a well-needed break from the myriad of realistic-looking shooter games flooding the console market nowadays. This game will test your skills as you race through beautiful, well-designed worlds, learning shortcuts and memorizing routes. Classic and modern Sonic are both great fun to play as. Skill sets add a welcome strategic element to gameplay, and the soundtrack is stellar. My few complaints are somewhat tedious side missions and lame friend characters. These are easy to overlook in the grand scheme of things. Trust me, from the moment you start up this game, greeted by the unforgettable Genesis era menu music, you'll be enchanted. Beware! Nostalgia awaits!Overall score: 4.5/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0047TG2R0","description":"","reviewerName":"A Hot Whizzer Summer...","summary":"Dragon Age 2 is a decent addition","reviewText":"I can really only say it is about as good as Awakening, but not Origins. I have beaten the game now, although I wrote this review after 8 hours of play, I still agree with just about everything I wrote. So the game hasn't picked up or \"gotten better\". I have dropped the score to 3 stars.Story: This is the first failure in my book. The story seems to lack cohesion. Where the first story was steady and true, you had a purpose and followed that purpose, and each of your companions were met in turn, this story is just a mess. You meander around picking up quest after quest and companion after companion, who follow you for no particular reason whatsoever other than \"I owe you one\" . For example, one of them becomes a captain of the guard, but still remains your companion, as if that even makes sense, like she/he could make week long expositions while having a steady job.Gameplay: For the most part, the gameplay remains relatively unchanged. The commands, giving commands, and the abilities all feel and run the same. It's faster pace, with you swinging you sword or casting spells wickedly fast, but other than that, it is surprisingly familiar. The enemies are weaker, but they throw more of them at you at once. This leads to another one of my problems with it. They have your enemies hidden until you run into them. You can't scout out and see your enemies ahead of you; Instead, they simply pop up in front of you. You then proceed to fight waves and waves of enemies that magical appear all around you. They literally jump from the sky and land, as if every attack was a carefully planned execution from the rooftops.Menu and levels: The new menu is mostly a slicker less gritty version of the old one. It isn't better or worst. The \"level up\" options are almost the same, except that you can now see more clearly how each change of your stats effects you. Rather than having all the ability placed on one page, they are now scattered by section and \"gridded\" so that in order to learn some abilities you need to learn others. In the end, it is just a fancy and less efficient way to display the same thing with the same abilities. I preferred to be able to read my options and see all criteria on one page, so in my opinion, this is less enjoyable. The new dialogue wheel, taken from the concepts of Mass Effect, is something I hate greatly. More often than not, the few word summary they give you does not accurately represent what your character says, so you end up saying things you didn't intend to, and there is no way to predict when and how much the text deviates from the words spoken.Maps are reused shamelessly. Not only do you need to repeatedly go through the same areas over and over again (at least once per act), but they also reuse the same maps as different areas. You end up with a large elaborate map for a mansion or cave, then each different mansions or cave with certain doors passable and other doors locked, thus allowing you to travel through a unique path... but you are really just repeating the same map over and over again, but might be going through it backwards, or having these two doors blocked instead of these two. This hits the score the hardest of anything in my mind. They shameless reuse the same maps over and over again for different environments. Origin did do this, but not nearly to this extent. Within 8 hours of play, I had repeated a single map 3 times for 3 different areas. That is very inexcusable.Other Changes from origins: Other changes include the dog now being a \"summon\" rather than a character that actual takes up a form slot(I believe this is an addon), which I prefer. You can no longer speak to your companions except in their own \"location\", so no having conversations when you are out and about, even in a city. The companions no longer have traditional armor, but wear an unique upgradable single armor piece, you are the only one that needs all the pieces of armor. Also crafting, including runes and herbs, is now done at shops unique to that purpose rather than by individuals...Overall: So all in all, the game hasn't impressed me so far. The lackluster introduction of each of the companions is put together so sloppily that it is discouraging at best. The story has no real direction. Nonetheless, the game is still fun, offers a faster past version of the combat system you may have learned to love, and there are some things they have gotten right. It's still a game worth looking at, but you might consider waiting for a price drop.I know it sounds pretty bleak from my diagnosis of the game, but everything else about the game is classic Dragon Age, and if you like that, and can dismiss every thing I mentioned as not a problem or inconsequential, then you know this is the game for you.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2011"}

Jensen","summary":"Riddicks eyes=your eyes","reviewText":"This game was awesome, as a fan of the Riddick movies it was great to get some slight backstory to them, and take control of Riddick and deliver some of his kick A fighting to anyone you feel like. While taking control of Riddick, I do feel as if I am Riddick. When I tilt his view upward, I always feel as if I'm looking up also and I get the same insecurity feeling (as I'm constently remind there's tons of empty space that way.). When it's silent I get nervous and excited, and when Riddick gets hit, I feel connected the character.Other aspects I enjoyed was how different each escape plan was, first one is a mix of stealth and carnage, second was pure stealth, third was run for life in carnage and the fourth was execution madness, Terminator style. Vin Diesal returning as Riddick was the best thing that could've happened to this game, he portrays Riddick as good as ever, with the same humor and menace. Other character's personalities were great to see. And the graphics for this game were nice to view.The fight scenes were very satisfying and the stealth aspect was surprisingly fun. Although I should point out something, they say in the guide that guards never look up, when you're on a overhang ladder. They actually do look up, minus the guard in the tutorial section.I should also mention that after you've beaten the game once, it saves each section on the main screen, so you can go back and relive any part you desire to experience again.I've seen this game on the dark fury disc, but I prefer this retro, as for some reason the controls feel better and I feel as if I am the character seeing the world and knowing what's there. If that doesn't make sense let's use another example, in Halo 1 I felt in perfect tune with the character and transitions between vehicle and on foot were easy. In Halo 3 I felt as if I was not in tune with the character and the world was too complex. And to be honest I was fine with the graphics already.I love this game and constently replayed back in the day. A good ride.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2012"}

{"product_name":"B001NIP3EG","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"Better Than the Original In Many Ways","reviewText":"I just wrapped up my second playthru Bioshock 2 and finally tried the online portion of the game. Without a doubt Bioshock 2 is a fantastic game that eclipses the original Bioshock in many ways. Only a few things keep the game from being one of the very best.First things first, Bioshock 2 pits you as Subject Delta, an atmospheric diving suit wearing Big Daddy that returns to Rapture in search of the Little Sister that he was paired with. Players familiar with the original Bioshock will be immediately at home with the story, characters and environment. Folks that are new to the series should really start with the original Bioshock though it's not an absolute necessity. As you progress through the opening moments of Bioshock 2 it's clear that Rapture is on it's last legs. A cast of characters are introduced each with their own motivations to stop you or aid you on your quest to reunite with your Little Sister. Without getting into to many specifics the storyline in Bioshock 2 is a bit more straightforward than that of the original and doesn't feature a dramatic twist. However, I still found the story interesting and engaging.The graphics of Bioshock 2 are very comparable to that of the original. In fact it's pretty evident that most of the art assets are reused elements from the original game. Personally I loved the graphics of the first game and how the developer combines the different elements of the game to produce the environment of Rapture. Where I think Bioshock 2 really shines is in the level design. Levels, while complex, are not anywhere near as confusing as in the original game where it's rather easy to get disoriented. The levels in Bioshock 2 keep thing interesting and moving at a nice pace without the need to back track. In fact, unlike the previous game, BS2 doesn't give the player the ability to travel to previously explored levels.The gameplay from the original Bioshock is mostly intact here as well. Despite being a Big Daddy your character can still move around pretty well. As a bonus because of your characters added girth you're now able to harness some of the same frightening weapons that the Big Daddy's used against you in the first game. This includes the power arm-drill and a chain gun. Additional new weapons include a spear gun, rivet gun, and the ability to deploy sentinel mini-turrets that target enemies.Hacking has also been refined and is simplified and much quicker than in the first. This time around you're simply trying to stop a needle within certain colored zones on a display. Miss and you receive a damaging shock or set off an alarm that sends 'bots' gunning after you. Luckily Bioshock 2 features a new item called the 'Remote Hack Tool' where you can shoot hackable objects from afar. This is especially helpful in the harder difficulty where you can turn turrets and security cameras against your foes.As I mentioned earlier, a few things keep me from giving Bioshock 2 a higher score. First, there's a certain lack of originality in this game. Even if you loved the original game it's almost shocking how little has changed from one to the next. I feel as if though 2K was perhaps painted in a corner with the lore and setting of Rapture but still. Secondly, I was sort of puzzled by the developers choice to neuter your character. In the original Bioshock encountering a Big Daddy was a game changing event. These suckers were brutal and very, very tough to kill without the right weapons and ammo. In Bioshock 2 you're one of these lumbering giants and yet even the most basic of enemies poses significant risks to your health. It's a curious design decision that makes sense in that the developer couldn't make the game a walk in the park but in doing so goes against the very foundations they set up in the first game. Lastly, the online multiplayer while featuring some originality is just not to my liking. It's a basic run-n-gun shooter with the ability to choose from various characters customizing their appearance and weapons and plasmids. I tried the online aspect of Bioshock 2 and I was never really drawn into it.Some may say that Bioshock 2 could have been a really, really large DLC release for the original and I'm not necessarily inclined to disagree. Though at the discount price being charged it's an easy choice - buy this game. Even with a few shortcomings it's easily worth the asking price.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2010"}

It's unbelievable to be able to finally take your explosives and actually punch through a wall rather than unload everything at a wooden door and just leave scorch marks like most games.

Just as it's extremely uplifting to find you can destroy things, it's equally depressing when the next door you try to blast just leaves those lame scorch marks.  A for effort, but C- for execution.The second part is a matter of taste.  I missed the civilians screaming \"I'm on your side!\" before they'd try to alert the guards and I'd blast 'em.  Also gone are the guards yelling \"I'm unarmed!\" as they run away to reload.  The guards in RF2 don't say anything I recall and killing civilians...Well, let's just say there are now consequences.I do give them great credit though for scaling back the railgun.  It was ridiculously cheap and over powered in the first RF game.  It's still a nasty weapon, and it still shoots through walls, but at least it's not a one shot kill.  That alone would push the game above the first one, but they also have one other trick up their sleeves.  Vehicles.RF2 features vehicles that have unlimited ammo.  Yes, it's not realistic, but it is realistic enough to figure it's going to have semi-infinite and just go with it.  The first game was slightly annoying by being too realistic with limited stores.  While that's a minor thing, I have to give RF2 the edge on vehicles mostly for the battle suit.  It is AWESOME to pilot that thing.  The game doesn't really become MechWarrior, as you're mostly just mowing down personnel, so that's good/bad depending on preference.  There's a really short level with it, but then you're treated to a longer level later on, complete with tons of stuff to break, tons of enemies to mow down, and finally a boss fight where you're the one in the big machine.  It made things a tad too easy, but so what?  I didn't care.  I was having a great time and that's the important part.You'll also notice that unlike RF where you could save anywhere, RF2 only lets you save to the last level completed.  It is also glaringly obvious when you're in a vehicle, nearly destroyed, then the loading message comes up and suddenly you're at 100% again.  Huh?  I just self-repaired out of the blue?  It's as glaring as one door blowing up and the other scorching that you're just in a contained game and not fighting for your cause.  It just slaps you out of the story.All things considered, I'd suggest getting both games if you can find them cheap.  The first half or so of RF is nearly perfect, but it gets cheap towards the end with it's railgun.  RF2 makes some great improvements, but also looses something in translation.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2009"}

It was fun to play through, but I felt like it didn't take advantage of the opportunities that it presented itself.  The story was good, but anyone who had previously played a Bioshock game knew to expect a twist and I guessed it straight away and so for me it was nothing mind-blowing but was more of an \" I-told-you-so\" moment.  I thought the Lutece characters were fantastic and I felt that they should have played more of a role.  The game could have been so much trippier and mind-blowing and for me, it was really disappointing that the creators didn't seek to throw the player off a cliff in terms of reality and what to think.  It honestly felt very pedestrian.  Additionally, it was really not that \"open\" of a world, going by the modern gamer definition of an open-world.  Empty pathways of nothingness until you reach the \"open\" battlefield.  Sure, there are multiple vantage points and ways to tackle said battlefield but in the end, it's still very linear.  I thought the character development was really nothing special.  Booker rescues Elizabeth.  Elizabeth instantly trusts him completely.  Booker tries taking her to New York.  Elizabeth hates him.  Booker rescues her again and trust is instantly restored.  Minimal character growth.  Additionally, the game was very short.  It was maybe 12 hours max.  As I could sense the climax of the game building, I kept telling myself that surely there would be a twist and send us on a roller-coaster and continue the game.  But instead, the credits rolled and my initial impression wasn't about how shocking or anticipated the twist was, but rather shock that that was it.The logistics of the game are good and the combat is well developed and enjoyable, but I can't see myself playing through it ever again.  There were no moments where I thought wow, I wish I could do that again.  At this point, I should add that my views may be biased because I am subconsciously comparing the game to Far Cry 3 which I found to be outstanding.Let me be clear, the game is not bad.  Some may even call it great.  For me, I just see wasted potential.  They could have done so much more.  A game of this caliber should be an emotional roller-coaster for the player.  Something you want to talk about with people afterwards.  Instead I felt it pandering.  Gladiator's Maximus could have popped up and shouted \"Are you not entertained\" and I wouldn't have been surprised.My advice: Rent it or borrow it from a friend.  Otherwise you'll play through once and then it will gather dust on your shelf.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2013"}

It is a lot of fun to play, but the biggest advantages come from playing with other people. The campaign can be played with up to four people, however only two can play on a single system. You can play through the story with or without scoring allowing for playing for fun or more competitive play. The skulls that have been in the previous game have been improved to allow options making the campaign more difficult but also creating the possibility for a higher score.The multiplayer aspect to the game is great too and also has been improved. Up to 4 people can play together on a single system, online or local/system link. If you have more people playing they do not need an xbox live gold account, but without one the can not play in ranked matches. Matchmaking is a new improvement to Halo 3. Instead of waiting in lobbies the game will match you up with people who want to play similar game types. You can always party up with people you find that you want to continue playing with. Also, if you have a party of friends you can play on custom games which allows you to play your choice of game types and completely change the options.There is also two new modes, forge and theater. Theater is the simplest mode that allows you to play back your previous matches. While playing them you can create snapshots or movies of your favorite moments, then upload them to you [...] profile. Forge is great as well, because you can edit the layout of the maps and create your own custom game types. These edits can also be uploaded to bungie's website.The final integration is that [...] website. It tracks all of your statistics and your rank. It allows you to compare your performance to that of your friends. Also all of the uploaded pictures and films of your friends can be downloaded. However, since the films are in game data they can only be viewed in the game. You can also download game modes. So if your friend made the \"most awesome game type ever!\" you can download it and play against them in it in custom games. The website allows you to queue up to eight items to download the next time you turn on the game. Pictures you can download right away and use on your computer. Its nice.So, at first glance this might appear like a small update it is a pretty full package, even if you just buy the regular version of the game. It wont be hard to find people to play against in this game, and the formula that made Halo and Halo 2 is still there, with some improvements. Even if you didn't like Halo or Halo 2 I would still recommend trying this as it really fills out what was missing in those games. The combination of local and online play, the 4-player campaign, the campaign scoring, the forge level editor, the theater, and the file share are all new features that make this game stand out over pretty much any other game available.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2007"}

The missions start with briefings and insertion into the drop site. How they got the team to the site isn't shown (Transporters??). I control two 3-man teams, Alpha and Bravo. Before the mission begins I go to the Dossier Room to set up your team. I assign a sniper and machine gunner to each squad since they are going to be sepearated. The game is realistic but takes a great deal of time to complete a mission. I advise saving games at each small milestone to reduce the frustration factor. The tank weapon can only be fire in kneeling and standing position and most be reloacded after each shot. This explains the freezing problem. Here's the cons and these are big ones in my book. Although the AI team members communciates with you such as they've sighted enemy. They don't give enemy positions left right etc. You can't call for your gunner to lay down fire to cover for the asaulting squad. You have to do it yourself. The squads are bunched together a lot making it easy for all to be killed by a single grenade. Squad have formations when on patrol such as Wedge, Echolon Left, Echolon Right etc. Just a running mob. The snipers don't cover for the men doing the assaulting a position and must be manual controled by you. And the biggest of them all - the graphics. Yes the graphics are good but the enemy ARE difficult to locate even swiping side to side visually. You can be shot at several times before seeing a muzzel flash if at all. The enemy indicator is sometimes wrong and I have on many occasions had enemy standing 3 feet away from me shooting. The problem is sound and peripheral vision. I need surround sound to hear where the shots are coming from and well  3-d TV to look out the corner of my eye. Also, you don't get a radio operator to call base for updates or support. Your men can be wounded and killed even after the mission is over so be careful using your best men. Again, the enemy are very difficult to locate and I have on occasion shot tree tops thinking enemy were on the ridge. My eyes on many occasions were sore because of staring at the screen looking for movement in the brush. The snipers aren't doing their job except on the ending credits when a sniper saved a soldier escorting prisoners from an enemy sniper. Brought a tear to my eye. The graphics may be to blame since the grass seems to grow as I move forward. The best missions are the airfield and urban combat. This is not a shoot em up game like Counter Strike. So don't even think you can do a \"Rambo\" here.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2004"}

Arkham Asylum gave us excellent graphics, an excellent storyline, excellent voice acting and above all else, excellent gameplay.  It was such an enjoyable experience, that upon beating it, I immediately started over again.  Arkham City improved on this successful recipe by opening up gameplay to the expanse \"City of Arkham\".  One very important thing that both games had in common, was the developer Rocksteady Studios.  Batman: Arkham Origins was developed my Warner Bros Montreal.  Oh how the developer can make a difference.  I'll start by saying that the game as a whole is a good game.  It's quite fun and and very similar to the first two Batman games.  In fact, it's almost a carbon copy of Arkham City, with some DLC added to it.  New toys were added to Batman's arsenal, such as shock gloves, the disruptor, glue grenades and a remote batclaw.  All of the other gadgets are present - smoke pellets, decryptor, explosive gel, etc. are all items that you start out with.  There are a number of bosses, all of which have unique ways in which they are defeated.  There are plenty of side missions to keep you busy (ala Riddler trophies in AC), such as destroying riddler disruptors, responding to police calls, destroying drug stashes, etc.  You are also now allowed to fast travel around the city via the Batwing once you liberate certain Riddler disrupted radio towers.  The game is a prequel, so you will be just getting to know characters like the Riddler and the Joker and there are many other villains in the game that you will get to enterface with.  The game looks good and the new voice actors for Batman and the Joker do a very fine job.All of these things are great, but they do not detract with the game being buggy and frustrating.  I've never had a game freeze up on me, requiring a restart as often as this game (at least for PS3).  The sound has gone in and out during gameplay.  There was a sequence where all I could do was walk around during a fight....no fighting buttons worked and none of the enemies was engage me anyhow.  One of the new gadgets - the glue grenade - is great when it actally works.  The hit detection for the GG is no poor, that you could throw one directly on the target, just for it to miss with no apparent reason why.  These are just a few of the many bugs that have taken away from the overall experience of a very good game.Bugs aside, I also found  myself asking a question.  It's understandible that in Arkham City the streets would be filled with thugs.  After all, AC was basically a sealed off prison city.  However, in this prequel, nothing but thugs roam the streets.  Where are the normal citizens?  You will hear a loud speaker from time to time that speaks of a city-wide curfew, but it just seems odd that there are absolutely no normal citizens, only thugs.  Not a big deal, I guess I just expected so much out of this game that the little things like this were noticieable to me.Overall, BAO is a good game.  If you enjoyed either of the first two Batman games in the series, you'll want to pick this title up.  Just beware of the bugs - perhaps the XBOX360 version has less bugs, but I have a feeling it won't matter what system you use.  After restarting the game 7 or 8 times because of a frozen screen you may find yourself throwing your controller.  That is, if the battle with Deathstroke doesn't have you kicking your TV first (the eipotme of frustrating boss battles).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2013"}

Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired.

Sadly, it was struck down in the semifinals by Final Fantasy VII (also highly recommended). I disagree with the results of this tournament. While FF7 may be the great modern video game epic, it doesn't have limitless replay value. SSBM does. The game's main focus is vs. mode, where you can battle your friends and/or the AI in matches which never get old. Other modes include adventure (platforming meets arcade fighter), classic (just the regular arcade mode with bonus games thrown in), all star (survival mode against all characters with limited health recovery), and event (interesting 1-player battles with unique objectives). There are an extraordinary number of characters (25, I  think), and a lot of environmental-hazard filled stages, (about 30) mostly taken from Nintendo games, from Kraid's lair, which features a large boss from Metroid who slashes at the platform, causing it to rotate and tip characters off the screen, to a couple of F-Zero race tracks, where you must either dodge or stay on top of the raceships, to several moving levels, where you must keep up with the screen or fall to your probably non-grusome death (there is no blood or gore to speak of, despite the T rating. No drug, alchohal, or smoking use, suggestive themes, or adult situations (tm) either.)What is the only bad thing about this game?

Klinko \"nureveww\"","summary":"Fable 1.5","reviewText":"I have played this game for about 12 hrs so far, and am surprised that it is pretty engrossing.  Graphics and gameplay are what you could expect if there were a game to bridge the gap between Fable 1 and 2.  There are some issues to consider however:  Voice acting is bad at times and have some overlap on occasion (example while in a conversation with a NPC, your character may say \"that looks good\" about a merchants wares across the room while still in active conversation with the NPC along a quest line....kinda odd).  But the story is overall decent, if somewhat predictable.  The characters, quests, fighting etc all have a Fable like feeling to them, but that is hardly a knock, it is a style that has worked successfully, so why not borrow heavily?On the plus side, there is actually a lot to like.  This really was an ambitious attempt and the developers included a LOT they did not have to.  You learn physical skills and mental skills throughout the game (you will quickly learn that most of them...like 90% you DO NOT NEED, but you can use just to customize your style of play).  I think this is both a cop out, but still smart on their end.  They probably did not really know what would work well vs what would not, so all the skills you learn, you can do without, or lean heavily on.  In all there is something like 50 skills you can master, a lot of them have several tiers to master after initially learning them.  This is pretty comprehensive for a game like this in my opinion.  There are also what seems to be a lot of quests (mind you I have completed chapter two and think I am nearing the end of chapter 3).  The game has a lot to explore, I do wish it had a few more dungeons/caves and the ilk, however each of the areas I have been (mountains, OUter and Inner Venice and Arsenal) each only have one 'dungeon/cave' like area.You get your money's worth here, and there is a lot to like and in my opinion (without seeing yet how the game ends), there is room for improvement with a sequel......which I would happily purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2011"}

A character is thrust into a nightmarish world and has to survive. Hideous creatures and twisted environments are the landscape you will navigate as you try to escape this hell. Naughty Dog has released a new game called The Last of Us but is this a journey that you will want to take?The game starts out in a prologue as you take control of a character named Joel. He is a hardworking man that is trying to make ends meet and to take care of his daughter. It is his birthday and his daughter managed to get him a watch as a present.  As you play through the prologue you are trying to escape an unknown threat. People seem to be going crazy and chaos is erupting all around you. Running seems to be the only option as you are carrying your daughter trying to make it to safety.Joel wakes up after the prologue 20 years later living in an quarantined zone in Boston. As you start to explore around this city you notice that it is run with an iron fist. There is a heavy military presence as there is a curfew that is strictly enforced. You are approached by a woman named Tess and you are asked to help her recover weapons. As you find out who stole the weapons you are told that the Fireflies have them now.The Fireflies are rebelling against the conditions in the quarantine zones. Marlene is the leader of the local chapter and they are promised double their cache in weapons if they do a job. The job is simply to transport a girl named Ellie to some fireflies outside the quarantine zone. They grudgingly accept as you make your way out of the quarantine zone and into the ruined city beyond.Boston is now a wasteland filled with toppled skyscrapers and buildings that are reclaimed by the earth. The infected now prowl these ruins as they have been mutated by a spore called cordyceps. There are various stages of infection ranging from the human like runners and stalkers to the inhuman clickers and bloaters. The difference between these two enemies is the clickers and bloaters are more deadly but can only see by echolocation.Stealth can be an option as you can take out unaware enemies by strangulation or by a shiv. You can also go in guns blazing but seeing as ammunition is scarce you might to plan your attacks. You can also pick up the various pipes and boards to inflict more melee damage but they all have integrity. After a few hits with an enemy the board or pipe will break leaving you with your bare fists. One of the things that is awesome about combat is you can utilize the environment around you. If you beat someone close to a desk you can ram their head against it caving in their skull.One of the most breathtaking aspects of this game has to be the graphics. The scenery ranges from ruined cities and towns to wilderness and the open road. It has to be the best looking game on the PS3 to date and it is without a doubt the best exclusive. This is a game to be experienced and we have only scratched the surface in this review. If you own a PS3 this is the game that you need to get for that system.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2013"}

A perfect balance between Socom-type stealth/weaponry and very creative espionage missions.  The computer hacking/lock picking/alarm deactivating in this game were very well thought out and very rewarding when done properly.  The variety of weapons is amazing, and each one has advantages and disadvantages depending on the mission type.  There are some levels that you can run and gun your way through, but some where you will be killed in seconds if you try that approach.Your decisions during conversations impact the game play more than on just a superficial level, and the decisions are never obvious as in games like Fallout III.  Overall, I believe any gamer should give this one a rental.  If you're not caught up within ten minutes you may never be, so it's a quick assessment.  I was swept away after the first mission.  The only reason I didn't award five stars was due to some AI stupidity (I played on normal though, not difficult).  Some enemy soldiers are very intelligent and some are mindless zombies, it's nice to keep you on your toes but the stupid ones sometimes run right passed you and not see you standing there.  I imagine on the difficult setting this wouldn't happen.  But it really evens out b/c the intelligent guards will sometimes shoot at you and sometimes bum rush you and beat the heck out of you.Overall, great game and definitely a huge step forward in espionage gaming.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00503E8S2","description":"","reviewerName":"mark twain","summary":"multiplayer review: it's awful","reviewText":"This review covers only the multiplayer, as I have not yet played the campaign and only a little Spec Ops/Survival.  But since 99% of people buy CoD for multi only anyway...The multi in MW3 is awful, extremely horrendously bad.  It's the worst since the launch days of World at War, when enemies would spawn 2 feet behind you and stab you in the back.1.  The spawns are very bad.  You can play correctly, always aggressively flanking the enemy team and it won't matter they'll spawn a guy behind you to shoot you in the back.2.  The maps are very bad.  The maps might look a little different superficially, but they are almost all the exact same map...a lot of little buildings and corridors.  Encourages camping, and because of the terrible spawns you won't see the enemy who spawns behind you in the building you just ran through.3.  The lag is very bad.  The host advantage can only be likened to Gears 1 that's how severe a problem it is.  An example: I see an enemy at the end of a small corridor facing away shooting out at one of my teammates.  He doesn't move as I put 10 bullets into his head and chest.  But somehow I fall down dead.  The killcam shows that he spun put 10 bullets into me and I never shot even once.  Yes it's that bad and you'll see it happen every match right now.CoD 4 > MW2 > WaW (after being fixed) > CoD 2 > Black Ops > MW3 > CoD 3Call of Duty is still chasing CoD4 and probably will never reach that level again of balanced gameplay with superior maps.  Maybe the saddest thing is that they make a billion dollars a year off of CoD but since the real Infinity Ward is gone we've only received the thoroughly average Black Ops and now this which makes Black Ops look amazing in comparison.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0037LVW9M","description":"","reviewerName":"MekoRush","summary":"Finally something fresh and something you'll finish less than 3 days","reviewText":"Usually I would start a game and drop off to another game 2 days later, not here as it only took 2 FULL days to complete. Ok I guess the cool technology did it for me or the modern war games are played out with COD/BF. But I was so into this game after 15 mins.Gameplay: In short it's fun. There are so many ways to kill enemies and complete missions. I actually used every device I could but it sucks you are stuck with only 2 grenades. Every device comes in handle so just pick something as you'll wish you could had 3 slots for handys. It really doesn't require much thinking of how to kill a group of enemies usually devided into 3 with 4 or 5 spreaded out alone so most of the time you'll have your 3 buddies kill the first group of 3 and you alone would take out a side enemy. Either that or if you like to get all stealthy you could wait till they wonder off alone and snap necks. You can forget about running and gunning I only killed 2 then I was dead. That's one thing that bugged me when you die it's probably because taking cover kinda sucks when you have bullets flying everywhere as what you stand behind doesn't protect you from damage or someone is on the side of you shooting so that leaves you to get up and move to another spot but by the time you're there you're dead. So prepare to die a lot or get revived. Plus when you die you have to start back at last checkpoint which usually 5 mins of back time. After the 8th mission things really don't advance anymore far as gameplay, by then you pretty much have a ruetine in place of how you kill enemies which work always. I wished the game would of made me feel more bad ass by coming up with different ways to kill enemies. All you do is have your 3 buddies kill while you're on the side eating doritos. Honestly that's all you can do as each waves of enemes are set up the same way, so it's ether stealth kills or have your 3 hommies kill while you're tagging the last guy, it would of been nice if they did some killing on their own that you may have never detected so that's that.Sound: effects are good. good voice over. nothing here to talk about.Graphics/animation: graphics look 2012ish so no biggy there. The cutscenes look kind of meh, I guess I'm use to COD/BF's cool looks.Overall: It would probably come in at 3rd place against the other 2 big houndy dogs. The story just isn't hollywood, there aren't any characters that stands out other than ghostlead* that's always serious about the mission. Even when they do joke it's meh. Then they try to have a softy moment which you really don't care for. Also like in many reviews this game takes from Gears of war, Splinter Cell, COD to make their game. So if they would of spent 50% more on battle field cutscenes instead of showing you a map with your next target and the next location you're going then it would make the game more interesting. After each level is completed all you'll get is a mission breif with a 25 sec clip. Then every 5 missions you'll get a cutscene of the main target you'll trying to kill, yada yada. BUT this game is up there with COD/BF simply for the cool killing and you actually have a team that helps you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0037LVW9M","description":"","reviewerName":"paper tiger \"Adriel August\"","summary":"A Fresh, New, and Fun Challenge. Futuristic Military Shooter!","reviewText":"The game requires 6.5gigs of hard drive space, there is a very small update already, it is PS Move (gunsmith use only) and 3D compatible, an it requires a Uplay account and passport code to play online (which is included).I've always been a fan of the Ghost Recon games because of the third person military action as well as the strong stealth aspect of the game play. I have been waiting for some time now to get my hands on Future Soldier as I waited through all of the release-date push backs and delays. I must say it is an amazing game. The graphics are phenomenal, the control is tight and the over-all game play is very realistic and entertaining. Sync Shot is a really cool feature where you tag multiple enemies and your team takes all of them out instantly. I think I am more into being alone in the game, however working as a team greatly has its advantages in Future Soldier. The game is very well put together and I can tell a lot of time went into the menu, weapon and inventory system.PROS+ Well detailed graphics, very realistic and natural looking. The scenes and maps are very well laid out.+ Perfectly crafted control and weapon system. Creating your own weapon is a blast.+ The game is fast, controls are very well responsive and not sluggish at all. It is a smooth running game, no glitching or lagging.+ Music, voice-acting and sounds effects are very well produced. I was blown away by the clarity and the level on my surround speakers.+ Weapons are fully customizable and gadgets are very helpful. Camouflage is very cool.+ Multiplayer is incredibly fun when you have the right teammates.CONS- Some of the cut scenes and the character models seem dated and less detailed than the actual game play.- There is no slit-screen (couch) co-op in the game. All co-op is online.- Like in past Ghost Recon games the area is limited and you are warned when you are leaving the area. It gives the appearance of a larger area, yet it still is quite linear.- In combat your progression options are sometimes limited and you must stick with your team.- There are a few small clipping issues like floating objects or your characters arms not linking around an enemies neck when doing a stealth kill, very minor though.- In the snow levels you cannot see your footprints in the snow. Also when you are invisable you can still see your shadow, which you think the enemy would see.Multiplayer is a huge amount of fun and quite a challenge, but it is a must to have good teammates. It makes it difficult when your teammates just shoot everything. When you get hit you can spawn back to a standard location or to a teammate. It is very fast paced and cover is the key. Cover is also important in single player, however with it is a necessity in multiplayer.This may be the first time I have ever said this, but I enjoy the multiplayer much more than the single player. The single player is great and it is a very solid game, however the multiplayer is just so much fun.I like having the option to play how I want to play in the single player campaign. Ghost Recon Future Soldier gives you a large area to work your way though, you could either go in guns blazing or you could take your time and sneak in and stealth take down your enemies. I have played one area over and over again until I am happy with the way it went down. It is very well put together and the maps are well designed and laid out. If you stealth sneak into an area and are seen, you will alert many more enemies than if you were quiet and careful and were not seen. It is a lot of fun and quite an enjoyable challenge.The fictional futuristic style gadgets are very cool and as you progress through the game you get more and more, however you don't always have all of them for every level, it depends on the mission. The gadgets give you a heads up on the enemies and sometimes makes the game too easy, however using the gadgets in different ways and in different areas really mixes the game up and keeps it interesting.Over-all Ghost Recon Future Soldier has met what I was expecting out of the game. I am very happy with it and I highly recommend this for gamers who want a smart military shooter. Future Soldier is not for gamers who are expecting another cookie cutter Call of Duty game. This game is smart and realistic in that you need to plain your missions and attacks and take your time. It is a stealth shooter which requires you to think. The movement and sliding from cover to cover is very fast and the controls come very naturally. Highly addicting game.Game on!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2012"}

FEAR 3 seems like it was thrown together with little effort to improve on its predecessor.  The graphics are not that great - textures are messy and the atmosphere of each level consist of recycled areas.  The controls work fine for a FPS.  The sound is ok and the voice acting is decent.  The story line is strange and a little messy.  Enemies start to become repetitive.  And this game is certainly not \"scary\" by any means.  My assessment is that this title is a mediocre shooter at best.  Score out of 1-10: 6.5.  Typically, when it takes me a long time to get through a game it's due to the difficulty level and resulting frustration that makes me put it down for a while.  However, this game took me a while to get through because I kept putting it down out of boredom.  If you are a crazy FPS fan, and are in dire need of something new, this may satisfy you.  But probably not.  If you are looking for a good story, fun battles, and a game that you can't put down, PASS.PROS- Control scheme works well- Some gunfights can be fun- Voice acting is not badCONS- Poor graphics for a next gen game- Enemies are repetitive and actually more annoying than anything else- No real thrills or \"scares\"- Just not really that fun overall","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00APBF8A6","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Hacking Into RPG's Past","reviewText":"When you say \"Shin Megami Tensei\", most gamers today will probably respond with \"Persona.\" However, the MegaTen brand stretches back to the 80's, and virtually none of the other games are similar to those popular spin-offs. In fact, up until \"Nocturne\" hit the PS2 in the early 2000's, the series exclusively relied on first-person dungeon-crawling, excessive level-grinding, and punishing resource management coupled with elaborate demon training, a mechanic which Nintendo would successfully ape in their \"Pokemon\" games.This is an important introduction, I feel, because \"Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers\" is a straight-up port of a 1997 Sega Saturn game, predating the birth of the \"Persona\" series, and the modern overhaul which would bring the MegaTen franchise into the 21st century. As such, it's a weird transitional piece that, despite its flaws, serves as an interesting peek into what would make the series so famous in the coming years.Amami City is now the most technologically advanced place on the planet, thanks to every household now being connected by a broadband (!) network. Not only that, but people can now visit each other via the internet in a virtual town called \"Paradigm X.\" Paradigm X houses movies, online shopping, and forums where people can assume different identities. But there's a sinister evil lurking beneath this seemingly perfect cyber utopia. The sinister corporation behind it is using the code to summon demons, causing them to materialize in the physical world and wreak havoc. As a member of the secretive hacker group Spookies, you must arm yourself with a portable computer and capture demons in order to fight back. Oh, and while you're at it, it might be a good idea to exorcise the demon from your best friend's body, one that's shifted her personality from \"shy and nerdy\" to \"brash and sultry.\"As you might have already noticed, this setting is pretty dated by today's standards. Technology is treated like magic, and hackers as wizards able to control it. But concepts such as portable computers and a virtual city, not to mention online shopping and other things of that nature, are already commonplace in today's society, so the mysticism of it may be lost on a modern audience. That being said, the narrative itself is rock-solid. The characters are all very memorable, with the highlight being the protagonist's friend shifting back and forth between personalities, leading to some hilarious conversations with \"herself.\" Another cool feature are the \"vision quests\", which put you in control of a character who has deceased in order to gain their knowledge and experience to aid you in your quest. This is a really unique idea, and something that I'd like to see return in newer MegaTen games.Props are also due to Atlus' translation team, which obviously knew that this was one of the sillier MegaTen games, and thus decided to tailor the dialogue accordingly. Therefore, players are treated to subtle references to films such as \"Clerks\", and gamer in-jokes like the infamous \"my body is ready\" meme. All-around, despite the dated silliness, the characters and excellent translation elevate this to the level of newer entries as far as the writing goes.What may be an unwelcome mechanic to fans of more modern RPGs, however, is the gameplay. It's all pretty basic and straightforward. Overworld navigation is handled by a map, and dungeons are first-person, grid-based corridors. Battles are random, and if you want to succeed, you'll have to be prepared to seriously grind levels, unless you want to die within a few turns upon entering a battle. The entire experience of navigation can be summed up in two phrases: \"resource management\" and \"trial and error.\" You'll constantly need to manage Magnetite to keep your demons summoned, and you'll die more than a few times trying to figure out enemies' weaknesses and attack patterns. This is one of the easier old-school MegaTen games, true, but that's not saying much when the series is renowned for its punishing difficulty.However, the difficulty is alleviated somewhat by my biggest bone to pick with the game. For this 3DS version, Atlus added in optional \"hacks\" to alter the gameplay. Some of the more convenient perks include being able to summon demons regardless of your party alignment, and being able to see the entire map of a dungeon without exploring it (a lifesaver if you reach the end of the dungeon, then die.) These two features are pretty handy, and don't really rob the game of its challenge at all in my honest opinion. Unfortunately, the other \"hacks\" don't get off as easily.First off, there's one that allows you to see demon types in the game that you haven't even encountered, taking away the joy of discovery gained from grinding through dungeons. Even the super-casual \"Pokemon\" doesn't stoop this low. My biggest concern by far, though, are the difficulty hacks. Sure, you can make the difficulty higher, but let's face it, most people are going to be interested in making the experience less of a grind. And for the first time in series history, they can do this at a moment's notice. If a player is having trouble, they can simply turn on Easy Mode, coast for a bit to grind levels, then switch it back up to normal.For a series that has historically placed a huge emphasis on making a choice and sticking with it as far as difficulty is concerned, why would Atlus choose this game to implement such a feature? Why not wait for the bigger \"Shin Megami Tensei IV\", which undoubtedly has more mainstream appeal than this? I'm going to out on a limb and say that no new player of this series is going to stick with this one for long, and I feel as if this one is intended solely for hardcore fans, i.e. people who would rather deal with the game's difficulty as they're intended to: by dying, grinding, and repeating. Being able to change it on a whim throws the entire balance off. While I will fully admit this may be my bias as a longtime fan speaking, I don't like the inorganic implementation of such a mode, especially considering players can essentially use it to cheat.Aside from this, the gameplay is great. Capturing demons by conversing with and bribing them is as fun and funny as ever, and fusing them in order to create new recruits is immensely rewarding. Ofttimes, I'll find myself hunting dungeons for demons as opposed to items or experience points, just to find the right ingredients for my new creation. From combat to capturing to exploration, everything here is full of depth and has enough entertainment value to last for dozens of hours. While the design is still somewhat rudimentary and archaic, and thus requires some serious commitment to fully understanding, it's really worth the effort.The aesthetics of this game are truly a mixed bag. On the one hand, the art direction is brilliant, with some memorable and unique character designs, and some of the coolest settings in MegaTen history. On the other hand, Atlus forgot to mention that this isn't really a \"remake\" of the original at all. It's a polished, cleaned-up version of a game that is three console generations-old. Aside from the new anime opening, the graphics are virtually untouched from the Saturn game, aside from the fact that they look cleaner due to a higher resolution. What doesn't look clean, though, are the CG cutscenes. They're incredibly dated, and look really cheesy and terrible by today's standards. I'm not a graphical snob, so it doesn't bother me, but it's definitely something to be aware of going into the game. Expect an old-school experience through-and-through, right down to the graphics.That applies to the music as well. Even though the soundtrack has been re-done, the 90's aesthetic remains. It's an energetic blend of fast guitars and blazing synthesizers, brought to us by series veteran Atsushi Kitajo. It's a great soundtrack, with some surprises thrown in (such as the beautiful \"Hotel Goumaden\" theme) to keep you on your toes. Also a nice surprise is the quality of the voice acting, something the series has been really nailing since the release of \"Persona 4.\" In my honest opinion, the auditory department of this game is where some of its biggest successes come from.If you go into this game expecting something like \"Persona\", then you might as well look elsewhere. Atlus has released an RPG that's about as old-school as they get, even moreso than this year's \"Etrian Odyssey IV.\" While the \"hacks\" are a point of contention for me, and the graphics could have been spruced up a little more, this is still a winner in the end. For those looking for a game with longevity, challenge, and great atmosphere, \"Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers\" fits the bill quite nicely. It's a rollicking, if slightly flawed, RPG thrill-ride, sure to keep you engaged for ages.Plot: 8.5Gameplay: 8.5Graphics: 8Sound: 9Overall: 8.5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2013"}

Since then, government forces have managed to control the zombie threat and Leon has become a Federal agent. When the President's daughter is kidnapped, Leon tracks her to a remote, hidden fortress in Europe - where he'll relive the horror he faced six years before.   Players will face never-before-seen enemies that make Nemesis seem like a kitten. You'll be wishing for the usual Resident Evil zombies!","reviewerName":"Andrew C.","summary":"Creepy-and fun!","reviewText":"I wasn't expecting a lot from this game after learning that it was a port of a console game. Also, I hadn't played any of the past Resident Evil games.  However, if you own a gamepad (especially an XBox 360 controller), Resident Evil 4 is definitely worth the price.  It's a game of the horror/survival genre and packs in a lot of good scares and clever adventuring. It does have a few problems, but overall, I had a blast!Gameplay: In a nutshell, you are a U.S. government agent sent to rescue the president's daughter from a evil cult in Europe.  There are some minor intrigues going on and you'll likely get confused about whose working for whom, but for the most part this is a simple rescue/save-the-world mission. Your travels will take you through villages, an abandoned hospital, factories, sewers, a castle, and an island.  The diversity of environments is actually impressive.  There is some good loot to be found, but most of it is simply meant to allow you to buy better weapons from strategically placed weapons dealers.  And you'll have fun enough using the weapons, trust me. With a XBox 360 gamepad, this game plays well.  It's one of those games truly meant to be placed with a gamepad, thus I can excuse the lack of mouse support (though it really should have been supported).The game offers a lot of good, creepy action, and there are no less than 10 great boss fights.  Some of the fights are frustrating and will require repeated efforts.  However, they are all satisfying and leave you with a sense of accomplishment when completed.  The game lasted me about 30 hours (according to the in-game timer); however, it's actually longer than that if you count all of the saved games that you'll have to reload after dying (and you'll die many, many times), along with the bonus missions unlocked after completing the main game.  For the bargain price of $20 or less, it's money well spent if you are a fan of adventure and/or horror games.Graphics: This is a mixed bag.  You can adjust the resolution, and the game looks very good at 1600x1200.  Character models are done well, though at least 75% of the opponents you'll meet will be zombies and cultists.  Most of the cutscenes are not impressive at all and were not apparently touched up as the game was being set up for the PC.  Still, the graphics are immersive and set the appropriate foreboding atmosphere.Sound: The audio is creepy when it needs to be and sedate at other times. Really nothing special.  There is some music in the game, but usually it's the kind of hurried ochestral stuff that typically plays in horror movies to get your pulse up.  Voices of main characters--as well as their looks--are rather juvenille, which takes some of the seriousness out of the subject matter.Technical issues: The game comes with a thin, but functional manual.  There is no tutorial level as far as I can recall, but you'll learn the controls quickly.  The game did hard lock my computer about five times, requiring me to reboot my PC.  I consider this a serious technical issue, in addition to the few times it crashed to desktop.  Still, I could usually play at least 3 hours straight before any problems occurred. I assume a patch could fix this.  The game has an auto-save system, but it works pretty decently since it saves at a lot of different checkpoints.Replay/value: For the price that I paid for this ($17.99), the game was definitely worth the money.  However, I'm not one to replay a game that will have the same story line and ending, so I didn't find much replay value here.  In sum, if you like a good scare with some wild-side adventuring, Resident Evil 4 is definitely worth a try.Pros:+Creepy and immersive gameplay+Great weapons, with many upgrades+Some fun puzzles and well-done levels+30 solid hours of gameplay at a cheap priceCons:-Some repetitious fighting sequences-Some boss fights are tedious and annoying-technical issues-should have had mouse support","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2007"}

Unlike the SP version, this one does not \"flip\" open to reveal the screen.  When they named it the \"Micro\" they hit the nail squarely on the head.  From what I have read, Nintendo was aiming to make the Gameboy a trendy \"tech\" item, one that would mirror the small design of today's mobile phone market.  They pulled this off; the Micro is about the size of a cell phone.  It is very sleek in design but also very simple.  Nothing is wasted; you have your basic command buttons and power/volume switches, and a plug-in for headphones.  That is about it aside from the plug-in for the charger.The Micro will play all GBA games but not Gameboy Color games.The screen clarity is a perfect 10.  Games look amazing on this little guy, and the colors jump right off the screen.  In my opinion this a feature that is worth the price of the Micro alone.  Also, the battery life is extrememly long.From what I can tell, the most popular version of the Gameboy has been the SP.  As a result, many SP owners will be (rightfully) skeptical of the need to purchase a Micro since it is not an upgrade in terms of the games it plays.  It is still, at the end of the day, a GBA.

Many missions in this game that are sometimes boring, but if you played \"Farcry 2\" these missions will seem really fun. Sadly, there is only 1-4 online players. Overall, this game has so many things to do that it is definitely worth the $30.00.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2012"}

It is so good that many call it the Game of the Year of 2007. I have been playing FPS games since the mid 90's and this is among the top 3 best FPS games I have ever played. It has a short but incredibly breathtaking single-player experience backed-up by a very deep multi-player. I recommend this to anyone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2007"}

I love the story so far (haven't beaten it yet but I will soon). The graphics have improved, and so did the gameplay. New powers, abilities, new characters in the story, and you get weaponize tanks and helicopters by removing their machines and turrets. How cool is that? Radical Entertainment has really done a great job making Prototype 2. I'll update this review when I finish the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2012"}
