Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"Boring and Unimaginative","reviewText":"Finally got this on a rental and have had my fill after about 2 hours...First, I realize that people walked and drove a bit slower back in the 40's, but did the game have to be THAT realistic?Second, as mentioned by many others, the game quickly gets repetitive.  Walk around, look at clues, walk around some more...  Everything happens at such a snails-pace that it becomes tediously boring.  (May not have helped that I just took a break from playing Saints Row: The Third...)  Plus the interviews are hard to pin down unless of course you've had training in interpretive acting, linguistics and psychology......but even that doesn't help.  On the 3rd-or-so case of the game, I personally had a reasonable suspicion as to what happened, and got a witness to prove it.  But when I asked the next question, the main character accused the witness of something else after he had already given away the answer.  In the end I got 1 of 4 questions right, even though I had already solved it!So what does it make me do?  (And maybe it would have made me do it anyways...) another staple Rockstar mission: \"Follow the bad guy at a 'safe' distance to see where he's heading...\"  For the love of GOD can we STOP USING THAT MISSION?!?!  It is one of the most frustrating, overused, and unimaginative chores ever given in a video game.Frankly I think they bit off more than they could chew with this one.  The production value is remarkable: I'm really impressed with the \"notebook\" and the way you can store and revisit information.  Even when you pause during an interrogation, you can read all the previous dialogue on a piece of paper that looks like courtroom stenography.  Impressive stuff...But they ruined it with flat-out dull game play, apparently broken dialogue trees, and too much attention to detail... ...in the wrong areas.  So I gave it an overall 2-stars, taking into consideration the decent graphics and believable environments.Eject disc, stick back in the padded envelope, and away she goes...","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2011"}

The DLC pack has the Soundtrack of the game, a Dynamic theme and 2 avatars (one of Ellie and another one of Joel). The Art book is huge! the art in it is really great, and it explains some other small details about the characters development. The comic book is nice, it's a good read. The steel case looks clean with the main characters faces in each side. Even if the survival edition didn't really come with a lot of stuff, the stuff that it did come with was very much worth the price ($70). I'll give it 5/5-----------------------The Game (SPOILERS)I wouldn't say this game is perfect, but it certainly is a Masterpiece. I've been waiting for this game since it was announced back in 2011, I pre ordered it in 2012, the wait was long, but it's finally here. (prologue/intro), The game starts with Joel's daughter waking up to uncle tommy's phone call, you walk down the hall to Joel's room to find out what is happening, you see on the TV that something bad is happening when explosion happens and then you turn to the window and realize that it was really close to the house, you walk down stairs to find your dad, you find him and he tells you that something is very wrong, a neighbor gets in the house, Joel Shots him and he walks with his daughter and tells her that something is not right, soon later, you get in the truck of Uncle Tommy and drive off, as you sit in the back you see that everything is starting to go to hell, people houses are burning, police cars everywhere, people running left to right. The 3 characters (Joel, daughter, and tommy) had to leave the car after it was crashed, they go down a hall to find out there we're more infected there, they run into a bar and tommy tells joel and his daughter to run and he will catch up, you run down a hill and then up to meet up with a military personal. he tells them to stop and then shoots them, they both roll down the hill and Joel stands up to find out that his daughter was shot, shortly after she was dead. This seen was the most emotional/heart breaking part of the game, for me, even though I didn't know the character very well, I felt very sad to see the little girl die in Joel's arms. The game is very emotional and compelling, it's no Uncharted, this game is a lot more darker than the previous work of Naughty Dog. It's a much slower pace compared to Uncharted and the characters seem to be more alive, you could feel their emotions a lot more. The voice acting was amazing, the soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard in a Video Game, the graphics had it's ups and downs, sometimes it looked better than Uncharted 3 and sometimes is looks a tiny bit worse, but lets not forget that this game is a lot bigger than the previous franchises and has a lot more stuff going on, it's also running on the PS3, which is an old piece of hardware. There is some texture pop ins and their was some glitches, but nothing that would ruin the experience. The AI is very smart, you can not run and gun in this game, if you do, you will find yourself very frustrated, because this is more of a stealth kind of game, the bullets and items you find (to craft stuff) are limited, sometimes you will think; 'hey, I have plenty of bullets, I could probably just blast everything up', well... You can't, trust me when I say that you will run out of bullets fast, specially if you're playing the game in Hard or Survivor. The AI (infected and people) cannot see the AI (Ellie and other partners), unless they spot you, then they will attack Ellie and or the other people you are with. Naughty Dog did this on purpose, because they didn't want your partner/s to get in the way. The Controls feel smother than Uncharted 3's, you cannot, jump to things and climb stuff like Drake can, when you see Joel run, climb etc... you could feel like a heavy feeling, you could tell that he can't do all that stuff that Drake can do, you could tell that he's just another person trying to survive. The atmosphere is perfect, I had Dead Space (the franchise) in first place when it came to that, but The Last Of Us is just so much better. This is an amazing game that everybody should experience, great story, great character development, good graphics, really good mechanics and amazing atmosphere. I recommend 10/10 or 5/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000BI3QK2","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Fernandez \"lorenzferus\"","summary":"KOTOR & FABLE did it better.","reviewText":"So far this game seems pretty good but not amazing like some people are saying. I mean to me it's all about the main quest and the story probably isn't all that interesting. Your actions can't change the outcome of the story like you could in Knights of the old Republic. Also one of the main things that makes those games cool is that the decisions you make also change the way you look. So far I haven't found that to be true in Oblivion. First off, you can't see yourself because it's from first person view unless you switch to third person but you'd be loosing out on how the game was really made to be played. Second you can change your armor and clothes but I personally found it hard to make a character that looks cool or represents how evil or good you want to be.Most of your allies in this game are annoying as hell, trust me. There's no story to it or anything that would make you want to help anyone. The AI isn't as good as people say, I thought it was stupid how you steal something and they yell at you but if you approach them they talk to you like nothing happend. Also you can attack allies as much as you want and you just need to block and talk to them and they forgive you like nothing ever happend. I mean when I get bored and do this like 10 times it feels very artificial.Yes the world is huge but try walking around in first person view and crashing into rocks and uneven ground textures and walking side ways on steep mountains it feels very clunky, the combat is poor when there is allies helping because usually they just get in your way and you end up hitting them.Storywise the game seems to be very basic evil VS good story as you try to save the world from hell. Like I said you can't change the outcome and the good guys win. I just got the feeling playing this game that this kind of engine has been used on PC games for a long time. I can't agree with people who say this game is amazing I think games like Star Wars: Knights of the old republic and Fable were better and more modern.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2006"}

Witches, bears, black magic, lunatics with machetes are fine by me. What I can't tolerate, no matter how comfortable my surroundings might be, is little girl ghosts. Worst still little girl ghosts with a massive cob on. Add a bright red dress and lank long black hair draped over a dreaded face - see The Ring - mixed with that little freak cloaked in a red rainmac from Don't Look Now and you've royally got me. Computer games are supposed to be about fun and full of joyousness, not grown men being obliterated by ghosts. What's the world coming to when a little girl craves to see such anguish in the faces of men? These are strange times, strange times indeed.Bearing all that in mind there is one job that I wouldn't do for all the women on the internet - be a member of F.E.A.R. For those unfamiliar with such an unnerving acronym it means: First Encounter Assault Recon. These bad boys don't muck about with terrorists or rescue hostages from jungles and all the rest of it. No. Members of F.E.A.R. are elite soldiers trained to deal with situations that normal people just wouldn't be able to handle. So if there's a mean supernatural force of gargantuan proportions posing a threat to national security, who you gonna call? F.E.A.R. I'm not talking Most Haunted here either - Derek Acorah would be splashing his pants within minutes of playing this - sadly so was I.Predictably you play the new kid on the block. You don't speak and your colleagues doubt you - although bizarrely despite being a part of a 'team' you spend the entire game fighting alone. They think you're not made of the right stuff, that under pressure you'll do a runner faster than Thierry Henry on speed. Very little about the plot is given away initially - you're a bit special - you're training results scored off the charts - there's some evilness to be dealt with and that's about it. Rather pleasingly one of F.E.A.R.'s strong points is the narrative, but more importantly how it is delivered to you. Where most FPS use cut scenes to move the plot forward F.E.A.R. is subtler. You'll hear whispers that suggest future events, characters will react to you in a certain way suggestion something isn't right. Messages on phones, note books and the occasional cut scene - however these never really feel traditional as they link seamlessly into the action, so much so that you barely notice that you're not in control anymore.Within minutes of starting you're running down corridor upon corridor while being treated to the kind of subtle psychological scare tactics usually found in far eastern horror movies - glimpses of people behind doors, flashes of gore and evil innuendo. Similar to the excellent Condemned in atmosphere, F.E.A.R. tightens the vice on your nerves and builds tension like the very best horror movies. While the physics engine pales compared to Half Life 2, the world you're a part of is tangible - objects can be manipulated and you'll often mess your pants as inane objects are placed in your path as you run down dimly lit corridors. Such is the tension that you'll scream when you bump into an empty drinks can and it goes flying.See through F.E.A.R.'s horror niche and you'll find a pretty decent shooter in there as well. Next-generation perhaps it isn't, but the lack of any slowdown despite the barrage of explosions and bodies flying mean that you can play a highly demanding PC game smoothly on the 360. F.E.A.R. has another trick up its sleeve in the slow mo feature - there is nothing original about it, Max Payne was doing the whole bullet time thing back in 2001. On the 360 however it's a different kettle of shrapnel - a visual spectacular that looks so good it could have been taken straight out of The Matrix. Bits of debris fly out, dust is thrown up and walls crumble as you blast your way through your enemy. The point being that when you're overwhelmed with enemies you can use your 'special abilities' to dish out the pain. The combat system is something to marvel at - going in guns blazing is going to get you capped and shooting from behind cover is equally perilous as the AI is such that they will flank you and pop you one before too long. In order to progress through the battlegrounds you have to combine the slow-mo feature with melee attacks as well unleashing a barrage of lead.For all the explosions and slow-mo arse whipping F.E.A.R. remains a generic FPS. The AI is superb and the scary bits are nothing short of cinematic, but there is an awful lot of running and gunning. While this might not be a negative factor for an hour or two, the similarity between weapons only illuminates the lack of diversity on offer. F.E.A.R. is also a short game, but with the said lack of variety this isn't necessarily a bad thing - imagine one big kaboom as opposed to a peppered drawn out series of explosions. These days longevity can usually be found online anyway - F.E.A.R. offers an array of game types all familiar to the genre: capture the flag, deathmatch, etc.However any frustrations that you might have with this will be easily overshadowed by the emotions it invokes within you. F.E.A.R. made me react like no other game can - one particular nerve shredding point literally forced me to involuntarily throw the pad from my hands - the glorious thing about this is that very little happened on screen, it was all about suggestion and even the world's greatest horror movies would do well to learn from Monolith's creation.A game that fashions such primal fear and mixes it with an always-compulsive if a little generic shooter action can only be a positive thing for gaming. What's on offer here is sheer ingenuity in manufacturing an atmosphere that creeps right into the room you're sitting in - and that's playing it in broad daylight at three in the afternoon. If you like you shooting with a dollop of tangible fear, F.E.A.R. is for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2006"}

I've previously been collecting pretty much every version of the game for portable consoles, with the exception of the PS Vita game. THIS was the game Ubisoft talked about after the King of Pop's death, though, and THIS is the game that's gotten all the attention. Just look at the amount of Amazon reviews for this, for Pete's sake! Anyway, I suppose it's time I throw in my two cents...Michael Jackson: The Experience is a rhythm game for the Wii that is completely reminiscent of Ubisoft's Just Dance series, but of course, with the musician's songs filling up the entire track list.Here are the songs in the game:-Bad-Billie Jean-Beat It-Black Or White-Don't Stop Til You Get Enough-Leave Me Alone-Smooth Criminal-Thriller-The Way You Make Me Feel-Remember the Time-Ghosts-Sunset Rider-Wanna Be Startin' Something-Speed Demon-Streetwalker-Rock With You-Heal the World-Who Is It-The Girl Is Mine-They Don't Care About Us-Dirty Diana-Workin' Day & Night-In the Closet-Money-Earth Song-Will You Be ThereWhen playing a song, a virtual Michael Jackson will be onscreen with some backup dancers, and then the fun starts! Games of this breed are pretty self-explanatory when it comes to how you play them: YOU DANCE! You gotta try any mimic Michael Jackson as well as you possibly can! That leads to the one major problem with the game, keeping it from a 5-star rating, and unfortunately it's a technical issue: The Wii Remote play simply isn't as accurate with judging your moves as you'd like it to be. Often do I try pretty hard at copying the moves, but in the end, I just get measly 1-star scores. You can probably get the same result by just waggling the Wii Remote all the way through. The game begs for something more advanced to judge the player's moves than just a motion controller that only mimics hand movement.Nevertheless, this game is still jolly good fun! It's otherwise a very well-crafted experience. The choreography is outright amazing and the visuals are as stylish as dance games could ever be (It definitely helps that Michael Jackson's own music videos are pretty creative works of art). You can even unlock Dance Training videos that, while not really about the game itself but are linked to Jackson's dancing, are neat little bonuses.The game has also proven to be one heck of a workout, and in a way I haven't anticipated. I played the game for a couple hours only to end up feeling the soreness of my limbs the next day. I may have not been particularly fond of being sore, but I welcome the exercise Michael Jackson: The Experience successfully delivers. If you ask me, it's more fun than going to the gym (Hmm....Maybe some gyms should start putting this game on display...).As a video game, though, I highly recommend the Nintendo 3DS version over this. That version, while restricted to swiping with the stylus, at least plays just fine and doesn't deal with imprecise motion control.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2013"}

{"product_name":"B003DNH95K","description":"","reviewerName":"J. J. Burtch \"In Life, Try to be the Type of ...","summary":"I Really Like It...But There's a Catch...","reviewText":"I am a big fan of Tolkien's works, and when I heard about this game a while back I was immediately interested.  The graphical style seemed to be in tune with the recent Peter Jackson films, and the story is an all original one, which means that the designers didn't have to worry about recreating things that I have already seen in the movies or imagined while reading the books.So I preordered the game and got it shortly after it came out.I'll try to do my review in sections.1.  Overall Presentation-The menu and selection areas are very easy to use and intuitive.  They didn't confuse me at all when I first fired up the game, and were easy to navigate and understand where things were.  In fact, the \"main menu\" is literally just a character selection screen that you can instantly launch the game from.  The options to set up an online game are also easily found and easy to use.  Overall, the presentation is basic, but it works very well.2.  Story-So far I have found the story to be interesting, if a bit uncentered.  It seems as if it jumps around a bit, with your characters ending up helping others along the way more than finishing what their actual task at hand is, but that's not a big deal.  The actual issue with the story is a lack of character development.  You basically just have three heroes that seem to be fighting for no real reason other than fighting.  I would have liked to see the characters fleshed out a little bit more so that I would actually care a bit about them.  As it is, they are only the avatars used for me to slash hundreds of orcs to death...which is okay, it just could have been a bit better.3.  Graphics and sound-I really thing the graphics are pretty good.  There are some animation issues that could have been better, sometimes I feel like my character is just kind of floating along the ground instead of actually walking, but the environments are done well and the character models are solid.  Some of the indoor environments can be a bit dark, but you can adjust the brightness settings if you need to.  I really like the actual combat animations.  The effects that your weapons put off when they are being used are great.  I especially found the motion blur from the swords and axes to be done well. The sound is also top notch.  There is tons of voice acting, most of it very good, and the sound effects are done very well.  With a surround sound system you will hear things coming from all around you and some of the sounds you hear will clue you in on things that are coming up ahead.4.  Gameplay-The gameplay has been said to be a bit repetitive, but I would like to know what game doesn't have gameplay that is a bit repetitive.  I find the gameplay to be very fun.  Sure, you are basically just pressing the same couple of buttons over and over again, but there is a bit of strategy involved, especially when you have many enemies attacking you.  The reason the strategy becomes key is the fact that your character doesn't seem super powerful.  What I mean is that after a few whacks from an orc's sword, your character will be seriously hurting.  So you need to know when to retreat and try to heal and when to go completely on the offensive.  The character control during speaking segments is very similar to \"Mass Effect\" in the way that your conversation tree can go.  I find the interaction during speaking segments to be good, but sometimes it seems a bit slow.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoy the actual playing in the game.5.  The Issues-I haven't had many issues, personally, but I will report what the guy that I have been playing with had happen to him.  We have been playing co-op over Xbox LIVE! and both of us played the same amount of time.  However, the next day when we went to play his save wasn't at the same spot as mine.  Apparently, his game stopped saving about half way through our play session.  He could still join me, but it wouldn't save his progression or his game.  So he tried loading his save and playing the part that we had already played to catch up with me, and he got to the point where he couldn't get out of a level.  His game was basically broken.  He started over and made it to the point where we both were, and we haven't had any issues playing co-op since.  I did some research and found this to be a fairly common issue, that is hopefully being addressed with a patch.  With that said, if you start a co-op game and one of the players gets a message that says \"Achievements and Saving are disabled,\" you should check to make sure that you both are on the same section of the game, which can be done from the main screen by looking in the top left corner (it will say something like \"Chapter 4 Part 3\").  If those are not the same, you should have the person that is the farthest back host the game.  You may have to play some parts over, but it should continue to save both players experience, instead of allowing you to play for hours and then not saving someones gear and loot.  Other than that, I've had zero issues with the game.Overall, I really enjoy it and recommend it to anyone that likes hack and slash games.  It's a good time, and if you have a friend to play co-op with, you will love it that much more.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00BGD6LMG","description":"","reviewerName":"Vynny \"Vynrod\"","summary":"Very unpleasant game","reviewText":"I rarely write game reviews these days. It's too subjective and people invariably seem to feel slighted if their favorite game is critiqued. I am confident however that most people who had the misfortune of purchasing this game will agree with me. And that's it's a very messy, unpleasant game.The E3 tease turned out to be a graphically fabricated lie but putting aside that, the game itself is just so nasty. I really feel like the developers genuinely went out of their way to make a game as offensive to the player as possible. Any time you feel you're getting a some enjoyment, the mission turns into a cluster of police just suicide ramming you. You're supposed to 'hack' your environment to escape in a car but usually that results in you yourself being the victim of the attack since the method of tripping explosives usually work against you. It's actually easier just to jump into the water and swim away, which feels cheap.There are moments of goodness, which makes this affair more frustrating. The gang hideout side missions showcase what this game could and should have been; a stealthy game of chess where you're taking out bad guys at your pace using the surroundings as your ally. Sadly this is short lived and even during main missions where this mechanic is employed, the campaign inevitably ends with you moshing your way out with twenty police cars chasing you, and their associate terribly car handling, they just ram you to death. And boy will you die a lot in this game, or rather the missions will just end. Did you like the \"tail without getting caught\" missions in Asssassins Creed where one mistake results in an insta-fail and restart? Every single main mission is like this here. Every single one.Let's add insane load times to this mix, and unskippable phone conversations which you will hear many, many times and you have a dirty, vile little game that punishes the player for trying to enjoy it.Forget that it's graphically out of date, that it didn't deliver what it promised, that it's a new IP. It's just plain awful and not worth your time and definitely not worth your money. I do wonder how so many people who apparently worked on it (hundreds according to the credits) were able to make such a game. How not one of them asked themselves \"isn't a game supposed to be, you know  fun?\" Because if they had, they would not have released Watch Dogs as it is.*main campaign completed with 70% of the game done.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2014"}

{"product_name":"B001E8VB6O","reviewerName":"elchamber","summary":"Holy Incarnations Batman, Freaking Finally! (Jest Review)","reviewText":"After playing this game, you'll forget all of the other bad comic book in the past.This is a spooky, creepy, gothic-style sand-box where you play the real Batman.  Real in that he can't jump 20 ft high, but rely on his gadgets, skill and intellect to avoid, escape and hunt enemies, find important evidence and scout locations.  The fighting mechanics are easy that even a 10 years old child can use it, but the difficulty of using it increases where you have to use some of Batman's gadgets to take down larger opponents.  At one of several moments, I had to jump into a group of enemies to get to a location.  At first I was hesitant, but then I remember how easy it can be if I remember how to deal with each kind of enemy.  First, I see what kind of enemies their are and plan my onslaught.  To test and hone-in you fighting skills, you have challenges outside the main game to practice on.It's not just a button-smashing game, its also a puzzler.  You can switch into 'detective mode' to find evidence, trophies and solve environmental riddles as well as figure out how to get to one place to another.I beat the game in 10 hours, but worth going back to try on harder challenging levels as well as to complete the entire game.  Puzzles were very cleaver.  I had trouble with a certain type of puzzle that I decided to completely ignore them.  Now, I have figured it's skillful ways and hitting myself for not thinking of it earlier.Two things I hated were the fact that I couldn't get to certain locations and be able to get things without the upgrades I got later.  The next problem of mine is that the game ended where Batman goes back to Gotham City.One actual problem is the Scarecrow challenges.  The camera angles and controls aren't that responsive verses the way the main game version.  I liked them at first to give me a break from the main story line's gameplay, but became increasingly annoying when trying to time an action.  It took me several times pressing on the buttons to have it work.I can say, Batman Arkham Asylum is one of the best games I've ever purchased.PARENTS:  If your thinking of purchasing this game for your kids, here is what to expect.  Light or mild sexual themes.  Poison Ivy is presented in a seductive way and mild innuendos from criminals stating, \"I wouldn't mine playing doctor with her.\"Violence is suggestive.  The locations have skulls and bones.  Bodies lying in the floor or hang on their limbs(Batman only knocks out his opponents or left to their end, while criminals kill).  No gory images if you could on a little blood dripping of Batman's mouth after a hit.  No bad language.  Basically, if you've watch or seen the animated series then you pretty much see what level of sex and violence it has.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2009"}

There are plenty of other reviews to give you more details about the actual gameplay.My only complaints, and these are minor:  Experience is doled out much too slowly.  It takes forever to level up and upgrade your costumes/attacks.  If you want to fully deck out a character you would probably need to play through the game 3-4 times at least (rough estimate).  If you tire of the slow pace of progress, there are cheat codes you can use, which we eventually resorted to.Some of the attacks are amazing, some are lame or just not that fun/interesting.  The point is that it's tough to know which is which at first, so you'll end up wasting some experience upgrading something only to find out that you don't use it.Lastly, it's not always readily apparent where you need to go next.  The minimap shows as red the areas you haven't been, but if your objective is \"get to the control deck\" you may have to blunder around a bit until you find it because they don't tell you how to get there.However, I consider these minor issues in a great game.

This PS3 update, however, left me a little cold. The gameplay is extremely repetitive and the world you roam as the Prince is needlessly complicated to navigate. There are some cool acrobatic and wall running moves as with the previous games, but nothing new and different enough to hold the attention for long. Give this one a pass, or at least rent it first.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2011"}

My excitement, however, quickly gave way to frustration.  While the story and the acting were fine, the gameplay itself is infuriating.  I can handle difficult games, but there's something very unsatisfying about having to empty a clip into each foe to take them down.  I felt like I was blowing paper wrappers off straws at guys.  In both games, I also shared the same anguish of a merciless save system.  Die, loading screen, start over from where you were five minutes ago, die, loading screen, repeat ad nauseum until you just can't take it anymore.  Too much sneaking, weapons far too impotent... both games shared the same problems, and neither were good for me.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2013"}

It plays like an action game, much faster than WoW and is obviously best played with a controller.2. The animations are decent, not silky smooth but kind of cool.3. The interface is horrible IMO. The icons are blue and hard to tell apart, the usability is horrible and a bit laggy. For instance, comparing a new item with something you already have on has to be done manually, no hover overs, etc..4. The character creation is pretty cool. Not a ton of options but plenty to be unique and the interface was well done.5. As with many MMOs people are experiencing a lot of problem getting online, crashes, queues, errors, etc...Overall I see the game has potential but would recommend buying it. It's possible some of these things have already been addressed or will be soon. Wait and see or get a trial before buying.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002I0K3M0","description":"","reviewerName":"Just Trying to Help","summary":"If you like party games, then buy it.  otherwise, not so much.","reviewText":"Personally, I would only get Nintendoland if I got a 32GB WIi U (oh yeah, I did that).  The 32 GB gives you a cradler charger, a 10% rebate on online purchases from nintendo through 2014, extra GB and , TA DA, NintendoLand.Considering that the price difference between the 8GB and the 32GB is only $50 (at reputable stores) I can't really see how its worth $60 thats being charged today.Don't get me wrong... its a really fun game.  But my 3 star review is based on \"VALUE\".Nintendo Land has a nice set of games that introduce you to life with the video controller.  12 games in all ... ok, 13 if you count a little pachinko game in the center tower.6 are multiplayer and 6 are single player.  The multiplayer games are what makes NintendoLand shine.  Many of the single player games don't have much play value.1) Some of the games are a lot of fun. The most popular minigames in our house are the game where one player pretends to be a ghost and scares other players. This is accomplished by having two screens, the ghost can see everyone, but nobody else knows where the ghost is. This is always a howling good time at our house. The Mario hide and seek works the same way and is also popular with us.2) Some of the games would be worth about $1 in an \"app store\". (balloon game and yoshi game, I'm talking to you!)3) Some games have more than one control scheme. The Pikmin game is enjoyed by my 4 year old because he can use a stylus to direct \"Captain Olimar\" instead of the joysticks/d-pads. Thats the nice thing about having multiple control options. So for the first time even my youngest can join in on at least some of the action.4) Metroid shows off what the Wii U can do for multiplayer combat/FPS. The player with the video controller operates a \"helicopter\" while everyone else are \"ground troops\". The two screens allow for different perspectives in battle.I would be very happy to pay about $30 for this.  I think that would be a fair price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I0K3M0","description":"","reviewerName":"Thomas Riccardi","summary":"Nintendoland a great party game for the Wii U","reviewText":"When the Wii was released there was a game that came with it called Wii Sports and it was the iconic version that sold systems. The games were fun to play either solo or with some friends and it made people want to purchase the Wii. Now that Nintendo has launched it's new console the deluxe bundle comes complete with a game and that is Nintendoland. But will this game be as fun and sell as many systems as Wii Sports did or is this one theme park that you do not want to go to?Nintendoland sports twelve games and some can be played solo while others can be played with friends either competitively or cooperatively. The games you can play as a team are The Legend of Zelda battle quest (where you and three of your friends use swords to battle enemies while the one with the game pad uses a bow.), Pikmin adventure (where you and your friends navigate thru various stages ) and Metroid Blast (as three of you are mii's on the ground but the one holding the game pad is in control of Samus's gunship).The competitive games will have you talking smack with your friends and they range from Luigi's ghost mansion (as you are armed with flashlights trying to spot the ghost while the ghost holding the game pad is trying to take out the rest of the players), Mario Chase (which is a fun game to play as one of the players dresses up as mario and the rest are toads as they run around various levels trying to catch mario) and the last is Animal Crossing Sweet Day (as you take on the role of an animal crossing character trying to steal candy as one player holding the game pad is a guard trying to catch you and make you drop you sweet ill gotten gains).When there are no friends around you can still play solo games as there are six to play based on various classic Nintendo franchises. Takamaru's ninja castle will have you launching paper shurikens at ninjas, Donkey Kongs Crash Course has you trying to navigate a cart thru various tracks, Captain Falcon's Twister Race looks a lot like the classic F-Zero SNES game, Octopus Dance which is a rhythm game, Yoshi's Fruit cart which has you collecting all the fruit in various levels and my favorite Balloon Trip Breeze based off the old NES balloon fight game.I have to say if you wanted to buy a Wii U and got this title bundled with the system it will definitely keep you busy until you get some of the other games out there.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000TT4GBG","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"Loads of Fun; questionable quality of instruments","reviewText":"I originally I thought I would NEVER pay over $[...] for a video game.  I even held off on getting GHIII because I didn't want to pay the then $[...] price tag for a video game.  Luckily I never had to because I got it for Christmas.  GHIII has obvious flaws (i.e. Boss Battles), but I still am having fun with it along with GHII.  However after a while I started longing for more songs and more variety.  Sure I can purchase new songs off of XBL for GHIII, but I decided that I would finally bite the bullet and see what all the hype about Rock Band was about.The instruments themselves are the game's weak link.  I have heard many stories of the pedal breaking and that was one reason I haven't go Rock Band sooner.  So far however the pedal seems to be holding up for me, I just am sure to only use my bare foot when playing and make it a point to instruct my easily excitable son to do likewise.  The drums themselves started giving me problems after having the game for about 10 weeks.  For some reason the blue drum stopped registering some hits, unless I absolutely pounded it.  Of course 10 weeks is about 10 days past the new 60 day Harmonix warranty, so they basically told me I was SOL.  There was no way I was paying 80 bucks for a new drum set so I researched the internet for some fixes and found a kit that would replace the drum sensors.  Before I spent money on the new sensors, I took apart the drum and jiggled the sensor.  That seemed to fix it for the time being, if I continue to have problems, I will then get the sensor kit.  It's sure a heck of a lot of better than buying another drum kit that will probably fail right after the warranty expires as well.I also had to RMA the Stratocaster Guitar a few weeks before my drum set started messing up.  The problems I started having was the effects switch would turn on even by just touching it, in addition I had issues with it is double strumming.  This occurred during the warranty period and was also BEFORE Harmonix instituted the new 60 day warranty, so I got a new one with no problem at all, and haven't had any more problems since.  Even still I think overall, the Strat is made MUCH better than that cheap piece of junk Les Paul Guitar from GHIII.  First off the neck is permanently attached to the base so no unreliable \"pogo-pins\" to deal with as with the Les Paul.  In addition the Stratocaster's buttons are also structured differently; the buttons don't stick or get stuck as they sometimes do with the Les Paul.  The strum bar with the Stratocaster will take some getting used to.  After playing GHIII for a while, I became used to the \"click\" feedback the Les Paul provided, with the Stratocaster however, there is no \"click\" or any feedback for that matter.  If you are coming from GHIII, this will certainly throw you and your timing off.  It was an annoyance at first, but now I am pretty used to it, and it's not much of a problem anymore.  In addition the Stratocaster is wired, but the cord is very long so it's not much of an issue for me.  Being wired is not necessarily a bad thing because there are no batteries you have to worry about.The actual game is quite similar to the Guitar hero series except that instead of only being able to play the guitar, you can also play drums and sing.  In addition while you can't play the Bass in single player career mode, you CAN play it Single player quick play mode.  In GHIII you could only play bass during multiplayer or practice mode.  Everything else about RB will be very familiar to you; instead of \"Star Power\" you have Overdrive which is basically the same thing.  The only main difference between the two is during \"Overdrive\" you can continue to fill your overdrive meter after you have activated it.  Overdrive will also bring your band member back from the \"dead\" if they fail during multiplayer.  You will need to do this because once a band member is out, the entire band will suffer.  No matter how good you are playing, you will continue to lose the crowd if other band member(s) are no longer playing.Other than getting used to the zero feedback Stratocaster, playing the guitar in RB is similar to GH, there are still hammer-ons and pull-offs and they function exactly the same way.  Some cool additions to the RB guitar is that the whammy bar can create different sound effects depending on what you set the knob to.  The coolest thing about the RB guitar is the addition of solo fret buttons near the base of the guitar.  You can use these buttons at any time during a song, but their purpose is to be played during a blue \"solo section\".  The best part of these buttons is that during a solo section you don't even have to strum, just tap them as the notes appear on the screen.  You can however strum if you want, and it is recommended if you encounter the same series of notes during a section.  One thing that sets RB apart from GH is the Solo section; it adds an entirely new level of fun and excitement to the game.The vocals portion is something I really don't mess around with, but surprisingly, the pitch recognition is actually good.  I was able to complete songs using the vocals on medium.  On hard I don't know if I would be able to do it.  One thing to keep in mind about the vocals is that it doesn't care about getting the words right, it only cares about the pitch.  So you really can just hmmm through a song, make up your own words and still pass.The drums portion is quite interesting and surprisingly tricky unless the game has your 100% concentration.  Not only do you have to worry about hitting the pads at the right time, you also have to hit the pedal when you see a long orange bar in the note track.  I have never played drums in my life, but I got through Medium with no problem, right now I am squeaking my way through Hard with 10 songs to go.  However, as tricky as the drums are they are still rather fun to play.Some songs in rock band have freestyle sections that you can play anything you want to rack up more points (and activate overdrive for the drums); the only catch is that you have to nail the note(s) immediately following the section for it to count.  Freestyle sections sometimes appear at the end of the song (known as a \"Big Rock Ending\") as well and the same rules apply.  As far as the song selection in RB goes, the original set list is better than GHIII's set list, but that is just my own personal opinion.Difficulty-wise, I find RB a little easier than GHIII.  In fact after beating career mode on Hard and even 30/42 songs on expert career in GHIII, I was able to pick up RB and jump to Hard immediately and finish all the songs without much problem, and then I went back and beat it on Expert without much issue.  On \"Hard\" difficulty Flirting with Disaster was the only song that I didn't beat on my first couple of tries, and is the hardest song on \"Hard\" to me; on `Expert\" difficulty, the hardest song to me is Green Grass and High Tides.  Even on Expert, none of the songs in Rock band are impossibly difficult to the point where I just give it up all together.  One reason I think RB is easier than GH is that the songs aren't over charted, like they are in GH; harder difficulties on GH just mean more chords.  Another great thing about RB career mode is that there are no stupid, corny, and cheap Boss Battles to deal with.  Boss Battles really hurt GHIII, and thankfully RB doesn't have them, so to me RB is all the fun without the annoyances that GHIII has.Online play is available but I really only play band matches instead of head to head because people will ALWAYS quit if they are losing.  Like many others, Harmonix and/or EA are unwilling to do anything to discourage quitting online, so there is no point even wasting my time going head to head with anyone unless they are physically in my living room.There are also tons of songs available for purchase from XBL, but they are quite expensive.  One song costs 160 points which from what I have read is double than what they used to be.  160 point is about $[...].  If you buy a \"pack\" your cost per song will go down a little, but most songs do not come in packs.  I usually don't buy stuff of XBL, but I have bought a few songs that I like.  I guess it wouldn't be so bad if you actually got a MP3 version of the song as well, but $[...] to just play ONE song on a video game is kind of steep.  So in essence you are paying twice as much for a song you can only play on Rock Band when an MP3 version of the song only costs $[...] to download from a music site.  I think there are nearly 100 songs available for download now so if you were to get them all, you would have to spend close to 200.Overall I find Rock Band loads of fun to play.  I still play GHII, and GHIII as well, but RB adds a little more depth with the additional instruments and solo buttons on the guitar.  My only complaints are the questionable quality and reliability of the instruments, and the amount of money people have to pay to get additional songs off of XBL; but then again people don't HAVE to purchase them.  I just wish they were available at a cheaper price.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2008"}
{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"The Tech Fanatic \"The Tech Fanatic\"","summary":"One of THE Best Games of this Console Generation","reviewText":"Uncharted 3 is without a doubt one of the best game I have ever played in this console generation. I dare say that it may be THE best game. I have played highly rated games such as Fallout 3, Zelda Twilight Princess, Half-Life 2, Prince of Persia, Mass Effect, Bioshock, etc. and this one tops them all. I never thought that Uncharted 2 could be topped but it did in every way. From the story to the gameplay to the graphics it is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. I can tell that they spent a lot of time creating this game.The gameplay which is the most important in any video game is top-notch. It was fun from start to finish. I was so engrossed in the game that I found myself playing for much longer than I had planned each session. This game just feels very polished. My only gripe is that the cover system is not as good as Call of Duty's. But I can forgive this small weakness in the game mechanics area. Sometimes you are trying to go for cover and instead you end up throwing yourself in front of the enemy fire. The aiming seems to have been improved but it is not quite as good as Call of Duty's. But, hey, this is an action game, not a shooter per say. The platforming aspects can be iffy sometimes but overall it is pretty good. It reminds me of Prince of Persia especially the levers and climbing. I only encountered one glitch in the whole game where I got stuck in the sand. The battles are for the most part manageable on normal. There are some quite challenging ones towards the end where you are running and gunning all the while being shot at and having grenades thrown at you from all directions. But after a few trial and error I was able to meet the challenge.The graphics of this game is top-notch. The environments are on par with the best of Prince of Persia. The walls, for example, show a lot of detail. You can tell that they spent a lot of time in this area. The character animations are also excellent. The FMV's or cutscenes are the best I have seen and used quite well. They are quite seamless and are not placed there just to take a break from the action. They are there to continue the storyline. I love the humor that they used during the cutscenes and during the gameplay. I felt like I was inside of a movie.The sound effects, music soundtrack and dialogue were excellent. The voice actors were very good. They breathed life into the characters. I found myself rooting for Drake and wanting to take down the baddies just because I wanted him to succeed.The storyline unfolds like a good novel. This is a big reason I could not put down this game. Normally, I try to play a chapter or two of a game and then call it a day. I like to savor games rather than try to finish it as fast as I can. But in this case, I didn't want it to end but I had to find out what happened next. But it is an epic game so I got my money's worth. There is one aspect of the storyline that was left hanging. And that is in regards to two comrades of Drake that played an important part during the earlier stages of the game. The story does not mention them during the ending which left me wondering what happened to them. Maybe they are going to play a role in the next installment that will explain that? It seems that the ending leaves that part open. My favorite part of the story was where we learn of how Sully and Drake came to be partners in crime. That chase scene involving young Drake was so hilarious and I found myself laughing out loud. I've never done that in any game ever. It was very funny and I really enjoyed it. It was an origins of sort. I believe that they could develop that more in an entirely separate game. You'll see what I mean when you play this game.This game is so epic that I found myself in the midst of a boss battle and thinking that it was close to the ending of the game only to find out that I wasn't even close to finishing the game. In most long games that I have played chapter 18 would have been just about the ending. But no, it continues on. I was wanting to find out what was going to happen in the end but at the same time happy to find out that I had some more juicy tidbits to unravel. That is a mark of a great game. It just keeps you coming back for more. There is never a dull moment in this game.As if the game was not enough, they tacked on a multiplayer aspect which I have not played yet but will eventually.In summary, if you own a Playstation 3 be happy to know that you own the system that has Uncharted. If you have the system and do not play this game which I believe is a must-play, you are missing out BIG TIME. Do whatever you got to do to get this game. Buy it, borrow it or rent it. But if you are going to rent it, be prepared for the possibility that you will need two rentals to complete the game is it is epic. You will still get your money's worth.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2013"}

The graphics are amazing they make the Two Towers game look like an N64 game.  The animation is very smooth and who can forget the amazing effect.  In the beginning of game you will pick one of three paths to follow.  You can pick Sam and Frodoes (play as Sam or Frodo) adventure of getting the ring to Mount Doom.  You can pick Gandafs adventure (play as Gandaf) as he helps to take down Isingurd and defend Minas Tirith. The last path to take will allow you to play as Aragorn, Legolas, or Gimli, as they cause all kinds of hell, from fighting dragons, to ghosts, to thousands of Orcs and Goblins, and other things in black armor.  There are also three secret characters that you can unlock. (one of them is Golom). Return Of The King will offer more then 15 different levels to play.  In a lot of levels you can interact with items and weapons, like shooting a catapult or big battle bows, to climbing latter's and sliding down ropes.  A cool new feature to the game is Co-op mode.  This means you can fight every level with a friend at your side.  If you don't have any friends you can play with a random person online, how cool is that.  The only reason I give this game four stars is one the Camera angle can screw you up in some places.  At times the camera will be perfect at other times you wont be able to see crap.  Another problem is they haven't changed the formula of the game.  In almost every level you go to an area kill 50 Orcs and go to the next area.  Not all the levels are like that but a lot of them are.  Every character has three basic attacks quick attack, fierce attack, and ranged attack, you can also parry.  As you kill enemies you will gain experience, which will allow you to buy new attacks and combos. In the end LOTR Return Of The King is a great game, you should definitely by it.  Beware they game has movie footage from ROTK and it may spoil it so you might want to hold off till December, but hell I wont.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2003"}
{"product_name":"B006W41W82","description":"","reviewerName":"Vynny \"Vynrod\"","summary":"Aural heaven!","reviewText":"If you're a late night FPSer with a family sleeping nearby then at some point you're almost certainly going to have to consider a headphone solution as the loud guns blasting from games such as COD and BF3 et al wake folks kipping in the wee hours. As a person in that scenario I was happy to receive Turtle Beach's XP300 for review and I must say I'm incredibly impressed.Every set up is slightly different but the cables and equipment supplied in this package had me running in no time. As with most people these days I connect my 360 to the TV via HDMI and use the TV set's speakers. The Xp300 comes with pass-through RCA red/white cables which allow you to add them to your TV or receiver without taking up an existing output. So if your audio connections are limited, say because you have a roku, DVD player, apple tv etc you won't need to lose one or have to swap out the connections each time you want to use the XP300. In my case, I connected the RCA to the audio OUT on my TV. If you have a TV less than four years old then it most certainly should have the same output and is probably the easiest way to get your 360's audio to the headphones.The other end of the RCA is connected to the wireless transmitter which derives its power from a USB port on your 360. With that done you're ready to pair the headphones (if necessary) to the base transmitter and then finally pair the mic on off dongle which attaches to your controller and talks to the phones to mute team talk. Finally, hook up the other supplied USB cable to allow the phones to recharge during downtime. One nice thing I noticed was the 360 supplies power for recharging even when switched off so the headphones are always ready to rock. If it's all set up correctly you should hear game sound both through the headphones and the TV and then it's simply a case of muting the TV's sound.If all this sounds complicated it's not and I had the phones working in about five minutes. You can individually control game sound versus chat too which is an important touch when both are being fed to your ears from the same phones.The phones themselves are very comfortable and feel well made - not cheap, weightless plastic toys. And audio quality is stunning and strolling through the marketplaces in Assassin's Creed has never sounded so realistic and atmospheric. You know you can hear flies and insects buzzing about! It adds so much and really is quite remarkable. Thankfully, there have been zero interruptions in the audio, delays or dodgy static or any issues that have plagued some wireless headphones that I've had in the past and the EQ settings add a lot to the appropriate games.I didn't try pairing my cellphone with the set although that's a really nice feature to have, but if I had one complaint it's that the mic is only on one side - I know it shouldn't matter with stereo headphones but for some reason I prefer a mic on the right and you can't do that here.Aside from that I couldn't be more happy with this bit of kit. It's revitalized my late night gaming and the family is grateful too. At the price it's a must-have device for every 360 owner.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2012"}

The motion sensing and voice activation works great.  Just make sure you have enough distrance from your tv about 6-10 feet.  The reason I marked it down one star because some of the games are just crap and the motion sensing is horrendous on some games.  The game it comes with Kinect Adventures is just ok, but it does help you get use to the Kinect.

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"SnS \"&#34;Those are my principles and if you ...","summary":"If It Ain't Broke.....Apparently You DO Fix It","reviewText":"I have been an avid Final Fantasy fan since I was introduced to it at FFVII.  I loved what has since become the very definition of RPGs.  I enjoyed the turn-based fighting, the gorgeous graphics, deep storylines, and the wonderful imagination behind the creatures, spells, weapons, etc.  Final Fantasy has always been one of my favorite franchises.  Naturally, when XIII was available for pre-order, I did.Well the imagination is still very much there.  The characters are well thought out.  The weapons are beautifully created, the voice-acting is still top-notch.  On the surface, everything is there that made these games a staple for any gamer's collection.  However, I am not overly thrilled with the changes that have been made.By now, I am sure there are dozens of reviews covering how fighting has changed, and it's true.  The fighting system is drastically overhauled.  Gone are the days of the turn-based fighting that ultimately, in my humble opinion, made these games iconic and great.  Sure they may not be as exciting as the XIII battles, but I liked it.  I LIKED controlling my party's actions.  I LIKED being able to take a phone call mid-battle and not even HAVE to pause the game.  I LIKED not being graded on every battle I did.  Does this make XIII bad?  Not in any way, but if there was one thing I would ask Square is this:  \"You experimented.  It's successful.  Now please go back to the old style.  And while you're at it.  Bring back exploration.\"  Yes, I know I sound like a rigid fanboy of the old games, but I would like to meet anyone who isn't a die-hard fan of the old games that rushed out this soon to BUY this game.  Chances are they are few and far between.Final Fantasy XIII is NOT a bad game.  Far from it.  It really is an very good game. However, the very things that made this franchise great are slowly being weaned out it favor of newer ideas and systems that frankly, I don't feel enhances the game in any way.  This is honestly the first time I have played a Final Fantasy game that I did not feel was a 5-star.  Something is missing, and that something is the gameplay mechanic that the fans have grown to love.The graphics are unsurpassed.  The sound is top-of-the-line.  The story, while not SPECTACULAR so far, is still very engaging.  I just don't like feeling so disconnected from my party and where they go.  With new RPGs (coming) out that offer so much in party control and personalization and storyline, I would have expected Final Fantasy to do something along the lines of branching storylines, or additional character customization, or even a larger world to explore if they were looking to improve the franchise.  Instead we have a railroad car that barrels us toward our objective with little say in how we meet that objective.With all my gripes, it is easy to think I don't like this game.  Far from it.  This game is still the benchmark for RPGs.  However, with the \"improvements\" being made, I would consider it to be a far easier benchmark to reach.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"To be or Not To Be","summary":"Boring and too easy to play","reviewText":"The last time I played Final Fantasy was when it was on Nintendo, which was like 20 years ago. I consider that old version (FF III) more fun to play than this. I haven't played FF since then. I'm only 4 chapters deep into this game and I accomplish that in less than 3 hours of playing. Its basically one straight path of killing stuff to end the story for that chapter. Along the way, there's like dozens of save points. At each save point, you can buy stuff or upgrade your weapons(and there's not much stuff to buy). Again, I only finish 4 chapters in this game and I'm not impress. Fighting is too simple since you will be selecting auto battle most of the time (at least that's what I've been doing). If your main character dies, the game is over. You may retry the battle or reload from last saved point. What's the point of having potions that can resurrect fallen player then? I mean, there's one or two other characters that is helping you fight. Why can't I go to them to heal my fallen character (maybe I can switch characters later in the game, but that would be stupid. They should of had that option straight from the beginning). Another thing I hate is that you can only equip your guys with one weapon and one bracelet. One weapon I understand, but people can wear more than one bracelet on them.The only thing great about this game is graphics. Other than that, it is literally boring and stupid. The acting or voices is really annoying. I rather put the TV on mute than to listen to these characters talk.Bottom line: This game makes no sense at all! No free world to explore. No towns or shops to buy stuff (come on, buy stuff at save point? that's so boring and too easy). Too much cut scenes. Will this game be more fun if I keep playing or would it be the same throughout? I'm guessing its going to be the same throughout, which is \"one straight path to victory.\" Dull and boring!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0001ADAMO","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution. With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well. As if the technical edge wasn't enough of a reason to invest in the Xbox version, it's also Live Aware, and comes packaged with an exclusive multiplayer level (the Coliseum). Without the slightest hint of doubt, the Xbox version gets The Edge.Concept:Clean up the west as a merciless cowboy in this heavily influenced spaghetti western gameGraphics:The character models are not the most detailed, but the environments look nice and I love the cameraworkSound:A remarkable soundtrack lures players into the vibe of the westPlayability:Unnaturally short levels and satisfactory run and gun actionEntertainment:The stages should have been longer, but replay is abundant in the number of unlockables and enjoyable multiplayerReplay:ModerateRated:8 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:Buck up, cowpokes. All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"rebecca","summary":"fun but gets hard","reviewText":"The first half of the game is fun but then it gets difficult. the multiplayer is funner then the single player storyline","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2012"}

That's your cue to draw your sword and join the fray.","reviewerName":"Michael J. Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"One of the most beautiful games to ever grace the PS2","reviewText":"I had low expectations for Rygar. After all, my only contact with the game was when it was an extremely difficult side-scroller in the arcades. Sure, Rygar's concept was cool - a barbarian who throws a Yo-yo of Death (okay, it's called Diskarmor, but you get the idea). What's not to like?Rygar: The Legendary Adventure changed my perceptions of what Rygar was about. Rygar was reimagined as a Greek tale, much the same way that Link was reimagined as a Celtic hero. Being an avid role-player, I appreciated the change.But there's a lot more to Rygar than just throwing a shield at weird caterpillars. The realm is firmly (if rather inaccurately) rooted in Greek mythology. Echidna, Typhon, Minotaur, Centaur, Sphinx, Cretus, Greek gods...the whole gang is here. And the settings are beautiful - backgrounds look and feel like Greek landscapes and vistas. Even better, Rygar is encouraged to destroy everything in sight and his efforts are rewarded by the massive collapse of pillars, statues, and caverns. It's like Classical graffiti. Unlike Superman: Shadow of Apokolips, you actually feel as if you're hitting hard things when you hit them with your Diskarmor. The Diskarmor sparks and bounces as it hits solid rock.The princess you have to rescue is a spitting image of Britney Spears. Depending on your opinion of Britney, that's a good or bad thing.The game revels in its beautiful levels, giving Rygar ample opportunity to explore it all. The Temple of Poseidonia is especially breathtaking, with sparkling waterfalls and glowing seashells. Equally impressive are the Skies of Arcadia, where Rygar must do battle miles above the earth and clouds. Fortunately, if you fall off you don't die but rather start over at the nearest large floating island. This single piece of thoughtful design is what stopped me from completing Akuji the Heartless. It's a compliment to say that Rygar got everything right that Akuji tried to do - take an unusual setting and make it both visually interesting and fun to play.Like Final Fantasy, there are familiars that can be summoned to unleash even more damage on Rygar's enemies. There are three: Siren, Cerberus, and the not-quote-phonetically-correct Taros (that'd be Talos, but the Engrish translation screwed it up). The Diskarmors can also be improved by gaining experience (er, sorry, &quot;sfaira&quot; which means &quot;sphere&quot; in Greek). By improving the three different types of Diskarmor, Rygar can add mystic stones. Mystic stones enhance the powers of the shield, including the ability to heal, inflict more damage, or defend better. Some people call this a &quot;role-playing element.&quot; I don't, but it's still neat.There are a few things wrong with Rygar. For one, the voice acting is awful. I know voice actors - they have brains, and anyone who speaks English should not be reciting the badly translated crap from Japanese that was foisted upon Rygar. Don't any of these voice actors turn to the guy handing them the script and say, &quot;Nobody would say it like that!&quot;? In one instance, the bad guy is trying to get Rygar's soul. So he states, &quot;I will crush your soul, and steal your body.&quot; That'd be &quot;Crush your body so I can steal your soul.&quot; The voice acting is bad enough that it detract from the game.Rygar's plot is nearly impenetrable due to the bad translation. It loosely involves Aristotle (yes, THAT Aristotle), Cleopatra, and Julius Casear (along with his son, Caesarion). Because of the poorly constructed plot, the whole thing comes off as if someone threw a bunch of Greek names in a blender and made a story out of it.The monsters are strangely out of place in an adventure set in mythic Greece. The rollers are a cross between pissed off centipedes and caterpillars. They move just like caterpillars too. But why is Rygar fighting so many of them? Or the strangely acrobatic Hycanithus (wouldja believe they're killer flowers)? Or the Harpuai, which are floating arms. The only Ancient Greek monster that shows up on a regular basis are the cylcopes, but they're rare. C'mon folks, this is Greek myth, there's plenty of other critters to thrown into the game.But I quibble. Although Rygar isn't as good as it could be, it's still one of the most beautiful games to ever grace the Playstation 2. I played it obsessively until I beat it. And that's the best recommendation I can give any game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2004"}

This is, quite simply, the greatest open world I've ever seen in a game, and it's a joy to behold and explore. I typically don't enjoy open world type games too much, but this one is just about perfect, enhanced with intelligent &#34;fast travel&#34; options (not just for major locations, but for locations within other locations!), clearly marked objectives, and a beautifl ship that is magnificent to pilot across the open waters.Though the combat (both on foot and aboard the Jackdaw) is fun and intuitive, my favorite parts of this game is the exploration. It's such a joy to sail across the Carribean, diving through sunken ships, searching for loot while attempting to avoid the notice of the circling Great White sharks... or slinking through a smuggler's cove, attempting to relieve the pirates of their stolen goods... or finding a new island with hidden secrets and interesting wildlife.There is so much detail AND content packed into AC4, it's astonishing... it's clearly a labor of love, and one of the few games where you can actually see why it required hundreds of developers, programmers, and artists. It's so much fun, and such a beauty to behold, I still look forward to my trips into the animus, and I'm hoping for my content, in addition to the Freedom Cry DLC (I have not tried the multiplayer yet).

Basically, Nathan Drake (a descendant of Sir Francis Drake) wants to find El Dorado as Francis did. There are a bunch of twists and maybe a funny moment or two. Overall, the story is a well-written one, making the game that much more enjoyable. There's also a big twist at the end that makes Uncharted look like Resident Evil, but I don't want to spoil it for anybody.Shooting: Yes, I know some people are disappointed with the shooting, but I'm not. Without shooting in this game, it would've been kind of dull. And you can tell the shooting isn't just a last minute add-on to waste time because it ties into the story. My favorite guns have to be the Wes and the Dragon Sniper. The Moss (the one Nate is holding on the cover) is OK, but not for far distances. The Wes can kill anybody in sight with just one bullet, and the Dragon Sniper does the same but for enemies that are farther away. The variety of guns is great, and I don't know what Uncharted would be without the guns.Graphics: This game has by-far some of the best graphics I've ever seen in a video game. I recommend you have a big TV (40\" and up, maybe) and the HDMI cable (I bought mine for under ten bucks) to completely tie in the beauty. Every little detail is beautiful, I couldn't even find one blurry spot or not well done spot. The graphics remind me of Call of Duty and Resistance, if not better. This game has a high level of realism that's hard to find in a video game.There you have it--a perfect ten out of ten video game. Everything in this game is perfect in my opinion. It's an addicting fun good time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2009"}

I have racked up a modest 12 hours of play time.  In that time in the Skyrim world I slay dragons, spend time on quests learning about the people, the world, and in the process killed many enemies while helping friends.  I have wandered aimlessly around.... And that is much of the best part of playing!I have a long history with Oblivion.  It was absolutely one of my favorite games and I am still playing some of the third party developed sequels.  So what was my obsession?  Open and seemingly infinite sand box quality... wander to your hearts content.  Climb a mountain just to see the view and listen to the crickets or wind or gravel under your feet.  (Play with headphones you will find the immersion quality very high).  The large and varied skill tree that allows you to learn and tweak your character as you grow.  The huge variety of weapons, spells, and potions (you can craft and enchant).  The variety of main story line missions and seemingly endless side tasks you can embark on just by chatting up the locals.  In short, Oblivion and now Skyrim, represented the ultimate first person fantasy game for me.As an experienced Oblivion player, it did not take long for me to settle in and understand the updated navigation system; along with what I needed to do to advance some skills I always love having.  As a \"High Elf\", I am what I always want to be, a mage with some melee skills.  As the game moves forward, I am hoping to play my disappearing act very soon with spell based invisibility skills--so far I can find only expensive potions for this ultimate sneaky activity - but it will come with more play time.  That invisibility skill and bringing in undead helpers was what helped me survive in the prior version.  You see, there are things that you do not want to do battle with and I love to sneak by.  There is a new skill called the \"voice\" which you obtain early on, and I will not ruin the what's and whys of that acquisition.  The abilities you can acquire as a player will not disappoint you... be who you are or what you want to be.As for the game itself, the graphics on an Asus G53J with an i7-740QM and a Nvidia GTX-460M, running at high quality are suburb. Details like falling leaves in a forest seem magical. FPS is definitely above 60 and everything is smooth, including multiple party fights.  I have had some slow-downs and have not tracked down the cause yet.  There is nothing running the in background that I can find that would be causing the problem.  They happen only occasionally following a transition (through doors) and require a quick save then an exit to desktop.  Letting the game reset brings everything back to normal.  Maybe an update will tweak this problem gently out of view...As for another graphic quality, Bethesda has done a great job with fighting, and when in a melee, will often automatically move you to a third party cut away view of your final kill.... It is really fun to experience.This is a player's game!  So much to experience and write about, but why not just get started on your own personal experiences?  Highly recommended to those who have never played Oblivion but have wondered why it was and continues to be so popular.  An absolute must purchase for any long term Oblivion players out there.  I fully expect to rack up over 100 hours on Skyrim playing my way - wandering around a world that contains wonders and dangers to be experienced.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2011"}

Having missed part 1 and 2 I wasn't really sure what all the fuss was about. Sure, the commercials for GOW 3 looked pretty epic, but could it really live up to all the accolades being thrown its way? Well, I figured I would give it a chance so I lined up at the local game shop at midnight to pick up a copy so I could play it for an hour or two before getting some pre-work sleep. One or two hours soon turned into four and then five hours. I was having a very hard time making myself turn the game off as I was getting deeper and deeper into the story. I kept promising myself that I would stop at the next save point, but then I would think, okay I will just go a bit farther and then turn it off.Let's start off with the obvious, how does this game look? GOW 3 may possibly be the single greatest looking game ever made! No effort was sparred in bringing the graphics to life. Even the smallest and most distant background items are very detailed. Everything Kratos smashes with his fist or arsenal of weaponry gets covered with blood and gore. I'm not just talking about Mortal Kombat blood for the sake of blood that disappears within a second or two of being splashed into the air. I'm talking about blood patterns that alter the way the baddies and Kratos look as you continue your mission of blood lust. Even the water that Kratos occasionally has to swim and trudge through looks insanely real as it ripples away from his movements. The lighting and shadow effects are as good or better than I've ever seen. For an example of this just check out the Helios boss battle and the cave level that follows.Next let's look at game play. GOW 3 plays like a dream. The controls are fairly simple making switching to the right weapon for the job and being able to double jump from platform to platform completely up to the skill of the player. I will admit that this game is what a lot of people describe as a \"button masher\". You mash buttons to perform combos, complete sequences, and have an extremely intimate exchange with a goddess...yep that last one really happens. The thing about GOW 3 is that button mashing, while it only gets you so far even on the normal difficulty setting, has never been so enjoyable. The melee combat system alone gives you approximately a dozen different ways to decapitate, disembowel, stomp, or throw your enemies. If that doesn't do it for you, simply grab one of the baddies and run around using them as a battering ram to destroy other baddies. Kratos gets a handful of other weapons and items with most of them having some unique use in different situations. My weapon of choice is the Cestus which brings new meaning to the phrase \"open up a can of whoop @$s\". For an example of just how devastating the Cestus can be check out the Hercules boss battle...I mean WOW, this is some brutally epic stuff!Finally there's the story...because if this is just random violence wrapped up in a gorgeous package would it still be fun? In this case I think so, but luckily GOW 3 has a completely enthralling story line. Even if you're like me and didn't have the experience of GOW 1 and 2 you can easily jump into this game. You're given a nearly 20 minute history lesson when you first start the game. You will be up to speed and obliterating a multitude of enemies in no time. Kratos himself is an undeniably interesting character. He is completely brash and uncaring about all the death and destruction unfolding around him due to his own actions. He is blindly driven by his rage and need for revenge which leads to intense and at moments humorous dialogue. The voice acting and mannerisms displayed by all characters could not be more spot on! I can't stress enough how epic the sheer scale and weight of this story is. Smashing your way through waves of baddies and completing puzzles to face off against one of the many truly impressive bosses hasn't been this satisfying since the days of the Nintendo Entertainment System! With GOW 3 clocking in at slightly over 10 hours it's a very satisfying experience whether it's your first or even fifth time playing through. And yes, this game is that deep and visually stunning that 3-5 play-throughs will feel like a breeze.It's time to wrap this thing up! I realize I'm way late to the party when it comes to putting out my thoughts on GOW 3, but it's something I've been meaning to do for quite a long time now. If you have not picked up this game by now then you're looking at some really good timing because you can get it from around $15 used to $25 new. GOW 3 has earned its place among a very select few games ever released that can legitimately be regarded as \"best ever\". On that note, bring on God of War 4!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2011"}

{"product_name":"B003VJNPPE","description":"In BriefThe second instalment in the RPG saga about the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia, features a thoroughly engrossing, mature storyline defining new standards for thought-provoking, non-linear game narration. In addition to an epic story, the game features an original, brutal combat system that uniquely combines tactical elements with dynamic action. A new, modern game engine, responsible both for beautiful visuals and sophisticated game mechanics puts players in the most lively and believable world ever created in an RPG game. A captivating story, dynamic combat system, beautiful graphics, and everything else that made the original Witcher such a great game are now executed in a much more advanced and sophisticated way.DEVELOPER: CD Projekt REDBrief Story DescriptionAfter helping to stop the rebellion undertaken by the Order of the Flaming Rose and saving King Foltest&rsquo;s life, Geralt became one of the central figures of political turmoil in the Kingdom of Temeria. Geralt continues to protect the King in the monarch&rsquo;s mission to bring peace to his state. The last bastions of the Order yielded to the royal army. The only remaining task is to pacify the rebellious castle of Baroness La Valette, who announced separation from the Kingdom. It&rsquo;s been a month since the attempted assassination of the king, when his army arrives at the gates of Baroness La Valette&rsquo;s fortress in preparation for the final battle. In the meantime, Geralt, stuck with Foltest, cannot begin his personal quest - to discover the origin and identity of the mysterious witcher-like assassin responsible for the attempt on the king&rsquo;s life - a quest that would answer many questions...Key FeaturesA truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative events are dependent on the player&rsquo;s choices and lead to multiple different game endings and several additional plot forks. This time gameplay time will be shorter than The Witcher 1, but more intense and packed with events.A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter seldom seen in other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and attractive to contemporary gamers. We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt&rsquo;s personal theme, in which he&rsquo;s looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to play.Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski&rsquo;s book series and The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues sequences, thanks to a new game engine.New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in which we observe the link between our past choices with current actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.Sex and eroticism will be introduced in a much more realistic, involving and mature way, thanks to which sexual relationships are presented more credibly than in TW1.Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide an incredible, believable story-driven experience.Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further actions in the game.Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine create a cohesive, fully accessible world!Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a wider range of new tactical options.

Luckily, since then, I had played some much better role-playing games, namely titles like Divinity II: The Dragon Knight Saga and the one I'm currently reviewing right now, The Witcher II. I really enjoyed The Witcher, but it had some rough edges that were sometimes a bit of a nuisance, but The Witcher II does away with the first game's issues, expands upon nearly everything, and delivers what is easily one of the best role-playing experiences of recent times. Every other RPG developer should take note of the successes by CD Projekt Red with The Witcher II.Positives:- Excellent Story, Well Realized Characters - While other role-playing games can often suffer due to being developed on lower budgets, The Witcher II is a grand title with stellar production values. The story is well told and keeps the player involved. The characters are well voiced, interesting, and just well done all around. This is a story for more mature players. CD Projekt Red didn't pull any punches with this one.- Gorgeous Art Direction, Stunning Technical Graphics - The Witcher II is no doubt a showpiece for your PC. Not only is the the art among the best, but it's technically a masterful experience in terms of graphics. The graphics are detailed, including nicely rendered characters and environments, well done texture detail, stunning lighting, and it goes on and on. And like I said earlier, the art is absolutely wonderful and only lends to the beauty of this title. The world of The Witcher II feels like a living and breathing place packed with detail.- Hardly Any Recycled Assets - The Witcher II doesn't use many recycled assets in the game world. There is a lot of variety to the texture work, NPC models, environments, etc. This world must've taken a long time to fully realize, as it's a thing of beauty and doesn't wear out its welcome.- Wonderful Gameplay - Different from The Witcher, The Witcher II goes for more simplistic gameplay, which it definitely succeeds at. Gone are the mouse-clicks in favor of a more 1:1 combat system that keeps you in the fight in a more natural way. You have weak attacks, strong attacks, and you also have an evasive roll mechanic that allows you to dodge out of harm's way. In addition to the melee combat, you have Signs, which is also known as the magic attacks. The combat menu is slick and works well. The overall UI is just so well done in The Witcher II. Leveling up has been made simpler with 3 areas for upgrades: Signs, Alchemy and Swordplay.Negatives:- The Witcher II still has some rough edges, but the edges are getting closer and closer to straight as an arrow. This feels like a top notch production from a AAA studio, so even its flaws are very minor.The Witcher II is a compelling and rewarding role-playing adventure that'll immerse you in a grand world, with delightful characters and an overarching story. If you're searching for a role-playing game that is of high quality, you need not look any further, The Witcher II is for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2011"}

Not only do the characters in the game keep repeating the same, overly dramatic things over and over, but it's overflowing with swearing. I get it, it's supposed to be \"war\", but seriously, they just don't say ANYTHING else at all. They hardly ever say anything that even adds to the game play. They just start swearing every time bullets fly, which of course is the whole game. If they aren't swearing they are yelling as loud as they can. It just gets old and you'll find yourself wanting to mute the TV.Next is how the characters work with each other. The idea of working together to draw fire and cover each other is a good one, but the inability to play in a first-person mode (instead always directing your character as if your right behind them) makes shooting and more accurate aiming difficult. You spend more time trying to get your character going in the right direction than fighting the enemy.The game play is ok. Nothing overly creative or memorable. A game that would be easy enough for my 10 year old son to play, but the non-stop barrage of f-bombs keep me from doing so. As you go along in the game, you can purchase better weapons and other accessories. The game saves at certain checkpoints which is helpful in longer missions. You can drag your wounded teammate out of harms way, but the whole time they are repeating the same obnoxious dialog about being hit and it kind of makes you want to just leave them there instead.To sum it up, it's just one of those games that's there to go through the motions. The only unique feature is the co-op game play. Other than that, the missions are nothing special, the characters are way too dramatic, there's no decent background music in the game (just lots of yelling) and there's no first person view for shooting.There are better games out there.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2011"}

I have been a Hardcore Resident evil fan and tho I do admit Resident evil Operation raccon city was allful thats not the case here. Resident evil 6 is an epic masterpiece survivel horror game!Nowadays sites like IGN, and Metacritics have lost my desire to read there ignorant reviews. If the game is fun just buy it. They dont respect the hard work companies like EA and Capcom have done I do respect there hard work! Listen I own most of all the AAA titles this is one of the games lots of people will miss because of bad reviews. I for one cancelled my pre-order but heard amazing things about the game from Gamestop and friends of mine. I ended buying the game and love it its awesome, If your doubting a buy you really need to give this game a chance and rent it. Also if you want to buy it you should I would recommend buying it here on Amazon since its cheap. Long live Epic missed games!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2012"}
{"product_name":"B001IK1BWC","reviewerName":"Darth Borg","summary":"The best rpg I have ever played...","reviewText":"I will not go into a overly detailed review as what needed to been said has been said many times over and the game overall ratings speak for themselves. In general this game remains true to the Bioware tradition and plays out like a interactive movie in which your character has the starring role and his decisions as well as actions will not only determine his party's future but also the game's overall storyline. This game is in the truest senese a offline version of famous online mmo's like World of warcraft, Everquest etc. You get to expirience the same sense of epic adventure with a group of npc party members to help you along in your rise to the end-game. The npc members are very well developed and their interaction with your character is so well done that you actually forget that they are npc's but began to see them as your friends in a epic journey with you. Pretty much its the ideal group with no drama queens or childish members that you can only dream of getting in a mmo and the biggie here is no monthly fees too :)The game is pretty long...took me few months to finish but I am a casual gamer so others might finish it faster but the game does not short-change you in any way when it comes to the content it offers for the money. The game may not have the huge (almost useless) vistas of online mmo's or open-ended world which in my view is done to encompass you within a tightly cordinated storyline which really helps the game unfolds like a taut, interactive fantasy movie. The graphics at the highest settings are good enough, the AI tactics for the npc partymen works really well, the combat in the game is fun, the armor/weapons offered are nicely rendered too. The only con I see is that some boss-fights gets overly challenging and you might have to lower the difficulty level to progress but overall I finished the game about 80% on the normal settings.I will highly recommend the game if you are looking for entertaining fantasy rpg that is currently the absolute best in its genre. Dragon Age is about to be offered with all its expansions as well as DLC's in one box and I cant imagine a better holiday gift for you and your family and in this way you can also get ready for the sequel DA2 well ahead in time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2010"}

A PAINFULLY OK GAME!","reviewText":"UPDATED POSITIVE REVIEW...I had to update my review on Dead Space 3.  The game is far more fun than I had originally believed but you have to stick with it till level 14 to really appreciate just the true fun of Dead Space 3.  My only issue I have with Dead Space 3 is the lack of the fixed save locations throughout the game since they let you stop at predefined places.  The Bench is still tedious but; once you understand its complexity building your own weapons starts to be fun. The awesome thing about the Bench where you craft your own weapon is that, you get to merge the weapons you most love onto one platform.  In Dead Space 1 and 2 you had to choose a good weapon and too often endure a lesser quality variation of that same weapon as an option.  In Dead Space 3 you get to create your own perfect primary and secondary weapons.  Problem is that Dead Space 3 gives you painfully little quality bits to build weapons with at first.  The only way to get started with quality weapons is to download better prepackaged weapons from PS3 Network.  For casual gamers with good jobs like me the spending of $20 or so is no big problems since it just means I won't be playing so many lottery tickets.  With the Lottery I never win so playing $20 on Video games at least I get to have fun with money spent on additional Dead Space 3 guns and down-loadable content.If you wait till chapter 14 you will have three scavenger bots working for you at one time.  Scavenger bots find ration seals by the score so just keep them hunting and you will be flush with ration seals.  You can buy gun upgrades using the BENCH so no need to spend tons of real money on gun upgrades.  My only problem with Dead Space 3 is that it relies too much on trapping you in locked rooms or other no win situations with monsters that can't be killed and you waste time running around and using stasis power for nothing.  Getting trapped in situations with monsters that can't be killed is the sure sign of a bad game and developers who have run out of imagination.  Dead Space 3 is still fun but Dead Space 3 has run out of gas and depends on cheap tricks to create tedium that is hoped to pass for fun..I had to update my review on Dead Space 3.

With the Lottery I never win so playing $20 on Video games at least I get to have fun with money spent on additional Dead Space 3 guns and down-loadable content.Key to making Dead Space 3 fun is the automated BOTS you send off to get you additional resources.  If you collect all the BOTS in the game you will have three of them.  BOTS collect the resources you need to build awesome weapons.  So effective use of the resource collector bots will allow you to build the most powerful and fun weapon combinations.  I have played through Dead Space 3 a number of times now.  Dead Space 3 when it leaves the \"Space\" environment does change the flavor of the game immensely.  The creepy decayed rather claustrophobic nature of the spaceships added a fright factor that being on a planet can not match.  The group play option in Dead Space 3 hurt the experience and helped it as well.  I played Dead Space 3 with my brother who is a 6 ft 8 in 320 pound lovable brute that acts a fool all the time.  We are each others best friend since we both have autism.  Playing Dead Space 3 with my brother was hilarious because; even in the game his wild strange sense of humor comes through in his character based on what what he does.  I totally enjoyed playing Dead Space 3 with my brother in two person play.  We ganged up on aliens kicking and stomping lots of things to death.  Till Dead Space 3 I never spent so much time laughing and having fun playing a video game.  I love my brother with all my heart but this game brought us even closer.  We watch out for each other in real life but in the video game we took that to the next level and it was awesome.  Unfortunately the fact I laughed so much enjoying Dead Space 3 in two player mode that I completely forgot how frightening it is supposed to be.  Now while my brother and I were playing Dead Space 3 other people were so totally creeped out by the blood and gore but, we were both so totally loving it laughing like wild men.  I think the biggest part of the creep factor in Dead Space franchise was the fact you are alone, ALL ALONE with icky things all around you just waiting to leap out and kill you dead!  Don't get me wrong, the game developers likely felt they milked the Space world dry unfortunately being on even the most brutal of planets just feels more safe because; most on Earth are used to life planet side.  Our Earth bound imaginations are far more completely engaged when we are in that unknown alien filled world that is the vacuum and disorienting weightlessness of space.  No other game did weightlessness better than Dead Space and 3 is no exception.  After playing Dead Space 3 many times I must give it five stars in fun and overall.  Dead Space 3 has its shortcomings BUT, it has so many great elements that I can't take a star off.ORIGINAL POST...I'll take my lumps but Dead Space 3 is not scary.  The sheer creepy factor in Dead Space 1 and 2 came from the very close confining nature of the game space aboard ships and stations.  It also helped that ships and other facilities in Dead Space 1 & 2  seemed only barely space worthy.  Dead Space 3 like its previous  versions a has your character do all the fetching \\ hard tasks while others take their sweet time doing less dangerous jobs or making dumb mistakes that place you in peril.  Dead Space 3 has at least one airhead woman who makes a big mistake that you will pay for in blood and tears big time.  Much of the action in Dead Space 3 seems so forced.  Waiting for elevators and trams while infinite creatures swarm in endless waves.  While other monsters that regenerate and can not be killed can very quickly kill you.  Meanwhile an elevator or tram takes its own sweet time getting to you what a crock.  The game basically engineers situations where you are forced into no win situations.  Dead Space 3 has huge sections where nothing is happening as you wander from one place to another.  In Dead Space 1 & 2 there was more atmospherics sounds, flashes and other evironmental creepy events just far enough in the background to keep you guessing.  The whole craft a gun using collected bits at the Bench was not fun just tedious and boring after too short a time.  The Dead Space 3 plot seems a bit more thin compared to previous plots.  Of all the Dead Space franchise Dead Space 2 was the absolute best, the creep factor was there in spades.  The plot was rich and awesome.  The save locations were perfect.  There were no dumb MASS DRIVER CANNONS!The graphics in Dead Space 3 were far better but the planet side exploration was too wide open.  It was the tight quarters of a spaceship where no one could hear you scream that made Dead Space 3 so much fun to play with lights low.  Some places in Dead Space 1 and 2 were so dark the monitor barely lit the room.  There were no save boxes on the walls that gave players opportunities to decide when they wanted to save.  The new save system was regulated by the game as such it decided where the previous check point start point would be.  What's worse the games auto save does not really let you know where important checkpoints are forcing you to replay long missions if you happen to stop or die in the wrong place. The new Dead Space 3 auto save system is a kinda dumb backward design step. You must pay $4.99 or more to get good quality pre-crafted guns placed in your safe what a crock!  It's funny Dead Space 3 is actually easy to play but the changes ruin the game so much I can't for the life of me figure why I'd bother. Dead Space 3 is not scary. Dead Space 3 it is not a really exciting shooter.  Dead Space 3 took an awesome easy to use and understand Bench and ruined it by making it a tedious confusing mess.  The pacing of monster encounters Dead Space 3 sputters along in an episodic pattern that is not fast paced.  When Dead Space 3 is fast paced its usually just waves of un-killable beasts swarming you which is a cheap unimaginative way to generate empty thrills.  Dead Space 3 has none of the plot based foundations that used to guide the thrills in Dead Space 1 and 2.  All monsters now run to you taking away any advantage of distance I enjoyed which makes the Dead Space 3 too predictable and boring.  It is as if the Dead Space 3 developers took all the low road ways to make the game harder which in turn made the game much less fun.This Dead Space is a lot like eating empty calories its filling but in the end nothing sticks to your ribs enough to make you glad for the experience!  The Dead Space 3 developers did not IMPROVE Dead Space 3 by making logical evolutions of the great elements in Dead Space 2 they CHANGED the very look feel and nature of the game.  The creepy things that go bump in the dark aura that set Dead Space 1 & 2 apart from almost any other gaming experience is the very thing that got watered down in Dead Space 3.  Dead Space 3 got lost in \"IMPROVING\" the mechanics of the game to a point where the very things that made Dead Space 3 a thrill a minute creep fest got seriously diluted.  In Dead Space 3 you spend your time looking for scrap metal, gell and other crap so you can spend endless hours crafting weapons.  Problem is by the time you finish finding all the materials and crafting the weapons and materials you are bored stiff and the game has gotten old.  Dead Space 1& 2 were the near perfect and perfect creep filled shooters.  Dead Space 3 wanted to be something more than both Dead Space 1 & 2 and ended up being much less than either.  The best thing about Dead Space 1 & 2 is they both felt highly personal in ways Dead Space 3 does not even come close to matching. Dead Space 3 plays like a game, Dead Space 1 & 2 were like a totally awesome yet painfully creepy suspense filled adventure.  If they had not changed the \"WORK BENCH\" I would have given Dead Space 3 four stars in FUN but the Work Bench is too much work and not enough fun.I rate Dead Space 3 THREE STARS for overall fun because; after getting bored stiff finding materials and \"Crafting Weapons\" there is just enough old Dead Space 1 & 2 spark left in Dead Space 3 to make the game an interesting concept.  However Dead Space 3 overdid the whole engineer centric character focus to the point where it sucks much of the fun from the game. Dead Space 1 & 2 worked because they gripped your imagination and never let it go.  Dead Space 3 grips your wallet and little else.  I must admit some people will love running all over finding materials to \"Craft Weapons!\"  Also I must admit some of the weapons combinations you can Craft are awesome if you can make sense of then use the clumsy badly executed Bench mechanisms to make great weapons.  I am a Dead Space purest, I liked Dead Space 1 & 2 for the basic reason that I enjoy shooting monsters and watching them die in awesome ways, and I never got tired of it.  I liked being creeped out by the weird locales and signs of recent human habitation.  The creepiest thing about Dead Space was they got the little human nuances and creature comforts so right that you felt people really lived in these spaces till disaster hit.  You would walk in a room and you could put yourself in the scene and say hey this could have been my place.  Part of the awesome Dead Space creep out factor is the hey this could be me sense you got as you went through the different environments.  Dead Space 3 plays more like a video game, the environments do not evoke that strong visceral identification with the people and cramped spooky places.  I would not go so far as to say DON'T BUY Dead Space 3.  I would say buy Dead Space 3 because; it is still an OK video game but don't expect much.  You might want to wait and rent Dead Space 3 before buying it.  If you buy Dead Space 3 you might want to wait for the price drops that are sure to come.  Dead Space 3 has some really awesome high points worthy of Dead Space 1 and 2.  Unfortunately Dead Space 3 has more dead areas. Dead Space 3 uses many more cheap tricks which insure its action, fun and creep out factors never live up to that found in Dead Space 1 & 2!  What is wrong with Dead Space 3 is the developers changed the whole feel and character of a once great game and unfortunately not for the better!Last of all Co-Op is fun but it helps ruin the Dead Space experience. A BIG part of the DEAD SPACE TOTAL FUN \\ CREEP OUT factor was the fact that you experienced this environment ALONE! Walking around dark dingy old beat down spaceships BY YOURSELF with only your wits, skills, status and guns between you and survival was the core essence of Dead Space FUN! In Co-Op mode you have someone with you. Humans are social animals who adapt better to stress when with another human.  If that other human is also a trusted friend who can be depended on to, \"Have your Back in a Crisis\" well the fear factor goes way down not because; Dead Space 3 worse than Dead Space 1 & 2. I have cerebral palsy. I am short, small and frail.  Hoever I have a younger brother who is 6 ft 8 inches tall, he is very strong and weighs 320 pounds.  When my younger but much bigger brother is with me no matter where we are together I feel safe. Walking around a beat down old spaceship with my strong crazy brother I don't worry, I am not frightened because; I will protect my baby brother and he will always protect me.  My brother kills all the high stuff I kill all the low crawling stuff.  Playing Dead Space alone was fun because its all about you, your skills your ability to survive.Finally there are some Co-Op missions that single players are LOCKED OUT OF, WHAT IS THAT ABOUT!  That's what I hate most of all when Games are so focused on Co-Op missions they forget about enriching the single player Dead Space 3 experience. Oh that's right if you want an enriched Dead Space 3 experience you must PAY $20 TO $30 MORE for downloadable content that locks you out of more awesome co-op only content.  So yeah Dead Space 3 is a good game and it IS FUN but, Dead Space 3 is more about an game experience weakened by bad design, bad decision making by people who did not understand the real creepy shoot first ask questions later ease of use allure of Dead Space 3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0009PETYO","reviewerName":"R.A. McKenzie","summary":"Major Disappointment","reviewText":"\"The Matrix\" has been great entertainment for years: I love the film trilogy, I enjoyed the companion tales of \"The Animatrix\", but more relevant I enjoyed the \"Enter The Matrix\" video game (it's a 4 out of 5).  So when I popped in this disc, and eagerly awaited the next installment in this iconic world...I was stunned!CONCEPTPlayers will assume the role of Neo for the entire film trilogy.  Half of the game revolves around key sequences (Morpheus' rescue, or Neo vs. Agent Smith).  The other half includes portions that add to the overall story.  For example, 5 short tales are about Neo freeing the minds of The Matrix's inhabitants.  Gamers can improve Neo's abilities and powers as they progress through a simple upgrade system.GRAPHICS / ANIMATION---The game looks solid enough, but the character models aren't very smooth and look a little blocky.  The environments are nicely detailed, but there isn't much interaction with them.  The martial arts combat 'looks' smooth, but collision detection has some serious issues.  The walls are destructible, but the character models don't react correctly to their surroundings.  Try to imagine a dark, gritty, and unclean \"Jade Empire\", and you get the right idea.SOUND---The music doesn't stand out very much; in fact, it often becomes silent in the middle of cutscenes.  The voice-acting isn't great, but rarely is bad.  The only sore spots are actually when different actors quote the movies' lines.  What's really strange is that when players use the Focus ability, the sound becomes muted and muffled.  It's a really annoying experience.  The guns sound fine, but don't have much of a punch to them.  The martial arts attacks sound good, but also lack much emphasis to get one's blood racing.PRESENTATION---This is the part that ticks me off the most.  \"Enter The Matrix\" seamlessly interweaved \"The Matrix Reloaded\" footage with original cutscenes to create a good story.  In \"Path of Neo\", the actual film footage is used with no cohesion whatsoever.  Seriously, movie clips are randomly spurted like an ESPN highlight reel, and end with a brief clip that pertains to the level you're about to play.  In-game cutscenes aren't too shabby, but are inconsistent.  Some are outstanding, while others are extremely weak.  Some of the in-game presentation reminded me of the \"Minority Report\" game that was released three years back.  To make matters worse, the Focus ability (which initiates Bullet Time) gives an annoying green tint on the screen.  This becomes extremely annoying.GAMEPLAY---When compared to \"Enter The Matrix\", this game takes too many steps back.  Climbing ledges and scaling walls is difficult and useless, gun-shooting isn't fun and feels like it was tacked, and there are even some platform exercises.  The platforming isn't bad, because it actually feels fresh.  But the key feature is obviously the martial arts fighting.  This was not done too bad.  The motion capture is very good (if not always timed right), and doesn't feeling like you're watching it like \"Enter The Matrix\".  Instead of combining odd camera angles like last time, \"Path of Neo\" is a complete third-person adventure.  The hand-to-hand combat is inconsistent, because sometimes animations can't be stopped, but it is slightly fun.  The problem with that, however, is that the the first third of the game is an introductory phase.  \"Path of Neo\" features some of the most unenjoyable training I've ever played.  Only the most patient gamer will want to reach the \"Reloaded\" and \"Revolutions\" chapters.OVERALL---I really hate this game.  It isn't worth the 50-dolalr asking price.  I really want to like this game, but when I play \"Enter The Matrix\" and compare it to \"Path of Neo\", too many steps were taken backwards.  My love for \"The Matrix\" stories and experiences can only propel a bad game so far.  \"Path of Neo\" is not worth your time or patience.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0014WJ78E","reviewerName":"G. Lindquist","summary":"A Review from an Xbox 360 Owner","reviewText":"As the title suggests, I own a 360. I have read and studied graphic comparisons, reviews and more between the two systems as long as they have been out. Until this game came out (MGS4) I was not planning on getting a Ps3 anytime soon. As someone that uses every feature my 360 has, this is my views and my impression on the Ps3 system as well as the game itself.::=:: THE PS3 SYSTEM::=::First I want to start with the ps3. I always heard good things about the system itself but that was never enough to make me go out and get one. The game selection for the 360 always attracted me, but now, especially with the release of Metal Gear Solid 4, it's a great time to pick one up. I use my laptop's Windows Media Center with my 360 to stream a huge amount of videos I have to my TV, which I honestly never expected the ps3 to be able to do, but it does. This was an awesome surprise. Not only does it detect my laptop, but also it sees the 5 other computers on my network that are sharing content and I can access them all! Not only that, I can access them from my ps3 remotely with my PSP through any WIFI connection. It's a weird feeling to be able to stream videos from your Laptop that is wirelessly connected to your Ps3 at home, while you are miles away on a handheld. The HDMI connection displaying everything at 1080P is breathtaking and blue ray movies truly do look stunning. The game menu is actually rather simple as well, but in a good way. It lays out everything in front of you but though it does that, it doesn't clutter you with content. You don't feel overwhelmed at all with the menus.The games on the system look stunning. I have read countless reviews for games that go cross platform and I will admit; games like Call of Duty 4, Rainbow Six Vegas 2 and other cross platform titles do have better texture quality on the 360 but games that are literally designed for the Ps3 are amazing. I currently have Heavenly Sword and MGS4 (duh) and I have not seen graphics and draw distances like these on the 360. The power of this system seems limitless right now, and the games made specifically for it show it. The system also has Bluetooth built in, which lets me take my Bluetooth headset and merely hook it up to my system to use in games like Metal Gear Solid 4's online multiplayer. The backwards compatibility on the system works without a hitch, though I have had some lag with Metal Gear Solid 3. Apparently these new Ps3 systems merely emulate the Ps2 instead of how it worked with the old systems which actually had the real Ps2 emotion chip built in. This is why MGS3 lags on this system when it wouldn't lag on the original Ps3 systems.Overall for the system this is an amazing deal. You get the 80 gig system which use to be $600 for $100 less but it also comes with a new release (and likely the best game the system has seen yet), and a duel shock 3 controller. That's nuts! I wouldn't suggest just buying the system by itself, but this deal is worth it. Now that I have the system I am finding more titles I wouldn't mind owning, so if you're a 360 fan, this system IS actually for you.::=:: Metal Gear Solid 4 - Son's of the Patriots::=::To date, as a person that is actually heavily into game development, I have not seen nor played a game that looks better, is more polished, and more innovative as this one. This game shouldn't even be referred to as a game, as it should merely be addressed to the public as an \"Experience.\" Anyone that grew up with Snake and his adventures will get an experience out of this game that cannot be missed and expressed in words.:~::GRAPHICS::~:What can I say about the graphics that hasn't already been said? The two words that come to mind are: ABSOLUTLY GORGEOUS. Every \"cinema\" isn't even a video it's merely in game play being shown through cameras set at different angles. The Environments, player models, weapons, lighting is all top notch!SCORE: 10/10:~::STORY::~:Every inch of this story is great and it ties up every loose end the series has. The story is told so that every cinema is well worth watching and no matter what you think you know, there are always new events that change EVERYTHING even until the last credit rolls (and afterward so watch on past the credits). Each character is built up well and has a lot of back-story to them. Since the story is so serious, there are a ton of Easter eggs to look forward to that not only make you laugh but make you enjoy the experience even more.SCORE: 10/10:~::GAMEPLAY::~:As I sit here and write this, I am actually smirking because as someone who has beat the game and then has to describe the gameplay...well, there's no way to really do it without sounding like a gitty school girl. The polish and fine-tuning was immense. The stealth, camo, guns, customization, levels/environments, voice acting, story; everything involved in gameplay deserves more than a 10. You never get bored, and though the levels are a bit linier, you can beat through this game dozens of times and still have some extra to shoot for while having unique experiences each time.SCORE: 10/10:~::SOUND::~:The voice acting was done by some serious talent and it shows. David Hayter (Solid Snake) does a beautiful job. This was definitely a step up from the first Metal Gear Solid. You have Phil La Marr (Vamp) who does the voice of Hermes in Futurama. The list goes on. Anyhow, the music, sound FX and voices are just outstanding and really help the game flow.SCORE: 10/10OVERALL: 10/10If you are looking to buy a ps3, this is an amazing deal. If you are looking to buy Metal Gear Solid 4, it's an amazing game. If you don't have either of these items, get this bundle right now!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2008"}

Movies that are so cheesy, so god-awful, that they are, somehow, amazing in their own right. I loved this game, I won't lie, there are a few issues that can turn people with little patience off, but if you can tolerate those things, this is an amazing game. Anyone who enjoyed/enjoys the Show 'Twin Peaks' will likely feel a sense of deja-vu when playing this game.The story takes a back seat in the game, kinda.... You can pursue the main story and blaze through the game pretty quickly (my fastest time was a little under 3hrs on Hard), but if you diverge and do side-missions, learn about the people, see all there is to see, you can spend a good amount of time in the game (up to about 10-15hrs). I would suggest everyone who plays this to do as many side-missions as possible, they explain a lot about the characters.Much like a Pug (the dog), they are so ugly that people just love them. The graphics in DP aren't anything to write home about, but that just adds to the game in its own odd way, it has a grainy overlay to it, especially at night. It's obvious that the game was made on a budget (when it was first released is was only $20 NEW, now going for $40+ new here), but if you look at Francis, you can see that they did have talent (don't shave at all and he looks a lot like Justin Timberlake, at least to me).What I loved, more than anything, was Francis' nonchalant approach to talking with his alter ego (inside his head) out loud, and many of the townsfolk could careless about it, as if it's something normal (or maybe they're all insane). The quirky-ness of all the characters makes you feel like you're watching a episode of 'The Twilight Zone' or something, the strangeness of them is one of the best things of the game.Combat was average at best, but if you're a fan of survival horror this is nothing new to you. It generates the feeling of helplessness and fear, but is far from being terrible and unusable. You need to have timing, if you go in swing or shooting without any cares, you're gonna fail, simple as that.I know I touched briefly on the characters in the game, but what I failed to mention is that every character has their own backstory, you just have to befriend them. After certain story events, characters will have missions that they need you to do, upon doing them you learn a bit more about them. Like Mr. Stewart, he is, or his aid Mr.Tillotson, is hilariously awkward, or Thomas, who (*******SPOILER FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT PLAYED THE GAME*******) is a cross-dressing sheriffs assistant (deputy?).All in all, this has POTENTIAL to be a fun game for those who don't mind cheesy-ness. If you are serious about graphics, gameplay and acting, stay away from it, this is a game that is designed and made to be a 'spoof', a game that doesn't take itself seriously and doesn't expect you to do so either.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00B3PDHBU","description":"","reviewerName":"Celeste \"Vodka, Apple Pucker & Sweet 'n' Sour\"","summary":"Very Impressive","reviewText":"So I started off using this headset for the one application that isn't listed as supported, PC Gaming (Bioshock Infinite specifically). As long as you have a sound card with optical output it works just fine for output. However, if you want to use the microphone you'll have to buy an accessory to convert from separate mic/headphone  jacks to a unified jack like the ones on smartphones or the xbox 360 controller (there is an included cable for connecting either size) and the connection for the mic is on the headset so you'll lose wireless. Something I've noticed with the few PC games I have is that, unlike most console games, they don't support Dolby Digital or DTS. So, although the sound quality was excellent and the headset was incredibly comfortable,  I found that it wasn't heads above the not insubstantially less expensive headset I was already using. At this point I decided I needed to check out the Dolby Digital capabilities with my PS3. I normally wouldn't consider using headphones for my PS3 as my media room is equipped with a roughly $7,500 surround system. I popped in Assassin's Creed Revelations (my game queue has gotten out of hand) into my PS3 and I was shocked. I don't know if it was the headsets excellent Dolby Digital reproduction, its noise cancelling that effectively silenced all background noise or if it had to do with the Pioneer Kuro Plasma and the fact that I rarely get to turn the volume on my surround system loud enough. But I haven't been that immersed in a game sensorily in a long time. I'm sure the sound design in Assassin's Creed helped with that immensely, but the precision with which sounds were placed and the crystal clear separation and balance of individual sounds was very impressive. Enough gushing, there is one more really cool feature to this set. It can be paired to two devices simultaneously. So you can have it paired to both the PS3 and your phone at the same time and it will function like a stereo bluetooth headset for you phone. And with the noise cancelling features, this is almost a necessity if you want to hear your phone ring. So when a call comes in it slightly lowers the game volume and a ring tone goes off and you can press a button on headset to answer the call. Its done very well, the ringing is very unobtrusive and to my shock I could both clearly hear the game audio and the person on the phone, more so than if they were in my media room trying to talk to me while my surround system was going. If you do most of your gaming physically alone, this headset, I hate to say it, is pretty tough competition for my surround system and a fraction of the cost.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2013"}

It's important to note that these are so much more than gaming headsets though; these are top of the line music, chat and gaming headphones.They were easy to set up and thanks to the intelligent audio control of chat I could hear both game sound and in game chat clearly regardless of the noise generated by COD black ops. The Bluetooth streaming works seamlessly and the presets are a nice touch. During gaming you will hear sounds you've never heard before - the atmospheric ambience in assassin's creed 2 is utterly stunning.Battery life seams to be what it says on the box (circa fifteen hours) and they sit extremely comfortable on your head.So whether you're listening to music, playing a game, chatting or skyping ...

{"product_name":"B00005YTYJ","description":"WithGrand Theft Auto III, Rockstar proves that not all  developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games.  This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular  predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any  criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the  local population for their money (or weapons), make time with  prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking  more structure can embark on dozens of plot-driven missions or steal  cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and go on vigilante  missions. Grab a cab and play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi.  Take a fire truck and earn money putting out fires. The game just never  gets boring.As in real life, there are consequences for your criminality. As your  random acts of mayhem mount up, the police start hounding you,  eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you  continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily  the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are  packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every  category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump  trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically  when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific  detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic,  pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing.  Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine  different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a  monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages  to get everything right.--T.

It seems that 'Team Soho' have decided to take a few steps back in the modern day 3D action/shoot-em-up/driver/drama by releasing something that is more than a few notches down from what they should be capable of doing.First of all there are NO camera angles in the car other than 3rd person driver view. No rear view or side views or interior views which is a total shame since it seems like the game engine could actually handle it. Why bother creating a realistic map of London if we can't look around a bit or even SEE the police cars that are chancing us!!!... Seriously!So okay we will forgive it maybe if something else happens like the ultra cool combo movements we have been hearing about but alas Max Payne style character animation has been thrown out the door for something that looks like it has just popped out from 'Afraid of the Dark 1'. The character does two cool movements period. These are.... breaking necks and..... acting drunk when all shot up. Okay... very cool... but I think I paid some money for a GAME here?The cut scenes, story and character animation are NOT BAD at all but I would rather watch 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' than this. I really wanted to play 'The Getaway' and when the action starts and you begin driving you have about three minutes fun and then it all starts to get very repetitive. The car smash physics, controls and damage are great but it is still a few notches down from what you expect (don't expect any stunts or overturning in The Getaway either) because it is simply a bit boring. A few ramps here and there would have made all the difference.Okay so we drive and then we reach the place where we are supposed to do some shooting with sort of 'around the corner' style shots and taking hostages as bullet shields before capping them because they have served their purpose. Cool!!! for awhile and then you find that the actual control of the character is like a 50/50 bet. Sometimes it works and aims and you can shoot and sometimes the enemy is running through a wall or you seem to have targeted him even though he is standing behind a wall and then someone you where aiming at vanishes into a wall and then you say to hell with this someone get The Getaway into product testing fast!!! AND THIS IS THE MORAL OF THE STORY.Team Soho have clearly put themselves under pressure to release a game for that Christmas period. Well that is fine with me and if product stability is put second to XMAS sales figures then fine... but to be quite frank I feel that I will use caution with Team Soho releases. All it would have taken is a little more testing, a few fixes here and there and then we would have something to boast about!Driv3r and Vice City had bugs but where playable... this one is totally not.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2005"}

This game just isn't worth that kind of time devotion so I'll make a small list of my complaints and urge you to stay away.DRM has hurt this game more than any other game before it.  D3 was a blessing compared to SC2013.Pros:- The cities are half decent looking graphicallyCons:- *Small complaint but stupid nonetheless* You are forced to play the tutorial even if you know how to play the game- this doesn't sound like a big issue (and its more of a nuisance) but early on in the game with the server issues it meant I had to play the tutorial 4 times before I could start a city... a tutorial I'd already played 100x during beta weekends... fail- Cities wont load and there's no apparent fix - this was the simple inability to load my cities... period.  There was no other option, I could abandon them and come back a week later and re-claim and they would still not load.  It was not 1... or 2... or even 3 cities, it was many many cities.- Game requires too much bandwidth - If you are downloading something or have family members streaming movies and such expect your cities to constantly have issues and need to be rolled back.- Cities need to be constantly rolled back - even if it's not a bandwidth issue you'll find that EA want's you to constantly roll back your progress.- No way to save your progress - expect EA to know exactly when to save... even though they wont.  Next time you kick on your game play the guessing game &#34;how many minutes will I have to replay&#34;- No way to roll back the game on your own - Can't roll-back your own city progress to undo something you've done by accident or to experiment and see &#34;what will this do&#34;- Way too much &#34;work&#34; - You'll learn to get sick of the bulldozer RRREAALLLL quick... people abandon buildings too fast and they constantly need to be destroyed. Oh and, patch 2.0 made it to where people will abandon places MORE often.- The games finances do not seem to scale well - I haven't had to ability to test the numbers (due to cities not loading and a pure dis-interest in the game) but I found it amazing how hard it was to make $$$ with cities that had 350k people when there was very little difference in the cities infrastructure from when it was racking in the dough with 250k or 150k residents.- Traffic is a joke - It's pretty funny how sims will spend the better part of 12 hours stuck at an intersection.... the game has no resemblance of how anything really works... I don't want to &#34;avoid 4 way intersections&#34; or &#34;make 1 long road that curves so you have no intersections&#34;... are you kidding me?- Traffic is a joke pt2 - 1 major highway into the city? gggreeaattttt.- Cities are too small - You can read all about it elsewhere... It's true, there's no denying it.- No terraforming- Residents unhappy over stupid stuff - 350k people &#34;worried about crime&#34;... check crime map... 3 crimes a day... ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Oh and, after patch 2.0 people will get upset MORE easily... greattttt.Ehhh, thats enough for me.  There were a lot of bright points to the game but they get squelched by just about everything.The only star this game gets goes directly to Amazon.com for allowing refunds to continue even today, weeks after the 30 day deadline... I waited until patch 2.0 to see if my cities would be useable because I simply had zero desire to create new ones. I'd already made 20 cities and there's not enough diversity in this game to justify getting myself back to where I was just to have the maps lost in an infinite limbo again. Yes a few of my maps load, but when big cities are so reliant on the ones around them to provide services and those maps simply wont load, every grouping ended up broken.I tried, I really did...

{"product_name":"B002I0JAVK","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Batman Soars Above The Competition","reviewText":"As a longtime Batman fan, the wait for Arkham City has been long and painful. Everyday, I've dreamed of how amazing it would be to run amok as Batman, in a city filled to the brim with deadly foes, zipping from building to building, and delivering firm fists of justice into hapless criminals' faces. The final product, though, has turned out to be something much different than what was expected. Instead of just a rollicking good time, Rocksteady has delivered a brooding, introspective journey into depths that suit the source material perfectly. But on top of that, they've done the unthinkable: made a superhero game where you actually feel like a superhero.Arkham City kicks off with a twist that manages to not feel contrived or unnatural. Bruce Wayne, running for political office, gets arrested for his opposition to a large prison city that rests in the heart of Gotham City. It turns out, though, that getting arrested was part of his plan all along, and when he calls for Alfred to drop his Batman gear into the city, it's clear that he means business. From inside the walls of Arkham, Batman plans to get to the bottom of Arkham's existance, and to shut the facility down for good. But before he does that, he has to worry about the virus that's slowly destroying both his and longtime rival Joker's immune systems. In a desperate race to save himself and end Arkham City, Batman fights through a rogue's gallery of fan-favorite villains while being constantly reminded of his impending mortality.Saying any more would ruin the excellent plot, written by fan favorite comic writer Paul Dini, that the game houses, and that would do a disservice to all potential players. I will say that both newcomers and longtime Batman diehards will take away nothing but immense satisfaction from the game.But what really keeps you hooked outside of the main story is the innovative gameplay, which is a perfected version of the formula introduced in Rocksteady's earlier Arkham Asylum. Hand-to-hand combat strikes the right balance between choreographed superhero action and realistic visceral urgency. You're never left feeling that every punch you make is the same, and for some brief instances, you can almost be fooled into thinking you're watching a real fight unfold between Batman and whoever he's beating the living tar out of. It's a fantastic combat system, coupled with one of the rare video game counter systems that works exactly like it's supposed to. Beating up bad guys in Arkham City is never a chore, it's a thrilling new experience each time.The experience isn't limited to combat, though, and it is perhaps when you're not fighting anybody that the depth and scope of the game becomes clear. The City of Arkham is a fairly sprawling location, laced with secrets and new side-missions to explore that merit far more than one playthrough. Exploring the city is an absolute delight, especially with a ability to utilize Batman's gliding and grappling abilities. If you see something, odds are you can scale and fly off (or on) it. An unprecedented amount of thought went into sculpting Arkham City's dark city of crime, and it shows.It doesn't hurt that the graphics are astounding, either. Because of a preordering mishap, I ended up with 360 version of the game as opposed to the PS3 version that I wanted, but I was not left unimpressed. Even on the graphically weaker 360, Rocksteady's attention to detail is astounding, especially the painstaking rendering of each character. Batman's cuts and bruises never disappear throughout the entire campaign; his costume slowly forms bloody rips, his cape gradually develops jagged tears, and bloodstains wear into the Batsuit's fabric. Everybody from the Joker to Two-Face to the small-fry goons inhabiting every dingy location ooze raw, bloody life. This game has character, something that you're reminded of everytime you set foot onto the cracked pavement of Arkham City.Ron Fish and Nick Arundel do a fantastic job of capturing the essence of the Batman franchise in the phenomenal score, which may the most memorable I've heard this year outside of \"El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron.\" Music in the game is highly reminiscent of the musical score found in \"Batman: The Animated Series\", as opposed to Hans Zimmer's score for the newer \"Dark Knight\" trilogy.Speaking of \"The Animated Series\", several of the original voice actors from that classic show return to lend their talent to Arkham City, most notably Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill as Batman and the Joker, respectively. While Conroy does a fantastic job as the suffering and dying Batman, Hamill is definitely the scene-stealer here. Anybody who has heard Hamill as the Joker would never guess that there was room for improvement in his performance, but they would be absolutely mistaken. He delivers an unseen level of pathos and conviction to the character, painting a portrait of a maniac becoming increasingly aware of his dwindling life. His performance is reminiscent of the late Heath Ledger's in \"The Dark Knight\", which is lot coming from the man who consistently gets labelled as \"that guy who played Luke Skywalker.\" Other standouts are the multi-talented Grey DeLisle as a sultry and mischevious Catwoman, and Nolan \"Nathan Drake\" North as the maniacal Penguin. Come game awards season, Arkham City may sweep the voice acting category without a hitch.Few games offer the scale and scope found in Batman: Arkham City, and almost no licensed games (outside of stand-outs like \"Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay\") do so at all. Rocksteady has taken the Batman franchise and given it relevance in a field that it failed miserably in with previous endeavors. This game is not only arguably the best licensed and comic book game to ever be developed, but one of the finest gaming experiences that has ever been crafted. With promises of a vast quantity of DLC characters, missions and costumes, it isn't going anywhere soon. And even without that content, Rocksteady's epic stands on it's own as one of the finest games of the new decade.Everything (Graphics, Sound, Acting, Gameplay, Plot): A+NOTE: I didn't review the Catwoman missions because Warner Brothers made her only available using an online pass, which isn't included in used copies. While I did play them, I refuse to review something that not everyone who buys the game will have ready access to outside of spending extra money. Gamers should not have to be forced into spending more money to access on-disc content, period.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2011"}

Avoid hot plates, electric shocks and inky turrets to create your own path to the impenetrable I.N.K.T. Fortress. Just remember that the struggle to reclaim Chroma City is to be fought on your terms. Remix the city in your own image using custom paints, patterns and soundtracks. Super-size your blob to attack larger and stronger enemies. Join the Color Revolutionaries to refine your skills while making a mess. The race to rescue Chroma City has just begun, and only de Blob can save the world from a black-and-white future.Gameplay: de Blob's Primary Goalde Blobis a 3D platformer where players use the Wii Remote/Nunchuck combo to maneuver their hero, de Blob. Equal parts amorphous blob of paint, struggling artist, revolutionary and juvenile delinquent, de Blob's goal is to replace the drab, lifeless gray coloring that the I.N.K.T. Corporation has imposed on Chroma City and its inhabitants, the Raydians, with a range of vibrant life-giving colors, all the while avoiding and battling the gray-clad forces of the Inkies.Players must acquire paint and hurl de Blob at the buildings, walls, statues, roads and skies above Chroma City. As de Blob bounces around, adding color wherever he lands, his supply of paint is depleted and he begins to dry out. As this happens players must collect more paint and rehydrate in pools and in front of hydrants scattered across the city. As the game starts access is limited to the colors red, blue and yellow, but these can be blended to create a number of other colors. Being able to create and apply these colors becomes important as Chroma City and its inhabitants come to life, and de Blob makes contact with a range of other characters known as the 'Color Revolutionaries' and receives an increasing amount of missions that charge him with splattering color all over town. Success at these mission gains the player point which drives the game forward, eventually leading to a direct assault on Comrade Black's I.N.K.T. fortress guarded by elite Inky soldiers and massive ink turrets.Key Game Features:de Blob- Flip, bounce and paint your way past the all-powerful I.N.K.T.

These multiplayer campaigns support up to four players, come with street and sewer maps and include four player split-screen functionality. Just a few of the multiplayer campaigns include:Paint Match- Paint as many buildings as possible and steal points from opponents by re-painting the buildings that they've already covered.Blob on the Run- A variation of 'Capture the Flag,' in this mode only one blob can paint and is pursued by opponents who attempt to slam him into submission and gain the ability to paint and accumulate points themselves.Blob Race- In this mode buildings can only be painted once and are indicated by in-game arrow.

However I feel that many titles, deBLOB being no exception fall under the way when making such a blanket statement.In a world of dry development and overused concepts this game is extremely refreshing. The main character is an easily like able blob that can absorb the color contained in little mechanical vacuum spiders (which somehow are made adorable as well) and can splatter it like Jackson Pollock against a city wide canvas.The music in the game is styled during your play and it picks up or slows down with extra beats as your pace changes. It's immersion incarnate in every sense of the word providing the exact amount of challenge and enjoyment that I feel many games these days fall short in acquiring.Every single second of video is fun and absolutely adorable (to a level that is almost painful at times...but in a good way). While I fear that future itinerants of this game may loose the originals beauty and scope I do think this is a great example of just how wonderful the alternative universe of Wii gaming is to your generic Gears of War clones or 'free roaming' murder fests, that admittedly I like but the 60 dollar price tags don't justify the lack of advancement in the genres.If you haven't played this I strongly recommend it, even if only from gamefly. You most certainly won't be disappointed, it doesn't necessarily require the Wii mote but it certainly is in no way crippled by it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2009"}

This is some of them.","reviewText":"L.A. Noire is the latest game from Rockstar, best known for games such as Grand Theft Auto IV and Red Dead Redemption. It's a game that's both very similar to those and very, very different.The main character of the game is Cole Phelps (Aaron Stratton, best known for his role as Ken Cogrove in Mad Men). Phelps is a WWII vet living in 1946 Los Angeles. He has recently become a police officer in the LAPD. He starts out as a beat cop and slowly works his way up through traffic and on up the ladder. Throughout he's solving cases, chasing bad guys and driving really old cars really fast.I cannot think of enough good things to say about this game. Let's start with the acting. It's top-notch, and it's not just voice-over work. It's actual actors filmed and inserted into the game with motion capture technology. This technology is especially noticeable in the faces, which frequently look very \"real\". In fact, it's also most important there as you have to analyze the body language and facial expressions of suspects and witnesses when questioning them. When you do so, you can decide if they're lying, telling the truth or that you doubt their story. I do rather wish the game came with a \"bluff\" option, which would have been very handy and is a typical tactic used by police.Beyond the acting, there's also the environment. Actual cars from the 1940s are used. This is good and bad. Good, because they certainly look great and commandeering a Ford, Packard or Chevy is much different than, say, jacking someone's Faggio like in the other games.On the other hand, the cars handle like you'd expect 1940s cars to handle. This is entertaining at times, but believe me, when you're in a high speed chase and trying to corner with one of these, you'll long for a modern vehicle.And then there's the city. Los Angeles in the 1940s was a fascinating place, and this game does a great job of capturing what the city must have felt like back then. You see Red Car trolleys, signs for Nixon, and a total absence of TV-related things (though I passed several radio repair shops). It's a very noir kind of city, and this game does an excellent example of showing you a noir LA.As for the cases, they're pretty straight forward. You find out about a crime, go investigate the crime scene, talk with people and make a collar. Pretty A, B, C. But along the way, you'll get calls on the radio that enable to you go deal with street crime which is, frankly, a bit more entertaining in many ways. Also, unlike the other games made by Rockstar you can't just pull out your gun and start shooting or run over everyone in sight. You are a cop, after all. So usually if you want to go shooting, you'll want to handle as many of these street crimes as you can.Overall there's nothing I really dislike about this game. I look forward to playing more and to the inevitable sequel and expansions. And now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go out and hunt down some criminals. My name's Phelps, and I'm a cop.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J5UQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Matthew Chidester","summary":"I tried to like it..","reviewText":"*spoiler free*LA Noire is a nice change of pace compared to what usually rockstar puts out but the story was of typical rockstar fashion.  Before I bought the game, I figured it was about one major crime and trying to solve that one major crime, but instead I was surprised how LONG this game was.I wanted to like this game - there was a ton of hype over it and so I was excited, I really did want to like it and usually I'm into games like this where you walk/talk/explore the world and have total control while going through a complex crime or story.Pros:The things I really liked was the technology they put in this game by scanning the actors faces, I hope there are more titles that come out with this (Mass Effect 3 for example..).  The sound was good, the acting was good, although sometimes the actors would be talking during some musical score playing which made it a little difficult to hear what they are saying.  The action was well spread out but worked well.. and the story was really complex.  The amount of detail the programmers put in the game was awesome, the controls were simple but took a while to figure out boxing or hand to hang combat.  Depending on how you drove and walked and talked this game had a ton of content and I guess a bunch of DLC content as well (always a plus..long as it's downloadable)Cons:The story sucked.  Almost wanted to throw the controller at the screen after that ending.  Actors did their part but the story did not plus the constant cut scenes cutting in and out almost like GTA vice city style.  I didn't even want to view another newspaper just to avoid another stupid cutscene.  No matter how awful you are at interrogation eventually you'll get through no matter how bad you screw up so there's not much incentive in being perfect.  The action scenes were simple (not that I'm a first person shooter guy) but the action was spread out and sometimes rare.  The main character just like GTA was .. a dork at times, not the most likable character and they could have selected someone else to play the lead role.  Controlling the character in tight spaces was a pain, and sometimes clicking on a clue took a few 360's moves by the character.  Once I got cornered in by my own detective and got stuck.  Unless you have an HD tv this game is going to be a little hard to read and follow clues.. quite a bit of swearing, and racism (I guess that was pretty much the norm back then but it made me *cringe* and wanted to turn the sound down)Overall the game was good not bad, but after I beat the game I haven't put it back in.  This game is an acquired taste..coming from a Metal Gear/Mass Effect person I can't give it more than 3 stars.  Rent sure..buy cheap..buy new?  I don't think so.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2011"}

However, there isn't much to do with the camera so far. They PS4 comes installed with a few mini games, but after a hour playing it all you most likely won't ever go back to it.  The quality of the camera wasn't as sharp as I thought it was going to be, but I do have a 60inch, so maybe my screen is too big? I don't know I was just expecting High Definition.It just started doing voice commands. So you can say &#34;Playstation&#34;, then &#34;Killzone&#34;, then you can start it. Turn off the system with your voice. Just real simple things. When you first turn on the PS4 you can have it recognize your face. But the camera has to pick up the light bar on the controller and you have to have good lighting for it to work. It's just easier to click on the user.The camera comes with a neat little rubber think that can bend and hang onto the top of your television. Other than that it's just a camera with no real games for it. I think Just Dance came out, but from what I read, the game isn't that good with the camera at all, so if you don't get that game, the camera will be collection dust until something else comes.

I have been a COD fan for many years. The first game I played was COD 4 modern warfare, and this game was actually my first xbox live video game that I played on. When I heard COD: Ghosts was coming out this end of the year, I was so hyped up. I couldn't believed that Infinity Ward would make another game after MW3. I expected to be the game of the year, because when I watched the game trailers or the commercials, I thought that this game was going to be better than the  Modern Warfare series. I was F***ING Dead Wrong!!! Of course, this game is going to be the #1 Best Seller, because people don't know what is going to be in this 60 dollars product, and they expect to see better outcome. I felt bad for the people who preordered the game, and then they have to return it to Gamestop, and receive 30 dollars back. Anyways, the gameplay is terrible and very different. When I am playing this game on ONLINE mode, I felt I was playing another game, not COD game, but another game. I had to look twice on the game cover that if this game is actually Call of Duty: Ghosts. I kept repeating myself, \"this crap does not look like the game on the trailers nor the commercials\" After an hour, of course, I got a little comfortable with the game, and trying not to get mad after getting killed to quick. Yes, if you already read the other reviews as I also did that mentioned that you get killed very easily in ONLINE MODE. The graphics are absolutely terrible. It was like playing a game that should have been made years ago. The texture does not look realistic. I was very mad how the game turned to be. We all expected this game to be at least better than Black Ops 2 or Modern Warfare 3, but NOPE! I rather play the other COD games than this piece of crap. The maps are not that bad. Playing in a small map makes you react quickly or make quicker decisions where are the enemies. It a rush mode when playing in smalls maps in Ghosts, but big maps is totally opposite of rush mode. It is hard to find these enemies in buildings even though playing with 12 men, it is still hard to get to these guys. The killstreaks are ok I guess. I mean the guard dog is pretty badass, but the rest is distant. The game is very glitchy while I am moving around, or watching other players moving side to side very quickly like some kind of lag throughout the matches. The weapons are pretty hard to aim right. Taking out a pistol was hard to aim, and to me, the gun looks pretty small on my point of view. Overall on Multiplayer, I was very disappointed with the results that Infinity Ward made. Sorry to say this developers, but you made many people very upset for buying the game that they thought was going to be great, and turns out to be garbage...Single Player mode (Campaign Mode), I actually loved the thrilling missions and scenes. It keeps me more connected towards to the story-line. After every missions, I always get excited what was going to happen to next, and that's the way how to keep the players active during campaign mode, so I say good job on that part of the game. But overall, I am very disappointed of the game. I understand other people enjoying playing this, but as a COD Fan, I expected more, especially from Infinity Ward. If you want the game, get it. This is just my opinion about the game. People will probably agree or disagree on my review...","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2013"}

They implemented the same nonsense from Black Ops 2.  Because the entire community is a bunch of whiny sniveling children, they don't want anyone to \"pub stomp\", a term coined by the guys from Treyarch.  This is a laughable concept given that anyone can squad up and they don't have dedicated servers.  If your squad wins a game or two, take note, it punishes you and won't put anyone new in your lobby.  When this happens you can either back out and search again, or just wait for an eternity.  In either case it will merge you with with another lobby and you'll lose every gunfight.  Why does this happen?  Because matchmaking is based off winning and skill level and connection takes a back seat.  So essentially if your party wins a few games you'll be punished by being matched against another group that is considered \"at your level\", and the connection will be terrible.  I defended this game the first week it came out, saying the matchmaking would get better.

{"product_name":"B00004U5VF","description":"The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.--Jeff Gerstmann--Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"4MaskCurse \"Kyonshi Jiang Shi\"","summary":"Someone go get a bucket, cause I'm gonna PUKE!!","reviewText":"First of all,I didn't even want to rent this game cause I thought it looked stupid and insulted everything that was great about final fantasy.I SHOULD have listened to my first instincts,but instead I gave into to so many whining squaresoft&quot;fans&quot; who said that this really is a great game,you just have to get past the fact that there's disney.HA! I'd like to know how that is possible when everywhere you turn,disney is screamed in your face;the shield has a mickey mouse emblem on it,the sword has a mickey mouse emblem on it,everything has a mickey mouse emblem on it!What really bothered me the most about this game was all the subliminal messages in it.For example one of the final fantasy characters in the final fantasy world says&quot;Our world is just one tiny peice that is part of something much greater!&quot;OH!I see,so final fantasy is just something insignificant and what's sooo much greater is disney!This also leads me to ask that if each individual disney story/movie had it's own world,then why couldn't they have done the same for each individual installment of final fantasy?Every final fantasy fan knows that the diffrent stories in the series where always on an epic level,so why does disney treat the final fantasy anthology so unimportantly?By just mixing all the final fantasy characters from diffrent games into one world to call it's own was a slap in squaresoft's face.And just look how they depicted poor cid from ff7!They gave him blonde hair(he's older and has grey hair)plus they got rid of his cigarette and put a twig in his mouth....grrrr!Of course I suppose disney was the right partner to choose for this project since squaresoft seems only to want to make interactive movies instead of games.By this,I mean the same problem with kingdom hearts was what I saw in final fantasy X; play a little bit then watch a cinema(which you can't skip over either),play a little bit more then watch another cinema!This replays itself over and over and gets extremely annoying.Graphicsseem to be more important than gameplay.Lastly kingdom hearts is not a true rpg to which it passes itselfover as on the box.It isn't a true rpg in the sense that there isno turn based battle system;it's an action rpg with free moving enemies and heroes.This tied in with the locking system makes it much more like zelda:ocarina of time than any of the final fantasy series.Why squaresoft chose to do this is a mystery to mesince the game is supposed to tie in with final fantasy.My only guess is that it was probabaly disney's idea,since they see fit to march right in and change every aspect about anything with THIS world!The saying for kingdom hearts is &quot;You'll never know who you'll run into next.&quot;I think the saying for disney should be&quot;You never know what we'll take over next!&quot;I'd rather eat a bucket full of broken glass than play this disney comercial!!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2002"}
{"product_name":"B000BXKA38","reviewerName":"Alex Gomez","summary":"Review: Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater (Subsistence Edition) for Playstation 2","reviewText":"Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is a perfect hybrid between cinema and video game. The game's  scenes suck you into Snake Eater's story, while in between scenes you play out your mission in vast jungles, buildings, maintain terrains and a large, supposedly impregnable fortress.I will be reviewing the Subsistence edition of Snake Eater that came packaged with 2008`s Metal Gear Solid: Essential Collection set. Those of you who have the standalone edition of Subsistence will be glad to know that this version is also compatible with Disc 2: Persistence. So consider this a review of not just the Essential Collection version of Subsistence, but also the standalone edition. They're virtually the same. The original Snake Eater featured a fixed camera from a top-down perspective much like MGS1 and 2. While the fixed camera worked well enough for those game's closed in environments, it didn't fare very well in Snake Eater's outside world . Fans complained, and Kojima listened. Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence features a 3rd person viewpoint and a rotatable camera, much like MGS: Peace Walker and MGS4. This new addition makes for an entirely new and better experience. For those of you who prefer the ways of old, you do have the option to quickly switch back to the fixed camera by pressing the R3 button.Following the movie-like introduction, you're dropped off in a jungle via Halo Jump. Your mission is to find Dr. Sokolov and bring him back to the United States safely. As your mission winds down, you're confronted and betrayed by your former mentor and mother figure of ten years. This confrontation sets into motion a sequence of events that lead to the beginning of your new assignment; Operation Snake Eater. To kill The Boss; a World War 2 Hero who defected to the Soviet Union, taking with her two Davey Crockets, and the person who unleashed a nuclear catastrophe on Russia.During the beginning of the game, in what is called the Virtuous Mission, you will find yourself in a vast jungle crawling with small animals. As you move forward, you will begin to notice enemy sentries standing watch and patrolling several areas. Getting by some of these guys can be tricky if you're a newcomer. You will often find yourself lying in wait for an opportunity to either 1.) proceed without being detected by using your surroundings for cover or 2.) dispatch of sentries by sneaking up on them and slitting their throats, putting them in a chokehold until they pass out, or using your mk22 to tranquilize them from afar. To get by an area without alerting any guard, it's best to lay low and keep to the ground by crawling through grass. Change your Camo to blend in with your immediate surroundings and lower the probability of detection. Move forward only when the enemy is looking elsewhere, obviously.Personally, I get a kick out of being able to sneak through heavily guarded areas, and Snake Eater gives you all the tools you'd need to get the job done. By using the Dpad you will walk very slowly, eliminating sounds emanating from your footsteps. This is great for sneaking up behind enemies without arousing their suspicion. If you try to sneak up on guards using the analog stick, they will hear you once you're within range and unless you manage to take them out quickly, the alarm will be sounded and the soldiers will go into Red Alert. When in Red Alert mode, the enemy will actively pursue you. A seemingly endless hoard of bad guys will continously spawn until you are either killed, or find a good hiding spot where you aren't discovered for the remainder of the Red Alert and the subsequent Caution Mode, which lasts for quite a while. You can try to fend them off with your weapons, but I find that it sort of kills the whole theme of the game, which is to sneak through without being seen. If I am caught, I usually just let them kill me and then attempt to re-do the area without alerting anyone. While you're crawling you can press the R1 button to enter First Person View mode and get a better view of area in front of you. If need-be, you can also press and hold the R2 and L2 buttons, while simultaneously holding the R1 button to have Snake poke his head out to get an even clearer view. When you're crawling and happen to move into some tall grass, you will automatically enter First Person View mode, or rather, Intrusion View mode. In this mode you will only be able to see what's in front of you. Some may say that it gives the game a sense of realism, but to me it ended up being nothing more than a needless con that shouldn't have been added.Snake Eater's Health System:Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater features one of the most complex health systems I've seen in any video game. To the top left of the screen is your health bar. If that drains down to nothing, obviously you die. So try not to let that happen. Directly below the health bar, you will find your Stamina Gauge. The further your stamina goes down, the less precise your actions will be. For example, your aim will be shakey and your CQC moves will lose strength. To keep your stamina gauge at a manageable level, be sure to hunt for animals and kill them using your hunting knife or any guns you have. There's a variety of animals, or rather meals that you will encounter during your time in the jungle. They are: Crabs, different types of Snakes, Alligators, Rabbits, Markhors and plenty of others. You will also come across bagged foods called Instant Noodles and Rations. Don't be fooled by the name. Rations don't work the same way in Snake Eater as they do in other games in the Metal Gear franchise. You won't automatically regain health if your Life Bar runs out by having Rations equipped. Rations are incredibly hard to come by and you won't really see them until later in the game. Life Meds take the place of Rations in Snake Eater by slightly recovering your health, but if your life bar runs out, you will die even if you equip them. If you keep captured food for too long without eating it, it will rot. Never fear though. Just because it's rotten doesn't necessarily mean that you will have to throw it away. You can still eat it and recover you stamina, but you will contract a stomach virus. If left untreated, this infection will quickly zap your stamina. So if you find yourself with no other option but to eat rotten food, do so and then immediately press Start and select Cure.Snake Eater's Cure System:Often times you will be forced to go to the Cure screen to heal a stomach virus, remove leeches, bullets, arrows or heal burns and other things. Para-Medic's long winded explanation may make the process of curing Snake seem daunting, but it's actually quite easy. You press the L2 or R2 buttons to see your medical items. To cycle through them, simply use the analog stick. Press X to choose the Hunting Knife if you need to remove a bullet, or the Ointment to treat a cut. The Health and Cure systems both work incredibly well together to give you the feeling that you really are in a jungle environment where survival is of utmost importance.Snake Eater's Bosses:In your mission you will encounter various foes, most of whom are part of your former mentor's elite group of soldiers called The Cobras; The Pain , The Fear, The End, The Fury, The Joy and one more. I'll let you find out who that is for yourself. The first Cobra member you encounter is easy enough to dispose of, but the 2nd proved to be a bit of a challenge. However, there is one extremely easy way to kill him, but I'd go as far a labeling it a cheat even if it isn't technically one. The End is... well. You will just have to find out for yourself. He's this extremely old man who also happens to be a legendary Sniper, and you have to kill him before he kills you in what is quite possibly the best boss battle in video game history. I cannot tell you how amped I was fighting against The End. Rather than being quick, this Boss requires you to take things slowly and be patient. Instead of running around, it's best to crawl and try to avoid being seen. The Fury was incredibly difficult, but I managed to finally eliminate him. The battle against the Shagohod takes place on a street. You're on a motorbike and that behemoth is chasing you. Imagine that. This epic scene couldn't be more cooler. Well, that wraps it up for the Bosses. I intentionally left a few of them out as to not spoil too much. Let's get moving.Snake Eater's Items and Weapons:You will come across many valuable items and weapons in your journey across the jungle, so be sure not to miss any of them. I can just imagine how grueling the fight against The Fury would've been if I hadn't had the Night Vision Goggles and Thermal Goggles. The Thermal Goggles also came in handy for locating food toward the last stretch of the game where I was extremely low on food supplies (I had none) and had to keep not only my own, but a certain someone else's stamina from completely draining. All the while we were being hunted through a jungle by aggressive soldiers. The Mic will also prove useful in locating your adversary during one of the game's most impressive boss battles; the Sniper Duel against Cobra member, The End. From the start of the game, you will have a set of default items including a Sound Radar that pings when enemies or animals are nearby. Snake Eater features a decent amount of weaponry, though it pales in comparison to Peace Walker's weapon choices. You have the mk22 Tranquilizer handgun that comes equipped with a suppressor. Don't get too excited though, the suppressor wears out with usage and will eventually break. When that happens, you will have to find another one. So be sure to remove your mk22`s suppressor when using it to hunt alligators and other large prey. You also get a handgun with lethal rounds, an M37 shotgun, an SVD Sniper Rifle, a Rocket Launcher and oh so many other dangerous play things.Snake Eater controls remarkably well, minus a few hiccups like the forced Intrusion View, but it's mostly a game you can immerse yourself in through it's gameplay, and most of all, it's story and cinematics.The Story & Cinematics:Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater's tale is one that definitely tugs at your heart strings and makes you feel for the protagonist. To be with someone, to love her, train with her, live with her and consider her family, and then be forced to kill her. It's something that really just kills you inside.  At the end of the game, once you've neared the end of Operation Snake Eater, you will be asked to pull the trigger and kill The Boss. I, and I'm sure many other gamers couldn't do it. I paused for too long and eventually the game took over and finished the job. It's only a game, but I can honestly say that no film, let alone video game, has ever struck me as deeply as the story of Big Boss and The Boss in Metal Gear Solid 3. Well, enough of the waterworks, let's continue. During the Virtuous Mission, Big Boss learns of a new type of nuclear strike enabled weapon called the Shaghohod. I guess you can consider it Snake Eater's Metal Gear, although it isn't technically a Metal Gear. It's a large Tank that can accelerate to 300 mph and launch a nuclear missile to anywhere in the United States. We also find out who the original mastermind behind the Metal Gear project was, and get a short glimpse of Huey Emmerich. Hmm... I may have already spoiled too much of the story, so let me just stop and move on.The Metal Gear Solid franchise is infamous largely due to the length and frequency of the cutscenes. Those who complain claim that a cutscene occurs every few steps, and while that may be true during certain portions of a game, it's definitely an over-exaggeration. MGS3 has cutscenes, they're plentiful and they're long. So if you were one of those strident fans who loathed MGS2's cinematics, MGS3 won't be a breath of fresh air for you. Personally, I don't understand the complaints. MGS' cinematics are an integral part of the series. Without them, neither Solid Snake nor Big Boss would really be who they are in the hearts of the many MGS fans. It is because of how story driven this series is, that the cutscenes are as important as the gameplay. That of course is just my opinion.In Metal Gear Solid 3, the cutscenes can almost fool you into believing that you're watching one hell of a kick ass movie. That's what it feels like sometimes because it's all put together so well. The level of detail that went into Snake's CQC maneuvers, Ocelot's braggadocio and fancy handgun acrobats, and especially the Shagohod chase scene near the end is absolutely astonishing. Every scene is fantastic, so I cannot tell you which one is my favorite. Do I choose the one where Big Boss singlehandedly dispatches of a certain handgun virtuoso's entire brigade, or the one where The Boss takes down Big Boss and Snake Eater's main villain at the same time? Perhaps one of the many scenes where Eva bends over for us in her underwear? But I digress... Snake Eater's scenes were done in real time, so the Big Boss you see while playing is the same Big Boss you see during the cinematics, which to me is a plus. I detest watching beautifully rendered characters in cutscenes, and then playing downgraded versions of them. So in Snake Eater it all flows very well, especially so since the in-game graphics are beautiful anyway.To conclude this review, I have to say that Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is unmatched. It's definitely my top 1 game of all time and I doubt any other game will surpass it. Hideo Kojima out-did himself here.Cons: Not much that would deter from enjoying the game. The only thing I really disliked was the forced intrusion view when crawling through tall grass.Pros: EVERYTHING! I want MOOOAR!Score - 10/10 As good as it gets on the Playstation 2Cecile Cosima Caminades.... uuuuhh that's a Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker reference. Only PW players who actually bothered to listen to Cecile's tapes would know what it means.Kojima Is God, truly. All praise be Kojima!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2011"}

First let me get the bad points out of the way: there are no outer-space battles, you cannot play as a jedi, the A.I. is hard headed, and the maps are too small for flying vehicles. It should also be noted that this is NOT a mission-based game like, \"Halo\", so stop comparing every game to \"Halo\" please! Battlefront plays similar to a Pc game called \"Battlefield 1942\", you CAN compare it to that game. You can win the game by capturing all command posts (territories) or killing all enemy units on the map. You play as a grunt soldier in the frontlines of all the epic battles seen in Star Wars films (including Tattooine, Hoth, Endor, Naboo and much more!) Before you begin battle you pick from four different army factions: Clones, Republic, CIS, and Rebels. Then you pick the soldier type you want to be: rifleman (rapid fire blaster), pilot (can repair and dispense medkits to soldiers), missle launcher (bazooka), sniper (long distance zoom killer), and commando (special unit). Most soldier class carry primary and secondary weapons and a couple of grenades. Everytime you get killed you can respawn and choose a different soldier type. You can travel by foot or ride in vehicles if available. Almost all of the vehicles from the Star Wars universe are in this game! Even the monsterous AT-AT! You'll be fighting alongside an army of A.I. controlled soldiers. There's lasers, missiles, and grenades exploding everywhere! The battles are intense, chaotic and a lot of fun!

I used to be a REALLY hardcore Sonic fan. After buying all of those collections, this game looked like a bit of a joke to me. It looked like it was trying to pass itself off as yet ANOTHER Sonic collection, just so Sega could pull in some more good money, like they hadn't ripped us off with the so-called \"next-generation\" Sonic games already. 'I won't fall for it', I told myself sternly. But, after checking out just how many games and unlockables there were in this game, I couldn't pass it off as a joke any longer.

{"product_name":"B00BGAA0SU","description":"","reviewerName":"steve","summary":"Infamous: a truly memorable adventure","reviewText":"Infamous is, without a doubt, the crown jewel of the Playstation 4 upto this point. While Killzone: Shadow Fall was fun for awhile, it was nowhere near to the level that Second Son is. However, to remain objective, I will refrain as much as possible from referring to non-infamous games and dive right into the review.Infamous SS takes place almost a decade after the events of Infamous 2. It sees the introduction of a new character, Delsin Rowe, and he is interesting, to say the least. However, he is not ill-fitting for the story.Story: The story is great and as engrossing as it gets. From start to finish, Delsin's journey is fascinating and keeps you interested.Graphics: The graphics in Second Son are beautiful and undeniably next-gen. This is the best looking game on the PS4 thus far.Control: in much the same fashion as previous entries in the series, the controller setup is easy to learn and works well. Implemetation of the new touch pad feature is well done.Sound: Crisp, clear sounds and voices are heard throughout the game and are beautifully done.Replay Value: The replay value is pretty high, although once you beat the game with both good and evil paths completed, there is not too much to do. However, Sucker Punch is releasing a large amount of FREE DLC to keep interest up, such as the Origami Storyline and Cole's Legacy - great move by Sucker Punch.Summary: If you have a PS4, this is the game to buy. Does this game warrant the purchase of a PS4? If any game does, Infamous: Second Son does. From its gorgeous landscape to the intense battles, it is a thrill from start to finish and a must have for any action game fan.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2014"}

Would you really play a game where it was based off the exact movie, and you played the sotryline and knew how it ended. You know, why would anyone play the game if it had been like that.

I am a GTA fan and I understand their is going to be some foul language in games of that type, but gee whiz! This game takes it to a new level with the use of the \"f\" word being used in my opinion, 100 times that of GTA.  They need like a language filter or something on games that way those of us to enjoy openworld games can play them and have fun w/o hearing all the frequent profanities.  So bluntly put, the language in this game is horrible!  If they would have did it along the lines of GTA it would have been more tolerable, even though not good still to even have profanity in a game.  Games can be a blast w/o all that mess.  So have got that out of the way, the gameplay is a blast!  Vehicle physics are kind of rough though and not as smooth as GTA i.e. the driving of the cars and boats.  The graphics are pretty good too.  I love the mansion. That is cool.  They have really neat cars and boats as well.  I like the fact too that you can hire your own henchmen and driver.  You can call a car from your garage from anywhere and your driver will bring it to you in a matter of seconds..same goes for your boats if you are in a boathouse location.  There may be other locations to call boats from but I haven't discovered it yet.  In the game, you buy property, do deals, take down enemy gangs, etc on your way back to the top to claim your empire.  Overall, language not included, this game is fun.  But if I would have known then, what I know now, I would have just stuck with GTA and would have went out and bought D1 drift racing instead.  Considering the language just makes this game a chore to enjoy without wanting to bring it back and trade it in. My wife could hear me playing the game from the other room and even she was disgusted and admitted that even GTA is better than this game. So being the GTA fan that I am, I just can't really recommend this game to anyone.  Parents be forewarned.  This game is rated mature for a reason so please do not buy this game for your children thinking the rating is nothing but a label.  This title earns a capital \"M\".","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2006"}

The character leaps around, bounces off walls, swings from chandeliers, slides down handrails, and all that while shooting two guns at the same time.The overall look of the game is great. If def. has a cinematic feel to it. (Note: The game also has a pretty high level of gore and violence, so it def. isn't for everyone...)It isn't all that realistic. More like \"wire-fu but with guns\". But heck this is fun. It really makes you feel good about yourself and the awesome moved \"you\" just pulled off.The one negative about the game is the save system. It is the console-typical (although ot necessary) check-point system. Unfortunately, in the later parts of the game (especially the final sequence), you can go a long way (seems like close to half an hour) without hitting check-points. Especially after defeating a boss I would always expect a check-point...I bought this game at about the same time as I got Gears of War and Bioshock. Both these games I had high expectations in and I ended up liking them pretty good. But as it turns out, I like this shooter better.

Compared to the awesome control of Mario U im still trying to get used to the controls in a 3d style as for me Mario will always be a 2d game regardless of how good the graphics are. In this game and Mario U they are stunning but this game is hard to navigate as it's damn near impossible to determine where you going to land....again I love the smooth controls and camera angles of Mario U.  The multiplayer is kind of fun, my wife and I tried to enjoy it but it gets frustrating quickly for the control/camera limitations I mentioned above.  Once again going through the levels together is tough and if you get a little ahead of the other player(s) it kills you all or bubbles everyone which is very annoying.  The next thing is the cat suit power up, its way to overused like in every level, where are the racoon suits?  If you die 5 times in a level you get the while tanookie suit rendering you invincible save from pit falls which this whole game is.....  Overall Mario U is all you need for a great new Mario game this one is a real dud, it tries to pride itself on nestalgia but fails and the levels range from easy as hell to damn near impossible again due to the 3d mess of the controls and camera angles.

One thing is certain, in this city, you will learn how to run.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"It just made the jump...barely","reviewText":"As anyone who's ever been in a job interview or met the guy/girl of your dreams, you'd know how important that initial first impression is and your thoughts upon it can be influenced by that first go. After all, if you act like a buffoon in front of that gorgeous girl from work, imagine the work it would take to correct that. Gaming is similar but with anticipation very heavily found, these first impressions can be somewhat disappointing or the game's so full of awesome that it blows you away immediately. When I first played Mirror's Edge, one of the fall games I was dying to play, I had to say I hated it and glad I didn't buy it. Frustrating trial-and-error, broken combat and rather lame story made me think it was another one of those \"good idea, bad execution\" type deals. Well after playing it a second time on the 360 this time, certain gripes remain but maybe I was just too harsh last time.Story: You play as Faith, a \"runner\" who travels along rooftops hopping to wherever there's solid ground transporting vital packages though what's in them is usually never mentioned but apparently they're bad since the government, all-powerful and all-controlling, wants them back. When a mayoral candidate is found dead and Faith's sister Kate is the suspect, it's up to Faith to use her brains as well as her feet and hands to figure out the truth.Graphics: Using the Unreal Engine, what immediately strikes is it has a very distinct sense of style. Sure it's FPS and visible body parts akin to Monolith and the \"Condemned\" games but with a bright, nearly sterile city, huge draw distances and colored walls, it's quite a vibrant looking game. Even things like framerate were pretty spot-on though occasionally I'll notice a funky texture on some things while other things (stare at a pipe when you're climbing one) look great. Character models look...okay for the most part and the story sequences, while good in their own right, differ too much from the in-game graphics and cutscenes.Sound/Music: Anchored by its theme music \"Still Alive\" sung by Lisa Miskovsky (and not by gLaDoS), the music is along the lines of a techno soundtrack with a fair bit of ambience, trance music and energetic stuff as well when things get more dicey. It's actually quite a lovely soundtrack to listen to though it's not really \"memorable\" in terms of melodies, just pleasant. Voice acting I found very well-done and never found problems with anybody in the cast and it's nice to see an FPS character actually say something rather than bland Nathan Hale from Resistance or all-important-but-mute Gordon Freeman.Gameplay: I think everyone and their mother's dog have been getting a bit tired of FPS games and especially the obsession with World War 2. While occasionally you'll have something like Bioshock or Fallout 3 to change things a bit, it's a bit too same-y when you're dealing again with shotguns, grenades and the like so in comes Mirror's Edge and does things differently. The core part of gameplay is getting from point A to B and figuring out how to do that. The controls are like this: LB is your jump while LT is your crouch, RB is your quick turn around and RT is your attack. These are sensitive to the situation so for example a jump and kick will be a different combat maneuver than a sliding kick baseball style. LB will be the dominant button since with it you can jump to places, climb up ledges, swing off of poles and beams and wallrun Prince of Persia style. Also found is using LT to slide under gaps or going more into a ball to clear a fence's top. While I don't normally use 2 fingers for the triggers, it's actually remarkably intuitive and not once did I feel like \"okay now...when I jump it's....LT I press, right?\"Also included, since it is Dice, maker of the Battlefield series, is combat and guns and sadly they just don't work. Everytime the platforming was around, I loved it despite the occasional missed jump but when you have to fight otherwise you'd just be shot if you ran anyway, then it gets frustrating. You have a disarm move to knock your opponent out and grab their weapon only sometimes it won't actually trigger and you'll just get your face smacked in anyway and of course you're typically being shot at by about 4-6 others so why bother disarming one guy when more are just going to target practice you anyway? Not to mention it's hard to target a guy to drop kick or what have you when you're running like hell so runner vision, another slowmo feature, makes it a bit easier though sometimes you just die in slow motion anyway.The fun parts of the game are easily the platforming and many times when I'm being chased or just gotta get somewhere, it's a blast to hop, roll, slide and wallrun over everything to get there and though it's touted that you can go anywhere you want, it's really just linear though you can climb a small building or scale a nearby fence but it's more shortcuts and speed than alternate routes. Alternatively, it's easy sometimes to wonder where the hell you're supposed to go and many times, I'll be chased and I'm wondering \"now what?\" as I'm trying to figure out just where the exit is. Maybe it's just the second time going through it but I found it easier to get where I needed to go once I knew where I actually needed to go rather than guesswork.This game kind of reminds me of one of those things where the first time you hated it, found it tedious/boring/unfunny/whatever but then you go \"well, maybe it just needs to grow on me\" and so Mirror's Edge does have flaws, big flaws that I wish weren't a part of it but on the other hand, there is some entertainment to be had despite its short length but like other games that aren't massive sellers, this'll either be a love it, like it or hate it. I moved from the middle to somewhere on the way to the former.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2009"}

It looked like a new, beautiful, and innovative game.  It looked really fun.  I was correct about new, beautiful, and innovative, but the fun seems to be missing.Mirror's Edge is an intense first-person run-and-jump platforming game similar to Tomb Raider and Prince of Persia but with a focus on speed.  The game's premise is that the player must quickly determine the most effective route from point A to point B across the rooftops pulling some insanely cool Hollywood style stunts along the way.  Graphically, the game is beautiful and I especially like the color palette.  In fact, the color palette is actually very important to gameplay as it represents your \"runner's sense\" and subtly shows you the correct route.  The idea behind the game is great.  The story, what I've seen at least, seems pretty good.  The problem is the gameplay falls apart and frequently results in repeated frustrating falls to your death in a trial and error fashion.My personal theory is that this game isn't finished yet, having been rushed out the door to be ready for Christmas.  The controls just don't feel tweaked and finished yet.  If the platforming and running controls had been completed before shipping the game, I think I'd have loved the game.  Examples of bad control:- Doing simple things, like jumping up onto a waist-high box or ledge, frequently requires multiple tries because you often jump too far or end up banging your shins on it and falling back down.  All the while, helicopters and cops are shooting at you and laughing because you can't climb onto a simple box as you run for your life.- Grabbing stuff sometimes just doesn't happen.  I don't know why, but sometimes I could grab a ledge or pipe and other times I couldn't even though it felt like I was doing the exact same thing.- The indoor environments are not as fun as they could be because they limit your ability to do what the character does best, which is RUN.  A lot of your maneuvers require that you build up a certain amount of momentum with a good long run, but being inside really kills your ability to build up speed properly which results in more trial and error situations than is really acceptable.- Combat is broken in my opinion.  When it works, combat makes you feel like you pulled off some sweet Jet Li action.  Unfortunately, reliably pulling those moves off takes far more practice than it should.  Don't worry though, because you'll get a lot of practice from all dying you'll do.  I could cope with a broken combat system though because combat is maybe 10%-15% of the game.Sadly, Mirror's Edge just isn't as good as the hype set it out to be.  The game controls feel rushed and unfinished, and I blame the industry tendency to push things out just in time for Christmas for that.  When things work, this game shines and feels awesome, but that feeling is often killed by frequent trial-and-error moments in the game.  What I really hope is that a sequel is released that addresses the issues I described above.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2008"}

Nonimowse. \"bomber214\"","summary":"Disappointing, repetitive, a one trick pony.","reviewText":"Normally I like to see games through until the end, even if they are mediocre.  I just ended up putting this one down out of boredom.  Army of Two has all the elements to make a good game, but they are all arranged and executed poorly.AoT has a few \"key features\" and the game basically beats you in the head with them, repeatedly.  In fact, if you don't play the game precisely how the developers intended you won't do very well.  It's really very constricting.  The aggro system doesn't really translate into fun, it translates into a monotonous repetitive sequence that you will be required to perform.  A prime example of this: the ridiculously useless except for specific parts \"Co-op sniping mode\".  Traversing the game really is a matter of executing the exact same formula.  All the main bosses require you basically flank them and then shoot them because they are invincible from the front.Aiming your weapon doesn't seem to make it all that much more accurate, and it usually takes an impressive number of shots to drop the average enemy.  Regularly I had to put two high caliber rounds into the average enemy grunt's face, even at very close range.The voice acting and dialog are utter garbage and are physically irritating to have to suffer through.  It isn't the foul language, because I'm like a sailor with my colorful words, but it's just the idiotic content of their conversations.  Over and over again, the basically same idiocy.AoT does have an interesting variation on the cover systems we've seen in these types of game -- implied cover.  Anytime you are near cover and you try to shoot at something where the cover is in the way your character will move his gun around to clear the cover.  It's kind of fluid, but there can be perspective issues.  The environment, therefore, takes on that \"Gears of War\" syndrome -- where everything is pretty much full height, crouching cover height, or too round to utilize.Overall, I would say it probably wouldn't be a bad rent, but buying it is something I'd only consider if you really enjoyed renting it.  Or found it very for cheap and didn't have any other game on your plate.  One last note:  to be fair, I never bothered to play it co-op.  I literally couldn't find anyone else interested, for one, and I don't really feel the addition of a human player would change how you played the game at all.  The only benefit to a human player would be the social aspect.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2008"}

After picking up some mobsters in his taxi one day he is thrown into a chaotic, wild ride that takes him to the top rankings of a Mafia family where betrayal, murder, life changing plot twists and turns are a part of every day life.The main characters are memorable and wonderfully voice acted. The facial textures and animation are probably the best of the current PC games, and the graphics engine, while a system hog, are so good it makes it feel like real cinema.The action scenes are challenging but fun to play over and over until you accomplish your goal.  And every little detail boasts 1930's gangster era novelty, from the brick roads and trolleys, to the clothes, hairstyles, weapons and cars.Mafia is probably the most stylish and immersive game since No One Lives Forever and Deus Ex.  The third person controls work suprisingly well in the gun fight scenes, and there are plenty of different missions to keep it interesting and have you longing to find out what happens next.There is too much about this game to go into more detail here, but I couldn't recommend a game more highly.  It's a \"grown up's\" game unlike GTA3, which has similar mechanics, but in my opinion doesn't come close to the over-all production value and entertainment that Mafia offers.If you have a decent computer system and video card, and you only bought one PC game this year, Mafia should be it!

Choose from Aragorn, Legolas and Gimili, and fight through locations like Balin's tomb, Fangorn Forest, Rohan, and Helm's Deep. EA managed to snag the original cast from the films, so not only will you be hearing their authentic voice-overs as you play, but you can also unlock movie clips where they discuss the recording process.I actually played the Return of the King game before Two Towers, making for an interesting experience. Return of the King adds several enhancements to the graphics engine and fine-tunes the gameplay, not to mention allowing you to play as nearly the entire fellowship. Two Towers feels very limited in comparison, and many of the missions feel horribly short (you're in and out of Rohan before you know it). It's only the last three missions in Helm's Deep that offer any challenge, and coupled with the awesome graphical effects its clear that the designers based the game around this scenario. What Two Towers does right though, is moderate the difficulty level. The last few levels of Return of the King were kicking/screaming unfairly frustrating, whereas the challenge in Two Towers is high without losing the fun factor. I want to concentrate on killing the enemy, not worry about my teammates who can't take care of themselves.Overall, Return of the King is technically the better game all around, with 2 player action, more characters, better graphics, etc. But both games are very well put together, and its worth the cash for Lord of the Rings fans to have both in their library.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2005"}

I've owned and used many headsets over the years (a few Turtle Beach) and there always seems to be something new for PC, gaming consoles, mobile devices and DJing.  As I always enjoy testing out new headphones here are my thoughts on the Turtle Beach Ear Force PX4;Pros+ All volume, treble, bass and mic controls are adjustable via individual buttons on the headset.+ Dynamic Boosts are extremely helpful when playing multiplayer/co-op FPS games where there are a lot of explosions.  Being able to hear an enemy approaching or a teammate warning you in tense combat situations is invaluable.+ Headband/earcups are comfortably padded and easy to wear for long periods, even with glasses.+ Microphone is detachable which allows use with all of your portable devices.+ Breathable mesh earcups fit comfortably over your ears.+ Multi-platform use (XBox 360, PS3, PC, Mac and mobile devices).+ Respectable battery life.  My average times were around 13-14 hours of use before the battery ran down.+ Excellent Dolby Digital sound and mic quality.+ Able to pair with two different Bluetooth devices at a time.+ Dual-Band Wi-Fi (although limited at the moment until a few software updates are issued) with a decent range.+ Lightweight construction.+ Easy set-up and pairing.Cons- Build quality of plastic and synthetic is a bit disappointing considering the price tag.- Steep price point of $150 which I feel is too much for the quality of what you're getting.- Mediocre noise isolation.- Earcups only swivel 90 degrees one way.- Poor instruction manual.At the $150 range, the Turtle Beach Ear Force PX4 unfortunately falls a bit short to justify the asking price.  The audio quality is good and the adjustable controls allow you to find just the right balance to fit your gameplay or listening style.  Every video game I've played so far has had crisp and clear highs, mids and lows without ever sounding dull, distant or hollow.  I've been playing multiple games (Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag, Borderlands 2, Bioshock Infinite, Dead Island Riptide) with all resulting in quality sound.  I've also used the headset with multiple tablets, mobile phones and portable gaming devices to listen to music and play games with equally respectable sound quality.  Using the headset for phone calls was nice and clear so they're easy to recommend for that purpose.  However, I feel that the current asking price for the Turtle Beach Ear Force PX4 is too high at the moment for what you're getting.  I feel that this headset would be a more worthy investment around the $100 range.  Personally, I feel there are better headset choices on the market for the current asking price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00320JAWY","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"A harrowing experience","reviewText":"Spec Ops: The Line is a difficult game to talk about without giving away too much. The game's impact upon the player will come from encountering situations that few video games have ever dared to go, and revealing too much about this will amount to spoiling the game. However, Spec Ops: The Line is a troubling, challenging, and overall brilliant entry into the ever-evolving medium of video games. It's a game that is going to be referred back to for many, many years, even though people may not realize that yet.Spec Ops: The Line is loosely based on Joseph Conrad's classic novel \"Heart of Darkness\", which later went on to influence the seminal film \"Apocalypse Now\". You play as Martin Walker (perhaps named after \"Apocalypse Now\" actor Martin Sheen, who plays the same role in the film?), a solider who leads a squad of two other soldiers into a future version of Dubai that has been ravaged and practically destroyed by dust storms. A decorated American solider, Colonel John Konrad (a reference to the \"Heart of Darkness author?) has gone rogue, holed himself up in Dubai with his regiment of soliders, and has not been heard from in a long time. It is Walker's, and your, mission to enter Dubai, search for Konrad and his troops, and then get everyone evacuated. The game starts off normal enough as a pretty basic military third person shooter with decent gameplay mechanics and controls. But before long, the game starts heading down its dark path, and takes the player with it every step of the way.Spec Ops: The Line's brilliance comes from the way it takes the player on a parallel journey through darkness along with Martin Walker and his squad. As Martin Walker is forced to commit horrendous, unspeakable acts and begins to question not only his morality, but his own sanity, the game forces the player to ask questions of themselves regarding their own nature. And as Martin Walker begins to unravel, provided the player has allowed the game into their psyche, the player too will begin to question their own motivations, and will very likely come out of the experience seeing things a bit differently. Apologies for the vagueness of this paragraph, but like I mentioned earlier, it is a game that really has to be experienced to be understood.Spec Ops: The Line isn't the most pleasant game to play. While some of the combat does provide some great thrills, the game is very dark, disturbing, and can be a challenge to get through. But at the same time, Spec Ops: The Line is one of the boldest games of this generation. It takes big risks in the way it works its narrative and in the way it addresses the player and forces him/her to ask themselves questions. Like the movies of Ingmar Bergman, Spec Ops: The Line isn't always a \"fun\" experience, but once it's over with, it is a game that sticks in your consciousness for a long time. All gamers who are interested in the possibilities of the medium of video games should give Spec Ops: The Line a try. This is an important game, and shouldn't be missed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2013"}

Like many \"gamers\" I'm just sick of having to upgrade my console every few years so I played my xbox1 as long as I could. I was given a wii as a gift last year and found it to be a fun social game system but I grew up on nintendo and sega genesis. I needed a new fix: enter ps3. WOW. When I saw the previews for Uncharted 2 and GOW I was pretty sure this was the next gen ticket. Now if we make our next gen purchase based on the history of the consoles and companies that brought them to us, it should be well documented that Sony has a much better track record than the competition. The xbox1 was abandoned the second the 360 was announced. Meanwhile the ps2 still has some support years after its peak. I can't forgive M$ for that. Sorry you don't get my money. Whose laughing now. After all the recalls and constant upgrades to hardware it is clear that Microsoft is scrambling for public interest in their consoles and desperately trying to mask the fact that they continuously release inferior products with shoddy production year after year. When the next xbox comes out and they finally put the last nail in the 360's coffin all of their supporters are going to be really disappointed. Meanwhile Sony will continue to outclass their competition by supporting their consoles and providing a long healthy lifespan for their customers to enjoy.:)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-22-2010"}
{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Wright","summary":"Two stars, only for the eye candy","reviewText":"So, I could go on and on about how great Mass Effect 1 and Mass Effect 2 were.  I think most people know this already.  Basically, I'll state that the reason Mass Effect 3 is the way it is is because EA is the way that it is.  That is, it's a company primarily in business for the numbers. EA's sole interest is how many games they can make fly off the store shelves. They don't really care if the game is good, bad or just plain awful. To them it makes no nevermind.What matters to the EA bean counters is that you plop down $60 for it and then $10 here and $10 there for DLC. That's what matters. Mass Effect 3 is the poster child of exactly how EA operates its gaming divisions. EA demands its gaming divisions to deliver when they want it delivered, not when the game is ready or when the game is complete. It's clear also that Bioware has been gutted of any creative spark that was there when KOTOR and, later, when Mass Effect 1 was released. It's also clear that EA has forced Bioware to dumb down and scale back what Mass Effect is so they can get it out faster.As for Mass Effect 3, this game tries to play like Mass Effect 1 and 2, but fails on so many levels.  The environments are small, there are few side quests and what is there is so directed it might as well be a rail shooter. When you're on board the Normandy, you can hop from star system to star system collecting things, but too has been removed the 'mining' parts from Mass Effect 2 dumbing this game down substantially. You can still search for things, but only what the game wants you to search for.The relationship building aspect is still mostly kept intact, again dumbed down and scaled back. So, at least that's somewhat there. There are question and response pieces that seem to be leading somewhere, but really don't. The choices you make seem like they might do something, but again do nothing.  The 'war assets' you collect, do nothing. In the end, none of anything that you have done throughout the game (or indeed any of the games) makes any difference to the conclusion.  It still ends up the same, and it's not all that impressive at that.So, just chalk Mass Effect 3 up to EA's bean counters.  Again, ME3 is effectively the poster child for everything that is wrong with EA's business strategy. By playing this game, you will understand why when EA takes game companies over, their franchises don't live long under EA.  If this franchise manages to survive at all, it will become a hollow vapid shell of what it once was and ME3 is already displaying this. It's likely that the next Mass Effect game released ends up being some kind of mediocre arcade-style first-person zombie shooter so that there is nothing left in common with this franchise but the name. That's also one of EA's strategies. Basically, they will use the name until it can't be used any more no matter what genre the game is. They just want your $60.Oh well, so much for Bioware (begins playing Taps).","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2012"}

Calling it the best game on the system is pretty dumb, though, because Mario World beats all the other games. The combat system isn't perfect, with a few minor flaws and one major flaw: guarding against enemies is a pain to deal with! The timing for guarding is difficult to learn and sometimes seems impossible. The minor flaws are in the menu. It's not quite as good as what you see in later Mario RPG's. Also, I don't see why people think the story and characters are so great. Paper Mario 2 did way better in that category. I thought the way the characters were portrayed was annoying. The story line is just a little bit insulting to the Mario series too, just a little bit.

{"product_name":"B00000K2R4","description":"The Dreamcast system is, in a word, awesome. Fire upSoul Calibur, and instantly you'll appreciate that the graphics and gameplay are even better than in the arcade version. AndSonic Adventure, with its light-speed gameplay, is sure to wow even the most jaded gamer.It's amazing that such a small machine (it's about the size of your mouse pad) can deliver such incredible performance. Chalk it up to superior engineering. Dreamcast's only downside is that it comes with only one controller and a demo disc. In order to truly take advantage of Dreamcast's capabilities, we recommend outfitting the controller with a Jump Pack and a Visual Memory Unit. Getting one or more extra controllers is also a good idea, because some of the best Dreamcast games support up to four players at once.Why it's so cool:Ultramodern components:Custom-made video, audio, and processor technology blows away the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation and puts Dreamcast in the same league as PS2 and XBox.Integrated modem:In another video-game first, Dreamcast comes with a 56K modem. Use your regular Internet service provider and the separately sold keyboard to access e-mail, shopping, and the World Wide Web. Not only can you upload high scores, participate in chat discussions, and download updates and enhancements for your games, but, through a membership to the SegaNet Internet service provider, you can playQuake III Arena,NFL 2K1, and other games against Dreamcast owners over the Internet.The Visual Memory Unit (VMU):More than just a memory card, the VMU is a miniature portable game system that fits inside a controller--so its LCD screen is easily seen by you but hidden from your opponent.All-in-one entertainment:It plays games. It plays audio CDs. It connects to the Internet and lets you browse the Web or e-mail friends. Our note to the cost-conscious: If you have a Dreamcast system, you just don't need a separate CD player or a separate computer. Dreamcast does it all, and does it well.--Mike Fehlauer","reviewerName":"Chris Peters","summary":"Now is the Perfect Time to Buy This Outstanding Console","reviewText":"The Sega Dreamcast is a great game machine.  I have been happier with this console than I ever expected.  If you are dying to get a Playstation 2 but weren't fortunate enough to pre-order one 9 months ago, definitely give the Dreamcast a try!  You won't be sorry.First of all, the games are great, they are unique, and they are fun.  Only on the Dreamcast can you play Resident Evil:Code Veronica, Crazy Taxi, Sega GT, Space Channel 5, Jet Grind Radio, Sonic Adventure, F355 Challenge, Virtua Tennis, Seaman, Samba de Amgio, Soul Calibur, or Power Stone 2.  NFL2K1 is an outstanding game, and most review sites consider it to be barely...  -barely-  ...behind its Playstation 2 equivalent.  Games like Tony Hawk, Soul Reaver, and Jedi Power Battles feature better graphics and other improvements over their PSOne cousins.  Also consider the huge titles just about to be released - Shenmue, Grandia 2, Skies of Arcardia, Quake 3, NBA2K1, Half-Life.  That still leaves other huge titles, like Virtua Fighter 4, Black and White, Phantasy Star Online, and Shenmue 2, for next year and beyond.  The Dreamcast has a great future!Chances are you have tried online gaming, but if you haven't, you don't know what you are missing.  Another human being makes a game intense, especially in a FPS like Quake 3 or Half-Life.  Right now, only the Dreamcast is online.  Join the Sega.Net ISP for 18 months and you'll get the Dreamcast for free.  Again, most Amazon shoppers probably aren't new to the internet, but if you are shopping for a family who is without a computer or internet connection, the Dreamcast is the cheapest, easiest way to get them online, surfing 'n emailin'.Finally, you will not be losing much by waiting a year to buy your Playstation 2.  For the cost of a PS2, you can buy a Dreamcast and 3 great games.  For a PS2, you'll shell out $300 plus tax, and still need to buy a game.  Next Christmas, anaylists predict that Sony will be selling the PS2 for $200, and by that time, the console will have many more great games out for it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2000"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest. This unprecedented 60-player option could revolutionize online multiplayer game play and is sure to provide countless hours of action-packed fun.Resistance 2, set in the United States, is loaded with new weapons, enemies, and an unprecedented online gaming experience.","reviewerName":"Too Old for Games \"casualgamer\"","summary":"It will exceed your expectations","reviewText":"I was on the fence about this game for awhile now.  Some have compared it to the original and said the original is better.  I won't tell you which is better, but having played the original, I was left unfulfilled--granted, it was partly because I did play it years after its initial release. Needless to say, I came in with low expectations, but from the start, you can tell the scale of this game is much greater.  You can tell you're in the middle of a war raging on whereas in the original, you were in isolated landscapes fighting a few pockets of enemies here and there.  And the enemies in this game are also larger in scale.  The graphics are much improved and the environments are more varied.  The weapons seem more powerful--you can only carry 2 at a time which some have complained about because you could carry a lot more in the 1st game.  In regards to co-op, this one has online but no local and no co-op campaign.  I believe the 1st had local co-op campaign, but no online co-op.  That may be a factor to some.

It is not just a visual feast for the eyes or honeyed music for the ears, it is game that excels as a classic 2D platformer, continually calling to mind classic platforming games of days past. The level designs are varied and contain a mixture of the beautiful and the bizarre.Playing this game, I keep thinking of old-school, SNES greats like Donkey Kong Country or Earthworm Jim. The game has gorgeous backgrounds and immersive environments like DKC and a strange, sometimes quirky and macabre sense of humor and level design like Earthworm Jim. The underwater levels are some of the funnest since the DKCs. The level designs, once again, are an inspired mix of the kind of oddities best seen in other 90s platformers. The grungy, out of this world flair of these levels feature a world made out of rotting food where one must bounce on the visible grey matter inside open skulls, or an underwater mansion complete with robotic sentries.The game, as a collect-a-thon, will also offer plenty to keep you occupied, such as rescuing each Teensy from a world while collecting enough Lumes to win bronze, silver and gold cups to increase your \"awesomeness\" score. Daily and weekly challenges from Ubisoft's servers will also pit you against players from around the world as you vie for the highest score or time in challenge levels. These are quite addicting and push you to try and outperform everyone else for more cups to increase you awesomeness score.The game however is not without a few flaws, the biggest of which being the unbalanced difficulty. In this you have infinite lives. No, not infinite continues, infinites lives. No matter how many times you die on a certain area you'll never have to leave the level unless you want to and are free to try again and again without penalty. Often times I would get to the end of a level having rescued all ten of the levels Teensies and collected the 600 Lumes for the maximum score only to feel a twinge of guilt knowing that I had died several times and still got high marks. But despite the game forgiving nature, some levels are downright maddening in their difficulty. Some speed run levels which require you to move as fast as you can to get to the end seem nigh impossible to get through in time (let alone once) to rescue all the Teensies at the end. I had to stop a few times before I got frustrated and chucked my controller...again...And there's several of these levels, far too many in my opinion.Overall, the game feels unbalanced in terms of challenge. You'll find it far too easy at times and far too difficult at the others with there seldom being a happy medium. The game also features tons of unlockable characters but seeing as how each one plays exactly the same with no unique abilities it's really more of an aesthetic choice than anything with not much strategy involved other than getting good at the game.Still, overall I enjoy this game more than I do New Super Mario Bros. Wii (which I realize this game borrows heavily from). It feels new and refreshing but at the same time sweetly nostalgic. I strongly recommend this game for fans of classic 2D platforming.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2013"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game.

On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

The gameplay will also feel similar to these two games are if you've played them the Devil May Cry or Dante's Inferno and like these games you level up with each boss or mission you complete. What's enjoyable is that you aren't so confined in this game as you feel you are in the GOW series meaning instead of just following a single path you can explore the world around you more freely.  The graphics are very good though if you think you're going to get the quality of say Gears of War or something then expect some disappointment but that's not to say the graphics are in anyway terrible just that they won't be at the level of some of the more exclusive game titles.I have to say Liam O'Brien was cast perfectly as the voice of war and of course many will recognize Mark Hamill as the annoying and deceptive partner which War is force to have at his side and of course many other talented voice actors/actresses. So if you're a fan of games like GOW/DMC/DI or just looking for a fun entertaining game to play here's one to choose and of course don't forget to get the sequel where you get to play the next horsemen probably feared the most out of the four.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2013"}

This was back when Radio Shack had the Tandy computer. This is by far my favorite. The graphics are wonderful, the management while its not overly oppressive, it definately sims what running a city is like. In this one you get both SimCity4000 and the expansion Rush Hour. YOu can create sprawling metropolis or small villages by creating a region. What makes this game so much fun is the amount of thinking, urban planning, management, and urban revitalization is unprecedented. Placing zones of either residential, commerical, and Industrial the heart of your city planning. You must layout transportation, and the sims will come. As you zoom in closer to your city you can see it come alive.My only peeve is that I wish another expansion would come out, this is certainly a gem. Im aware of EA coming out with what seems to be Simcity's replacement and new lease on life. Many people are shouting that Maxis is not in on this one. What concerns me is seeing the pictures it looks like its City Life's cousin and you plop buildings down and not the zones. I happen to like zoning which is true to making a city.I was hoping that traffic lights would get an update and the use of turn signals (red arrow), and placing traffic signals. It would be nice to change the timings (see bags over the new lights that are about to be installed), add more signals, put them on the poles or long wire that we see everywhere, have traffic truly following the signals. Added realism can see traffic meters added, parking spaces, real parking lots, police pulling over speeders and running red lights, and getting into the police car and pulling people over or writing tickets for expired meters or stickers. The toll booth was a nice addition but when you see a toll booth its sprawled over many lanes and has gates and flashing lights. The airports need more action and realism. Sports stadiums should create a lot more traffic. I wish MAxis didnt give up on updates. Their was one update, more than 4 years ago. Simcity with todays computers would of benefited a small upgrade to allow the use of dual core processors which have dropped in price, and higher end video cards power to lift its capabilities. Cities lag badly when it gets bigger.All in all, I love this game. If you like city management/building, city creation, the opportunity to create a region from scratch, along with transportation meccas, then this is an absoulte. For $15 this is a steal!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2007"}

Dark Souls is a very good game because i have it but the Cheap Kills in Dark Souls is ABSURD compared to this game. I cant count how many times i got killed on the \"Back Swing\"  from and enemy or Boss.  In Dark Souls you can get Killed hiding behind a WALL or any other place you think is safe.  An enemy can shoot an arrow that will somehow follow your movement, unless you are lucky enough to roll it might mis you which is rare.Dragons Dogma is difficult but i have yet to get killed standing behind a wall or any other object that's used for cover.  The cheap shots are FAR and FEW between.  You can create and level your character, weapons and armor.  But the thing i love most is the magic in this game.

The maps are pretty well designed, although a little too favoring of long rage.  The big failure is that all the need for skill has been replaced by a rock, paper, scissors sort of system where this perk beats that weapon type, which beats an attachment, which beats a certain play style.

So were the snipers, encouraging half the team in any game sprinting around quick scoping.The zombie mode is the best part of the game.

{"product_name":"B0050SW8OS","description":"","reviewerName":"Arch Stanton","summary":"Nearly as Good as the PS3 Games","reviewText":"The question here is obviously whether a game for a portable system can achieve the same level of epic scale that the Uncharted series is known for. The answer is partly yes and partly no. The graphics are great and even if they can't compete with the PS3 they're still capable of showing off the meticulously crafted vistas that Uncharted is known for. I know this because I spotted them occasionally as I was running from things. This game rarely stops and shows off what it can do. There are few moments of awe amid the action, not even during climbing scenes when you have little else to do. The levels tend to be repetitive jungle. In a lot of ways it's quite a lot like the first game in that it rarely leaves a single region. Towards the end when exploring a massive underground city the game finally comes into its own and shows what it can do, but it needed more moments like that and it needed them sooner.I also felt that the game was sorely lacking in the epic setpieces that were the highpoints of previous games. Even if just in a cinematic, it would have been nice to see stunts so insanely reckless that you give out a silent cheer. Those games are structured around massive events, with most of the plot taken up in explaining how Drake gets from event A to event B. Their absence betrays a certain lack of inspiration more than any system limitations. As I said, in the scenes where they do show off the scenery it all holds up quite well. There are some beautiful backgrounds if you move the camera around to look away from where your focus is. I see no reason they couldn't have done more. They're playing it safe rather than taking risks and that's not what Unccharted does.As to the rest of the transition, it's all there. The witty writing and excellent voice acting and animations are all present. The characters are as great as ever. It's a prequel so there's no Chloe or Elena, but instead we get good old Sully as well as new characters Dante and Chase. Chase basically takes Elena's role as the conscience and prod, although she's a lot less altruistic. Dante is a fun antihero who gets to be both helpful and treacherous whenever the situation calls for it. Guerera is the typical South American strongman rogue general with little to distinguish him from other such characters. Some people have complained about the new characters being less interesting than the old ones but honestly, apart from Chloe in the second one the only really memorable characters have always been Sully and Drake. The other characters are rarely interesting, and I will at least remember Dante. His constant plotting and self-justification was fun to watch. The plot is as twisty and convoluted as ever, even if it is restricted to South America. This time it involves Visigoths, Conquistadors, and the city of Quivira. It's as loopy as ever and never lets up for a moment.Combat plays out basically the same as on the PS3, although it can take a little while to get used to the contours and responsiveness of the Vita system. There have also been a number of new features added, mainly connected to the touchscreen. To perform melee combat you now have to swipe your finger across the screen. This usually works surprisingly well, although if you're caught by surprise it can be quite hard to get your fingers into position in time to do anything. They also have a new feature that lets you take charcoal rubbings of various statues using the touchscreen. This works quite well and feels natural. The scraping of dirt off artifacts feels rather less so, but it isn't massively intrusive. You can use the rear touchpad to climb ropes and the front touchscreen to climb walls, but they never force you to use it. Occasionally it is even helpful.Honestly, the lack of ambition is the only real problem I have with this game. Maybe sticking to a South American context was important for texture storage reasons, but there's no reason they couldn't have taken better advantage of the vistas that they actually did have. It does have a rather weak ending, but it's nowhere near as anticlimactic as Uncharted 3, where the inevitable collapsing city began for no reason and the bosses barely featured. Uncharted games tend to have weak endings, probably because they've used up all of their amazing scenes just getting there. Golden Abyss is actually slightly better on that score, despite having the final boss fights take place in QTEs. Aside from that it features everything that you love about the Uncharted franchise: witty dialogue, fun characters, and exciting plots. If it is on a smaller scale than the latest adventures that doesn't mean much. It isn't that much less globe-trotting than the original Uncharted.If you haven't already, you should definitely check out the previous games in this series:Drake's Fortune,Among Thieves, andDrake's Deception. They are all better than this game, though not by much. Drake's adventures are just designed for the big screen. Which makes the success of this game a bit of a marvel.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2013"}

Secondly, I had to know why this game got better rating than Starcraft.  I will say first off this game and Starcraft are both so amazing that even someone like me who doesn't like sci fi enjoys theses games.  Aside from that, I will say this game is basically a starcraft clone with a few extras in reguards to how it plays to such a point that it seems like it was developed quickly.  Aside from this tho, the game amazes me with it's decent campagin story and lots of fun features.

I recently started playing like, let me remember, ahhh yes, 2 days ago! StarCraft I've been playing for years. This is the review that compares what some people acclaim to be that StarCraft BW is better than WarCraft3, even though warcraft has all the graphics, etc. Please note that there will be disagreements between those of you about what I'm going to say, but its simply my opinion and what I think, so stick with me here.Even though WarCraft 3 is new and contains really good graphics and game play. What sets its gameplay slightly below StarCraft, for what I've seen as in experience in playing, is the fact that people like things to be simple. The heros in WC3 are nice but the thing about it is that it complicates game play, where you have to think about not just building and upgrading men, but which moves to give the hero, when to use it, lvl up points going where, and which hero will be more useful in the long run. Where else over at starcraft bw, you just simply have to upgrade men, build them, and use strategy. Ignore defense, etc, as both games need them.Another reason why I believe starcraft is thought to be a better game is because of the numbers of men you can get. Players just like to throw an army at another person, its just the way it is. I mean I'm probably not saying it in the best way possible but I hope you get my point. People like having a huge army to throw at their apponents. Its more.....thrilling? Exciting? Shrug.Oh yeah, okay this is what I think, after playing WarCraft 3: Reign Of Terror, I noticed one thing. Even though I haven't played it long, so I'm not sure if my analysis is wholesomely accurate, but its hard to distinquish one type of men from another. I built a large army once and it took me awhile to find the hero lol. So I'm over here trying to cast a spell found on the hero and I can't find him. Hotkeys I suppose, but having a bad memory, thats not going to work for me. Its just not for the hero but many of the men. I don't know, try it for yourself, bunch up a bunch of your men and I think you'll see what I'm talking about. And again this is probably just my problem. Shrug.Hope this helps.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2004"}

You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or fighting the good fight solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support.Multiple Controller SupportMonster Hunter Trifeatures a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes. And finally the Wii Remote allows the ability to save your character&rsquo;s information directly to it, just as is possible with Miis, so you&rsquo;re always ready to play at a friend&rsquo;s house.Key Game FeaturesSpecial Controller Included- Designed with input from the Capcom development team, the Wii Classic Controller Pro is included in this bundle.Hunt Together- In the hunt, you&rsquo;re never alone. Hunt together with up to 4 players online or take on arena quests with 2-player split-screen action. In single player mode, you even have the ability to hunt with AI-controlled characters named ChaCha.Communicate Online- Because communication is key in coordinated huntsMonster Hunter Trisupports Wii Speak and text chat.Monsters with Unique Abilities and Attacks- Monsters have unique and dynamic personalities, abilities and defenses, increasing in complexity as the player progresses. They camouflage themselves to ambush hunters, but will flee or call for help if outmatched.Immense Living, Breathing World with Ecosystem- Monsters interact amongst each other in a living breathing ecosystem, complete with food chain. Monsters have stamina, migrate and even attack one another, the strong feeding on the weak.New Underwater Maps- For the first time ever in anyMonster Huntergame, you will be able explore land and sea and hunt monsters of the deep.Fully Customizable Equipment- With ten weapon categories &ndash; including the all-new Switch Axe &ndash; and new armor and weaponry created from the remains of slain monsters, there are almost limitless opportunities for equipment customization.Choice of Controls- Play with either the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, with the Classic Controller or Classic Controller Pro.Take Your Character with You- The ability to save your character to your Wii Remote lets you engage in multiplayer hunts anytime on a friend's console.","reviewerName":"Tanya McHenry","summary":"This is the Kind of Title the Wii has Been Missing","reviewText":"Too often the little things are overlooked in games that prevent the gamer from really feeling like this is \"their\" game. Monster Hunter Tri has managed to avoid most those pit traps, starting with the character creation process.First off, and paramount to a lot of gamers, especially those of us of the female persuasion, you can choose the sex of your character. It's such a simple concept that too often developers will scoff at the idea of making multiple models and essentially snub female players in a typically dismissive fashion. Yes, you can play male or female in Monster Hunter Tri.My first Character was female so I am going to cover those choices here. There may be different options available for the male.Name:  You only get 8 characters for this eliminating some fancy combos but still some freedom.Sex:  Male or FemaleSkin tone: Pretty much a range from black to white with tan and browns in between. There are no outlandish colors, green for example, but still a nice rangeClothing: Four choices, but armor will soon cover this so no worries.&lt;For clothing and hair color there are 12 preset colors but also a color spectrum to essentially choosey our own from who knows how many options. This is awesome>Face: 9 types to choose fromEye Color:  10 Choices found hereFeatures: A dozen facial features to choose from, tattoos, paint etc.Hair: 11 different hair stylesVoices: 20Now these, of course, are not limitless and lack some the fine tuning you might see in other RPG games (like on the PC), but there is plenty here to make running into your clone more very unlikely, which is an issue for some other games that are online. My only gripe about this game, and many others, is there is no way to really change the age of the character or the body type so we're stuck with the teenage girl look. It could be worse of course and overall I am very pleased with the character creation process.Now on with game play: for those who picked up the demo and wondered where the heck the tutorial was, have no fear, it's in the real game. I have no idea why Capcom released a rather poor quality demo. The demo was too short, offered no directions, and a lot of people were stuck using the wiimote nunchuck style. For me, the classic controller is the way to go. Get the camera under control was so much easier with it attached to an analog stick. There are two classic control styles too so hopefully one of those works for you. In terms of graphics, I keep hearing how stunning the game is, and while it does look good, it doesn't look great on my HDTV; yes I use component cables. It's not a deal breaker for me, but there are issues with black bars on the right and left sides of the TV for some of us, even in 16:9 \"full\" mode. The TV I am using is not some low grade model either, nor is it the most expensive thing I can find. Again, it's not so terrible I would pass on the game for it but clearly looks a lot better on SDTV.The tutorial takes awhile to get through, and sometimes I found myself a little lost, not so much as to what I am supposed to do but how to do it. And while there is an in game info section you can access for quick looks ups on your weapons and how you are supposed to use one skill or another, I did consult the manual and online a couple of times to make sure I was doing it right.This is a hunting game, lots of battle, and if the idea of battle doesn't appeal to you, then this probably isn't the thing for you. I say this because as a Rune Factory fan, I know that series doesn't necessarily require a lot of battle. Some people might think this game is obvious as to what it is, but let's keep in mind, Monster Hunter has never been huge outside of Japan and there really isn't anything like it on the Wii. This is not a standard RPG style either where there is a detailed linear story that guides you from point A to B to C. There is a story but it is minimal.Now where this game shines is online. I haven't spent a lot of time online yet as my friends have yet to purchase the game, but I did browse around. It looks like it could be a little bit of a pain to meet up with friends the first time since it's separated into cities/servers, but that is just for those of us who have a set group. The rest will have no troubles. It's plenty populated and there was a \"Rookie\" section I know I would be hitting and possibly will be hitting if my friends don't open up their wallets and get this game. This is \"real\" online play with Wii Speak, USB Keyboard and/or a virtual keyboard option available for actual conversation. I say this because I play Mario Kart Wii and was annoyed with the tiny amount of preset messages available, my favorite, yes and no questions without yes or no answers. For a console with built in online options, the Wii has been sorely lacking in online co-op multiplayer experiences... here it is.Now a quick note about battles, there is a lot of strategy involved, even early one when your equipment is almost non-existent. You have to watch what the monsters are doing and they give signs, sometimes just little ones, before they charge or do their attacks. It will take time to get used to your own attacks and theirs.Now I wanted to take some time and talk about the classic controller since this is the bundle. I was surprised with how light the controller was and relatively small. This is not a bad thing. The only other comparison I have is the Gamecube controller which I always felt was a little large and bulky. It's the perfect size for me even if it does feel gutless.Lastly, I want to mention a couple of gripes I have with the series. One is the inventory system. I find it to be annoying but it is something I will get used to. The graphics, well I can deal with that. I didn't buy the Wii for stellar graphics after all; the PS3 and 360 were available for that. One of my other gripes is the videos imply that the areas are vast and open, but when you play them, they feel tight and restrained. There are certain areas you can climb up but all those hills and mountains and even the monsters on them are just direction. Nothing feels real \"open\" to me in the way I was hoping it would be with the exception of some of the underwater maps which do feel a lot more expansive. My final gripe, and no it's not a long list aside from minor things mentioned above is  of split-screen co-op mode. I don't care what the game calls it, there is nothing majestic about the Arena mode.  It's basic and unsatisfying though handy for a quick run through.  It's unfortunate they left it so limited. As I mentioned before, the Wii doesn't have a lot of quality online games, but it does have tons of local multiplayer games, quality and not so quality.Anyway, if you enjoy action rpgs, and know that that is, it is the quick and dirty way I can explain the series from a player who has never played the past MH titles and can't specify the changes as some others might be able to do. One quick note, underwater combat is challenging and fun.Happy Hunting!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYILE","description":"","reviewerName":"postman","summary":"Great game","reviewText":"****UPDATE****9/29/2013Okay I just finished the main story line. I still have some side missions left so i'm not at 100% yet but I can talk a little bit more about the game so far. I mentioned in my original review that the driving was better than GTA 4 but could still use some improvement. I take that back. The cars (as I suspected) do handle better when you get used to the controls. They really handle well after modifying them. The planes handle well but the helicopters are quite difficult to control. This game simulates wind when flying so the vehicle will sway in the air as well as produce tuburlance. I have a hard time controlling the choppers. I have to continue to move the joy stick and constantly have to change altitude and the chopper still won't level out properly, its just difficult for me. I'm sure some of you won't have this problem I am having with it and I know if I keep playing it I will eventually get used to it. Even with my \"flying skills\" maxed out the choppers are still difficult.The controls for your character are kind of finicky to me as well. I had to buy another wireless controller since my other one uses up battery power to quick for my taste but even with the new controller the game controls seem to lag a little bit for me. Sometimes I try to take cover (which you have to do a LOT in this game since health packs are scarce) and he doesn't respond. Its the same with the trigger when I try to shoot. I am going to play the game a second time and this time I will take my sweet time playing it but I thought that may be something I bring up.Yes, health packs are pretty scarce in this game and its also a little more difficult to make money. Most of the main missions won't reward you with any loot for your hard work but there are stocks you can partake in. I still haven't tried it yet since I know nothing about stocks but I hear you can make upwards of a billion dollars or more if you know the right timing. Body armor is also hard to find. There are some scattered around the city but to find them you either need a strategy guide (which I have) or luck. More than likely you need a strategy guide just to make sure you get to do everything this massive game has to offer.Your health gets sucked down pretty quickly. That may be a good thing for some since this game almost depicts real life but it get tiring after a while. The later missions are not to difficult but you still need to take your time and watch your health.I still haven't witnessed any glitches minor or major. Once again this is a great game.****ORIGINAL REVIEW****I bought this game from GS the day it came out but decided to wait a few days and get familiar with the game before I review it.Lets start with the 2 game discs first. As you probably already know the xbox version of this game comes with 2 discs. The first is the \"install\" disc and the second is the \"play\" disc. You must install the \"install\" disc first on the hard drive. It takes about 15 min. After that you can pop in the \"play\" disc and continue to play the game. You only need to use the \"install\" disc one time. The PS3 version is on one disc since it is a blue ray disc.Lets start with the graphics next. One word: beautiful. Vastly improved over GTA 4. I know some people loved GTA 4 but I hated that game. There are some \"popping\" of textures in the game especially if you are in a fast car the building may pop into view or pedestrians may pop into view but for me its no big deal.Controls are next. Better, but I won't say great. The cars in this game handle much better. You still may need to get used to it though. The shooting mechanics will also take some getting used to as will the \"ducking\" moves. The default way of getting around on foot is to walk. In previous GTA games, your character will run the farther you pushed up on the joystick and to sprint you just hold \"a\" or \"x\" if using a Playstation controller. You cannot change his mode of foot motion in this game so if you want to jog you need to hold \"a\" and to sprint you need to tap \"a\" really fast. Its like that even if you are on a bike or swimming. Not a big deal but I wish they went back to the old way of doing that. Also each character you use have a different style of walk and run so that is pretty good.To switch guns you need to hold the left shoulder button (LB) and use the right joy stick to select what gun you want. Works pretty well for me. The last gun you select, if you just tap LB you can equip and unequip the weapon quickly. Works well enough. There is a large amount of arsenal to choose from and I believe most of the guns can be customized. There is body armor as well as knives and batons to use. You can also purchase grenades. Health packs, I think are scattered around the city.The map is HUGE. Lots of places to go and things to do in this game. I haven't gotten around to flying a plane yet but I have ridden bikes and they give you different varieties of bike to choose from. The cars in this game look similar to cars in real life and there are quite a few of them to choose from.The HUD is a little different. In previous GTA games you had your map as well as what gun was selected, day and the time. On this one the only way to check the time and see what day it is is to pause the game and look in the upper right hand corner. Speaking of pause menu, that is where you can find more details of the map and the places you can visit (which are available to you right from the jump), you can check the \"brief\" tab on missions that you are currently doing and objectives, the \"stats\" tab shows your skills that you gain as you play the game as well as a whole host of other things you have done in the world. \"Settings\" is where you can change the controller settings, display, audio, even facebook etc. The \"game\" tab is where you can go back and replay missions. That is probably the coolest feature of this whole game. There are multiple ways to do a lot of the missions so if you want to try a different way, after you finish the mission you can go back and replay it. Don't worry, it won't affect the progression of the story or game. You are graded at the end of each mission so if you want the best possible grade you will need to finish the mission as quickly as possible and kill the most bad guys with head shots (on some missions) and the like. Also in the \"game\" tab you can load a previous saved game or start a new game. The \"online\" tab isn't available yet so that will have to wait.Of course you know you have three characters to play around with. At the start of the game you will only have one to choose (i'm not gonna reveal which one so I don't spoil it for you) and after you do a few missions, another will open and after some more missions the last guy will open up to you. You get a dog but the dog doesn't come along until later. You can train him but you need a special app for the iphone (I don't have an iphone). When you can switch characters you hold down the bottom d pad and use the right stick to choose your character and the game will pan out to a google map type view and then zoom in on your new character. Which ever characters you are not using will continue on with their lives so every time you go back to that particular character they will be doing something different each time. Cool feature.There are lots of different varieties of people walking around. I haven't come across any animals yet but the city is very much alive. The AI seem a little smarter this time around but it can still use some improvement.Lots of music in the game to choose from and the soundtracks are very good. The ambient noise in the game seems realistic and if you have surround sound this game will really come alive.Cars have a lot of customizing that you can do to them. Different paint, rims, tint, you can even put xenon HID lights on your car. The convertible have tops that operate this time around. Hardtops and softtops of various kinds. Very cool feature. Sometimes if you get in a car accident the other people in their cars, I think, will get knocked out and lay on the horn. You can do burnouts until your tires pop too. Lots of different motorcycles in this game too and you have a few varieties of trucks. You can attach them to a trailer and pull it. If you find a tow truck you can also tow cars.There isn't a lot of loading in the game even when cinematic scenes start and end. Most of the time the scenes end and you automatically take over from there. No loading times. Some missions you have to \"prepare\" before you start them. You have to pick a crew (the game gives you people to choose based on their skill level) and you can use them in the missions.That is all I can think of so far as far as the regular gameplay is concerned.Word of caution: THIS GAME IS RATED M FOR MATURE FOR A REALLY GOOD REASON! I know a lot of games have cursing, killings and drug use and this game does all that. But now there is nudity. If you go to a strip club the girls in there, if you let them give you a private dance, will take off their tops. They only show their breasts but this game, shockingly, isn't rated \"A\" for adult. This is the first game I have played that actually had nudity to that level but I'm not surprised its in this game. Prostitutes are in here and this time you can have them do different \"services\" depending on how much you want to spend. They don't take off their clothes but they do make the noises and you can see, clearly, whats going on in the car. Also weed can be smoked in this game and you can drink alcohol.Haircuts and clothing stores can be visited but I haven't seen any tattoo shops in here. I haven't come across any major glitches or freezes. The only glitch I have seen is people walking on top of counters or hot dog stands but after I leave the area and come back, everything is back to normal. That may be the reason as to why Rockstar pushed the game back 6 months. They are coming out with an update on October 1, so that may fix any glitches that may be present. Also there may be more guns as well as more missions to do in future updates  as well so that is something to look out for.Overall its a great game. I recommend it but if you still aren't sure about spending 60 bucks for this game then you should try and rent it first.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2013"}

McBeth \"PSN/XLive/Steam: DirkPittSpawn\"","summary":"Great Experience and Lots of Fun","reviewText":"Killzone has a distinct look and story background to it. It also has a brutal feel to it and feels realistic when moving. The character and weapons feel like they have \"weight\" and you are very limited in what you can carry. You have your primary weapon, a couple of grenades, and a pistol.The beginning with 'Brian Cox' returning from the first KillZone as Visari was great, really spot on for his character. The music in the background is particularly fitting and just has a realistic, unique sound. Not only that but the sound effects are also very welcome, from the sounds of the rifles/weapons to all sorts of surrounding effects, bullet impacts, and explosions.The campaign can be finished in a weekend and has a lot of different elements thrown in. Of course there are sections where you man a turret, but there is also where you control a tank and a two-legged Mech unit. Unlike the first Killzone, your health is not noted on the screen and regenerates back to full (Killzone1 had a bar, which would regenerate, but only to level that it was at without taking additional hits. If you had taken damage before and didn't get to cover in time, the gauge would be at that lower level even after regenerating; unless healed. This dynamic can be found in the multiplayer of Killzone 2).The multiplayer is great. The firefights are intense and the requirement for teamplay and tactics is definitely necessary. It's particularly rewarding to level up and achieve another unlocked badge or attain another ability for a badge you already attained. The gameplay changes as you go; if you start out playing against players of the same rank you'll find it a good transition as you add more elements. For instance, your first badge unlock is the Medic with revive ability. Now your enemy will have to finish off downed players or risk having the tide turned against them.And soon you will have Engineers with Sentry guns, Tacticians with spawn beacons, Saboteurs with the disguise ability, an Assault class with added armor and the boost ability, and Scouts with the cloak ability. And the gameplay changes as each squad utilizes these classes to their advantage.Also the standard Warzone match includes several different modes to play that change dynamically. Capture points and hold them, Demolition a target while the other team tries to defend/defuse, Assassinate/Protect a target, and Body Count: the side with the most kills wins.I'd recommend this FPS (first person shooter) to those who are looking for a good game to play online and offline. It feels very immersive, the only time it breaks away from the FPS viewpoint is during a cutscene. You take cover while still maintaining that viewpoint, etc. The sounds, environment, etc. also help you become immersed into the story.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2009"}

Driven by pure revenge, nothing can stop Kratos from achieving absolution.","reviewerName":"Charles B Valentino","summary":"The thinking man's gore-fest","reviewText":"Set in ancient Greece, GOW's main character Kratos takes you through adventures that effectively highlight some of the most exciting legends of Greek mythology. One could describe Krato's story as a retelling of the legend of Hercules with bits of Perseus, Jason and the Argonauts, and other Greeks heroes thrown in. You encounter enemies such as gorgons, minotaurs, centaurs, hydra, harpies, cerberi, cyclopes, and even the gods themselves. It's a violent fairytale made of the best stuff the ancient greeks have to offer.The game play handles wonderfully. Not a button goes unused and many moves can be combined to create devastating combos. My favorite move is to toss enemies up in the air and turn them to stone with Medusa's Gaze causing them to shatter when they land. I found it fun to invent new ways to destroy large groups of enemies. My only complaint deals with the activation method for the Rage of the Gods move (a desperation move L3 + R3) It's a move that's only available when a fury meter fills up. This meter takes a while to fill and the move is intended for use when a situation calls for added strength. Consequently, I rarely get to apply it to a situation where I do need it. There is also a problem-solving element to the game but nothing I found particularly clever or mindbending, it does provide a nice break from the blood fest.Visuals/Sound - stunning.Though the music seemed repetitive at times (Kratos has a leitmotif), there were moments where it was programmed to enhance the energy of the moment. The visuals incorporate beautifully rendered creatures and magnificent architectural invention. Gorgeous visuals. Imagine climbing up from the chasm of Hades domain while departed souls plummet past you, jumping from ship to ship as hydras rip men apart close by, scaling a cliff growing from the back of a titan (the size of a city) who crawls across the desert, his every step shaking the environment.Interested yet?The storyline is simple and particularly reminiscent of Hercules quest for restitution. If you are familiar with that story then you should appreciate the parallels.Though I'm not an avid gamer (I could be characterized as a classic gamer/laggard), this game delivers challenge and thrill. It doesn't have a lot of replay value but for those who complete the post-game \"Challenge of the Gods\", new modes are unlocked as a result to provide added challenge, gameplay choices, and even a few fun easter eggs.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2006"}

I have been trying to get through this game since it was released and just gave up. The game is not only difficult, but it's so repetitive and strange. It has an odd vibe to it, but at least it controls well for the PSP and looks fantastic. The voice acting is spot on, but the story is so strange and broken up that I just couldn't follow it.That's not to say the game's horrible. All I know is that you play as Aya Brea from Parasite Eve (this is the spiritual successor) and you get jacked into a system where you can warp into people's bodies and control them. Think of them as lives. Once one guy is dead you have to transfer into another body or you will die. As you bring down the health of these parasites that have taken over New York City a yellow triangle will flash over them that lets you transfer into them and do massive damage. This is essential to winning most boss fights. You just run around blasting everything with traditional military weapons, but at least you can upgrade them. Adding more power, accuracy, and various other things requires points that you acquire through completing levels. There are a plethora of weapons in the game from handguns to rocket launchers. It's nothing special and I wish there were more unique weapons. The combat is fun at first but gets tiringly repetitive as you get further in.Every level nearly plays the same. You blast through parasites, transfer through bodies, then fight a boss. Some times you have to destroy nodes to advance, but it stops being fun less than half way through. The bosses are extraordinarily tough and you will die dozens of times. If you shoot stuff long enough you get Overdrive which allows you to do massive damage, but there's a weird pause between every few shots and it wastes precious time. Some bosses I died on dozens of times and nearly gave up -- they have multiple life bars and if you don't beat them a certain way you never will.The action never lets up, but the pacing is so poorly balanced. You get a good run through a level then suddenly are have to run from some unbeatable monster. The platforming is atrocious and even climbing ladders can be hard. I died multiple times because of how linear the levels are and I just couldn't maneuver properly. The game could have been one of the last great PSP games if it just had more polish. The graphics are fantastic with some great lighting effects and good-looking textures. There are just too many issues for this to be considered one of the PSP's best.Overall,  The 3rd Birthdayhas a lot of amazing aspects and ideas, but they fall flat because they weren't fleshed out all the way. The platforming sucks, the game is just too damn hard, and it's overly linear. The story is an unfocused mess, but at least the game looks amazing and the controls are great. The shooting feels good as well and there's a lot of customizable features. It just needs more polish, but what's here is worth a rental or cheap bargain bin price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2013"}

Looks great, sounds great.It plays, on the other hand, not so great as Resident Evil 4, which it borrows heavily from, in terms of overall look and design. Unlike RE4, however, you are stuck with a AI 'partner' who doesn't have very sophisticated AI. Give her a rocket launcher and she'll still hammer away at a hard target with her pistol, and if you're in her way, she'll stay behind you and shoot your back. More options for how to use her would have been helpful. The 9 slot inventory system is a disaster, IMO.  Having to swap items with your partner  during a firefight doesnt work well at all.Oh, and the racism.. IMO, one has to wonder if issues of racism have been hyped up just to create controversy around an otherwise average game to increase sales. Since your partner is black and some (1 out of 4, usually) white zombies are mixed in to the horde of enemies, there's no clear context of slandering Africa.. EXCEPT for one 'mud hut/spear chucking natives level' that was really pretty godawful.But the real problem with this game, though, was not any of the above, because the game is easy enough that it moves quickly and cinematically... the big problem is this game just doesnt't deliver the SCARES.  At all.  If you've played 4, you already know every trick they're going to hit you with. Games that redefine the genre are ones that go back to the drawing board and look for new ways to excite, or scare. It's not happening, here.But, if you've never tried the RE series and are looking for something light that looks amazing, then give it a shot.

Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play. However you choose to hero your way throughHalo: Combat Evolved, the action should break in your new Xbox in explosive style.","reviewerName":"bayou_hannibal \"bayou_hannibal\"","summary":"What's so great about Halo?","reviewText":"If you were like me, then you have heard about what a great game Halo is, but you couldn't figure out what was so great about it or what made it so special.  It first glance, it looks so ordinary.  You look at the box and see that you are fighting a bunch of aliens with laser guns and assault rifles.  Sounds like a cliche doesn't it?  But what is so great about this game is that it is just really fun to play.  It gets all of the little things right.  Halo isn't innovative as far as setting and storyline go, but it is a big breakthrough as far as gameplay goes.  (Gameplay, remember that?) Even during the mind-numblingly repetitive spots, it still manages to be somewhat fun.Here are five reasons why Halo is a great game:1.  Weapon balance - every weapon in the game is useful, and none are overpowered.  Every weapon has at least one advantage, and one disadvantage.  The pistol is accurate at long range, which gives it an advantage over the assault rifle, which is lethal, but only at a short range.  The plasma rifle is good for taking down shields, but can't hold much ammo, and the rocket launcher is very powerful, but also slow to reload.  You can only carry two weapons, but you will frequently find yourself changing them out for various situations.  The fact that all of them are useful gives you all sorts of ways to fight differently.2.  Fantastic AI.  The aliens in the game (called &quot;The Covenant&quot;) give you some very smart enemies to fight.  They will use cover to let their shields regenerate and if you are trying to run them over in a vehicle, they will dive out of the way.  They will also use grenades sometimes to flush you out, as well as try to rush you and/or outflank you.  Sometimes they will jump onto nearby turrets or vehicles.  Not only do the enemies have great AI, but so do your marine teammates.  This all makes for some very exciting battles, which never quite play out the same twice.3.  The game actually makes you use your skills and tactics, instead of memorizing where enemies are scripted to ambush you.  I love this aspect.  There are very few surprises in Halo.  Winning battles requires skillful use of cover, smart weapon selection, and good use of grenades too.  I am kind of spoiled now, because every other first-person shooter (except for maybe Serious Sam) seems inferior in this area.  Most games require you to abuse the &quot;quick save&quot; key in order to get through the game.4.  In Halo, you are always moving forward.  The game just flows so fast.  This is due in large part to the regenerating shields mechanic, which is being copied by lots of other games.  This simple innovation means that you can fight 15 or 20 battles without losing any health, as long as you are smart when you fight them.  Thus, you don't have to backtrack all afternoon for a powerup.  In addition, the game throws lots of ammo your way, so you don't have to spend much time scavenging for it.5.  Halo has vehicles and turrets seamlessly integrated into the game.  There are vehicles scattered throughout the game that you can get into and use to mow down your enemies or fly around and blast them from the sky.  When you get into the jeep, marine squadmates will jump in with you and take the gunner positions.  The vehicles in this game are so much fun.  Sometimes the best way to defeat a group of enemies is to drive around the perimeter and let your gunner blast away at them.6.  Surprise, surprise, grenades are not only useful, but crucial to surviving the game.  This is thanks to a separate hotkey just for throwing grenades.  You can be firing your assault rifle and throw a quick grenade, and then fire your rifle some more.  You don't have to switch weapons to throw grenades, so they become that much more useful.  This is another very simple innovation that substantially changes the gameplay.OK I lied, that was 6 reasons.  There are actually more, like the wonderful soundtrack, which makes the game's big battles so memorable.  Lots of people dislike Halo's repetitiveness, especially towards the end.  The infamous &quot;Library&quot; level gets pretty boring, but this is still really a great game despite being two years old and having some technical problems.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2004"}

Covino","summary":"Best game I played in a LONG time","reviewText":"This has got to be one of the best games I have ever played.What makes this game so wonderful is not in how it is played, but in how it follows the script. The huge world of the Colossus will overwhelm the imagination with wonder, as you gallop your way on horseback to multiple destinations in hunt for each gigantean monster: Up and down scaling mountainsides; across expanse fields; in between dark valleys; cutting through dense forest; bustling through immense deserts. And as you slowly come to know this mysterious, mystical, but somehow ominous world, you will encounter remnants of previous human dwellings, such as the ruins of ancient temples carved out of the bellies of mountains, particles of arched bridges perched above the surface of calm, lifeless waters, shrines, sacrificial altars on cliff sides, mysterious pillars laid out upon grassy hills. The land is so dismal and dreary in its lack of inhabitants and unattended buildings that it is a pictorial definition of what it is to be Godforsaken and Desolate. You cannot help but feel you are in a world that rejects your presence and condemns interaction with humanity in it's entirety. All you hear throughout your journey in this vast region is the hooves of your horse hitting the gravel as it runs and the wind whistling through the canyons. We are talking about a game hammering the highest degree of style. I mean, my God, what an experience.Aside from the mysterious and haunting locales within this vast landscape, there is the Colossi themselves to top off the brilliance of this inspiring game. There is nothing quite like the feeling of finding one. All are well hidden. They lay silent and dormant within the deepest parts of the rocky canyons. Some hide within the ruins of cities forgotten by time. Some within the earth. And some, beneath your feet, in water or in ground. No matter where they hide or how frustratingly long it takes you to find one, you will be awestruck with your encounters with them. They are huge, like walking mountains. The first time you encounter one you will always find some difficulty in defeating it. They are challenging in such a way that you will be forced to approach each Colossi with a different method of conquering it. The threat of death is not really an issue here, since most of their attacks are easily avoided. Jumping and climbing is key to winning most of the battles. You often must use the environment around you to distract them or expose their vulnerabilities. A great mix of puzzle solving and action, I thought. Although I wish the Colossi had more theme songs, the songs they DO have are performed brilliantly and I have yet to grow tired of them. They coincide with the epic battles perfectly.Story-wise, this game seems simple at first, until you match it to what happens at the rather long ending (stay tuned even after the credits). It will put you in a position, as another reviewer had previously stated, where you don't know what is good or bad. I will not spoil it for you, but I understand now why some people have admitted to coming close to crying and why forums on the internet have been made to discuss the true nature of our hero, the girl and the Colossi themselves. Evidently, I am not the only one who sympathized for the poor beasts.My biggest, and probably only complaint I have with this game is its stack of unanswered questions. Yes, the mystique may play a vital role in the quality of your gaming experience, but the curiosity is just too much. I would have liked at least a quick draft of the land's history and why so many of these buildings lay scattered in ruins and empty. I now understand the Colossi and what they are and why they attempt to kill (I had to study the game's ending to obtain this answer; typical Japanese story-telling is almost always inconclusive and leaves an array of possibilities for the viewer to consider). Maybe the game could have been better if the land had included other forms of intelligent life such as other lonesome travelers, or maybe a reclusive tribe, or perhaps an alien race. Could have worked if done right, I think.But overall, this is almost a perfect game. I played through it three times since I got it a week ago. I am not recommending this game, I am telling you that you need to buy it now. That way, if it gets popular enough, they can make a sequel.PS: By the way, the game ICO seems to hold a lot of relevance to this game, acting as a form of sequel. I myself have not played it, or even knew about it until I read what people were saying about this one. I ordered ICO from an Amazon merchant and it should be arriving shortly!

This review is in reference to the XBOX version.Prince of Persia the video game was released in its very first incarnation 17 years ago for the 8bit Apple II series personal computer.  Players were wowed with its fresh style of game play that used acrobatics and swashbuckling to solve action based puzzles and aid you on your way though the stages.  You didn't have projectile weapons to blast enemies from a distance, just your agility, wit and trusty sword for intense close quarters combat. Other games in the same vein came soon after to create a series, however, not until The Sands of Time did the Prince of Persia truly begin to rule.You play as the  young Prince.  The story begins as your naivet? and your attraction to the alluring dark magic dagger force you foolishly claim it as your own. As a result, you unwittingly unleash the sands of time along with a deadly evil. You must now right the wrong you have created by seeking and destroying all of the evil creatures you released and recollecting the sands of time from their fallen corpses.You will acquire new strengths and abilities as you collect the sands.  These abilities will allow you to control time itself.  You will be able to slow time to gain an advantage over your enemies and even reverse time to make second attempts when you fail to conquer an obstacle (or face your death).  In addition to these temporal abilities the prince possesses cat-like acrobatic skills, such running on walls and incredible fighting skills all combined to make a truly powerful being.The game is beautiful, amazingly beautiful.  I had never seen a game that looked so soft and inviting while at the same time evil and menacing.  The environments are lush, expansive and richly detailed. The game play is very fluid with a comprehensive combat system that just feels right and is loads of fun to use.  This is one of the rare games that you simply cannot stop playing until you reach the end. Utterly superb!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2006"}

It's entire life the Wii had hits and misses. Some games geared towards hardcore gamers and some geared toward the masses.The last hurrah for the hardcore fans is arguably one of the best RPGs created for any system this generation.Graphically, it's one of the best on the Wii. Sure, that's not saying a lot compared to a PS3 or 360 game, but in terms of the Wii, it doesn't get much better than this.The music is fantastic as well. I wish, instead of the launch edition coming with an artbook it came with the soundtrack instead, but such is life.The battles are real time, so it's more action oriented on an RPG level. I don't mind as I really do like to mix up real time RPGs and turn based. And honestly, there aren't many truly great (to me) RPGs of either style being released these days, so when one as good as The Last Story is released, I savor it.One thing I don't like is not having the option to listen to the dialog in the original Japanese language. I prefer my games the way I prefer my movies - in the original language. Yes, you can argue that English text isn't the way the game was designed, and you're right. My thing is, try to keep it as original as possible and still understandable. I do understand a lot of spoken Japanese and I use opportunities like this to keep it fresher than it would be otherwise.And don't get me wrong, the voice acting is very, very good! The British English accents actually give a game set in a medieval setting a more authentic feel. In comparison to American English, having never really had the middle ages like in Europe I mean.This is a great game. It's unfortunate Nintendo didn't bother to see fit to release it properly, but it's an amazing boon that XSeed took the chance and brought the game over. My understanding is that this is a code copy of the European version, which is fine with me.If you're an action RPG fan, still have a Wii and want a great game, you'll want to check this out.

WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws.

If the mass media gets a hold of this game like they did GTA3, there will no doubt be a collective outcry from parents groups, conservatives and other general naysayers with a microphone and an opinion.  Unfortunately, I don't think this game is good enough to warrant that kind of attention.Like a lot of people, I was really looking forward to this game.  While I don't own GTA3 (I'm waiting for the Xbox version) I have lots of friends who do, and I have to admit it's a fantastic game.  It's huge open-ended, versatile and has that nihilistic charm that truly makes it a guilty pleasure.  Unfortunately, SoE, has all the nihilism and little of the charm.Everyone has wanted to fight the power and stick it to the man at least once in their lives, and for that primal urge, this game does provide a welcome catharsis.  It is fun to run around in Chaos mode with wild abandon, beating people down, smashing windows and blowing stuff up, but eventually you have to take in the fact that the graphics are really shoddy (I'm assuming with the huge crowd constantly in circulation, the developers had to sacrifice quality) and the gameplay is really monotonous.  I have to say the biggest flaw of all is the lack of multiplayer.  This could have really been a saving grace for the game.  The whole idea of mob mentality is COMPLETELY LOST in a single player game. It seems so obvious to me that I have to wonder what the developers were thinking.  It's the difference between anarchy and stupidity.Also, I hate to sound like one of the groups I was kind of shelling earlier, but the mindless violence concept of this game seems a lot less fun in a post-911 world. I'm definitely an anti-censorship kinda guy, but anyone buying this game for their young kid should question their skills as a parent. It's made for mature audiences and only us old guys need apply (though once you start playing the game I doubt you'll feel very &quot;mature&quot;)  I think I would have enjoyed this game much better a year ago.I also might have liked this game better as a rental, but lack of a rental outlet where I live means I get burned more than I'd lke to admit. If you can rent this game and feel the absolute need to satisfy your curiosity RENT, DON'T BUY.  Take that one piece of advice above anything else I've written here.

The first RPG I ever played was Mario RPG: LEgend of the seven stars, a game that is considered a masterpiece to this day. The game that solidified my love for the RPG genre was final fantasy 7, which remains one of my favorites to this day. I have played and beaten final fantasy 6,7,8,9,and 10. I hated 12 and 13. I've played and beaten kingdom hearts 1 and 2, chrono trigger, paper mario 1,2, and super. I have run through every fire emblem game I can find, and with all that being said, Nier is STILL my favorite RPG of all time.Nier is the story of Nier and his daughter Yonah, who is afflicted with the incurable disease, the black scrawl. In his pursuit to find a cure, Nier comes across the ancient, and very funny talking book, Grimoire Weiss. Together they set off to find the sealed verses that hold the key to saving the life of Nier's daughter.The relationship between Nier and Yonah is different from most relationships in gaming. Nier is a hard working, loving father, who will do everything in his power to see his daughter healed. They live in an idealic village full of kind hearted people, who care for Yonah while Nier is away searching for a cure, and are not shy about asking for favors.An important note is that to get the full experience, you NEED to play through this game at least twice. This game features a new game plus that drops you at the halfway point of the game the second time through, and unveils the second side of the story. This adds depth and context to the game that most of the professional reviewers missed. Nier has one of the most affecting and heart wrenching stories I've ever had the privilege of playing, and it demands to be experienced.Throughout the game, you have the option to take sidequests for the people of your village, and later the residents of other towns,in exchange for money. Many critics have complained of the repetitive nature of many of the quests. I myself enjoyed them, and there are many quests that have humorous and sometimes tragic story lines attached to them.The biggest gripe that nearly every professional reviewer had against this amazing game is that the graphics aren't very good. This is a non issue for me. I personally enjoy Niers graphics. They are clean, bright and uncomplicated. One of my favorite games of all time is final fantasy tactics; a truly hideous game, with a terrible story, but some of the most enjoyable gameplay of its kind. Nier trades flashy, pointless graphics for wide open spaces and lightning fast loading times; a trade I with more games would be willing to make.The gameplay is solid. Nier is not turnbased, but more hack and slash. Nier does what you tell him to do, when you tell him to do it; you really can't ask for much more. The physical attacks are pretty simple, but it is the magic attacks that are spectacular. From launching multiple magical spears to forming an enormous hand to crush your foes, the magic attacks are numerous and varied. Nier moves quickly, and even has double jump, making traveling and exploration hassle free. The Boss battles are fun and varied. They do a good job of mixing up the boss encounters. Very rarely will a boss fight devolve into hit and run tactics, which is a good thing.The characters Nier and Weiss are terrific company, and you will never be bored. Their witty banter is dotted throughout the game, and they have a lot to say. I often found myself smiling and laughing along with them, which is rare. The strongest point in this game though has to be the music. Never before have I been so entranced by a games soundtrack that I put the controller down so I could listen to it without any ambient noise to get in the way. Some people have complained about the endless musical loops that inhabit each area, but when the music is this amazing, I doubt many people mind.All in all, Nier is the complete package. The graphics are clean and effective. The gameplay is fun and efficient. The characters are fleshed out and engaging. The story is depp, complex, and moving. The music is breathtakingly beautiful. Most importantly the game is a joy to play; it gets my highest recommendation. Do yourself a favor and buy this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2011"}
{"product_name":"B004QEV0MI","description":"","reviewerName":"postman","summary":"Great Game","reviewText":"I played the first 30 minutes of this game and decided to do a review of it. This game is awesome. Just as simple as that.I have never played a saints row game before so I was a little weary about getting this game (which is why I rented it), so when I decided to get it after reading a few professional reviews I decided to try it out. The game seems to be more closely related to GTA: San Andreas, but just crazier. Since I never played other saints row games before I can only compare this game to san andreas (I played GTA4 but didnt play much of it cuz I didnt like it).If you liked san andreas this game shouldn't be much of a problem since its so similar. You start off the game with max health and unlimited ammo. I'm not gonna say what your doing, you just have to see for yourself. After doing that mission, you get to create your own guy or girl although they only get one outfit at first. You can buy more after a few missions.This game, unlike previous GTA games has a \"respect level\" system that you earn as you progress thru the game. You earn points as you play the main missions, side missions, killing people, driving on the wrong side of the road, etc. The respect points have a max level of 50 so after that you stop getting points. Those points can be used only to unlock upgrades that you have to still buy after being unlocked. The upgrades can be used for health, weapons, abilities and such. It a nice system and works well. I dont know if the harder you set the difficulty the more points you earn happens or not but you can level up pretty quickly if you have a strategy guide. If you max everything out, however, which will take a long time, you will be practically invincible and have unlimited ammo for most weapons.The controls are straight forward. I have to get used to switching weapons in this game though. You have to press and hold \"b\" and use the left thumb stick to select a weapon. I'm sure with some pratice I will get the hang of it. Driving a vehicle in this game is kind of jaggy to me but its no big deal.There are 3 difficulties: easy, normal and hard. You can also do co-op as well if you like but I always play alone. There is also an online feature for this game too but I dont play online with any games.Since this game is very similar to san andreas then you should already know that violence is what makes this game work. Lots of cursing in the movie clips, which are pretty good by the way with good voice acting, gore, lots of shooting (of course), the works. The graphics are good too.Of course the main purpose of this game is to have fun and it delivers. I had so much fun playing this game and the thing is I was not even 1% complete with the game yet. I wont spoil the fun part of whats really involved, you have to play the game yourself to find out but if you liked San andreas then you probably will like this too. Rent it first though.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2012"}

If you like the gameplay of the Gears series, you will probably like this game.  The story is decent and the game flows as well as the others.  There's good replay value and tons of score points to earn.  You can also earn Stars which, after 40, will unlock an extra campaign chapter titled Aftermath.  Aftermath is a side story that goes along with the GOW3 storyline.  Throughout Judgment, you switch players as each individual tells their story of what happened.  Your main character is Baird though and you even get to play as a younger, and less cocky, Cole.  Each character is equally fun to play as.  In each mission you also have the choice to play the regular version or the 'Declassified' version, which will limit time, weapons, etc., and help you gain Stars more quickly.  I played the missions about half and half.  Some of the Declassified versions were a little too hard for my taste but more hardcore gamers will love the challenge.  Overall, there's enough here to satisfy any Gears fans, unless they're just too nit-picky.  For me, this is not quite as good as GOW3 but right up there with GOW2, and more fun than the original.  The price isn't too bad now, as well, so I suggest you give it a shot.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2014"}

I was between consoles when GTA3 was released, but seeing all the hub-bub, I decided to pick up the new GTA:VC.This game rocks.I graduated from high school in 1986, and this game pays a great homage to that time period. Driving insanely fast in a Lambourghini, doing drive-bys, all while listening to Judas Priest delivers an adrenaline rush like no other game. It's kitschy in the best way.The graphics are okay. I wish there were a bit more interactivity with the environment. I wish you didn't immediately drown whenever you end up in the water. I wish the fighting controls were more responsive (and less frustrating). But the city is huge, there are tons of things to do, and lots of places to explore. The driving controls are pretty great, too. Big lumbering vehicle sure feel large and lumbering.Plus, I wish I were better at it, because I'm anxious to unlock the second half of the city and do all the other exciting stuff I've been only reading about (fly copters, planes, boats, etc.)I've already lost way too much sleep playing this game. I like it more than SOCOM.I also wish there were a 1980's-style video arcade hidden in the city, where I could play old coin-ops.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2002"}
{"product_name":"B0000696CZ","reviewerName":"Jewels \"bookgrrl\"","summary":"Shockingly Overrated...","reviewText":"When Grand Theft Auto: Vice City came out, I was working at a retail store.  I couldn't believe how people were calling non-stop and asking me, &quot;Do you have any more.&quot;  The answer was usually, &quot;No.  You'll have to wait for the NEXT shipment, it sells too fast.&quot;  This of course is a sign for a good game, so I had to try it out for myself.At first, I found this game entertaining.  You can beat up anybody on the street, pick up any vehicle, (car, van, truck, bus, ect) and follow along on the story mode.  Running into stuff, blowing the vehicle up, and running from cops can even be fun at times.  I was amused by all of these qualities.  However, after a while it seemed like a chore to play the game.When I actually tried to get somewhere in the game, I found a few tedious features.  First of all, people on the street many times JUMPED or LEAPED in front of my car.  After a while this got annoying because then the cops would blame me and I would be chased around.  This got old fast, because I wasn't even trying to do anything wrong.  Many of the missions got extremely difficult, causing me to have to keep retrying.  After a while, it just was pointless.Another thing, is that the graphics are not as impressive as they could of been.  The same graphics used in GTA:3 were also used in Vice City.  This could be backed up by saying, &quot;Well GTA: Vice City, is not GTA:4.&quot;  But I still believe that graphics could've been more improved because of the year it came out.Overall, the gameplay is pretty good.  You are actually free in this game to do as you wish.  I think that the controls when shooting or punching were pretty bad, but I still have fun for a while.  This game is definately not for everyone.  I found it wasn't for me.  That's why I think it was too overrated.  Sure it's good, has great qualities, and is a sequel to a well known series of games, but it just didn't live up to the hype.Pros: Fun gameplay for a whileNon-linear.

{"product_name":"B000EGELP0","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"It's Not a Brain Pain","reviewText":"The Premise of Brain Age is pretty unique.  What this does is allow you to solve puzzles and exercise your brain everyday.  It is supposed to help improve the aspect of which you apply knowledge.  The game will even measure for you.  This is fine, and an interesting idea, but there are some parts of it that don't work out well enough.  The game overall isn't really bad, it's just not what you'd expect from a puzzle game.It's fairly simple.  The game presents puzzles for you to solve everyday.  Everything you do is kept in a file for you, and the game will also track your progress so you'll be able to see if you're getting better or worse. The game will also tell you your brain age.The good thing about the game is if you're a DS owner looking for a game that uses the touch screen, this truly is the game for you.  Everything you do with this game will involve the touch screen.  You also hold the DS sideways.  It's a little strange at first, but overall, it's not so bad.  In fact, it's fairly easy to get adapted to.There are a unique set of puzzles to do.  You start off nice and easy and then it begins to get harder.  You'll have puzzles that'll ask you to remember the place of certain numbers on a grid, test how fast you can read and a few other things.  There aren't a whole lot of puzzles, really, and you can't tackelt them all at once.  The game will make sure you can't do so.  So while there aren't a lot of puzzles, the game doesn't present them all to you out front.There are two things Brian Age has that might really get one's attention.  For starters, the game comes with Sudoku puzzles.  Second, the game can be played with up to fifteen people on a single card.  To be honest, the game is fairly addictive.  You'll find yourself doing puzzles and such again just to see if you can beat your high score.  This makes the game addicting, but I can't help but admit that it gets repetative fast.  There really could've been more puzzles to pursue.The game is entirely reliable on the touch screen.  This is part of where one of the problems with the game comes into play.  The game will ask you to write out a few solutions.  If you're like me, your handwriting isn't good.  Put simple, the game might not recognize some of your answers.  You might have the right answer, but the game can't \"read\" your handwriting and so you're penalized for it.  The voice recognition isn't perfect either.  Your pronounciation is of the utmost importance.  Even if you say a word correctly, the game might not \"hear\" you correctly.It's a great game for puzzle fans, at least.  It isn't the best puzzle game out there, but it's a unique game.  One that doesn't come around very often.  Fans of puzzle games ought to love this.  Who knows for sure whether it's really aging your brain or not though?The Good+Innovative+Those who love the touch screen will be in love with this game+To some extent, it's addictive+Being able to play with others is pretty coolThe Bad-There aren't a whole lot of puzzles-The game can't always \"read\" your handwriting-The game can't always \"hear\" you very well","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

Np pinkies, no cacodemons, no barons( no their not), no hell-knights, no spider demons, to aracnatrons, no rooms full of monsters to blast down, the weapons again look like an Alien movie not Doom except the chainsaw,  the controls are not near as good as classic doom or quake causing the multiplayer to be pretty much useless,  id just could never get to that level of greatness again.  I mean look how how butchered the Quake series is since Quake 1.

On his 21st birthday, the Darkness awakens within Jackie Estacado, a mafia hitman for the Franchetti crime family.","reviewerName":"Jack R. Tallent","summary":"Bravo! The Darkness is a truly fun and engrossing game!","reviewText":"I was so very pleasantly surprised by The Darkness.It seems that games that rise to the level of being engrossing and compelling are few and far between. In fact, not since Deus Ex have I played a game that really drew me in, and had me playing around WITH the game, like it was a toy. On the XBOX 360, there are really only a couple of must-own games at this point. Gears of War is one of them, sure, and, in my opinion, so is Oblivion.Now you can add The Darkness to that list.I had a lot of fun playing The Darkness, and, at times, it came close to the kind of experience I had with Deus Ex (which, for better or worse, I hold up as the gold standard in this genre).  Besides being fun to play with, this game continually wows you with its attention to detail and the level of thought that went into its design.Here are just a few of the elements and details that make this game so impressive:-The VOICE ACTING in The Darkness is simply the best I have seen in a video game, bar none. So good is the voice acting, that you find your self marveling at it. Everyone from the hero Jackie to Jimmy the Grape (oh man I loved Jimmy the Grape) is superbly performed.-One of the first things you notice is the little vignettes you watch during the LEVEL LOADING. The designers utilize what would otherwise be \"dead time\" to actually add to the atmosphere of the game.-LEVEL DESIGN is fantastic. You spend a good deal of time in NYC subways in this game, and they really look like the real deal (admittedly simplified). I found myself more than once admiring the rendering of the stairs and signs down in the subways. Just one of many great touches is the subway information kiosks (not authentic!) which are a clever way of quickly orienting to where you need to go. The NYC street levels are equally great, and very detailed. You will find yourself just walking around and looking. Then when you get the Demon Arm, and discover you can move cars and dumpsters...-NO ARTIFICIAL HUDs. Information in this game is, for the most part, presented in a \"realistic\" manner. One example already given is the info kiosks in the subways (you get an authentic NYC voice giving you directions). Another example is the level of your Darkness Powers, which are indicated by visual cues in the power manifestation.-COLLECTIBLES AND BONUS MATERIAL. Adding the collectibles to this game was a great move. Basically, this is analogous to the Cog Tags in Gears of War, giving you an incentive to completely explore all the environment spaces. The new twist here is that such collecting not only scores achievements, but also unlocks bonus materials such as comics, videos, and production art. Very slick. One of the two types of collectible items is phone numbers, and you unlock the bonus materials by finding a telephone and calling the number. When you do, you get a unique and superbly acted answering machine message, many of which are comical or disturbing. I loved every one.-DARKNESS POWERS. The Darkness Powers are the main game play \"gimmick\" of The Darkness, sort of like Bullet Time in Max Payne. You quickly figure out that the powers are pretty much what you use all the time, instead of, say, guns. There are a good number of conventional weapons available, but you end up not caring about them much. The two coolest Darkness Powers are 1) Creeping Dark and 2) Demon Arm. The Creeping Dark allows you to \"remotely\" explore your surroundings with a great deal of freedom, including climbing walls and getting into small spaces. This expanded freedom almost compels you to see what you can do with it, and you find yourself experimenting to see exactly where you can go. You can, of course, attack with the Creeping Dark, and in the beginning you do that a lot. The Demon Arm is great because you can pick up almost anything and throw it. Pretty far if you want. So, you realize that you can stack cars up on top of each other, or throw dumpsters at people, so you spend a great deal of time just screwing around like that. Oh yeah, you can also attack people and knock out lights with The Demon Arm. (But it's really for making a really big pile of cars.)There are a number of surprises in the game, which I will not go into for obvious reasons. Suffice it to say that there is even more to recommend this game that what has been mentioned, and, like the rest, it is very well done.Complaints? Quibbles? Only a few, really. NO game is perfect. Maybe my biggest gripe is that the final level & ending was very unsatisfying. In fact, I was sure that there was a better ending I could achieve. It turns out that's just how it ends. On the upside, the ending makes it clear that this is just a first chapter in what should be a truly great series of games. Other than that, the quibbles become truly minor. I thought the Darklings didn't really contribute much to game play, but maybe that was just me. Even so, they do add some entertainment.All in all, The Darkness is GREAT. If you own a 360, you should own this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2007"}
{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","summary":"Great","reviewText":"It was very refreshing to play The Last of Us as it was so well made, so good looking and so realistic. There's a lot to praise about this game.Most people know the story by now - you play as Joel, survivor in a future world where almost all human beings have been killed or turned into zombies by a strange infection. The humans that survive are 75 % criminals, 20% law enforcement, and 5% nice, normal people like you and me. Joel takes on a job, which is to escort a young girl named Ellie across the country, so the main game play is the two of you exploring destroyed cityscapes, towns, settlements and so on, while trying to avoid zombie monsters and aggressive gangsters.Playing style is 3rd person, a bit like Uncharted to a large degree (unsurprisingly), and the gameplay goes something like this: Arrive at a new area, Explore new area looking for hidden items. Realise that a major part of the level or route is blocked by a big gang of monsters or outlaws. Work out how to get past them. Get past them. End with cut scene containing shocking violence or tear jerking sacrifice. Rinse and repeat. That sounds mean but if you look at things with hindsight, that really does sum up most of the game. However it is definitely FUN - in capitals! A lot of the levels can be traversed by relying on stealth, although you can fight your way through areas if you prefer but this is much harder. There are plenty of ways to experiment. Enemies react differently all the time and the tables can be turned very easily, one wrong move or being spotted can ruin 20 minutes of silent creeping and send you back to a checkpoint. Checkpoints are plentiful and invisible, but nearly always well placed.Things vary slightly with a few surprises - sometimes the duo are separated and you play as Ellie. Towards the end of the game Ellie has a very gruesome encounter by herself and a solo boss fight, all of which is effective and nasty - this is a very violent game, and the 18 certificate is earned. Other variety comes from a bit of underwater swimming, a general item collection checklist, but basically the gameplay is very consistent. A special note must be added about the prologue - a short section played with Joel in a time set just BEFORE the infection changed the world forever. It's amazing, dramatic and very moving.But mostly what I was hoping for - based on what Uncharted was like - and what the game absolutely does deliver, is the superior look of it. Breathtaking, is a word I would use in some cases. Scenery is simply stunning, Characters look real, They move like real people and the vocal acting is amazing. Ellie and Joel are so lifelike, you'd have to be made of stone not to feel something for them. Some of the areas are huge and where there are shops and houses that you can find a way into, there is simply so much to explore. The residential suburbs where a lot of the houses can be entered is a snooper's paradise! A lot of the time I just wanted to look at all the stuff that was on show. It must have taken a phenomenal amount of work to put all of this together, and I appreciate it.I have no surprise criticisms to reveal. I enjoyed all of this game and only wish it had been longer. I think anyone who tries it will be similarly hooked.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2013"}

In desperation, the Soviets created a time-travel device that they've used to assassinate Albert Einstein before he is able to develop the weapon technology the Allies later use to defeat the Soviets. Upon returning, they notice a new world, and there is a world war taking place between three groups for control of the world.Play As Three Different Factions for Varied game playIn Red Alert 3, you have the choice to play as the Allies, the Soviets, or the Empire of the Rising Sun. Each faction has its own story-line and distinct units with advantages and disadvantages that you have to master in order to win. The new faction to the series is the Empire of the Rising Sun, derived from Imperial Japan, with an all-new cast of units and characters.The three factions have many differences, exemplified by their wildly different types of units. The Soviets, for example, have armored attack bears, Allies have the Dolphin ship which can high jump and use a sonic attack, and the Empire of the Rising Sun features such quirky units as a giant transforming mecha and ninjas. As they've done with the series, EA injects humor into the game when possible, keeping a smile on your face as you wage war.Fight on Land, in the Air, and on SeaRed Alert 3 has land units, air units, and naval units, all integral parts of the game. Unlike most strategy games that don't bother with naval warfare, Red Alert 3 makes controlling the seas an essential part of the game. Controlling resources in the seas and mounting attacks from all directions are strategies that must be employed to achieve victory.Cooperative Mode Lets You Team Up with Your FriendsRed Alert 3 has a fully co-operative campaign mode where you and a friend can play together to achieve victory. This means that you have to develop a strategy together, as well as execute it in synch in order to win. If your friends aren't online, you can also choose one of several AI commanders as your teammate.Play Against Your Friends in MultiplayerWith the different units and play mechanics of each faction, you and your friends will have a great time playing against each other, perfecting different strategies to best suit the units you have and the maps you play on. And thanks to the balanced game play, no one will have an unfair advantage.For previous fans of Command and Conquer, Red Alert 3 will provide the same light-hearted game play, but with more units, more strategies, and more fun.

(2)","reviewText":"This is precisely the sort of sequel expected from the Red Alert franchise.First I should say that I read early regarding development, and heard that the game would \"play up the silliness\" in design.That immediately turned me off from it, as Red Alert was so blunt, unpolished, bleak, and gritty as to be a frightening game for its time with the mix of a shockingly realistic Joseph Stalin in cutscenes, and a seemingly brutal AI in a game that never allowed for cheating or difficulty adjustment beyond that at the start of the campaign.Red Alert 2, in comparison, upped the \"silliness\" to a point of complete cheeseballs, and was a huge disappointment to many fans.At the very least, stupid cartoonyness aside, I thought Red Alert 2 was great.And so Red Alert 3 manages not to go overboard with playing up the \"silliness\", but it does come off as a cartoony sort of game in Red Alert 2 style.  The video cutscenes are of course sharp and beautifully acted, and while at first I was disappointed in the choice of well-known actors (Tim Curry in particular), I've found that they produce some of the best characters for the game.Tim Curry is the first believable Russian Premier of the series, holding little of the terrifying dread of Joseph Stalin, or the Russian-style \"engrish\" and goofball antics of Alexei Romanov in Red Alert 2, but making his own Russian Premier, a clear-cut and defined character who could be a legitimately real person.  George Takei has clear authority and gravitas as the Emperor, and his grand declaration on the Russians of Japan's divine mandate to conquer is overwhelming.The gameplay itself is nothing really special, something much of the same sorts as seen in Command and Conquer Generals (I haven't played C&C; 3 so I can't judge there), with a vast improvement in graphics since Generals, but still a sense of slower-moving action (not just from graphics overload).The gameplay as well is very much a balanced sort of cartoonishness which at one moment even managed to convince me that it was normal to see Russian conscripts marching alongside a trained scout bear and a series of tanks that walk like spiders (Soviet Stingrays) to attack Japanese samurai with lightsaber-like swords.While the game itself is terribly average, and barely an improvement from Command & Conquer: Generals, the mere presentation of it---the menu design, the epic soundtrack by Frank Klepacki, the cutscenes and acting---manage to hook me and keep me wanting to hear and see more in between each mission.UPDATE: Storyline.I won't post any spoilers and any details on it save for one.Like I mentioned on an ignored discussion page here, the game brings up a highly interesting plot element involving Dr. Zelinski contacting the player in all three campaigns, mentioning the Soviet Premier having travelled back in time to change the future/present.  In the Soviet campaign, he randomly disappears for no reason after telling you this.  In the Allied campaign, no one cares except when he tells them about a Soviet base on Cuba.  Only in the Japanese campaign does anyone seem to care about what Zelinski is saying, and by the end it doesn't even matter anymore.Zelinski's message involves a supposed 'break-down' of the time-space continuum.  And yet after all the campaigns, not only is this idea not expanded on in the least, it is practically completely ignored.  If anyone remembers Yuri's Revenge, a 'break-down' of the time-space continuum caused by Einstein lead to a \"merging\" of the two timelines, causing Yuri to be destroyed and General Carville to come back to life in the \"true\" timeline.Another highly interesting plot point completely ignored is Yuriko.  Absolutely no backstory is provided on her, nor is she given a FMV actor to portray her.  There is a clear distinction between her, Yuriko the Japanese Psychic in Red Alert 3, and Yuri the Soviet Psychic in Red Alert 2, and yet this is not explored in the least in Red Alert 3.  The storyline, while on its own interesting, is a colossal disappointment in context with Red Alert and Red Alert 2.Solidly 3/5, perhaps at best 3.5/5.Oh yeah, and SECUROM~!!!!!111  RUINS THE GAME!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2008"}

Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"A Beautiful Work of Art, a Sorely Dissapointing Game","reviewText":"Amazon asks how fun is the game.  I say one star.Amazon asks how is the game overall, I say two stars.Why?Assassin's Creed was hyped so well that I ran out opening weekend to buy it.  I knew nothing about the game, the character, or even the overall purpose.  But game reviewing sites said \"10 out of 10!!\"  \"A Must-Have for next-gen console owners.\"Once again, these commentators have looked the other way in favor of advertising income and industrial \"[...] kissing.\"  Assassin's Creed is almost a 100% complete flop.The opening movies and even the game itself absolutely mesmerizes gamers with a lush, gorgeous 3D environment.  Cities are packed with citizens moving about, talking to each other, and interacting with your character.  The visuals give this game everything it needs to be a blockbuster movie.  Thus the \"overall\" two stars.  However as a game it falls far short of the mark.Gamespot.com said that there are \"tons of things to do\" in the cities of Assassin's Creed.  I found two things to do - rescue citizens and climb towers.  Both get real old real fast, the latter only remaining interesting by the stunning views provided by sometimes-dizzying heights.  The core mission aspects of the game are deplorable - they require you to pickpocket notes from conspirators, or sit on benches to eavesdrop on coversations.  Especially frustrating are missions where a fellow member of your creed asks you to make assassinations on his behalf because \"my leg hurts,\" and by the way, \"please hurry - I have to go to the market...\"  Sadly, the game wouldn't let me assassinate THAT guy...The game hypes that you can make assassinations from cover and immediately blend back into the crowd - your identity and crime never being known.  This is true, but only of random killings within the cities.  The actual target assassinations are never allowed to go that smoothly.  Chaos inevitably assumes, and you're left with a 5 minute run through town trying to lose your pursuers, only to sit on a bench and watch them run by.  If law enforcement had ever been this stupid, we'd have burned our own cities to the ground years ago.Lastly, the game requires you to sit through mind-numbingly boring narratives from other characters - both from the characters you are to assassinate, and your leader who gives you your assignments.  You have to sit through these every time, whether you have to repeat a mission, or \"go back in time\" to earn extra stats, etc.  There is no \"skip\" option.  Pair this with the requirement of collecting well over 100 flags scattered all about the map with absolutely no benefit whatsoever except to Xbox 360 owners who can earn achievements from doing so, and you end up with a game that is truely uninspired and flat-out boring.After a few hours of gameplay, I decided to wrap up the core missions of the game so as to earn the maximum Xbox 360 achievements I could, and then promptly returned the game to get the maximum trade-in value I could.Assassin's Creed is indeed a must-buy, especially if you really like games that are completely lacking in content, completely without challenge yet persistently frustrating, all wrapped up in a visual masterpiece with a pretty box.Rent it.  You'll reap all of its benefits and be tire of it before Blockbuster even wants it back.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2008"}

If you find this type of character development and management tedious, there won't be a quick end in sight for you.As with most RPGs, you begin by creating your character. You get to choose between female and male. Dwarf, Elf, or Human. Warrior, Rogue, or Mage. The only combination which isn't available is the dwarf mage. For dwarfs and elves, you can also set yourself as a poor or noble. There are different backgrounds for each of these combinations with a back-story to get you started, and occasional later storyline differences are based on \"who you are\".For example, if you're a noble dwarf, your man-servant / buddy becomes a merchant in the big city and he'll recognize you and give you a great discount. Others do not get this benefit.The core of the game is that, through whatever starting means, you join the Grey Wardens - a special world defense group who fights evil. There is a giant group of demons rising to flood through the world, and it's the Grey Wardens who stand against it. You have to unite the humans, dwarfs, elves, and mages to fight the enemy. Numerous side missions get you along the quest.The game is dialogue heavy, with all of it spoken (although you can read subtitles if you wish). You are often provided with responses which range from gently kind to humorous to nasty. Depending on your method of interacting with others, you can bring about ten companions along in your party. Each companion will respond well to a different personality. That being said, there are many times that the multiple dialogue options seem to be \"shades of gray\" and give the same results.Die-hard fans will want to play through the entire game multiple times to see how it rolls out for a poor female elf, vs a noble dwarf warrior, and so on. Each loop through could easily exceed 50 hours or more.You have about 30 save spots, so there are plenty of locations to keep track of different characters and different paths.Actions have long term consequences. Something you do early in the game can have an affect 20 hours later in gameplay, so it's not a matter of saving and then just trying \"path A\" or \"path B\".There are downloadable extra missions you can purchase, if their massive amount of content still isn't enough for you.There are a couple of bugs in the game, which are fairly exploitable, but since this isn't a multiplayer game it only affects how you play vs other friends you might be in competition with.The graphics are high quality and quite comparable to other games on modern systems. The sound is well done and the dialogue brings life to the characters. Sometimes the conversations were laugh out loud funny. That being said, you have to have an open sense of humor to appreciate some of the scenes. They do borrow from Monty Python and current movies for some of their lines.The game is generally easy to pick up and play for any gamer who has played these style of games before. They did a good job with combat controls, camera controls and general character leveling.The one caveat I have is that there is a fair amount of mature content in here - both violent and sexual. You can set your characters up for homosexual or heterosexual relationships, and simulated (clothed) sex is shown. This is NOT a game for young teens.Well recommended for mature gamers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2010"}

Video game \"dancing\" consisted of mashing your feet to certain patterns. It was fun, it was a great workout, but at the end of the day it wasn't really dancing.Then along came Just Dance, which introduced the world to dancing to popular music using \"real dance move\", the kind that you could practice at home and then wow everyone with on the dance floor. It was slightly annoying that the controller accuracy was a bit off, but the dance moves were so fun we didn't care. Just Dance 2 introduced much better motion control accuracy. Plus, it introduced the concept of \"duets\", where people could dance cool choreographed routines together. And it was another winner. Because of the popularity of Just Dance, this spawned a lot of \"copycat\" titles from Ubisoft to cash in. Dance on Broadway. Michael Jackson The Experience, Just Dance for Kids. Even Just Dance with Smurfs. They were fun, but at a certain point they started to get a bit tiring, as they were all variations of the same theme.And so, we've all been waiting to see what Ubisoft would do for an encore with Just Dance 3? Could they push the genre forward, even as copycat titles on other platforms like Dance Central on the Xbox and Everybody Dance on the PS3 encroached on their turf? I'm happy to say that Just Dance 3 pushes the platform even further and does it with great success.When you start up Just Dance, the first thing it asks is if you'll connect Just Dance to the Internet so that \"Ubisoft can learn more about the way you play to make Just Dance even more groovy\". I wasn't sure quite how to answer the question, but I figure since Just Dance doesn't use a video camera like those other systems, there wasn't too much harm in it.The opening menu, like in Just Dance 1 and 2, is delightfully simple. There are only a couple choices:1) Dance!As with the previous versions, you just right into the dancing. What I love about Just Dance 3 is that getting started is extremely simple. No silly things to take up your time like creating avatars. No adjusting of cameras or calibrating of equipment. You just shake your remote to see what \"color\" you are on the screen, and get started.You can create a profile at any time; your name is limited to 5 characters. If you don't create a profile you'll be dancing by default as \"Happy\" (as opposed to \"Sunny\").As with previous version, your job is to dance the \"mirror image\" of a colorful silhouetted on-screen figure showing you the dance moves. I'm happy to say that the motion controls are better and more accurate than ever. Granted, it still only detects the movement of one arm holding the Wii remote, so technically you could still just hurl your arm the right way to build up points. But of course the fun of the game is to get into the dance with your full body (and in fact, if you follow the choreographed moves perfectly with your whole body, your score will be better than ever). One other subtle improvement over previous versions is that the audio cues coming through the Wii remote (for example, when you hit a milestone while dancing) are much louder and clearer than before.The choreography and backgrounds are as fun and in some cases as quirky as ever. For example, in Wilson Pickett's \"Land of 1000 Dances\" you're following a dancing alligator in a fancy suit dancing in a schoolroom. And yes, you \"do the alligator\" :) If you dance well on some songs, you can see the background animate and change.As with Just Dance 1 and 2, each song has a \"technical difficulty\" indicator from one to three gears, and a \"workout intensity\" indicate from one to three drops of sweat. There are over 45 great tracks to suit everyone's tastes, and most of the songs are popular and familiar.Multiplayer is where this game really shines. There's \"Dance Crew Mode\" which is like Duet Mode, except that up to 4 players has their own independent choreography (and a chance to shine with a solo performance). There's also a \"Dance Til Dawn\" party mode where you can just start the game up and it'll cycle through songs all night, without the need to go back through menus again.2) Just SweatAs someone who follows Wii exercise titles very closely, this option was the one I was most excited about. You can choose from a \"Free Session\" (an instant fitness session for up to 4 players) or the \"7-Day Challenge\" (A selection of challenges to boost your fitness during 7 days).For \"Free Session\" You can choose from a variety of options for the kind of music to work out to, including:Speed ShuffleNon-Stop ShufflePop! Pop!Rock PartyR&B; VibesElectro SoundsJust 80'sOldies but GoodiesFancy Dress BallAround the WorldExtremeSweat AttackThere are also fantastic options for working out in a group, including:DuetsDance CrewI tried Sweat Attack, and sure enough I was sweating up a storm after just one song. The songs kept going and the more points I collected (in both Dance and Just Sweat modes), the more a \"Mojo\" meter filled up. Each time the \"Mojo Meter\" was full, it unlocked a \"gift\" of another game mode, song, or choreography (the first to be unlocked is Simon Says Mode). There are 27 \"gifts\" to unlock, which will definitely motivate you to keep coming back and building up those points. The songs in my case before I collapsed of exhaustion were Cee Lo Green's \"Forget You\", The Black Eyed Peas' \"Pump It\", Anja's \"Dance all Night\", Wilson Pickett's \"Land of 1000 Dances\", and appropriately, C&C; Music Factory's Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)..all very energetic and lively (and fun) songs.As in the Dance mode, you rack up points when you hit the right dance moves. In addition, as with Just Dance 2, they don't count calories for some reason, but rather, they count \"sweat points\". With Just Dance 2, the consensus on the Web was that 4.2 sweat points = about 1 calorie burned, and it seems about the same with Just Dance 3. In all honesty, I'm not sure why they didn't just use calories, which would have made things a lot easier. But still, as long as you do the math in your head, you can pretty much figure out how intensive a workout you're getting (since each song earns you about 400-500 sweat points, it'll take about 25-30 vigorous songs to reach 3500 calories, or 1 pound of fat lost). As you reach certain points, the system will give you an indication of how much exercise you've done (after completing 1000 sweat points, it told me \"You've just walked across Central Park\"; after 2000 points, it said \"you've just run 10 rounds of the Wembley Stadium\").For \"7-Day Challenge\" you're presented with three options for the next 7 days: The Fresh Start (3500 sweat points a week, the equivalent of walking 30 minutes a day), The Healthy Choice (7000 sweat points a week, equivalent to running 30 minutes a day), and The Sweat Explosion (21000 sweat points a week, equivalent to swimming for 30 minutes a day).Overall, I loved Just Sweat mode, but I would have liked to see the ability to chart my progress over days and weeks. Still, it's a great improvement over previous versions and definitely one of the best workouts you can have on the Wii.3) StoreThis is where you can purchase downloadable content (DLC) if your Wii is connected to the Internet. As of this writing (October 8, 2011), the store contained only the following songs:- Baby Don't Stop Now (Anja)- Jambo Mambo (Old Orquesta)- Soul Searchin (Groove Century)- Twist and Shake It (The Girly Team)But a bunch of empty icons indicates that there are more coming soon. Each song costs 250 Wii Points, so if you buy a 2000 point card for about $20, this comes out to about $2.50 a song.4) ExtrasThis is where you can adjust options, such as whether to display lyrics, display pictograms (the icons telling you what move to make), display help screens, and track usage. You can also view the medals you earned.I think one of the questions most people will have on their mind is: is Just Dance 3 on the Wii still relevant when there are so many new \"real dance move\" games out for systems like the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3. My answer is a resounding \"yes\". Not only does Just Dance 3 hold its own in terms of fun and accuracy--it actually has an advantage over those other systems. While those systems force players to squeeze into a camera view of 6 feet across, with Just Dance, players can stand anywhere in the room, and it doesn't even matter if there are spectators or \"dancers without controllers\" standing among them.Long story short, I think Ubisoft has taken a great franchise and moved it even further. Just Dance 3 for the Wii is another winner.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2011"}

The 5 year old got a big kick reading each sentence - especially since his voice was being changed.  He would read the sentence then babble like crazy just to hear his own voice as it was changed.  He got a big kick out of that.  The free-form part of the game where you can just talk in different voices was his favorite.  He already LOVES reading, and doesn't need any more motivation.  But he defintiely liked this game.The 3 year old was scared - scared by the weird looking characters on screen and definitely scared by the voices.  So - I would say ages 4 and up here.When I say it needs more innovation, I mean the technology behind the voice-changing gimmick is severely outdated.  20 years ago, my sister had a voice-changing megaphone, and it sounded EXACTLY like the crummy voices that this product uses to \"change\" your voice.  It's as if that's the best we can do.  I highly doubt it.  I don't know what patents or other speed bumps are holding up this technology - but surely we can do better.  Because really it sounds quite awful.  But - the kid liked it so, maybe when he's 25 it will finally be up to par!??Overall - cute idea, could use a little work but the 5 year old did really like it and will probably use it again.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2010"}

I bought this game from Walmart because I wanted to play a basketball game, and there aren't any college basketball games out there now.although I only played 2 games so far, I am very pleased with how the game looks and flows. Graphically, the game is fantastic! the players look like they do in real life, and as the game goes on, they will actually start to like shine from the sweat (which is a small detail but I think adds to the realism).Gameplay is smooth as well. I haven't noticed any glitches or lags yet.The commentary is the same as it has been for the past few NBA 2K games. just updated quotes and such.There's a new addition to halftime and the end of the game though. They interview either the player of the game or a coach and ask what they are going to try to do in the second half, why they won, etc. (again, small addition to some, but it's something you would see on TV).the only CON I've come across so far is the install time. Right off the bat, there was an update that took me a few hrs to download (probably due to my sucky WIFI). Also, it took a good 25 mins to fully install the game and get started. (you can play a quick game between the heat and spurs while waiting. This doesn't have commentary though.My closing opinion is that this game is worth buying if you like basketball. Due to the fact that this has been out a few months though, I wouldn't pay $60 for it. try and find in online cheaper. I know that online for Walmart was like $54. the lower the cost the better lol.I will update this review as I feel necessary.

For example the difficulty is set (even on easy) to where a casual gamer just can't pick this up and play.  The training mode is lackluster, and combos are difficult to pull off.  Also despite how cool the music is, it doesn't always fit the area your fighing in.  However overall it works just fine.Looking at characters there is a nice variety.  You have cyborgs, ninjas, assassins, mutants, aliens, lycanthropies, and even a skeleton (who has the funniest ending).  No move is duplicated, each has their own set of specials and combos.

Here is a game for the hardcore gamer, \"casual\" gamers or the faint of heart will not be able to endure Borderlands' high level of difficulty and required grinding.The best way I can describe Borderlands in a nutshell is to say it is a role-playing shooter looter. The gameplay consists of shooting bandits and alien creatures and collecting improved weapons, items, and cash. The game also boasts a very unique (and very awesome) animation style that is simply stunning to look at.Borderlands caters almost exclusively to hardcore fans of the hybridized genres. This where the main problem I have with Borderlands arises. The game is a hollow, empty experience. It seems as if all the attention went into the gameplay and leveling system, and little went into story or character development. For some people, that may not be a bad thing. The shooting gameplay in Borderlands, along with the somewhat deep leveling system were quite fun and well implemented. The weapons are some of the most diverse of any game I've played. But if you're not hardcore about it, the thrill of getting new loot and cool new weapons will wear off, and all that will remain is the lack of story and ensuing boredom.The basic premise of the story is this: You are on the wasteland planet of Pandora. Pandora's only draw to offworlders is the legend of the Vault, which is somewhere on the planet and supposedly can unlock great wealth, fame, and power for the person who finds it. You have come to Pandora to find and unlock the Vault. This premise is somewhat interesting and I feel that the developers could have done a LOT more with it. The plot in the game is more thin a soaked piece of toilet paper. Character interaction is virtually non-existent. You don't really talk to other characters, you read scripts on your mission log, even when you're standing face-to-face with the character giving you the mission. Non-hostile NPC's are virtually statues, usually only turning their head to look at you, and lack any other animation. This is a huge disappointment because many of the characters could have been great if they were had a little more life breathed into them. This makes the experience of playing the game as a solo player very lonely and meaningless (however, playing with friends online or splitscreen is much more fun - the game really should be experienced this way, since the leveling system caters to co-op play).I forced myself to the end of the story, since I had already invested a lot of time and figured I might as well find out what spectacular treasures await me Vault. When I did reach the Vault, and the end of the story, I was extremely disappointed and underwhelmed. After some thought though, I realized how awesome the ending could have been, if there had been a strong plot throughout the game to build up to it. If I had actually cared about the characters and the lore of Pandora, the ending could have been spectacular. But this was not the case, and the game remained a hollow and empty experience.I will say this: \"Pandora\" is certainly a fitting name for the planet. Oh, what could have been!!!To sum up: Borderlands is a fun game for a while but will grow old unless you are a super hardcore shooter/RPG fan. Playing with friends helps the experience, but even then, the story is hollow and unsatisfying. The art style is awesome.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0002SQ0AY","reviewerName":"Michael Jones","summary":"The worst in series by far","reviewText":"Whenever you have a series of games,  you often run into a clunker somewhere along the line.  For the Suikoden series, the 4th installment more than fits that description.In the other Suikoden games(1,2,3,5) the plot, in depth characters, and sheer enjoyment of finding the 108 stars of destiny are extremely well done.  Not only does this game fail miserably in those aspects, but just moving around the world is a tedious act.Since the game takes place in the island nations, you spend much of your time sailing around in your ship.  Unfortunately the random battles in this game are also very high. I have nothing against random battles, and often enjoy them.  However, a battle every couple seconds while moving around the world map is a bit extreme.This game is extremely short,(actually a blessing) which is probably why you have random encounters every 3 seconds, otherwise this  no plot game would last 10 hours.  The only positives I can say for the game are the very nice looking graphics, perhaps the best in the series.  However, I would gladly trade the graphics for a much better plot and character development.Fortunately, Suikoden got back on track with the 5th installment.  I can only recommend this game for those of you who must have every game in the series.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2009"}

As a member of the elite HAWX squadron, you'll find yourself manning cutting-edge aircraft, training on all the newest weapons, and carrying out dangerous top-secret missions set against the backdrop of a chaotic future, where private military companies (PMCs) are constantly putting your skills to the test and forcing you to defend your reputation as one of the top military pilots on Earth..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: 20px; } table.callout { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, serif; margin: 10px; width: 250; } td.callout { height: 100 percent; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding: 10px; width: 250px; } ul.callout { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -12px; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5em; } h5.callout { text-align: center; } img.withlink {border:1px black solid;} a.nodecoration {text-decoration: none}Fly alone or work with other pilots.View larger.Let E.R.S. help you demonstrate your skills.View larger.Experience photo-realistic environments.View larger.Perform tricky maneuvers to try and escape brutal dogfights alive.View larger.Take on secretive, black-op missions all over the world.View larger.Shifting International Dynamics: The Hazards of PMC WarfareSet betweenTom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2andTom Clancy's EndWarfrom the popular Ghost series,Tom Clancy's HAWXtakes place in a world where warfare is constantly evolving--a time when state-sponsored militaries lack the funds and personnel to modernize their forces and elite, private mercenary groups have grown in size and scope to pick up the slack.The Reykjavik Accords of 2012 defined the role of these PMCs in combat, and they made it fully legal for these groups to purchase from the international armaments market, leading to a shift in the structure of global military power. Over time, you'll do battle on the front lines of both sides as this shift reveals high-stakes arms threats and a terrifying glimpse of the future.HAWX: The Elite, High Altitude Warfare eXperimental SquadronYou'll begin the game as former U.S. Air Force Pilot David Crinshaw, assigned to provide air support for the well-known Ghost Recon team. You and your fellow HAWX pilots are some of the most highly-trained specialists in the world. Based out of Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, you're tasked with everything from testing secret and experimental aircraft weapon systems to carrying out combat and recon missions, training other top pilots, and attempting to capture enemy technologies.With the rise of the PMCs, your unique skills in higher demand than ever before. And with 49 playable planes available in game, plus additional planes available to some pilots through pre-order bonuses or VIP memberships, there's no shortage of sleek, fast, deadly aircraft at your disposal as you put your skills to use.An Iconic, Enhanced Reality System to Help You Deliver ResultsWhen you're in the midst of a firefight, E.R.S. in-game technology can help anyone survive, if you know how to take advantage of it. Featuring incoming missile detection, an anti-crash system, damage assessment, a tactical map, and weapons trajectory control, E.R.S. even allows you to issue orders to your squadron and other units, much like the iconic Cross-Com system in other Tom Clancy games. When you're getting started, you can ease into the rigors of flight and gain confidence by using a special assistance mode that offers support through the E.R.S. This mode can be switched off at any time, deactivating safety features and allowing you to perform advanced maneuvers.Cutting-Edge Realism and Innovative Multi-Player ModesWhether you're in a classic F15 Fighting Falcon or a new-generation Gripen, the controls and flight graphics are designed to keep you on your toes. And the game's photo-realistic environments have been created using detailed satellite data. When you pull back on the throttle to jet all over the world, you'll experience this authentic world from a variety of viewpoints.Game play options aren't limited either, with the campaign featuring solo and multiplayer options with seamless jump in/jump out functionality, and a PVP mode where players can challenge each other to dog-fights for bragging rights, earning experience points and cash, and unlocking additional weapons.","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"Just Short of Greatness","reviewText":"I've been a fan of flight-sims and flight-action games ever since playing Flight Simulator '95 on my parents old PC. I also grew up playing Ace Combat on the Playstation and have followed that series avidly for a number of years. So when Ubisoft announced Tom Clancy's HAWX I was immediately interested in the title. I've now managed to complete the game and have logged quite a few hours online as well.So I'll begin with what's to like about the game. First, the selection of aircraft in the game is second-to-none! HAWX features everything from standard F-15, F-16, F-14, F-22, Su-25, Su-27, MiG-29, etc, aircraft that are readily found in most flight games to more exotic planes like the YF-12/SR-71, F-35 Lightning II, X-29, F-15 ACTIVE, F-18 HARV and a number of other fantastic aircraft. If you're a fan of fighters/multi-role jet aircraft this game will amaze you!Unlike Ace Combat, HAWX also features real-world locations like Rio de Janeiro, Chicago, Tokyo and Los Angeles and a number of other locations. HAWX incorporates real satellite imagery from GeoEye into the game and famous landmarks will be instantly recognizable.The game features 3 difficulty levels which directly impact the players load-out in each plane as well as damage characteristics. On 'normal' you'll find your plane capable of sustaining major damage and multiple missile strikes while carrying literally hundreds of missiles and bombs. It's not realistic though it's not meant to be. On 'elite' difficulty the game ramps the difficulty by cutting the amount of weapons you can carry (although still unrealistically high) and making damage realistic - one missile will down your plane.HAWX also features an in-depth leveling system. Successfully destroying air and ground targets will net the player 'XP' which is tallied at the end of each level. The levels mirror real-life Air Force ranks (though some extra levels are thrown in) from a basic Airman all the way to General of the Air Force. All told there are 40 levels which equate to about 1.4 million 'XP'. Figuring that most missions will net a few thousand 'XP' the replay value is relatively high due to the requirements for reaching the highest ranks/levels. Also, upon leveling up the game rewards the players with new planes, paint schemes and weapons loads.There are a few areas where I feel HAWX could be better. For one thing the game features 2 modes for flying your plane - \"Assistance ON\" & \"Assistance OFF\". Assistance OFF essentially makes your aircraft incredibly maneuverable - so much so that you'll be able to perform impossible turns and Mach 2+ easily weaving and dodging missiles. The unfortunate part of \"OFF\" mode is that the game locks your camera into a distant and awkward viewpoint. Your aircraft will be the size of a dime and targeting accurately is nightmarish due to the awkward controls. Due to the camera you'll be forced to blind fire missiles at enemies that you can't readily see - only trusting that you have a lock-on because of the audio chimes. Ultimately I found \"OFF\" mode more of a hassle than it was worth and stuck to a more traditional cockpit camera that is both functional (display information) and intuitive in relation to the control scheme. Using \"ON\" mode limits your aircraft to more familiar laws of physics though you'll at least be able to choose which camera suits your flying style best.Also, though the graphics are good I feel that they're somewhat lacking in key areas. We all know that the PS3 is capable of some truly amazing visuals and because HAWX is a multi-platform game it just doesn't shine. The aircraft are rendered well but small touches like air-brakes are missing. When using aircraft like the F-15 active with canards you'd expect to be able to see the canards move from the cockpit camera but they're mysteriously absent. The replay mode is decent but limited in it's camera options and is strangely mute of engine sounds.All in all I think that fans of flight-action games and Ace Combat will probably find HAWX enjoyable. Hopefully Ubisoft sees fit to continue the series and improve upon this good first undertaking!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000MUXLOK","description":"InBurnout Paradiseplayers are treated to a rarity in the video games universe: a complete reinvention of an established franchise that equals, if not betters any of the previous games in the series. Yes, this is a large claim, but one that can be explained in a single phrase: Next-Gen Freedom.Driver's heaven is a wide open worldIn Paradise City even cars can fly.View larger.Go for broke in 'Marked Man' Mode.View larger.Nothing is off limits, even head-on crashes.View larger.Start a race any time with 'Easy Drive.'View larger.Although theBurnoutseries&#146; over the top mobile action has been its calling card since it ignited audiences on the PS2 in 2001, and later on the first generation Xbox console,Burnout Paradiseis the first game in the series that has been designed specifically for play on Next Generation consoles. This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"strump\"","summary":"Perhaps you baled too soon","reviewText":"Well, first things first --- there is a crash mode, it's just not implemented the same way --- and true, it's not as good. The original versions were nice little destruction puzzles that required thought and skill to solve. These new ones are just mindless crashing for short-lived online bragging rights.Even so, this is easily the best game in the series --- but one must play it a while and get used to it --- and to discover why this is the case --- my guess is that most of the haters never gave it a real shot. Too bad, because it's a seamless, fresh, and ambitious take on a great series of games. To me the Burnout series is the only car game series worth playing --- and this is the best in that series.BTW, I played the demo and was completely unimpressed, but playing the actual game for a while is another story entirely.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYY5E","description":"","reviewerName":"Gabriel Young","summary":"Halo is back in all of its revolutionary glory!","reviewText":"For people who remember how this game changed FPS a decade ago, this is a must-have. I still vividly recall how I played the original Halo in amazement for hours on end. This game not only allowed me to fondly reminiscence those days but also gives me the glorious enjoyment of playing through in HD!Those of you know are relatively new to the Halo franchise, I still highly recommend this. Here's why:-STORY-Halo is such a great game that sometimes the story gets overlooked. The storyline is perfect: not too complicated, cut scenes aren't too long, has enough depth and twists to keep you interested, and puts you into action through a variety of backdrops.-GRAPHICS-Honestly, I thought the original had incredible graphics. Luckily, this version allows you to switch from HD back to the old graphics so you can actually see what a long way it's come! You won't stay in the old form long because the visuals are jaw-dropping. Even though I've seen all of this before, it's like giving someone with poor eye sight a pair of glasses for the first time.-SOUNDS/MUSIC-Let me first say that the music is flawless. The game plays the right kinds of music at the right times, even raising my heartbeat during some climatic portions. Surprisingly, the music brought back more memories than anything else. As soon as I started the game up, I was greeted with familiar Halo scores that I know I and love. As for the sound effects, those are executed well, just as they are in all the Halo games.-CONTROLS-These are very close to the same controls that changed console FPS forever! Lots of buttons but even first time players will find it pretty intuitive. Reach players will have to get used to not having special powers during campaigns though. Movement is fluid and one thing that we take for granted is the use of momentum. Walking, running, jumping, aiming, shooting...it all feels so natural.-WEAPONS-What once was old is new again -- the big, bad (non-nerfed) Magnum is back! So are all your other favorites, from battle rifles to needlers to rocket launchers, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Provides excellent balance in the game.-VEHICLES-Remember the first time you manned a Scorpion or flew a Banshee? Still controlled the same way and still fun! It's impossible to predict how much fun two guys can have just driving around with a Warthog and blowing things up.-AI-&lt;sigh> Not as good as Reach AI. Your teammates might as well not be there. I wish we could give them commands (via D pad) or even choose between aggressive, defensive, etc. The enemy AI is also somewhat predictable. If they were trying to create the exact same experience between both CE versions, the developers were successful. ;)-MULTIPLAYER-Being able to play Team Slayer on Battle Creek is like a dream come true. There are several new maps and if you've played Reach, your rank carries over. The part I don't like is that you can use special powers on the old maps. Another negative is that multiplayer firefight is lacking. We need more maps!-REPLAYABILITY & VALUESince I'm a Halo vet, I started on Legendary and had little problems finishing (easier than Reach Legendary). I still play solo campaigns and co-op campaigns. Firefight and multiplayer adds additional options. Halo has always been our \"comfort food\". We mess around with other games but when it comes down to it, we always end up back to playing Halo. I'd be hard pressed to find something better to do with $30-40.-WISHFUL THINKING-I hope Halo CE will open the doors for other developers to bring back some of their classics using this formula (i.e. improve the graphics, add some multiplayer, and leave everything else alone)!-RECOMMENDATION-Halo followers: Buy with no regrets! Be ready to experience hours of enjoyable memories all over again.New to Halo: Buy with no regrets! Buckle your seatbelt and enjoy the ride that started it all.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2011"}

Fortunately, it was made in video game form because I don't think it would've done too well on the big screen.  However, as a video game, it makes for a great dramatic presentation.  The characters are believable, the voice talent is some of the best I've heard in a while, and the story is simply gripping.  As I was playing, I truly felt for the characters in the story, especially the ones you control.  The game sort of plays out like the sims (without the action sequences of course).  You control your character and pretty much have free will as to where they go and what they interact with.  Unlike the sims, however, your story will eventually end the same every time.That being said, this game isn't really that fun as a \"game.\"  The action sequences and question choices seem more like a tedious task than enthralling gameplay.  In fact, it's the game's biggest downfall.  I can overlook the character graphical detail and the mouth movement that is worse than a Neversoft game, but I can't overlook the fact that the action sequences where I am forced to \"DDR\" with my joysticks or repeatedly pull the left and right triggers seem so unnecessary and unexciting.  Plain and simple, this game is not fun.  It has a great stroy, one of the best in a while...but it fails as a game because the gameplay is horiffic.  I wish that I felt like I was controlling the character (which, as the creator says in the tutorial, is the idea), but I just feel like I'd rather do it myself than being rewarded for \"bopping it\" correctly.Rent it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2006"}
