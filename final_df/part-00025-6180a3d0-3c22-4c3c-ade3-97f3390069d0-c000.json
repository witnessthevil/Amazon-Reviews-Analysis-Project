{"product_name":"B00BMFIXT2","description":"","reviewerName":"Raven A. Wind","summary":"A great update to Sid Meier's Pirates hidden inside a decent Assassin's Creed game.","reviewText":"Assassin's Creed IV... What to say? It's another good Assassin's Creed game. The formula remains the same-- Run around, climb buildings (or trees), synchronize on towers, get contracts, kill people, hide in crowds, etc. If you've played an AC game, you're not going to be surprised by this one at first. In fact, you may think it's the same old game, rehashed. Graphically, it looks great on the 360, and the setting-- this time you're a pirate-- is pleasantly different from previous entries. Once you get past a rather slow start of more of the same AC gameplay, you find the piratey goodness at the middle. That's when the game starts to shine.Okay, so it's not as \"piratey\" as Sid Meier's Pirates!, but there are sufficient pirating moments to be satisfying to pirate fans. It's a blast traveling by ship, taking down enemy ships, and boarding them to steal their stuff. Arranging a fleet is pretty cool, too. I still don't like how linear the main storyline is, and the \"modern day\" parts really pull you out of the game and put on the brakes, to be honest. But that's all easy to cope with once you get back on the high seas and do your thing.The issue I had with the game originally was that slow start-- They really take their time to get to the pirating parts. It feels too much like all the other AC games at that point, and honestly, I gave up for a while... And then I got back into it because an associate told me to give it another go. And sure enough, once you forge past the first section of the game, it changes dramatically and becomes a completely different-- and far better-- game.So get it, and just push through that same-old parkour stuff until you get your ship and start really playing the game. It really is worth it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2013"}

Because the workouts are legit, but funny to do for the most part. I am well over my weight recommendation so my goal in this game is weight loss. I chose to pick that I'd like to lose 50 pounds.At the start you measure yourself (chest, thighs, hips, etc.) and then you check your heart rate. After that, you do a couple of exercises so your trainer, Maya can see where you are at, physically. Then you check your heart rate again. You can actually skip the measurements and stuff and get right to the workout but I didn't. If you have measuring tape then I suggest you take the extra 10-15 minutes measuring yourself and doing the little workout to test where you stand. Finally, after that you can get started.Maya recommends what you should concentrate on before you exercise so you can go with that option which will be starred or you can pick another option for the day yourself. I've worked out on two different days (and will work my way up to 30 minutes eventually) but for now, I work out in 15 minute intervals. But believe me, she works you out! The exercises are varied and most of them are fun. So far there were 1 or 2 that I couldn't quite do so well so I just did a previous one.You can also incorporate your own equipment to use if you have it. This includes hand weights, an exercise ball, heart monitor or steps. I only had the weights so that's what I used.Maya is also very encouraging and I don't find her (or her voice) to be a nuisance at all. In fact like I said, when I'm working out with her I laugh--a lot! It's very fun to do these workouts for some reason and after my 15 minutes is up, I am always sweating. Maybe I'm just out of shape or she just stretches you good, but boy does it work!But onto the exercises. If the first part of it was too hard or not hard enough (she takes breaks occasionally), you can tell her and she will adjust accordingly. Also, in the beginning before you exercise, she asks you how you are doing. You can say, NOTHING CAN STOP ME, which will probably indicate a harder workout from the get go, NOT TOO BAD which will indicate you are doing average and will have a workout that's the same and finally YOU'RE LUCKY I'M HERE which means the workout will probably be easy on you.All in all, I'm heavily impressed by this game. It makes exercising fun! I'm not even the type to want to exercise. The only other exercise I get in is walking from time to time.By the way, you DON'T hold the Wii remote at all when working out!

Since Heavenly Sword was a PS3 exclusive, XBOX360 users can immerse themselves into exciting adventure of Bayonetta.  For those who wonder why this game is Rated \"M\" for mature: While Bayonetta is an eye candy, there is no nudity or sexual situations in this game.  However, there are plenty of f-words to go around.  Why did they decide to put in the f-words and make it Rated-M instead of Rated-T is beyond me, but regardless almost everything about this game is great.  Soundtrack fits well.  One of the first tracks you'll hear will be a Frank Sinatra remix of \"Fly Me to the Moon,\" which is worth the price of admission alone.  In terms of battles, the game relies mostly on button mashing, but there are also other elements, which include spell-like abilities and item forging.  You earn halos along the way for defeating enemies that you can redeem for new and more powerful items.Looking at 1-star reviews, I noticed a common complaint, which is last boss being hard.  Please do not let it scare you away.  This game has several difficulties.  As soon as I got stuck on Normal, I switched it to Easy(yes, you can switch difficulties in mid-game, so you don't have to restart!)  I actually defeated(barely) last boss on my first try.  Even if you can't, there is also a Very Easy difficulty that I personally haven't tried, but I'm sure it will be suitable for beginners.I will not spoil the game for you, but as I said, this is part movie-part game.  You will spend a lot of time watching the cinematics between all the action(I believe at one point, the cinema lasted for 5 minutes.)  It is that combination that pulls you in as you watch the movie and then get to be a part of it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2010"}

I know there is a type of gamer out there who just eats this stuff up.  But I'm not that type...if you are anything like me (someone who thinks Mass Effect and Dragon Age are the best games), don't expect much more than to blow off some steam beating the tar out of various creatures and enjoying the lush graphics.Bayonetta has some incredible production values, superb art direction, plentiful voice acting, and a pretty deep combat system...all of which looks like it took quite a bit of effort to come up with.  Unfortunately, that doesn't really add up to much more than a few afternoons of finger exercise for me, so I can't help but feel that this game was not worth the effort it took to make, and probably not worth my money to buy...a good rental, perhaps.That being said, the graphics, fight mechanics, and overall design, all completely over-the-top, is very well done.Taking in the imaginative scenery and insane character designs is one of the hight points of the game and my main reason for playing it longer than the time it took to master the controlsThe fighting is a nice balance-- if you have skills you can really make an art of it.  If you don't, you can basically go crazy on the button pad and muddle through enough to enjoy yourself.Look, if you want any sort of depth, or anything to remember a game by, other than thoughts of Bayonetta's animated rear end, you better look elsewhere.  This is basically the kind of game it is ok to have on at a party-- anyone can pick it up and enjoy, there's good eye candy, but no one is going to get so involved in it that they forget to socialize, or so wrapped up in it that they won't pass the controller on to another guest after a while.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2010"}

Infinity Ward could have easily messed this game up by changing the formula that made MW1 so much fun. Rest assured that is not the case. They took the funnest feature of the original (online multiplayer) and enhanced it with bigger/better locations, more challenging and deep rank/reward system, and a host of new challenges, accolades, etc. to strive for.  This makes the multiplayer all the more addictive, and makes the game a must have IMO.The single player campaign mode is back, and its short and easy, just like MW1. Don't buy this game for the single player mode, you'll be dissapointed.  Its not that the gameplay is bad or the story is boring, its just too short. But if you're like me, the real reason for buying this game is the multiplayer.A new mode was introduced in MW2 = special ops. It can be played single player or split screen, but is most fun when played with a friend. Special ops has a number of short-medium length missions that challenge you to clear a set of objectives in the shortest time possible. This could be anything from running through a course, defending a base from waves of enemies, or clearing an area of all enemies. Special ops is a lot of fun, and adds some replay value to MW2 if you tire of the multiplayer action.Everything else about MW2 is solid. Graphics, sound effects, simple menu layouts, fast load times... all the things we take for granted are well done here. The weapon and perk choices have been enhanced. There is a good selection covering a wide range of equipment, from shotguns to sniper rifles, uzis to LMGs, you'll find something you like. Although with the new rank system, it will take a bit longer to get the top-level weapons. But be patient and enjoy the ride. That's what MW2 is all about. Each game you play gets you a bit closer to that weapon or perk you've had your eye on.  This is what makes the game so addictive and keeps you coming back for more.I highly recommend this game for anyone remotely interested in first person shooters.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYYEK","description":"","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Comparison vs Dance Central (1) and Just Dance 3","reviewText":"I've been playing Dance Central 2, Dance Central (original), and Just Dance 3 pretty non-stop recently. How does Dance Central 2 stack up against its prequel and the Just Dance 3 game?First, let's look at the enhancements over Dance Central. The graphics are naturally much better. The characters look better and move more smoothly. I love the new venues far more than the old ones. The beach is my favorite, although I wish they didn't cut to a basketball court half the time. The characters are good. Songs you bought for Dance Central are available here with the same moves.The exercise mode is improved - you now get playlists of songs arranged by the intensity of the workout. So you can go through a 20 minute easy set to get going. You can also make your own playlists - awesome! It will give you alerts when you hit milestones, like 50 calories or 20 minutes - but you get no running tally as you go. So I do miss that.They lost the sense of a level progress as you play. Instead, they added a challenge mode where you \"take on\" a given dance crew by playing their songs. I'm not keen on this since there are songs I just don't like in the set. I'd rather be able to play the songs I want to.They now have a 'helper frame' to see where you are in the Kinect view square, which helps keep you in the camera frame. This is especially helpful if you're playing two player at a time.You can use voice commands to control the songs, which is fun.So definitely if you have the original Dance Central I'd look into upgrading. You can even import your old songs for a fee, so you'd get double the songs here.Now to compare it with Just Dance 3. The characters here in Dance Central 2 are still fairly robotic, and the moves can feel forced. Transitions between moves aren't always smooth. There are only the few venues and characters. This definitely gets kudos for its playlist functionality; I wish Just Dance 3 offered that.Just Dance 3 lets *four* people play at once in cool choreography that is smooth and gorgeous, and in general the dancing is much more fluid. Where this one has robotic move-leg-left and lift, with Just Dance 3 they are real people jumping and spinning and as I love jumping songs I miss that a lot here.A key issue for me is song selection. As I say on all my dance reviews, we all have different tastes in music. That's fine and natural, so the games we gravitate towards will be guided by that. I love the song mix in Just Dance 3 and I'm just not that same level of fond of the songs here in Dance Central 2. So if I'm going towards the TV and looking to pop a game in, I'll reach for Just Dance 3 instead because of the song mix and the fluid moves.Still, if you adore these songs, then you'll be drawn to this one for the same reason, and you won't mind the semi-robots you're following.So well recommended for people who love this song mix. If you're 50-50 between the two song mixes, I might lean towards Just Dance 3 - or heck, get them both and have double the songs to play with.Feel free to ask if you have any questions; I play these a lot.I bought this game with my own funds for the purpose of doing this review.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular.

The good part is if you own a xbox 360 and is a backwards compatible version this game will work in your 360 it looks a little stretched out if you play on full screen but it is definitely playable.Threw out the years I never really was to big on Rpgs its not that I didn't like them I just never had the time or patience to really sit down and play them all that much. With the exception of this, any other bioware game and Final Fantasy VII. However I was a huge star wars fan growing up (original and prequel trilogy included) I had to pick this up. I won't go into to much details about the story, for those that haven't played it but it is single handily the best story in a video game and in my opinion rivals the movies. Bioware did a excellent job with this and is probably the closest were ever gonna get to a star wars movie without a skywalker or a solo in it.The game has different modes for difficultly if your like me and don't play to many RPGs or just playing for the story theirs the standard mode and a hard mode. The hard mode is pretty much for a hardcore RPG player and it can be very challenging. All together it should take about anywhere between 25-40 hours to complete the game depending on how many side quests and how you play. The combat system in the game is good for a rpg it does get a little repetitive after awhile but there are plenty of puzzles to shake things up every now and agian. So if you don't like puzzles you will be spending a lot of time reading/watching walkthroughs.As for the graphics it hasn't really aged all that well but there still good for its time. However graphics are not whats really important about this game anyway. The soundtrack is done right as well. While it may not be John Williams score the guy that made the music should be noted for making a great soundtrack. In fact of John Williams is ever not available to make music for the movies then the should hire this guy. It doesn't try to mimic John Williams this guy kinda does his own thing and it paid off. I do believe there are a few moments with the classic soundtrack as well here and there.Anyway if you own a xbox, backwards compatible 360, or windows xp and you like star wars and I believe RPG fans themselves will have a great time with this game. Then you all should defiantly pick this game up along with its sequel (which isn't quite as good but still enjoyable) which the pc version is available in a bundle with both games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2014"}

I decided to buy the game about a year ago (I was poor, and waiting for the price drop). I had hoped that this could fill the void as I awaited the release of Final Fantasy X on the Playstation 2.Well, FFX has come and went, as have countless other games, and I STILL cannot muster the energy to put the sad, sad \"Legend of Dragoon\" out of its misery. I don't even know where to BEGIN damning this game, so let's begin at the beginning...Firstly, who in the WORLD conceived the lousy, pitiful soundtrack? From the opening title screen on, it seems as if the music was composed by some hair-metal band after a suicide attempt. And the plot? Can't Squaresoft sue? I mean, I have never seen a bigger ripoff of Final Fantasy VII, from the spiky haired lead character to the silver haired foe leading him by the nose across the world! Unfortunately for all, the results are far inferior to the Square offering...Also, who in the world TRANSLATED this thing? (I assume it is translated, I HOPE it is translated, I PRAY it is translated, sigh). Every character needs about a paragraph to say what could be thoroughly explained in a sentence. Does anyone even CARE about these characters? I sure don't...Oh, let's not forget the battle engine. Before every (RANDOM) encounter, the screen melts away like sand, followed by a sweeping camera laying out the poorly drawn field of battle, followed by a shot of the characters, and then one of the monsters. This happens before EVERY battle! I estimate a good ten hours of playtime is wasted just from this...Oh, and the battles? Don't even get me started. I will describe but one of the (uncountably infinite) shortcomings: a character can only cast magic while in the \"dragoon\" state. This makes every battle unbearably long, and expect to be hit with a random encounter every 5 seconds or so...I guess I'm left to ask, \"What was the big deal?\" Personally, I feel sorry for the schmoes who plunked down full price for this stinker (and apparently there were a lot of you; this game is a best-seller!). I suppose this is the reason for the ridiculously high rating this knockoff has received. Well, if there is anyone else thinking of buying this, DON'T! I hope the rant has dissuaded you!

I was bored, so i was playing it and i really enjoyed it.  So, one time at blockbuster, I saw it, but my mom wouldn't let me rent it.  Eventually I did rent it tho, and I couldn't stop playing it.  I beat the first disk in a week, and then i re-rented it just so I could keep playing it.  I beat the next 2 disks in the next week, and my mom wouldn't let me rent it again.  I managed to get my grandma to buy it for me, and I beat it.  It was worth everything spent on itI've beaten this game at least 4 times, and I still love playing it.  The characters are all awesome, the score is simply phenomenal, although it can be cheesy at times, it fits in perfectly.  This game really touched me, something that no other game has done until I picked up Shadow of the Colossus, which by the way is another fantastic game for PS2 and I highly recommend it.  Anyways, I popped this game in a few days ago after beating Silent Hill 2, and everything came rushing back to me.  The opening sequence, the first battle, even the title screen, it was amazing to re-experience this game.  The graphics aren't very good, but the game is so great you won't even notice.  Enough of me rambling on.  Let's list pros and cons.Pros:Great characters.  I cared about each and every one of them.Meru was my favorite.Excellent storyline.  I couldn't stop playingAwesome battle system.  I find the battle system of games such as Final Fantasy to be annoying.  This one is perfect, to me.fantastic music.  The music is incredible.  Even though it is sometimes cheesy, it still fits in to give the game a more friendly atmosphere.  Playing something like Silent Hill that has no friendliness sometimes gets tiring.amazing cutscene graphicsCons:many frustrating parts, such as disk 2.it's rather longgraphics aren't too good.  Cut scenes are great, though.  the cutscene graphics are comparable to PS3 graphics.  Although, the gameplay helps you forget about the bad graphicsAll in all, buy this game.

{"product_name":"B0047THYWC","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Son","summary":"Lazy and Sloppy Sequel","reviewText":"On its own Dragon Age II is a decent game. Next to its predecessor though, it is a shameful product. It is a slap in the face to the series and gamers in general. Its only redeeming qualities are the aspects it took from Dragon Age Origins and speeding up the combat. Dragon Age II has improved its graphics a little and the gameplay is much faster paced than the original which I personally liked although it's harder to execute strategy with this technique. The story branches quite a bit which helps to keep you interested. The game stays captivating enough that you'll want to see it through to the end. That is about all I can say that is good about Dragon Age II.Dragon Age II fails in so many ways it's difficult to tell where to start. There is a ridiculous amount of backtracking in this game. In fact, most of the game IS backtracking. You will be restricted to a very limited number of areas throughout the entire game. These areas may change ever so slightly as the game progresses but not in any way that will make you feel like you haven't done this a thousand times before. Dragon Age II also lacks story. In fact, there really isn't a story beyond a sort of documentary style of storytelling of your main character, Hawke. The threats are constantly changing and there is no overall goal or main story arch of any kind which leads me to my next problem: the characters. With no overarching plot/enemy to deal with in the game it makes absolutely no sense for most of your party members to even be following you; especially the ones that tend to dislike your decisions. Throw that on top of the fact that most of your party members are not all that likable. Hawke is a great character but for the most part, the rest of his/her party is terrible You can load a save from the original Dragon Age Origins but it serves little purpose and really changes nothing.In closing, Dragon Age II was a sloppy, thrown-together mess. This sequel will not bode well for gamers who like a story that serves more purpose and has intriguing characters that they care about which is pretty much the entire Dragon Age fan-base. Even twitchy fingered, action-oriented gamers that this game tried to cater more to will most likely not enjoy this game much due to the lack of environments and the awful amount of backtracking. Dragon Age II is a three star game ONLY because of the branching story and decent combat gameplay which I still feel was done better by its predecessor.PROS:-Improved Graphics-Branching storylines-Fast paced combatCONS:-No main plotline-Uninteresting party members-Way too much backtracking-Only a handful of environments to go to","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2011"}

One of the best games of 2009 so far.....","reviewText":"Like alot of people I had mixed feelings about Batman: Arkham Asylum coming out. For one most Superhero/comic games suck...badly. For another there were alot of skeptical preliminary reviews about the game's odd design choices that were not very appealing. Also the demo was average at best. Thankfully none of this got in the way of Rocksteady producing one of the best games in recent memory.The game starts out with a nice nod to Half-Life 2: You're escorting the recently apprehended Joker through Arkam Asylum as the credits roll. Through this scene and through most of the game you're in full control of Batman. There are maybe a handful of cut-scenes but none of them throw off the pacing in the game mechanics (one of my biggest beefs with gaming).The controls themselves are easy to use requiring no more than the press of one or two buttons to pull off some great comat moves and Batman inspired action with your arsonal of gadgets. Also the stealth aspects fo the game are easy as well (maybe too easy?) but completely add the the world and your character.Everything in this game is very accessable to the point where you don't have to be a hardcore gamer to have fun (though admitably some of the boss fights are a bit on the easy side). The story's got some heavy moments but is easy to follow, the voice acting is spot-on, and the game has enough easter-eggs and hidden trophies to keep you coming back for more.

Everything about it looked absolutely stunning.  When I purchased this game last year, that's exactly what it was like, &quot;stunning to the eye.&quot;However, when I played through this game, I couldn't help feel like it wasn't a game I was playing, but an interactive movie.  Cutscenes were long, the graphics are too gorgeous to believe, and the voice overs are done well.  Sometimes a scene would last up to an hour, but this can be avoided by pressing start and choosing to skip the scene.  I was promised over 80 hours of game play, and 4 mini games.  The game only took me between 35-40 hours to beat and none of the mini-games I really noticed to even test them.Truly the game was fun, but not as addicting as other RPGs offer.  The battles are turn based, so you can take 20 minutes if you want to decide on your next move.  However, the use of a boost ability can make or break your battles.Xenosaga can be challenging at times, but not enough to make it a lasting game.  What still captivates me is the characters, their involvements, and what's to come for Xenosaga II.Pros:Awesome graphicsGreat charactersDeep storylinePart 1 of a game series...(also see Xenogears)Cons:Cutscenes are long, which isn't bad, but some get too political and boring, (sometimes scenes up to 1 hour of watch time)Gameplay isn't as fun as many othersOverall, it's a must play for any RPG fan, but should be overlooked by the impatient.  Don't believe neccessarily what the backcover says, (over 80 hours gameplay) because all ready myself and others I know have played it in 40 hours.  And when it is claimed to have about 20 hours of cutscenes, that's only a 20 hour RPG, which is very short.

{"product_name":"B00FM5IY4W","description":"","reviewerName":"A. D. Anderson \"Flying Gamer\"","summary":"Honest review from a long-time racing simulator fan.","reviewText":"Let me start by saying that Forza 4 was the best racing game I have played.  Ever.  I spent over 200 hours driving to acquire the &#34;Bucket List&#34; achievement, and I enjoyed every minute of it.  The music, the tracks, the cars, everything fit perfectly.  That game (Forza 4) came out six years into the Xbox 360's life cycle.  Two years later the sequel (Forza Horizon doesn't count) is released on a new system and everyone is up in arms about how terrible it is.  Shockingly this opinion seems to be felt only by the Amazon community.  Most of the reviews I've read seem to be from trolls or casual Forza &#34;fans.&#34;  Here it is from someone who has spent a lot of time playing racing simulators, with over 1,000 hours invested in the Forza and Gran Turismo series.Graphics:  This is probably the first thing you will notice playing a next-generation system.  It is hard to describe how I feel about the graphics in this and Battlefield 4 (the only other game I own).  I would say that the textures look similar to previous-generation systems, but the amount of graphics displayed has increased tremendously.  I first noticed the crowds in the stands and the track-side detail.  It is impressive.  There is just a lot more &#34;stuff.&#34;  In Forza 4, the Sebring raceway seemed very open and spread out.  In Forza 5 it feels intimate, close up.  I don't know how to describe it other than it feels like you're driving through a real place.Content: In Forza 4 there were over 500 cars and 26 tracks.  Forza 5 has 200 cars and 14 tracks.  It is easy to recognize that you're getting about half of the content of Forza 4.  The big fear is that Microsoft will try to sell the &#34;missing half&#34; as DLC.  This remains to be seen, but I will pass on the DLC and wait for the sequel if it comes to that.  As it stands, it is better than what I expected for a launch title.  Everything has a very high level of polish and fits well.  The game seems designed to attract new players, as a lot of the menus and layouts have been simplified.  I honestly wish they would have borrowed more from Forza 4 in this case, but I can understand why they chose a different path.Driveatars:  This is probably the coolest addition to the game.  I love that as I write this, my driveatar is out there earning me credits and racing against other players.  It is really neat to watch the other cars race, as it shows you how other people handle the courses differently.  I've actually copied some of the driveatar techniques I've seen to see if it makes me faster.Global standings:  This is a minor point, but when you finish a race your fastest lap time is ranked world-wide.  It has definitely motivated me to re-race a couple of tracks just to get my time down.Physics:  The cars seem to have more &#34;heft&#34; than in previous Forza games.  It feels more realistic.  One of the complaints I had about Forza 4 was the glued-to-the-track feel of the cars with TCS on.  It feels much better with this one, you're no longer invincible with TCS on, the tires will break if you over-do it.In-game currency and micro-transactions:  This is where everyone is bashing Forza 5.  I honestly didn't notice the micro-transaction stuff until I read some of the reviews on here.  It isn't as &#34;in-your-face&#34; as everyone is making it seem.  The primary complaint revolves around the super-expensive cars, like the 6,000,000 credit Ferrari GTO.  If you want to pay for it in &#34;tokens&#34; it translates to $63.00 in real money (or somewhere in that range).  So let's be honest about this.  You can grind, as I did in Forza 4, to EARN this car or you can be an idiot and pay real money for it.  It is your choice.  I acquired the GTO at around the 180 hour mark in Forza 4, and trust me, it isn't anything special.  The only reason I bought it was because I had around 40,000,000 in game credits so I just bought all of the most expensive cars (achievement unlocked!).  Forza 5 is a little more conservative with doling out credits.  The main reason for this is that the credit multiplier has been reconfigured significantly.  I would earn 115% in credits in Forza 4 because of the way I set the difficulty.  With similar settings I now earn an additional 45%.  That said, I was driving my two favorite cars (Eagle Talon TSI and Dodge Viper ACR) within an hour of playing the game.  I'm sitting on around 500,000 in in-game credits with about 10 hours of gameplay.  And I've bought and modified several cars.  Bottom line, if you actually play the game, you will get the super-expensive cars.  There aren't as many cars in Forza 5, so you don't need as many credits as you did in Forza 4.  If you whine and complain that you can't drive the GTO on your first race you're not a gamer.  Go play &#34;Angry Birds&#34; on your iPhone.  If you are stupid enough to waste $63.00 on an in-game car, well, you know what they say about a fool and his money.Music:  My final point and biggest complaint about this game.  Forza 4 had one of the best original soundtracks for a video game in my opinion.  It was done just right.  They tried with Forza 5.  You can definitely tell that they tried.  Unfortunately it falls flat on it's face and comes across as one of the most pretentious and douchey soundtracks that I have ever heard.  It sounds like a bizarre combination of the soundtracks from the Lion King and Titanic, mixed in with big-band music from the 1950's.  It is very strange and has no place in a video game about cars.  When I listen to it I try to imagine the person who developed it.  I guarantee that whoever it is drives a Toyota Prius and can't tell you the difference between an air filter and a cabin air filter.  And they don't know how to drive a car with a manual transmission.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2013"}

Ramos \"Voltaire Tempentry\"","summary":"A decent upgrade, but not a must buy","reviewText":"The Classic Controller Pro is Nintendo's upgrade to its existing Classic Controller. The new additions include nice grips, redesigned shoulder buttons, control sticks, and cord. The new extras do help round out the controller, but obvious problems persist.The controller is still wired to a Wii remote in order to function. In a generation where wireless is standard, it is a nuisance and shame that Nintendo, once a pioneer in wireless controller, has limited its controller to a wire. Its not a huge deal as it doesn't affect gameplay or control in any way, but it is something worth considering for those interesting in \"re-buying\" a CC.The Classic Controller launched without a rumble feature, and now the CC Pro has done the same. Since the CC is tethered to a WiiMote, and gathers its power from it, a lack of rumble is sure to safe battery life. It does take away from some of the experience however. Although it is true that Sony launched the Play Station 3 without a rumble controller, they have since released the DualShock 3 to remedy it.Since it has no battery source of its own, or any internal mechanics to support a rumble feature, the CC Pro is very light. The plastic used is sturdy, so it doesn't feel cheap or breakable, but it does feel flimsy.The CC Pro has a gloss on top of the controller, similar to the Wii remote, but the entire bottom of it lacks any of the gloss, OR a matte finish like the newer Wiimotes of Xbox 360 controllers.At a cheap price of $20, it becomes obvious why the CC Pro lacks a sense of luxury, but it's disappointing that Nintendo would go through all the trouble of redesigning a controller only to do it poorly. The low price means that it isn't a serious investment, but the additions don't really warrant another purchase for those already stock full of original CCs. New comers are very welcome though.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2010"}

While gameplay revolves around the events of the story, there are many personal revelations and surprises for the characters along the way.

CQC - Close Quarter Combat Advanced A+","reviewText":"To think I almost gave this 1 star! \"Metal Gear Solid 1\" October 1998 designed to save the Playstation1 from the Ninento64 \"Golden Eye\" (released in September 1997) was a new type of `cinematics' game that the N64 cartridge could not do (playback of movie scenes on a disc is \"MGS1\"), MGS1 is about 4 stars at best or five if you really thought it was the bee's knees, maybe the preferred \"Golden Eye\" for 5 star treatment. Playstation2 hype, Christmas 2001 \"MGS2: Sons of Liberty\", created a big five star stomping fan base (see the reviews), but most of us could see how phoney \"MGS2\" was. I gave \"MGS2: Sons of Liberty\" 3 stars back then (maybe much less now considering), boring cinematics and constant in-game radio stops made it horribly annoying; flat game play often simply unplayable out of restriction. Quite limited in movement considering the excitement, the character of Raiden was also not Solid Snake either. The oil tanker was cool as a map for the first hour but not the whole game! In 2005 I played \"MGS3\" for thirty minutes and boxed it shaking my head. I went back to it again for another attempt last week. Let me explain. All is forgiven... and then more some.\"MGS3: Snake Eater\" is a Solid Five star game, the best MGS experience besides not even being MGS at all at times (this is why it is better), maybe as good as the experience of playing \"Half-life 2\" till the end, I am not a MGS fan (still not; skipped `MGS2.5: Substance' totally) but I played this like it was the best thing since \"GTA: San Andreas\" or slice bread. The video cut-scenes are the finest on the PS2 yet (or any game for that matter; some elements are PS2 rendered; wear the zombie mask camouflage for best cut-scene effect!), \"MGS2\" had great graphics, but MGS3 is all about the all-too-very real jungle and wildlife around you (Yes PS2 graphics are nothing compared to a PC ATI 256mb pro card, but Snake Eater lives!) LISTEN NEXT - William Ewart Fairbairn, General List, was born February 28, 1885 in Rickmansworth, Herts, England. Prior to the Second World War, Fairbairn was the Chief Instructor at the Shanghai Municipal Police from October 1907 to March 1940.  Fairbairn joined SOE in March 1942 with the rank of Captain, having previously been an instructor at the War Office Special Training Centre in Scotland in July of 1940. He founded CQC (see review title). CQC is employed in MGS3 as a means to effectively fight and ground the enemy with Judo type throws and holds and \"Tenchu\" style executions, use him as a human shield or interrogate the enemy for mission information (yes you heard right), you can also select several types of camouflage (play `Barbie' every other new area you explore, but still come out feeling more like a man) MGS3 has the most realistic jungle terrain accomplished in a game since \"Far Cry\", as you crawl your way very slowly through miles of Russian woodland for a few days (literally), also hunting the wildlife to feed yourself and a self-administered x-ray medical scan system that allows you to select treat various wounds with different medic tools, I came out the other side of this EPIC INSTANT CLASSIC thinking that there is a future revolution in gaming waiting to happen as a result of Solid Snake, you should support this game! Why? Solid Snake gets you doing things in the jungle that you have never done before in a `game'. At one stage I could see my own vomit on infrared because of a bad animal I killed and ate. This hot zone gave me away to a sniper called `The End' who eradicated me because of it. Towards the end of the game things get more urban. I hope MGS4 is in Tokyo City but just like the jungle here! I find the following most logical. You must find your own way but - see map, camouflage gear (check halfway through map again), first-person quick look, infrared look, sonar ping, crawl, kill rat food, ping again, crawl slowly to bad guy, CQC grab (Choose CQC mode), interrogate, kill, CQC ground smash three other enemies there and then, hide in bushes, set TNT, crawl away, detonate if bad guys come, eat hunted food, try CQC three more enemy, accidentally fail with CQC on one who alerts six other enemy, take them out with up to twenty weapons of various types or CQC them all, blend into the jungle and run away, the choice is yours until you get to the other end of the map where a video will play and although the story is ten times better than MGS2, it is still Japanese, so these things will always remain illogical to us Westerners, still works better than most PS2 attempts, at times Manga quality, this is one of the most memorable games I have played in my lifetime.Set game to `easy' and learn CQC before weapon's culture. Use your sonar, map and equipment and play the game SLOWLY (not GTA madness!) as in crawl for miles and miles in the right frame of mind and you will appreciate how significant things really are. I just hope that we see MGS3 PC with huge MULTIPLAYER jungles for many players! Get that going and it will 0WN MY BROADBAND! Developers, do you hear? Take note.Pros:- The first true stealth game you will ever play.- Likely the last true stealth game you will play in 2005 until MG4... maybe.- CQC.- Russian Jungle- Can actually take on HL2 and Halo 2.Cons:- HIGHEST PS2 LEARNING CURVE. Takes hours to break in properly. Intro does not appear until a few hours.- Does not last forever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2005"}

I took everything out and tried to register my VITA with my Account ID. So I click on yes I have a PSN ID. It tells me that my system needs a update and then try again. Fine. I update my PS3 and reset it. Same message. PS3 needs update. There was no way to register it. So i click on NO PSN ID. Starts the system. I go in the menu and register it through that. But wait. My Vita won't recognize my Wi-Fi. Ok, I had the same problem with my original PSP. So I put my WI-FI to no password needed and it works. I downloaded free demos for the VITA onto my PS3. I connect my VITA and try to copy the VITA games.Error message. WTH!!!!!! So I can't figure it out. I decided to go on the PSN store on my VITA that worked. I download the demos, and find my history so I can download any compatible psp games. THERE WERE LIKE 3 GAMES!! THAT'S IT?? I couldn't believe how I can't use my past digital downloads. It can't be hard, right? So I figure I bought this thing for VITA games, so I'm just going to hope that other digital titles will be available later. BTW, as I go down my history from download games, it takes forever, because it's too hard to only show what is compatable with the system.I try to put movies on my VITA from my PS3. I won't recognize anything except a Uncharted Comic file, that it can't copy anyway. The PSP could do that with no problem. Why can't the Vita? So I did manage to get some music on it, but it couldn't recognize some of the names for some reason. Even tho I actually paid for them. I got the 32gb memory. It's almost full ALREADY!! If they are going to force us to buy their memory cards, couldn't they have made a BIGGER one? I still have my 64gb that I have for my PSP and I can't even use that?? (I already knew this before, but I'm still irritated). So right now I haven't actually played anything, but these reasons alone get a 3 star rating from me.I'm tired of Sony messing up, and not putting their customers first. If you take care of us, we'll take care of you. I'm on the verge of returning this. But I'm going to wait until my games are downloaded and play some before I decided. If I do, I'll do another update. On a final note, if any sony rep is reading this. If you can put something on your PS3, you should be able to put it on your VITA, meaning mostly movies files and music. Stop messing with your customers.  Especially  those  who support you guys time after time. I'm hoping the rest of my experience goes well with this. As for now I just have a headache. Also HIRE someone who can make a user friendly interface!Ok, a update. A friend brought over Uncharted, because mine still hasn't came in yet, and I'm turned around again. I love this game. I also had fun with the Augment Reality games. I raised the starts on my review. So, just be prepared for a little headache if your used to using the old psp. I'm glad I got it, but still a little irritated on how hard it is to use on the ps3. ALSO THE SOUND SUCKS! How my iPod is louder than this is a shame. Even with headphones, it seems a little lower than usual.  So a must buy if you only want the Vita games, but might be a little disappointed about not having your complete library on here.Ok, Ok, this is my last update. The more I play with it the better it gets. Im just going to take this as a new system and forget everything else. As a new system, its good. I love the games so far, and I raised my rating another star, lol... so if you get this system, take it as a brand new console and get over the old psp. Otherwise you'll be as frustrated as I was in the beginning.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2012"}

(I pre-ordered the PS4, the XBO was a gift.) Both made solid improvements in multiple areas and are awesome machines, but honestly I think your choice should hinge on what you use it for. Below is my review for the PS4 and also a comparison to the XBO:*Quick Overview*:- Get the PS4 if high-end 1080p graphics and price are the most important thing to you.- Get the XBO if you want a more well rounded platform, that has better controls, media support and network services.In short, the PS4 has more power under the hood, but the XBO has better controllers/camera, better network/cloud support, better app support, better media support. If high-end games are your thing, the PS4 might be better for you. If you do a wide range of things, the XBO might be better.*PlayStation Review*:The PS4 is a beautiful machine with nice aesthetics. I had no technical problems with it at all. The graphics are a very noticeable upgrade from the PS3 (especially in 1080p), but by far the best improvement is the controllers. They feel much better in the hand and include speakers. The biggest negative to new DS4 is the battery life. Not sure if the light drains it, but it has a short life comparison to the DS3. Finally, the UI is simple and clean; I like it a lot and it continues to have the advantage over the Xbox.While the exclusive PS4 launch titles are a bit weak, the \"arcade\" games are very nice. Resogun in particular is awesome. That and Contrast are \"free\" if you're on the PSN--which you get a complimentary 1-month subscription to in the box. Also noteworthy is Flower; while it's super short, it's very beautiful and different. And while I had fun with Knack and Killzone, Microsoft's Ryse and Dead Rising were a little better in my opinion. Regardless, the PS4 has nice \"launch window\" titles coming up and I am very excited about them (especially The Order: 1886 and inFamous)... great exclusives is a big reason I got both consoles. Throw in games like Assassin's Creed, Call of Duty and Battlefield, and you'll still have a nice library of games from the get-go.Where the PS4 really seems to come up short is it's non-game functionality and support. On the hardware side, it doesn't have an IR Blaster, so no remote control support. Also, it doesn't support 5Ghz Wireless networks (pretty weird for a device nowadays). Finally, it doesn't have an HDMI-in port, which is actually a huge deal after seeing how the XBO can manage TV with it. On the media side, it is also lacking. I haven't found a way to play my own music or videos on the PS4. Also, it won't support key apps like HBOGo or NFL Network. Finally, the PlayStation Network's past problems have been well documented and surfaced again on launch. In comparison, Microsoft's network has been solid; I didn't see any issues on their launch. Additionally, MS has a sizable advantage in cloud services overall.*PlayStation 4 vs XBOX One*:PS4 Advantages:+ Better graphics power/1080p Support+ Better price point+ Better \"arcade\" games+ Better looking and smaller case (no power brick!)XBO Advantages:+ Better overall game lineup+ Better network/cloud.+ Better controllers/cameras+ Better media support (TV, Music, Videos)+ Better app supportI hope that helps!My XBO Review: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OSVSKC1KQ45U/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN;=B00CMQTVK0&linkCode;=&nodeID;=&tag;=","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2013"}

Out of roughly 1 million units sold, 40 thousand had issues. That's .4% (DECIMAL 4 percent).That being said, the console is quiet, stays cool, and the DualShock 4 controller is amazing! I loved the DualShock 3 and the 4 builds on it. The ergonomics and size are just simply a better fit. What I find most amazing is the 3.5 mm headphone jack on the back of the controller. I can set options on the PS4 to divert all game and player sound to the jack. This means that any headset or earbuds that you have w/ a 3.5 mm jack and a built-in microphone, can be used. No wires going across the floor back the console.The only launch games I have played so far is Warframe, DC Universe Online, and Battlefield 4.  Warframe is a free-to-play 3rd person shooter. Free to download, free to play. Google Warframe for more info, but I will tell you that it's the coolest and most amazing 3rd person shooter yet. Can NOT get enough of it.Battlefield 4: Well, you decide for yourself. If you're  a Battlefield fan then you're sold. If not, I would recommend you give it a shot. It's a good FPS game that does require some strategy versus tactics.DC Universe Online is another free-to-play MMO like Warframe. While you can't play as your favorite DC hero, you can create a character that is based/inspired by one of your favorite heroes. DCUO is fun. It's definitely worth checking out. Besides, DCUO and Warframe are FREE!!!!Speaking of free games, to play online with the PS4 you now must be a PS Plus subscriber. This will set you back about $50 a year. While there are a lot of neat little perks to being a subscriber, every month Sony gives out free triple A titles. And I'm not talking about games that are 6 years old. No, in the past 3 months I've gotten, Battlefield 3, Hitman: Absolution, Xcom: Enemy Unknown, Binary Domain, Uncharted 3, Kingdoms of Amalur, and there's more that I'm forgetting. You get a LOT of \"free\" stuff with that subscription. It's a much better deal than other online LIVE gaming services (to which I also pay a fee to).Sony has delivered another quality product.

You're going to get a post apocalyptic first person shooter with some combat racing in an open ended world.  RAGE doesn't do anything better than any other game, but it's got great atmosphere and it's fun.Story:  8/10You are cryogenically frozen and wake up after the apocalypse to a world in ruins.  There are settlers who are trying to get by, an oppressive government, and cannibalistic mutants with anxiety issues.  The good news is that your body regenerates and even after you are dead, you can jumpstart your heart.  That makes you valuable to the people of this world because you can take a lickin' and keep on... err... shooting back.World:  9/10The world is beautifully detailed and fairly open ended.  The world acts as a combat driving track where you battle mutants in vehicles.  The paths take you to settlements, where you can buy items, play games, race cars, get quests or to 'dungeons' where you fight and collect loot.  It plays like an open ended RPG (without XP).  When you kill bad guys, you get ammo, money, and supplies for crafting.Gameplay:  7/10Aside from some mini-games in town, there are two basic types of gameplay:  Shooting and Combat Racing.Shooting is fun.  You get an arsenal of weapons with different ammo types, each designed for a different purpose.  All of the typical weapons are here:  Pistol, Machine Gun, Heavy Machine Gun, Crossbow, Sniper Rifle, Shotgun, and Plasma Weapon.  You can also assign 4 quick use items to the LB button.  These include a bladed boomerang, grenades, various automated combat bots, regeneration buffs, damage buffs, quick heal, etc...  The enemies come in two basic flavors.  Armored Govt. Troops who fight with high tech weapons, and acrobatic mutants who are hard to hit.  Overall, combat is fun, especially after you get gun upgrades.  In addition to upgrades, RAGE has a simple, yet rewarding Crafting System, where you find items in the world, or buy them, and assemble useful items with the press of a button.Combat Racing is also fun, especially after you upgrade your vehicles' armor, weapons, handling, speed, ramming damage...  There are three basic types of races:  Timed Laps, Non-Combat Race, Combat Race with Weapons, and Rally Races with Weapons.  These are all straightforward.  Come in first on the 3rd Lap and you win.  The Rally Races are a bit more complex.  The first car to hit a checkpoint gets awarded 5 points and the checkpoint teleports to the next location.  If you destroy another car, you get 3 points.  First car to 50 wins!  Any car that gets destroyed respawns in 2 seconds.  So there are two strategies.  Stay in first place and hit the checkpoints, or if you fall behind, go to another part of the map and wait for the checkpoints to activate, then you can jump ahead of the other cars.There are two main reasons that RAGE falls short of being a GREAT Game.  First, there are heavy RPG elements, but there is no XP.  Without XP, you can't level up your character, which feels less rewarding than other games.  In the Shooter aspects of the game, you can't pick up enemy guns.  You only have your guns and you can only scrounge a bit of ammo from the corpses.  So this feels restricting.Graphics:  10/10The graphics are incredibly smooth and the art direction is great.  The settlements have character and the characters have personality.  The post apocalyptic world is stylized and is fairly realistic.  The animations are great, and the visual effects are well done.Sound:  9/10The explosions punctuate the action and the music sets the mood.  The dialogue is well acted, too.Maturity:  MatureThere is lots of gore, violence, and dismembered body parts.  There's some foul language as well.  No nudity though.  An apocalyptic wasteland isn't a sexy place...  unless you are into dirty hillbilly mechanics.Replay Value:  6/10The game is about 12-20 hours long, depending on how many side quests you do and there are 4 difficulty levels.  There is only one ending and you don't get dialogue options, so there really isn't any reason to replay the game.Online, there is a short Co-op set of missions that you can play with a friend and a Twisted Metal type vehicle combat game that you can play with others.  It's more of a mini-game, than the stuff you get with other shooters, so in the Multiplayer Shooter Dept, RAGE is lacking.Overall:  7/10RAGE won a bunch of E3 Awards and was poised to be a Game of the Year contender.  It fell short, but it's still a fun game, especially if you can get it for under $20.  The graphics engine is incredibly smooth and the world is great.  The gameplay feels a bit weak because it doesn't do anything better than any other game.  It's just good overall.  If you're looking for 20 hours of post apocalyptic shooting for $20, pick it up.If you liked RAGE, and wanted more weapons and more things to kill, play Borderlands.If you liked RAGE and wanted more of an RPG feeling, then the Fallout series is good.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0012N5MIO","reviewerName":"Caleb Williams","summary":"The Definitive Button Masher.","reviewText":"The game of Street Fighter sure is a legendary one and something that has a fond place in the hearts of many gamers. The super Nintendo was what made this game famous and now Street Fighter makes its first leap onto the next generation of gaming. What made Street Fighter so famous were its easy playability and its general simplicity, but the coolness of the more memorable characters was the icing on the cake. Some of the sequels following its initial debut were disappointing to say the least as they sought to try and make the original formula better, but let's be honest; you can rarely improve upon perfection.Street Fighter and Street Fighter II were easily the best of the series up to this point. Any in between are easily forgotten about. So it was with much trepidation that Street Fighter IV was heard by the ears of many old school fans asking \"please not another torturous piece of garbage.\" Little did they know that Capcom were planning to go back to through the traditional route and returning to the idea of simplicity and fun, but adding to the awesome imagery of the past. It also planned to bring back a lot of the characters who were discarded by Street Fighter 3 and told the makers of that \"you can't get rid of the coolness.The game itself tries very hard to return to the traditional feel of the past games, but also to bring it up to date so it would look fitting for the PS3 generation. The 6 button fight system and the 2D platform fighting format make a very welcome return, and thankfully they don't try and take it to the 3D fighting experience and just have it be annoying. The fighters are designed with an anime style cell shading which gives them both the cartoonish image, whilst maintaining a 3D next Generation appearance. The fighting backgrounds are entirely 3D and are immensely detailed and add a lot to the whole experience.The fighting is something very enjoyable indeed as the game is very responsive to a persons' button mashing ways and I certainly found myself hitting any and every button and pulling off an amazing \"ultimate combo.\" There are of course the combinations that you can master in order to pull off these moves once you've filled your \"Super\" bar to an acceptable level, but if you're like me, you'll just hit any and every button until something really cool happens and it will eventually, I promise. The main roster of characters is drawn straight from Street Fighter II and has a few wonderful additions to its roster. Abel, the French amnesiac. Rufus, the fat American and Seth, Dr. Manhattan on LSD. In addition to a few others of course.The collector's edition to this game, contains a 65 minute anime film called \"The Ties That Bind\" which could possibly explain the beginning and end anime scenes from the arcade mode for each character. The arcade mode is simply a way of fighting through a number of wonderful foes to reach the dreaded Seth. He's a really tough one to beat I must say. The game also contains a challenge mode which consists of Time Trial and Survival for both Normal and Hard difficulty. They can be a chore, but are certainly a good way of helping you become familiar with the game so you can become ready to take on the legendary Gouken who can only be unlocked through a certainly difficult and complicated manner.The online mode is pretty simple but offers certain awards that will certainly convince you to give it a darn good go. You can unlock a number of badges and other particular awards, and also accrue a number of points for every impressive win you pull off, meaning you can progress through the ranks and become the best of the best. There is absolutely no lag in the gameplay from what I noticed and even if it recommends you only connect to those with a superb online connection, I had no problem connecting to and playing those who had a terribly low connection. I've only managed to win one online match so far.This is a highly enjoyable game with lots of replay value and a high addiction capability which I'm sure will have many complaining relationships have broken up because of it. I would highly recommend it to those loyal fans of the series and it's certainly hard to imagine that it almost didn't get made.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2009"}

{"product_name":"B002673XJA","reviewerName":"Andariel Halo \"Disillusioned Smark\"","summary":"A lifetime subscriber speaks","reviewText":"I think I made a big mistake applying for the lifetime subscription.  Nevertheless, as you note from my fun rating, I am stuck with the game, and fully devoted to it.Nevertheless, in case anyone from Cryptic Studios Star Trek Online department happens to read this and identify who I am in the game, if they are petty enough to try to punish me in-game for my comments, I defend myself by saying I will remain loyal to this game not merely out of monetary commitment, but because it is still fun.I have never played an MMORPG before.  I tried World of Warcraft for a few minutes, but never bought in.And so, because of my pre-order bonus, I got to play the beta of this game, and all throughout the beta, I sincerely hoped that this was merely the beta version and the final release would be vastly improved.No.  It's not.  The beta was about as complete a game as you'll get.  The only changes I noticed were constant changes to the user interface and style of the cursor and buttons.The bad:- Graphics are horribly out of date.  An MMORPG like this extending to casual gamers cannot have Modern Warfare 2 or Mass Effect graphics, lest it alienate those without Alienware (Oh God, stupid pun!).  Even so, the graphics are something that would be top of the line in 2004 or 2005.- Character customization is deep, with many options, but some odd exclusions are sincerely annoying, such as an inability to adjust cheekbones, meaning you can shape or deform the head any way you want, but you'll STILL have jutting cheekbones.  As well, there are boring choices for hair, colors are heavily muted for eyes, skin, and hair, meaning you can't have bold colored aliens.- Almost no variety at all in quests, which make up about 80% of the total gameplay.  I guess the term they use is \"grind\".  The grinding in this game is annoying to a huge degree.  You're forced to play a stale tutorial as soon as you start up involving wandering around a ship, killing Borg drones almost insultingly easily, all on your own sometimes, then beaming down to a planet and killing more Borg drones to save colonists.  Then your captain arbitrarily dies, meaning YOU get to command a ship despite you being a mere Lieutenant.And this is the exact same startup for EVERY Federation character, even if you make more than one.  Then you can acquire missions from various commanders, Admirals, etcetera, and they are NOT randomized---the \"Patrol X Sector\" or \"Stop the Signal\" missions you get with your first character you will get with your next character, etcetera and so on.And almost every mission involves war.  They really bring to mind that unfortunate realization by Picard in \"Insurrection\", where he remarked \"Remember when we used to be explorers?\"  Maybe it's justified here since the story is that the Klingons have been manipulated into going to war with the Federation (Those Klingons have always been so easy to manipulate after TOS) plus the war with the Romulan remnants, and occasional Borg shenanigans.And yet even these missions are preferable to some of the absolute worst---the ones where you do nothing at all.  One of the worst offenders was one on a Federation colony where the workers are close to mutiny.  They're dissatisfied and want change (YES WE CAN!).  Your mission is... to \"talk\" to them, then report all this to Starfleet.  You don't even need to read what they say, just find them, click \"Talk\", then find someone else and do the same.  And I do mean FIND because they are inexplicable scattered across a small area of the map, with no radar indications as to where they are.You just talk to them, talk to Starfleet, and your mission is complete.  That was the absolute worst mission I have experienced in this game.But really, the missions are boring and grinding, and you only get a choice of three minor ships to start your career, after which you must advance TEN levels in order to reach the next rank and get a newer ship.  So learn to love your Wrath of Khan USS Reliant-style ship.- Ground combat isn't boring, but it sure isn't fun.  It's probably one of the few times in an RPG where, not pressed for time or sick of playing repetitive levels, I have actively sought to NOT fight as many enemies as possible.  This is simply because it's just too boring---enemy AI usually consists of the drones attacking your officers, while some random arses just charge at you and start shooting you from 2 feet away.  At least, this has been Klingon strategy ad nauseum.  And Phasers somehow lost their disintigration powers, as it can take nearly a dozen Phaser lances to kill an average Klingon grunt.Even worse, there seems to be a perpetual lag in ground combat, even when you're all alone in an isolated location.  Sometimes, if you try to attack enemies with punches and kicks and such, you'll be seen striking them, only for them to be knocked back a half-second later.  Sometimes if you bash an enemy with your rifle to knock them over, nothing will happen to them.  Sometimes if you attack an enemy with a long-range bolt from behind, they will stand there for a full two seconds before suddenly keeling over.They tried to make the ground combat live-fire live action combat (unlike KOTOR), and it ends up feeling turn-based anyway due solely to this inexplicable delay in hit processing.  What's even worse is you can't even fire shots from rifles or phasers repeatedly---there's a cooloff period for them which is your deathknell in situations where you are faced with a dozen enemies and your bridge officers are engaged with other enemies.- For a space game taking place in space, space is wholly uninteresting and painfully small.  There's a very sharp sense of isolation, even, in which system maps are completely separate areas from sector maps.That is, when you go to the Solar system, you are not only centered entirely around Earth orbit, but you cannot contact people NOT in the area, and you cannot interact with them.  When you want to warp out, you go into this huge \"Sector\" map which is completely unrealistic and a huge and jarring snap out of immersion, as a space-like environment suddenly becomes a big blue room with stupid-looking icons representing planetary systems, and huge blue lines connecting them via trade lanes.  And major sector blocks are separated from each other, so you feel like you're in a room, with other sector names painted on the walls.For a very good example, this is almost exactly like the Family Guy episode \"Road to Rhode Island\" where Brian and Stewie escape from the Pope on a hot air balloon, then see the world below them and marvel at how it looks exactly like it does on maps, with the countries literally labeled with their names and such.Space travel is in no way realistic, and you literally CAN travel the entire galaxy in less than an hour.  This is great for a video game with intentions at luring in casual gamers, but it does horrors for realism and for Star Trek fans, especially fans of Voyager, who would be sickened to learn that a 70 year voyage from the Delta Quadrant to Earth would likely take 12 minutes in this game at Warp 7.But then, the good:- You can curse.  I know it sounds stupid, but provided you uncheck the \"filter profanity\" in the chat options, you can curse all you want.  It's very liberating.- Space combat.  I was heavily disappointed at the failure to fully exploit 3D space combat and a sticking to the idea of \"Space is an Ocean\"---I would have loved to fly straight \"down\" and find a Klingon fleet seemingly \"upside down\" from my position.  Instead, your ships cannot fly straight up or down, but can come very close.Regardless, space combat has a VERY heavy maritime feel, as you can move swiftly, yet slowly, to a target, and open fire upon them with different weapons in different places, pulling broadside attacks, or exploiting \"three-dimensional warfare\" as best you can in a \"Wrath of Khan\" style of attacking someone from above or below.Even though I catch myself constantly feeling disappointed by the highly monotonous action of space combat, consisting of slow turns and nonstop clicking of the fire buttons, this never gets old or boring for me.  At least, not yet.  Joining a Fleet and communicating and coordinating with them makes this an even greater experience.The best comparison I can give is Freelancer.  In Freelancer (and depending on the mods you use) space essentially IS an Ocean---if you turn upside down, your ship will inexplicably turn rightside up again.  You can execute U-turns in space up and down, but there's really no reason to.  Space combat is a highly face-to-face affair where you will spend more than 70% of the time just turning around to face an enemy and fire at them with forward-firing weapons.  It's an unpleasant experience all around.Here, although you move a lot slower, it's incredibly more satisfying to spew lasers on enemies, in the hopes of just denting their shields, or slowly turning about in order to broadside an enemy from above while an ally strikes them from below, or experiencing the VERY REAL danger of a mortally wounded enemy ship about to explode, and you having to flee the area, as it explodes, and does damage to your shields and hull if you're too close.A frequent MMORPG player would find this game an insult, a shoddy and tawdry creation, with any and all redeeming features either insignificant, or up to future patches and development.This is my first MMORPG, and I plan on sticking with it.Any and all questions, I'll answer immediately in the comments section","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2010"}

The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

{"product_name":"B0016BVYAM","reviewerName":"Nathan Beauchamp \"ConsumerAdvocate (nathan(at...","summary":"Pointless installation limit + Windows Live +  Online Activation = FAIL","reviewText":"This review is intended to help educate potential buyers of Bioshock 2 about a few of the major downsides of the way 2K has decided to sell the game. If you've already made up your mind to buy it, or already own it, this review isn't for you. If on the other hand you're on the fence, I'd love to point out a few things that are very troubling about Bioshock 2:1) The game REQUIRES online activation. If you are a serviceman/servicewoman stationed in Baghdad (or anywhere in the field without internet) you're totally screwed. Requiring an internet connection to activate is offensive in itself, but coupled with the other major issues with this game's DRM scheme, it just keeps getting worse.2) The game limits the number of times you can install it. I don't care if they give me 1,000 installs, any limit on how long I can use a game I paid for simply isn't acceptable. I'm not paying for the 'privilege' of installing how ever many times 2K or anyone else thinks is appropriate. If I buy a game, I want to actually BUY it, meaning I OWN IT and CAN DO WHAT I WANT WITH IT. If I buy the game and don't like it, how can I resell it? How can I verify to the person I'm selling it to that it has installations left? This is just a petty and insulting way to treat paying customers. I don't want to have to come crawling back to 2K or Microsoft to explain why I might need more installations for a game I already gave them forty or more dollar for. And what if they close their doors at some point in the future? How can I be guaranteed I'll still have access to my game?3) Securom, the DRM package used by Bioware, installs with the game and there is no option to install it without Securom. That means you get a program running in the background when you play the game that can create issues for other programs on your computer. Don't believe me? I experienced all sorts of issues with the Securom that installed with Mass Effect I including it screwing up my drivers for my optical drives because it didn't like the fact that I has DeamonTools on my computer. I don't want crapware or potential security threats loading on my computer alongside the game!4) You MUST create a WindowsLive account if you want to access certain parts of the game. I hate WindowsLive and everything to do with it and don't want to create accounts to play my game. I want to install it, run the game, and be on my merry way. Forcing creation of an account is what marketers call \"forced opt-in\" and it opens you up to all sorts of information mining so that Microsoft or whoever collects the data can sell it to marketing companies. Forced opt-ins just flat out suck and I hate when companies force you to jump through their hoops to play their game.SO WHY DOES THE GAME COME LOADED UP WITH THIS NONSENSE????2K would say its to fight piracy. I say bull-****. DRM doesn't affect pirates as they're already downloading the widely available and free versions of this (and any other game) from torrent sites. To the inevitable idiots who will spam the comments of this review accusing me of being either a pirate or too poor to buy the game: 1) I own literally hundreds of games and paid for every single one of theme and 2) if I was a pirate I'd already be playing the game from a torrent site without any of the limitations of DRM. Bottom line: if you want to pirate the game, it's pretty amazingly easy. I don't pirate because I'm honest, but neither do I give my money to game makers who like to insult my intelligence by telling me DRM is 'necessary' or that force me to install crapware on my computer.Thanks but no thanks. I'll take a pass on this one.**********UPDATE 02/17/2010**********I had the opportunity to play Bioshock II on my friend's Xbox. Frankly I wasn't impressed with the game itself. It's very much a copy of the original game with very little that is new. I thought the game would center around being an all powerful Big Daddy. You do play as a Big Daddy, but you're not any stronger than the human character starting out in Bioshock I. I expected them to let you be more powerful but also introduce more powerful / numerous opponents. Instead, the same collection of splicers come in twos and threes just like the original game. So as a Big Daddy, it takes 2-3 melee hits (with a huge-*** drill bit mind you) to kill a splicer. It takes them 4-5 melee hits to kill you. That's just simply stupid considering when you fight another Big Daddy it takes a HUGE amount of firepower to bring one down. The whole concept of being a Big Daddy is diminished because you really are not any more powerful.It's like they took EVERYTHING from the first game, just tweaked it a bit, and called it a new game. There is nothing new that feels significant. The weapons are not exciting, and some of them feel almost useless (the shotgun for one). Only the spear gun and rivet gun have a satisfying quality to them.You still have the same simplistic moral choice (harvest or rescue Little Sisters), the same voice over the radio guiding you, and the same antagonistic voice prodding you along as you progress through the game. You get plasmids in the same order (electricity, then fire, then ice) and use them to solve the same problems as before (opening doors with electricity, melting snow with fire, etc...). Really it feels like they just redid the first game with less compelling characters and a less compelling storyline.I'm actually VERY glad I didn't buy this game, even if it were DRM free because it isn't that interesting. It's a rehash of the first and doesn't have anything really remarkable to distinguish it. Honestly, I've played MODS that were free that provided a better gaming experience than this. A good example would be the BT MOD for Oblivion which made Oblivion feel like an entirely new game. For the price 2k is asking (full retail for a new game!) it's just ridiculous.There are much better options out there. Go get Mass Effect II if you don't have it yet, or even Call of Pripyat from the venerable STALKER series. Both are a lot better than this.Final thoughts:It doesn't bother me if you want to buy this game and install it. I just want you to have all the facts before you do. If you don't agree with my perspective that's fine--this is a free country (assuming you live in the USA). Bottom line: some people do care about protecting consumer rights and I'm one of those people. Agree or disagree, I think everyone should have the right to information about the product they're buying. Especially when the game itself isn't even that great.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0002B90SA","reviewerName":"Jonathan","summary":"Any other predecessor, this would have been a good game","reviewText":"KotOR II suffers from the same dilemma the Star Wars movie prequels did: so many people knew and loved the original and had such high hopes for the new material. The new material got there, and it looked like it should and stuck to the formula it should, but somehow ends up not being what it should be.This game picks up five years after the original KotOR. After the Jedi Civil War, the Sith have been resurgent and incredibly successful at killing the Jedi, so much so that you are the last known living Jedi. What could be worse than having the entire Sith force hell-bent on killing you? You're an exiled Jedi and have been stripped of all your powers.It's an intriguing premise, and for most of the game plays out well, as the characters you gather all have their own little sub-plots, and are now influenced by your actions as well (i.e. if you become incredibly evil, as a whole your party will get more evil). The addition of many new items, customization options and Force powers take the formula that worked well in KotOR and add some good stuff to it.However, KotOR has some serious flaws. First of, the load time required is abhorrent. Every five minutes the game has to load a new area, and this load can take 2-10 minutes (made even worse if you're running the game on an Xbox 360 because of the emulator required to play it). The framerate is also a serious issue, because this game tends to forgo the boss battles of KotOR and instead throw a metric ton of normal and mini-boss-level enemies at you. Having so much going on at once is too much for the game's engine, the framerate becomes choppy, then the game goes to 1 fps or less, and your gameplay is toast. All the conversation bugs that were in KotOR are here too, and are worse in most cases - in my one play-through the character Mira, once in my party, never said a word in plot-driven scenes because the game would display her dialog for a fraction of a second and then skip to the next character, often leaving me lost.And, no spoilers here, the ending I got wasn't really an ending at all. After defeating the final boss, the ending felt like it was setting me up for the next level, which would come up after a short cut scene - but that cut scene turned out to be the credits, and I said - out loud - \"I did not just suffer through 40 hours of load screens for THAT, did I?\" And there's no epic plot twist, either; you have your suspicions within the first few hours, and about halfway in you - the player, that is - know what's going on, even if your characters don't, which takes away a lot of drama.If you liked KotOR, you'll like this game because it sticks to the formula. Everything about KotOR II, however, reeks of a \"cash-in\" sequel, so expect as much when you play it, especially when it comes to plot quality.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2009"}

I'd heard a little about this version, but until I played it, I never realized how much it enhanced the original Resident Evil game.For starters, the top display window constantly displays the in-game map. When the player gets injured, the top screen pulses with different colors:Purple: PoisonedYellow: WoundedRed: Near deathThis is a vast improvement over thePlaystation version, since the health bar and the map screens had to be accessed using the select button. Here, they are available at all times.There are a few places where character animations or dialogue was altered, such as the inclusion of Kenneth's decapitated head, as in theSega Saturn version, and different voiceovers for the Richard character. Subtitles were added, a big plus for gamers with hearing difficulties. Otherwise, the game remains largely untouched.Playing as Jill gives the player access to more powerful weapons, but she is more vulnerable to injuries. Chris can take more damage from foes but he does not have the lockpick, so he has to spend time gathering keys.The Classic Mode storyline for Deadly Silence is the same as the first Resident Evil game on the Playstation. Rebirth Mode is a little tougher, with a few extras to keep veterans like myself interested enough to play it again:(1) New puzzles: Certain rooms have puzzles that were never in the original version and require the Stylus or the DS microphone, which enhances the overall experience.(2) Knife fights: There are random areas where the game switches to a first-person mode and a knife fight begins. Players can use the Stylus to stab or slash enemies and blow into the microphone to deflect zombie acid back onto them. This mode takes some getting used to, but it makes the game much more interesting.The rewards from the original Resident Evil are also found here. Finishing the game in 3 hours or less earns a Rocket Launcher with infinite rounds for the next play-through. Saving your two comrades earns a Special Key to change your character's wardrobe.One extra mode of play is the \"Master of Knifing\" mini-game. This is a 5 level endurance round designed to test your skills with the blade against several different enemies. Using the blade for one-slash kills and successful hits in a row earns a higher score.Another extra mode is Multi-card play. Here, you play wirelessly with another player on their DS, either in Versus mode or Co-op mode. The object is to reach the goal alive, either with your comrade, or to arrive before they do.In Versus mode, defeating certain enemies can strengthen your opponent's enemies, or render your opponent unable to run.In Co-op mode, you and your ally share the same life bar and your enemies share the same life bar.There are 10 characters available in Multi-card play with different strengths & weaknesses, and each one is unlocked with different requirements.As far as drawbacks, there are only a few that come to mind.(1) The knife fighting can take some getting used to. Players need to time strikes carefully and this requires patience for players not familiar with the Stylus.(2) Multi-card play mode is not available for single-player use, which is unfair - single players should have the option to try this endurance round without a partner.(3) The game does not save when the unit is turned off or if the battery power runs out. The Sony PSP can save game progress in stand-by mode until the unit is charged or turned on again, but that's not an option with the Nintendo DS.If you're a fan of the original Resident Evil, the DS version will sate your \"on the go\" zombie urges and has a few extras to keep you coming back, but if you want a different storyline, you'll have to look to another gaming platform.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2009"}
{"product_name":"B004L4G8UC","description":"","reviewerName":"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","summary":"Great turn-based strategy","reviewText":"If I could sum up Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars in five words or less, it would be this: Fire Emblem with guns. Considering that I believe the Fire Emblem series to be the best turn based game of any sort, I'd call that high praise indeed.The premise is quite simple and should be no surprise to veteran strategy gamers. You move your units around on a grid, have a variety of weapon types and character skills, and typically control a small squad of 4-8 Ghosts. Each character has strengths and weaknesses, and as they gain experience they gain new skills and are harder to kill in general. Occasionally you run into allies or doodads on the field of battle that can help your cause, such as control points which eventually allow you to use support powers. Characters also have 'super' skills they can activate if they perform enough actions or deal enough damage.Weapon types range from handguns to sniper rifles, and most characters have a secondary weapon or skill. Some of them are quite interesting- engineers, for example, can drop a single stationary machine gun turret that does crazy damage, but needs to be manually picked up to be moved as a full turn action. Some weapons do splash damage or are more effective against certain targets, and some have limited ammo that can be replenished by finding ammo crates. All in all, there's enough weapons and associated tactics to make the game fun just on that aspect.That's not all there is to it though. Shadow Wars also has terrain features such as buildings, elevation, and partial cover. Units in buildings, for instance, take very little damage from enemies outside. To effectively deal with enemies under cover, you'll either have to go in and flush them out or use explosives like grenades. Being on higher ground- which is quite noticeable thanks to the fact it's 3D- allows you to hit enemies at longer range. Additionally, certain unit types can support one another by returning fire when a nearby ally takes damage. This can be lethal if you group up your party, but it also makes you an easier target for AOE attacks.Shadow Wars has a pretty lengthy campaign, plus challenges and multiplayer. Like most versions of Advance Wars (another of my favorites) you can use multiplay with one 3DS. The graphics and sound are good- not spectacular, but a decent showing for the 3DS. Some of the environmental effects in particular are well done. You can zoom the camera from an isometric to a top-down view with the thumbstick, and all the standard grid highlighting is present. Areas range from underground bunkers to mountain battlefields, and although most of the maps are a bit small there's enough going on for each to be interesting.I really have no complaints about Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars. It's a great strategy title for the 3DS- on par with any others of the genre released for previous platforms. In fact, it's one of the better handheld games I've ever seen. Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2011"}

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Icebergtech","summary":"Better Than The First","reviewText":"I'm Going to keep this simple.

Conker encounters abusive paint pots; jabbering dung beetles; trigger-happy, scar-faced Tediz; and a belligerent giant, with only a frying pan as a means of self-defense.

Thankfully, Conker BFD not only lives up to the hype, but goes further by forging new ground in videogaming.  By now you've no doubt been unable to escape all the talk of the crass, potty mouthed humor through out the game and have no fear, it's all true. I won't go into all the gory details, but suffice it to say that you don't want to play this when little Billy or anyone with a weak stomach is in the room. The game is laugh out loud funny and more than once I found myself playing with a huge grin plastered on my face. But what I find even more incredible are the game mechanics.Graphically and sonically the game surpasses anything seen on the N64 before. Colors are bright, edges are sharp and defined and Rare's work on lip synching is incredible. All the characters have expressive faces and fluid movements. Conker will even make a grimace as he passes characters he's angry at! I was also impressed with the amount of cut scenes in the game. Upon entering each new area you'll see a comical scene to explain the objective. In addition, while playing you'll hit some points and a scene starts, but there's no break or cut away, it's just like playing a movie. The jazz-like music through out the game is crystal clear and presented in surround sound to boot! It's hard to belive it's all coming off a cartridge. This is one game soundtrack that I'll be playing loud. If it's ever relesed on CD I'm sure it will be playing on many many CD players across the country.As impressive as these things are, it wouldn't matter much if gmeplay wasn't there to pull you in to experience it all. Thankfully this isn't a problem for BFD. This isn't a typical platformer where all you do is collect items and bash baddies. Rare has desigend the game to be more puzzle based. When you do find yourself hunting for items it's to assist another character and finding it generates an advance in the games plot. Every quest is expertly linked to a the next, so eventhough you need to achieve somehting in one place to further in another you're free to go off and try something else if you get stumped. And that's another thing, progress in the game really flows. Nothing was sooo hard to figure out that I was pulling out my hair. With a little thought and pateince, this is a game can beat without a cheat book. How's that for a change of pace? Without a doubt the best innovation are the context sensitive buttons scattered about the game. when you step onto one or enter a context sensitive area a lightbulb appears above Conkers head and a you hear ping. This is your cue that something special will happen here if you hit the &quot;B&quot; button. Doing this allows Conker to weild flamethrowers, chainsaws, take pills and even turn into an anvil! It's a great idea that gives Conker many items to use and become that you'd otherwise have to hut for in a standard game.Last word, if you are over 17 and have an N64 you must own this game! It's one of the best games available on any system and is sure to set new standards in game design and humor. This is a MUST buy guys!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2001"}

{"product_name":"B000UW21A0","description":"Sony Uncharted: Drake's Fortune 98103 PC Games","reviewerName":"Adron Gardner","summary":"A Great Experiment","reviewText":"Just before picking up Uncharted 3 and now having completed it on Hard, I had played through the first two games again to get back into the Drake story and really try and enjoy it as a total experience.  Having first played Drakes Fortune three years ago, I was eager to step back into the game and see how well it held up.If we look at it from 2007 eyes, Drakes Fortune was a really well made first gen PS3 title.  Clearly modeled in the Gears of War mold, and openly admitted to by Naughty dog,  the developers of Drake's Fortune went their own way.  Sure you have cover and third person shooting, but after 5 minutes you can easily say Drake would smoke Marcus Fenix in a firefight.  Why?  That's easy, while Marcus can roll and run, Drake can do all that, but he can also swim, climb, swing and even more simply, unlike any characters in Gears of War, Drake can jump.  Story-wise, there is a real investment in rich characters that would pay off in big ways as Naughty Dog expanded the series in the later two games.  The interactions and plot aren't anywhere near as deep as Among Thieves or Drake's Deception, but for a first installment of a totally new series, it is difficult to get as many things right as Drake's Fortune manages to do.  The visuals were a bar higher than most other games in 2007 and they still look lush most of the time.  However, the tech was in it's infancy back in those days and textures load slowly and do not carry the detail we have been spoiled with in the other games.As it was said in Drakes Deception, \"Great things come from small beginnings.\"  And going back to play this after a few years, while you can see where the greatness came from, that's not to say it isn't without a few notable flaws.  In taking on the Gears of War influence, Naughty Dog also took what is arguably the biggest flaw, and often most overlooked problem, of the entire Gears franchise - namely one  too many rooms of repetitive enemy hordes. While, at least the pirates here seem to be smarter and move much faster than the Locust and Lambent,  I don't remember how many times I ran out of ammo slogging through pirate onslaughts all the while dodging way too many accurate grenade throws and seeing a gray death screen.  It's not unheard of for a game developer to up the enemy count to compensate for the brevity of a game and so this is not really a total loss, but it is noticeable and, at times, pretty frustrating even on Normal difficulty.  Having more than redeemed themselves with deeper and more refined sequels, Naughty Dog gets a pass on this one, but not totally.  There are no multiplayer or co-op modes to speak of, so trophies (graciously added after the initial release) and jewel hunting are the only things to keep you playing after the story closes.Drake's Fortune is still a good game.  It's fun, but even on normal difficulties, can be punishingly difficult to clear the \"horde mode\" style waves of pirates.  The graphics still hold up, if not as high as they were seen and the shooting, platforming and puzzles add good variety to the overall package.  After finishing Gears of War 3, I couldn't help but wonder why so little of the series changed from the first game to the last.  In Uncharted, this is not the case.  Drake's Fortune was a great experiment, mixing several gameplay types in a package that, at least for a few hours, kept you playing until the end.  Even better, it served as a solid foundation of a series that, while recognizable in form, evolved far beyond its roots into something quite amazing and a rich mix of cinematic, puzzles, platforming and shooting no other game has bothered to take on.  There are some shortcomings, but this is still a good game.  Looking back at its flaws, you can sense just how far ahead the successive chapters are in comparison.  There is not a single other series in gaming I know that has come from such small beginnings to end up so unique in the end.Let's hope they keep up the trend at Naughty Dog.  I pity the competition.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2011"}

However, with the Lego games, Traveler's Tales have found their perfect balance. I'll admit, though, this is the first Lego game I've ever played or purchased. If you're not familiar with the Lego games, however, it's gameplay is this..The player fights enemies, platforms, builds things in Lego fashion, and tries to figure out puzzles given to them in order to progress through the game. Each character has their own ability. Batman and Robin can change their outfits to give themselves different abilities. The story isn't based off a movie or even a comic-book plot. This is an original tale of Traveler's Tales which is that all the enemies of Arkham Asylum have escaped and it is up to the Dynamic Duo to stop them. I'm here to tell you, though, the cutscenes get pretty hilarious. Robin is a complete goofball in this game who provides a good percentages of the laughs. I loved it.However, I do have some complaints. I didn't like how the game left you to figure out things on your own as to what to do and where to go. Given this was my first Lego game, I expected- at least- a short explanation as to what to do & whatnot to progress through the game. Sad to say, it took a couple of hours before I truly understood the gist of the game to go on by myself. Another thing that annoyed me was the bad AI with your computer-controlled character, at times. There are puzzles that require cooperation between Batman and Robin. You'll be trying to get your partner to stand on a platform that will be raised when you pull a switch or whatever and he continually jumps off before you can do so. So, I ended up racing to do things so he could make it to where he needed to go. Thankfully, though, it doesn't happen too too often in the game and that is a blessing.To be honest, I bought the game clearly on the Batman license alone and I'm very glad I did.Overall, Lego Batman:The Videogame is a great game that fans of all ages will enjoy.

This is so the developers' pre-programmed set pieces can emerge in a very cinematic but contrived fashion in all their glory. So it was with massive disappointment that Alan Wake made it clear from the outset that I'd be traveling down endless corridors furnished with invisible walls, random locked doors and magical force-field engorged vegetation. It has to be a great game that can win my heart with those sorts of physical boundaries. But it can happen - Gears of War for example is a great game despite the lack of freedom to roam given to the player and so I plodded on hoping that Wake would also prove to be an equally great game.Unfortunately, it's not. There's lots of reasons for this, some trite with no impact on gameplay such as the terrible character animation on Wake which you have to endure throughout the game, and others game-breaking like the shooting mechanic or the laughable car driving physics.I've read that Wake is considered to be a psychological crime thriller, not a survival horror. It fails on both. The former, the storyline is a mess and it feels like I'm watching Lost with the writers clearly having zero clue where they were going with it all. And given that most of the story is told not via the sub-2002 graphically ugly cut scenes but from a single jpeg of a book page read aloud in the most boring tone since Mass Effect 2. The latter, the horror element, is ruined by one major game feature - the camera pan. The moment you're about to be attacked the camera pans out to reveal where the attack is coming from. This zoom out occurs each and every time a bad guy spawns when you cross whatever trigger caused it to materialize. It's such a spoiler and the game would have benefited so much more without it. The game would have also been massively improved if you could switch off the HUD and the ridiculous white text that is on screen throughout. GET TO THE BARN in 20 pitch font kind of breaks the immersion here guys.The game also has one of my biggest pet peeves in the history of gaming. And that's when the game arbitrarily chooses to relieve you of your inventory. Hey I found a super-bright light... sorry you don't get to keep that. That shotgun you like? Gone and you're back to the pistol. Now there are times where this makes sense in a game such as when you're arrested in Wake - I understand I'd be searched and have such items confiscated, but other times you just lose your stuff. At one point Alan Wake climbs into a helicopter and when it lands I had lost everything I'd been holding. Why? Because the game devs decided the next 'level' would be too easy with those items? It's just lazy and it happens multiple times for no valid reason.Five years ago Alan Wake showed all the promise of a killer-ap, the game was developed by the folks who gave us Max Payne and sequel (a vastly superior corridor thriller by the way) and the early tech demos showcased amazing time transformations and a huge environment.But the reality is Alan Wake looks like a budget game made three or four years ago and offers naught but a few hours of mediocre entertainment. At best it's a rental and that's the real crime here.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2010"}

I don't like games where I have to do a lot of button mashing in combat.  Which is to say in a game like Fable, I was casting spells and shooting my guns, and in oblivion I never used the swords but relied on magic.And my favorite games are games like Mass Effect, Fallout 3, Gears, Left 4 Dead, and Call of Duty.Which is probably why I disliked the original Assassin's Creed so much.  It felt overwhelming.  I couldn't \"get\" the combat.  I didn't enjoy it at all.  I felt like it threw you in to the deep end right from the beginning.  I played it a few hours, got probably less than 100 gamer score out of it, and put it down forever.I found this for 39 bucks and picked it up against my better instincts.  And you know what?  I'm really starting to like it.  This game does a much better job of immersing you in the story and the controls.  It all feels more structured--though technically open world--and it is more of a guided experience.  At least the main story line is.  There's not a lot of time spent traveling, and I like that.  And as much as I hate button-mashing combat, that part of the game is actually pretty simple (no stupid combos--just fluid like on Arkham Asylum).Sprinkle in the exploration, multiple ways to attack a plot point, and the RPG elements, and you have a very impressive game.Well done.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2010"}

It only came with the Undead Nightmare, nothing else, so if this does come with anything else like more add-ons, I won't review those.The single player of Undead Nightmare is good at best.  You're basically thrown into it and told to kill zombies.  There isn't a whole lot of story here, just the bare bones amount.  You will meet some characters from Red Dead Redemption, like West Dickens, Landon Ricketts, and Prof. MacDougal.  However, your encounter with them will be short but sweet.  Some side missions are fun and interesting, like saving stranded victims from zombies.  But it lacks the excellent narrative and story telling of the main game.  The single player of Undead Nightmare is only good enough to be played once or twice.Where the real action is, and the best of it too, is the Undead Nightmare's online multiplayer.  You and three others are teamed against endless hordes of zombies.  Yes they are endless, everyone dies eventually.  At the beginning of each match, you get to pick your weapon set.  For example, they have close range: where you get dynamite, a sawed off shotgun and a double action pistol.  There also are medium range, long range, and a couple others.  At the beginning of each wave a coffin appears.  You have to open it before it disappears and you'll get ammo and time.  Then all you do is keep shooting the heads of zombies until the next wave.  There are about four or five maps to play on, they are selected randomly.  If one of your teammates get downed, you can revive him by giving him medicine.  There also is undead bait and holy water, which combined make for good times.Overall, I would buy Undead Nightmare.  Whether it is this one or the one on the Playstation store is up to you.

The music totally rocks!  I go to the options sound test menu all the time just to hear \"Vela Nova\" and \"Wrapped in Black\".  The backgrounds and levels themselves are presented beautifully with bright colors and such.  The easier stylus special stages provide great entertainment for me, although the last one (like many other of the final special stages in these games) nearly had me pulling my hair out.  There was only one thing I didn't quite understand in this game.  Blaze apparently has pyrokinesis powers, or control of fire, so every time she jumps flames surround her.  So how, whenever she was underwater, would flames still manage to surround her when she jumped?  Last time I checked water put out fire, so I take this to be a tiny design flaw.  This was the only flaw I found, however, as everything else seems to be designed perfectly.  The bosses are pretty fun, but basic once you get in some practice.  However, the extra boss proved to be pretty challenging with Sonic's lack of power, and Blaze's lack of speed.  The one major disadvantage I see in this game, compared to the Sonic Advance series, is the lack of playable characters.  I mean characters we love, like Amy and Knuckles, play a role in the storyline, and Tails and Cream are even your map partners (they tell you which zone you are about to enter), but only Sonic and Blaze are playable, which can be a letdown if you were expecting Tails' propeller flight or for Knuckles' gliding and climbing abilities.  Another disadvantage would be the game's mixed signals.  It encourages you to go as fast as you can, yet if you go to fast (like I usually end up doing) you will bump into an enemy robot, or fall down a bottomless pit, which can cause you to squander so many lives before you make it out of the difficult levels.  Yes, the levels ARE challenging.  You won't make it through the game without some good effort, but trust me you will want to see the endings.  My personal favorite ending (even against the extra ending) is the one of Sonic's storyline and the credits thereafter.  Trust me on this, it's a hoot!  Overall, this game is fun to beat with it's expansive gameplay (I mean for once they even combined 2D with 3D action) and it's upbeat and good enough to dance to music.  I recommend this game for anyone who wants fun!  Especially Sonic fans.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2007"}

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

The Blast and everything which follows is based around a shadowy group and the standard trio of gangs that take over in the chaotic aftermath.Gameplay manages to be unbelievably entertaining, with little repetition, apart from random enemy encounters, though every fight racks up experience to unlock new powers. The powers themselves all manage to be useful, and theres no one power that you'll use all the time because its the magical power of kill-everything-now, apart from the normal blast, and none of the powers are overly broken. Despite your abilities, and even with the highest level of damage reduction, the regular peons still can be threatening, and if you let yourself get overly confident, you could quickly find yourself shot full of lead.The morale system manages to be grey enough that certain evil decisions are less evil than just self serving, or better yet, let one suffer so I can help more. Apart from just randomly slaughtering civilians though, every decision does carry enough of a morale quandary to not be the \"power an orphanage vs. burn it to the ground\" decisions that plague other games. I'm looking at you, KOTOR 3.Graphics are phenomenal, though clipping does pose problems at times, but the few bugs can work to advantage, as theres nothing that brings a smile like seeing a bad guy spin up, up, and away after being hit with an explosive shockwave. The buildings and high rises all look near photorealistic at even short distances. The lightning effect never loses its charm, and aside from the problem of too many explosions whiting out the screen, the effects have yet to disappoint. Probably one of the better visual effects is being wounded. Blood will splatter your HUD, and eventually your vision will begin to gray out, to the point that almost everything become indistinguishable grayish lumps.Audio and voicing is also top notch, with entertaining characters, clear, crisp dialogue even at distance, and characters that actually feel realistic.The difficulty is well balanced, though certain missions, namely rooftop races, are annoying trial and error mini-games, and several other standard missions are little more than grind sandwiches. But still, above all, massive props for having more than 3 generic rinse and reuse missions.All told, aside from some annoying missions and enemies sometimes being clumped in battalion strength, this game is quickly rising to my top 5. Some of the story was revealed way too early(you'll know near everything about your powers and the Blast by mission 5), and there are some wtf missions, but otherwise, this game is engaging, well made, fun, and relatively bug free. Even many of the standard \"I only hate X about these kinds of games\" have been addressed. Fr instance, saving is segmented, so you won't start at the beginning of a 45 minute story mission, if you stumble with the controller and plunge into the lake. The finding missions all appear on your HUD, rather than being scouting nightmares, forcing you to scour every roof in the game looking for shards to up your health. This is one of the rare pieces that's easily worth full market price, as it'll encourage more of the same. I'm just incredibly pissed that its ps3 exclusive.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2009"}

Origin centers around on a macabre theme; at times the game is simply freaky, at other times the game is scary, and other times the game is just exciting. It's such a nice break from the zombie themes of Resident Evil.Here's a list of things I liked and didn't liked:* Anything can be used as a weapon. You can pretty much go melee the entire game. From your fist to a sledgehammer to guns, pretty much anything can be used as a weapon. Melee weapons, such as a hammer, have limited lifespan; each time you attack an enemy, the weapon degrades until it can no long be used. It gets kind of ridiculous near the end when you are carrying nearly fifty different weapons. I think the game should have had a weight limit on how much you can carry at once.* Great music. I think the music really saves this game. I think the music made me sweat at one point in the game as I was walking in a dark hallway and I didn't want to continue since I thought something would jump out at any second. Truly, the music in this game complements the game play perfectly.* Some minor bugs I noticed. I thought it was because I was playing on a ps3, but I've found that people playing on ps2 have the same issue. If you reload a gun in the inventory and you have more than one gun, you see duplicate images of the gun you reloaded. It doesn't appear to corrupt your game in any way, and once you re-open the inventory, the gun images are back to normal.* Story is outstanding. I actually wanted to play the game until the very end. I was mildly disappointed with the ending, but I won't spoil it for anyone. The game is short and sweet.* The puzzles are mediocre at best. They're not hard, but not exactly easy. There were two parts in the game that I became stuck on, but the reason why is simply because I didn't fully explore some areas. If you explore every room in this game, you will be able to solve all of the puzzles without much effort. The most exciting puzzle comes at the end when you have to solve this triangle-shaped-Rubik-cube-like puzzle. It's sort of exciting to see it, but once you notice the pattern, which you will have no problem in doing so, you'll be mildly disappointed.Overall, I say get Origin if you can. It's a nice grab in the final stages of the PS2's life. Also, Origin made me want to try out the other Silent Hill games. I recently went and purchased Silent Hill 2, and I am thus far pleased with it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2008"}

{"product_name":"B008CP6RWU","description":"","reviewerName":"Andrew Mulligan \"Joker\"","summary":"A Great Bundle","reviewText":"This is the first real game I've played on my PS3 (the only other thing being FFXIV). I picked this up at a retailer for $20 and while two of the three games are easily forgettable, Flower and Flow, Journey is, itself, almost worth $20.First, Flow (or flOw as it's written), this is a simple test of the controller gyroscope. You play as a small organism that eats others to evolve, some can eat you as well. Once you've gotten through enough 'levels', you evolve into a new species and start again. There's not much to it, it is much like Official Wii Zapper with Link's Crossbow Training, it serves as a test the waters with the gyroscope. The music within the game is quite nice.Flower is much like Flow, but there is a small bit of story. You're reliving the memory of, you guessed it, a flower and how it came to be in the sad state it is in now in an apartment dull with grey, black and white. As you play each level, you pick up other flower petals as you fly on the find. Depending on how many 'secret flowers' you find (there are 3 per level), the flower in that drab apartment starts coming to life again and some color is restored to the world. It's a beautiful looking game, but has little substance (again, it's mainly a test of the gyroscope).Journey is the meat of the package, you play as a mysterious figure and your only real goal is to reach a mountain in the distance. There are no vocals besides some singing your character can do and when you encounter others online you don't know who they are, this is the point of Journey, to make you feel alone. As you reach monoliths, you'll meditate and see a mysterious being who could be God or maybe a mentor, this is left to the player (i.e. you). Graphically, it's beautiful, but the story is all up to you and how you perceive it.Pay attention to the small details in Journey, like sand movement and when it's on your cloak, I was blown away by that.All these bundled together, it's worth the $20 it costs.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2013"}

II's battle system is annoying and ponderous because \"even in 'regular' battles, it forces you to spend many turns Stocking just so that you can do decent damage to enemies.\" This is actually a form of codespeak. What these people are really saying is \"I'm not very bright, and even after several hours of playing Ep. II, I somehow never realized how to use the battle system efficiently derp!\"Ep. II's battle system was designed around the concept: \"For every task, there is the perfect tool.\" It puts a great deal of emphasis on each character's specific attack attributes. Each character's attacks have unique combination of traits, and it's important to use the right character against the right enemy. The traits are classified as either Physical or Ether, there are elementals (fire/ice/lighting/aura) and finally there are types (slash/pierce/hit). Sound complicated? Eh, a little more so than the average RPG. Not nearly as bad as something like Vagrant Story. All you have to do is use Analyze on any enemy you're unfamiliar with to see their weaknesses, and then use the Change command to bring in the character that has the proper attack traits, if they aren't already in your battle party. When you come across enemies with Physical/elemental weaknesses, there are Ethers which you can cast to add that element to a character's physical attack. If their weakness is ether/elemental, then just use the standard elemental Ether spells against them. This is all you need to do to make battles flow at nice, normal pace.For some reason, the vast majority of Ep. II players seemed to never realize this. Instead, they saw their only option to be using the Stock command for nine (NINE!) turns in a row before beginning their attack. Even on wimpy garden variety wandering monsters! They took no heed of enemy weaknesses, e.g. using characters with physical/fire based attacks against enemies weak vs. ether/ice. RPG players used to have a reputation for being the more intelligent gamers. I wonder what happened...A lot of Ep. I fans never bothered to play Ep. II because negative word of mouth spread so quickly amongst the fanbase as soon as the JP version was released. But now that Ep. III is out (and it's truly fantastic) a lot of them will finally play Ep. II soon. I hope they do better than the first rounders did.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2006"}

Remember the first time you got to use Sega's 6-button controller?  It was great!  A sleek, smaller design that got rid of the bulk and wasted space of the original, while also slimming the buttons down as well as adding a second row of face buttons.  It was a tremendous improvement that was very welcome at the time.Now fast-forward to present day: Microsoft, less than a year after the debut of its wonder-machine, has decided (at the bequest of dissatisfied gamers everywhere) to make the controller originally designed for the overseas Japanese market available in the USA.  Enter the &quot;Controller S,&quot; a smaller model designed to solve the often cumbersome limitations of the original.  And it succeeds, albeit not 100%.Many people cited the controller as one of the bigger drawbacks to the Microsoft XBox: it was too big, the buttons weren't user-friendly, there was a lot of wasted space (hello, logo!) and people really didn't know what to make of those pesky white &amp; black buttons.  The Controller S aims to solve these problems, and does so in most areas.  The controller is smaller now, thus decreasing reaction time, the analog sticks are now identical and seemingly a bit tighter with less movement area, the gigantic clear dome logo has been replaced by a smaller button-sized logo, and the Back &amp; Start buttons have been relocated to the left side underneath the left analog.Obviously the biggest (and best) change is the new &quot;standard&quot; placement of the face buttons.  They are now North/South/East/West and also flat and circular, instead of teardrop shaped.  This makes finding &amp; utilizing them much easier and intuitive.  BUT, we still haven't mentioned the B&amp;W buttons yet, and that's where the design fails yet again.  Microsoft acquiesced to the positioning of the main face buttons, and should have just place the Black &amp; White buttons in the same pattern as the C &amp; Z buttons on the old Sega Genesis 6-button controller.  But, instead of having them in the awkward yet usable spot of the original XBox controller, they are now recessed and completely below the face buttons.  This all but forces the player to use the heel of their thumb to press the B&amp;W buttons, whilst the main portion of the thumb performs the usual face button duty.  This isn't impossible, but it's even more awkward and counter-intuitive than the previous awkward &amp; counter-intuitive setup.No bones about it, the Controller S is the better controller.  The new design facilitates faster and more accurate control, which is especially helpful in sports games.  I noticed the difference in NCAA 2003 the minute I played using the Controller S.  Though others maintain that the slower, more deliberate nature of the original is helpful in games like Halo or Star Wars Starfighter, I tend to disagree but your mileage may vary.  So check it out and see how much more precise your gaming experience can be with the superior XBox Controller S.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-02-2002"}

While being completely abysmal in its gameplay and graphics department, it completely delivers despite those 2 huge negatives. Similar to horror games from the Dreamcast era; the two oddities that sprung to mind while playing Deadly Premonition were Illbleed and D2. Both of those games also suffered in more than a few ways, though they were still two of the best experiences I've ever had. I think that describing Deadly Premonition as an \"experience\" more than merely a \"game\" is the right way to go.Positives:- A Wonderfully Absurd Story - Unlike many games these days, Deadly Premonition doesn't play it safe in its narrative department. The narrative is so well done. It goes from creepy, to hilarious, to somewhere in the middle, constantly throughout the meaty single player campaign.- A Cast of Oddities and Awesomeness - Needless to say, Deadly Premonition has quite the eccentric cast of characters.

Important characters, not just random NPC's, will go driving around, go to get a bite to eat at the diner, etc. This is a living and breathing world.- A Lengthy Single Player Campaign - It took me upwards of 25 hours to complete Deadly Premonition, and that's not even getting 100%.- A Soundtrack Worth Dying For - The soundtrack in Deadly Premonition spans many different styles, but all of it only adds to the quirky atmosphere of Deadly Premonition.- Some Decent Character Models - While Deadly Premonition is no beauty, its characters -- especially the faces -- look pretty nice overall.- $19.99 - It's a great budget title.Negatives:The Gameplay is Mediocre - I honestly wouldn't say the gameplay is bad, as it's totally serviceable, but it's quite clunky.Graphics That Aren't Cutting Edge - Deadly Premonition looks like a title from last generation, but with an HD resolution.Despite two major elements being below par, I highly recommend this gem. If you can get past some poor design decisions, you're in for a treat with Deadly Premonition.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2011"}

The enemies will try to hide but then come out of hiding for no reason and then you can easily shoot them.  More often, they will just come right for you.  That makes them super easy pickings. Some have armor, but that just means 3 shots instead on 1.  The stealth options might be even more disappointing.  There's some stealth gadgets, but you dont have to constantly hide in the dark (like Splinter Cell), so the stealth feels very undercooked.  The bottom-line is that the game lacks any real challenge, and that's not good.  C-The game does one thing exceedingly well though.  There's a conversation/reputation system in which everything you say to the game characters will have an effect on the events in the game.  Some decisions have a very notable effect on the game, unlike for example Mass Effect 2, where all you can do is choose between \"extreme evil or extreme good.\"  In Alpha Protocol, your conversation options are all moral shades of gray and there's no super obvious correct choice.  If you like plot and story in a game, this game is unlike any other. Other games have tried, but Alpha Protocol is one of the very few games (ever) that let's the gamer decide how the game's story-line will play out. Mass Effect 2 had a great sci-fi storyline that instantly grabbed you. Alpha Protocol's story is about current day terrorism and politics. Some may not like that storyline, but I thought it was pretty great once you get to know the characters. If you follow the plot, the conclusion has a giant fun plot twist.

As time passes, his lonely town of one becomes a town of two, three...until it grows into a town to behold. The town is not the only thing to behold. Among the newcomers are beautiful ladies who have moved to the town to start a new life. Which one will be our hero&rsquo;s lucky lady? However, our hero is soon faced with a problem. Creatures of the frontier, many of them hostile towards humans, pose a great threat to the safety of his townsfolk. To find a way to live in peaceful coexistence or perhaps destroy them along with the danger they bring &ndash; the decision is up to our hero.GameplayAs with previous related games,Rune Factory: Frontierfeatures a myriad of Life Sim activities like farming, raising livestock, building relationships with NPCs, etc., as well as role-playing elements like dungeon crawling and item collection and leveling, but in structuring gameplay it goes to great lengths to incorporate an open-ended structure that allows players to choose the type of game they wish to experience at all points in the game. This means that although at the beginning of the game players will find themselves presented with the familiar opportunity of starting a farm, selling their crops at market and by doing so improving the overall prosperity and size of their town, they are not necessarily tied to the land. Although farming is an excellent way to finance adventuring, the rich RPG elements of the game can be pursued at any time. These elements present themselves mostly in the form of battling monsters and bosses that have found their way into the land, but seem to be coming from the mysterious 'Whale Island,' which floats in the sky above your town. Players can either battle the monsters or make friends with them, raising them as a kind of livestock. As with everything inRune Factory: Frontier, the choice is yours. Whether it's growing crops, expanding the town, fighting (or befriending) monsters or even falling in love, the experience is unique to each player.Key Game Features:Lifelike Interactions- NPCs will come and go based on the player&rsquo;s actions. Want to get along with your neighbor? Want to give fellow townsfolk something they might hate? Go ahead, but they may get upset and leave the town. Be nice to attract more newcomers.Natural Ecosystem- Breathe life into the barren wilderness by cultivating it and planting crops. Small creatures (spirits) will gather first, triggering a food chain to later attract larger and rarer creatures. You are responsible for bringing more fertility to the land.Floating Island to Explore- There is an island that floats in the skies. When you see it, you must quickly find a way to get on it as new discoveries await.Intuitive Wii Controls- Use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk to do everything. Plow the land, shake hands with townsfolk to strengthen relationships, or even wave it around when you&rsquo;re on a date with a girl. (Also compatible with the Classic Controller.)Open-ended Play Structure- Whether you prefer Life Sim gaming, Action RPG action or a mix of both,Rune Factory: Frontierlets you game as you want, when you want.Console Debut-Frontieris the console debut of the popularRune Factoryseries.","reviewerName":"R. P. Jesus","summary":"This was a real let down, Rune Factory should be better on the Wii","reviewText":"One of the reasons I recently bought a Wii was for this game.It claims to use innovative motion controls to plow, plant, knock on doors, and more using the Wiimote. It doesn't do any of those things at least not like you'd expect. If you press the A button you will preform whatever action is needed (plow,plant) depending on your situation or if you prefer you can waggle the Wiimote in any direction instead.Knocking on doors could have been cool too. Finally a game that doesn't have you just bursting into people's houses whenever you want. Nope. You still wander into people private homes with reckless abandon but after dark they lock up and then you can knock on their doors as much as you want come morning. There's no animation for it either, just a delayed knocking noise after you shake the nunchuk controller. Static moments like these are the worst parts of the game.In Amazon's Product Features it says you shake hands to build relationships. I've been playing for months and unless Frontier is saving a handshaking mini game for the wedding ceremony all I can tell you is there's NO handshaking in this game.After seeing games like Cooking Mama and Monster Lab you'd think they would at least use motion controls for the cooking and forging mini games but you'd be wrong.You can't move the camera either, making this game feel ten years older than it is (even the GameCube's Harvest Moon had camera control).Rune Factory on the DS is an awesome product of Harvest Moon mixed with minor RPG elements and I love it. I regret paying $30 dollars for this Wii game. Rune Factory Frontier's hook is all about the motion controls and they don't deliver. To make a Wii game like this it takes zero imagination.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2010"}

Moore \"RvngoftheNERD\"","summary":"Mortal Kombat is finally back!","reviewText":"As everyone knows, Mortal Kombat hasn't been the best as of late. My favorite was MK vs DC Universe and I really didn't like that. No gore in a Mortal Kombat game! COME ON! It completely ruined it for me but I finished the game besides that and sold it after. Now that this game is out, I found myself very excited to buy it. Long story short... Mortal Kombat is back. The gameplay is more fluent than ever, combos are fun to watch and pull off. The graphics are great (disregard the 1 star reviewers), no frame rate issues at all. Quick side note: All of this was played while offline. So my game did not recieve the update as others may have. Controls are not too complicated and the fun factor and the games lasting appeal is very high.There are a lot of items to unlock(movies, music, art , kombat kodes and alternate costumes). Story mode is very entertaining and not dry.  There is the normal Kombat Tower to fight to the top. Tag team matches which makes it very simple to switch members into the fight just by pressing LB. The most interesting thing has to be the Fatalities and X-Ray moves. Fatalaties are back! Bringing the gruesome, dark, horror feeling back to MK as it should be. Heads come off and Hearts get ripped out! Everything that makes Mortal Kombat Mortal Kombat is there. X-Ray moves are great to turn the tables. As they are the most powerful moves in the game. You have to build up your meter in order to use it though (Similar to moves in Street Fighter 4). Also know you have to know how the characters X-Ray move works. You cant be 5 feet away with all characters, some close and some far. It is different for all characters. I cannot coment on online gameplay as of yet. :(With that said, I love the game. It finally brings the series back to it's roots and will win a lot of fans in the process. I would recommend this game to all gamers! Even if you are not a fighting game person, you should at least rent it for the story mode.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2011"}

{"product_name":"B007R4X3AG","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Fun rhythm game, but only appeals to Final Fantasy fans","reviewText":"The Good: Dozens of amazing songs, simple yet fun rhythm mechanic, RPG elements are nicely implemented, lots of content, various modes that extend gameplayThe Bad: Opening and ending themes are boring to play, gameplay consists of only 3 different tap types, gears towards mainly Final Fantasy fans, later Final Fantasy songs aren&#8217;t as great as older onesFinal Fantasy has had some strange off shoots like Chocobo Racing, Kingdom Hearts, and the TBS Tactics. A rhythm game is probably the only genre Final Fatnasy hasn&#8217;t touched and it&#8217;s one that the game belongs in. Final Fantasy is full of some of the best video game music ever created. While later titles aren&#8217;t exactly up to par, there are plenty of songs here that fans will love across all 13 core titles.The basic gameplay is broken up into 3 stages that are randomized. BMS is Battle Music Stage. Usually one song from each game is picked that was used in a battle, usually a major boss fight. Your four characters stand in front of bars similar to a horizontal Guitar Hero. The entire game consists of only 3 tap types. Hold, tap, and slides. The speed and combination of these 3 can make things really difficult on the Ultra mode but the standard mode is just way too easy even for beginners. EMS or Event Music Stage is a song picked during some sort of popular or well known cut scene and the said scene plays in the background to the music. It&#8217;s great seeing Rinoa and Squall waltz in Final Fantasy VIII or watching Aerith&#8217;s death scene in Final Fantasy VII. The game is mixed up a bit where the ring you tap flies around the screen as you follow it to complete the required taps. The final stage, FMS or Field Music Stage, has your leader character walking down a re-rendered field from each game collecting chests and the field music from each game accompanies it. This stage consists of one bar that you can move up and down to follow waves. There&#8217;s a third boring stage where you tap a crystal in the center of the screen as bubbles fly into it, these are for the opening and ending themes in the main mode which are as boring as ever.This may sound simple, but the other half is leveling up your cute chibi FF characters and equipping items and weapons to last through the harder difficulties. Characters with higher HP won&#8217;t die as easy (meaning you can mess up more) and this includes their armor (they won&#8217;t take as much damage when you do mess up). Characters with higher luck in field stages will find more items. This is a unique twist on the rhythm genre and helps push it forward in a way that&#8217;s never really been done. Thanks to the many extras such as fully rendered trading cards and DLC there&#8217;s a lot to be had in this package. If you like the lesser known songs in these games the Dark Notes mode will help you here. You can acquire new songs vita StreetPass or battling friends in multiplayer for the highest score. These are all set to the hardest difficulty so practice is needed.With such a content heavy rhythm game is begs the question as to who this title is for. Rhythm game fans will appreciate the mechanics and use of the touch screen, but may not care for the orchestra and chiptune heavy music. Final Fantasy nuts may love this game but not really like the fast paced rhythm action. It&#8217;s something that can appeal to anyone who even hates RPGs, but the Final Fantasy only music may turn Rock Band and Guitar Hero fans away. Despite who this game is made for, whoever picks it up will enjoy a simple yet rich game full of detail, content, and attention to detail that hasn&#8217;t been seen since the earlier days of Final Fantasy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2014"}

After finishing the game once colleting as many upgrades as possible (~10-12h) and attempting the challenge modes afterwards, this is what I thought.***********PROS***********ORIGINAL GOD OF WAR EXPERIENCE EXPANDED ON PSP: Yes that means Kratos punishing enemies in the most brutal way possible with his chain blades, climbing/jumping type of platforming and plenty of exploration in ancient greek/roman landscape. This game truly delivers nearly the same experience as on PS2/PS3 God of War games. Quite impressed.GREAT ARTWORK, ANIMATION AND GRAPHICS: The game looks even better than previous PSP God of war game. I truly can't believe we live in an era where we can enjoy such graphics on a handheld device. Truly astonishing. Also, this game contains very elegantly designed characters, carefully crafted structures and sophistically designed levels. It truly lives up to expectation.HECK&SLASH; GAMEPLAY: Just like in previous PSP God of War, you will be able to pull wide range of combos using dual blades and other weapons. Compare to previous game you have access to more moves. Proper use of these combos will punish your foes in most ruthless manner and will give you bonus orbs (for upgrades) while simply button-mashing will get you killed easily. While the combat is not as strategic as say Devil May Cry games, it still delivers.WEAPONS, MAGICS AND MORE: As you progress through game in addition to your dual chain blades, you will get access to some unique godly gears and devastating magical powers. Fortunately, these new tools of destruction are not simple rip off from previous god of war games, rather they are quite distinctive entities that when used right can overwhelm your foes or overcome indomitable obstructions. Some of them are quite fun to use.UPGRADES: Just like previous God of War games, you can upgrade your blades, new weapons and magics giving this game an RPG element. Upgrading your blades unlocks powerful new moves through which you can improve your combos and punish your enemies better while upgrading your magic will give you an edge in battles that would be too difficult otherwise. These upgrades also encourage you to explore each and every corners of the game and do better in battles to get more orbs making the game all the more enjoyable.GREAT STORY: Previous PSP God of War set up a huge bar in terms of story and I am happy to say the story for this game is even better than previous game. The story takes place between God of War 1 and 2. It has decent amount of twist in it and help you explain many thing that are not explained in God of War 2 and 3. Unfortunately, I can't describe much without spoiling it.VERY CINEMATIC: This game has some cutscenes that can go head to head with PS2 God of War games. Cutscenes, nicely designed by animators and carefully performed by voice actors, add great depth and drama to the story. Again can't describe much, but the cut scenes towards the end are simply magnificent.LONGER CAMPAIGN: Very happy to see it has longer campaign than previous PSP God of War. One thing I minded in previous game. So happy they improved it.UNLOCKABLES: You can unlock Trials and art/video gallery after finishing the game. Trials provide you with challenges and adds length to the gameplay experience. Competing these trials and finishing the game on harder modes unlocks more just like previous god of war games.*************CONS.*************LAST BOSS BATTLE AND ENDING: It was pretty good, but I guess, I enjoyed the game so much, I had higher expectation for last boss battle. Don't get me wrong, it was epic, but I wish it was longer and had some punches and depth to it. Same with the ending. It was good and appropriate, but I wish there was more to it.**************CONCLUSION************Chains of Olympus established great standards for God of War on PSP and Ghost of Sparta took the experience to the next level. So no complains here. If you like God of War than this game is a must buy for you. This is an experience you must not miss.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2011"}

The design works well if you are playing your games using the D-Pad.

Also what I did was I purchased the NYKO grip which really helped in my situation.The controller is of good construction.

{"product_name":"B0001NE48U","summary":"The Ultimate Star Wars Arcade","reviewText":"Do you enjoy Star Wars, but not enough to fill a bookshelf with trivia books?Do you like blasting people with lasers?Has the thought of running someone over with a hovercraft/dirtbike ever amused you?Do you enjoy the idea of single-handedly killing an entire enemy force by carrying out epic acts of marksmanship, tucking and rolling, and darting from one hiding spot to the next, all the while looking like the most awesome hero ever?Do you like playing an FPS online with a total of 7 other people, all of whom have hacked their system to allow them to simultaneously fly, collect gold coins, and unleash a pack of trained velociraptors on you?  Or, alternatively, do you prefer to play games in single player mode?Do you like to exploit hilarious game glitches once the novelty of playing by the rules wears thin?If you answered yes to any of the above questions, then Star Wars Battlefront should be a no-brainer for you.  At this point in time, it's an OLD game, so although the statement about the online mode is only slightly exaggerated, you can easily pick this up on the cheap and get a very solid game to revert to when the latest graphically scintillating immersive title finally gets too tedious.Think of this as the \"Burnout\" of FPS games.  We're not about ultra-realistic physics, textures, and gore here.  In fact, there is no gore, unless the sight of a battle droid exploding into pieces makes you queasy.  Star Wars Battlefront is a simple, but ingeniously designed game that sets up perfectly for fun, challenging battles lasting about 20 minutes each.Yes, SWB includes a couple of other modes.  There is the online mode, which I've played once...everyone was hacking...and to be honest I'm a single-player guy myself so my reviews reflect those game modes.  There is a campaign, which takes you through various battles in the Star Wars saga, and there is Galactic Conquest, which is a fun change of pace that makes the outcome of each battle a little more important on the whole.Without doubt, however, the Instant Action mode is where it's at.  Make a playlist of maps on which you'd like to fight, pick your faction, and choose from a variety of soldier types (infantry, sniper, etc.) with which to combat your foes.  Once on the battlefield, you can run from place to place, gunning down enemies as you go, or you can choose from (depending on the map), various classic Star Wars vehicles, each with its own characteristics and weapons.  The basic point of Instant Action is to capture \"command posts\" which serve as enemy spawn points.  If one side holds a majority of the CP's, the other side's number of available respawns (or reinforcements) will decrease, until only the existing soldiers remain to fight to the death.  Sometimes, this will happen to you, and with some sweet moves, you can turn the tide and win the battle.Technical details aside, SWB is just plain fun.  The game is easy to jump into and it's one of those titles that will yield dozens of \"epic\" or \"hilarious\" moments as the AI pull ridiculous moves, seemingly impossible feats take place, and glitches become obvious.Ah yes, the glitches.  I would honestly say that the little details the designers overlooked are probably the best part of the game.  Examples include the following:-Fly to the top of a rock on Tatooine and snipe people in complete safety...until your spacecraft spontaneously explodes and strands you.-Stand directly in front of a droideka to prevent it being able to shoot you, then push it off a ledge to its death.-Watch the elderly Count Dooku swat at you clumsily with his lightsaber, missing you while accidentally destroying several enemy droids, and in turn earning the \"Traitor\" award...with 7 counts of lethal friendly fire.Seriously, this game is hilariously awesome.  If you turn the difficulty all the way up, it is an insane challenge that requires an intimate knowledge of the game's foibles and a crafty strategy.  Put it on an easier setting, and enjoy casual but fun battles that can be carried out while eating pizza with your friends.  It may be an older game with glitches and a less than great online mode, but for a single player arcade-style FPS/TPS, it is rock solid.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2010"}

The format used is done so well, that Lucasarts and the Collective took that format and replaced everything with Star Wars.Revenge of the Sith for PS2 is a simple hack n' slash, beat-em-up game.  You go down a linear path, killing enimies, pressing switches, jumping occasionally, and going down more paths, killing more enimies, etc.  When you make a kill, you get a grade of fair, good, impressive, and masterfull.  The more kills you get, the faster your skill meter fills up, and the more experience points you get to upgrade your charachter.Sound familiar?  It should be.  While the gameplay is a disguised copy of the Lord of the rings format, it works for the most part, but could use more touch up (more on that later).For a hack-n-slash game, Revenge of the sith looks pretty good.  The enviornments and worlds look really good (especially the planet of mustafar).  Every area looks good and has lots of little touches to set it apart from the other worlds.  Grievous's flagship for example, has battleships floating outside, blasting each other to bits (which is quite fun to watch).  Mustafar has volcaones, couroscant has a gigantic city-scape, etc.  Overall, the game looks good, but certian things could use more improvement.  The clone troopers and Yoda, for example, have a boxy look to them.  It's not a huge problem, but it is noticable.One nice draw of Revenge of the Sith is it's big one on one duels.  You've got Obi-wan vs General Grievous (complete with four lightsabers, yikes!), Anakin vs Mace Windu (\"Ready for this boy?!\") Anakin vs Count Dooku, Anakin vs Stunt Coordinator Nick Gallard (*Face turns red in anger and steam rushes out of ears*), and the final showdown between Anakin and Obi-wan (which is just as awesome as it is in the movie).While the game has sixteen levels, it isint very long.  I completed it in about eight hours.  Short yes, but fun.  When you finish the main part of the game, you can then go and try out the bonus missions, which are simple \"kill em all\" missions.  It is however, quite fun to play as Yoda and General Grievous.  There's also a two player coopertive mode thats a complete waste of time (you go through rooms killing an endless amount of enimies.  Gets boring in about ten seconds).There's also a duel mode where you can play as the games big charachters in one on one fights in several locations, such as Anakin dueling Greivous in Couroscant, Count Dooku and Obi wan fighting on Mustafar, etc.  You get a lot of arenas and a good amount of fighters, but why no yoda or emperor?  One Feature I like is that if you're playing the duel mode by yourself, the computer will play as the second charachter, so you can enjoy it by yourself.There are also a lot of concept art that you unlock going through the game, some of which is quite cool (Anakin wearing his vader armor withought the helmet for example).  One big bonus of the game is that it includes several sequences that are not in the movie, such as a fight on Grievous's ship as it turns completly upside down (cool!).  Several battles are also extended, such as Anakin and Mace's fight, which is now a lot longer.Probably the biggest problems I have with Revenge of the Sith are it's combat system and it's lack of charachter selection in replay.  The combat system that Revenge of the Sith uses is almost identical to that of EA's lord of the rings titles.  It was perfected in Return of the king, but sadly the system here is not as good.  While it's fairly easy to reach maximum skill in LOTR games, here it's almost impossible to get anything outside of \"Fair\".  Getting \"good\" is really tough.  Getting \"impressive\" takes forever, and getting \"masterfull\" is almost impossbile.  Each sucsessful hit on an enemy gets you one point on the skill meter.  Each hit on you takes away a skill point on the meter.  And you get hit a lot, meaning that your meter gets emptied very quickly.As a result, the combat system suffers from getting too little experience points for all the hacking and slashing that you do.  It would have been nice if the developers copied the Return of the king combat system directly, as it had been pretty much perfected in that game (which is still fun two years later).The other quibble I have is that unlike the LOTR games, you cannot play any level with any charachter once you finish the game.  If a level plays with Anakin, then you're stuck playing as Anakin forever.  It was so cool to be able to mess around with \"what if\" situations, but you cannot do that here.  It would have added a LOT of replay value.  Think of it!  Mace Windu on Mustafar, fighting Anakin skywalker.  General Grievous teaming up with Yoda to cleanse the Jedi Temple of clone troopers, etc.As it is, Revenge of the Sith is a good, fun game that I enjoy a lot.  While it has the possibility of adding so much more, it's good as it stands.  I recommend buying it used, as i'd pay about twenty dollars for the game, not fifty, but you should probably rent it first.Oh, one last thing.  You can play as Anakin and kill obi-wan in the final battle on mustafar, giving you a cool \"What if\" alternate ending.  That alone is quite fun to watch.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2005"}

Revenge of the Sith follows the film's storyline almost exactly, while the graphics look great, and even the actors from the film provide the voices for their characters.  You can play as Obi-Wan or Anakin and battle your way through the game on single player or co-op, or you can duel it out with various Star Wars characters, including ones that can be unlocked.  However, the story mode of the game is really nothing more than a simple hack & slasher at heart, and fighting hordes of droids and soldiers becomes old real quick.  The sound effects are nicely done, as is the score used from the film, but the voice acting is surprisingly stiff, and the one-liners are annoying and actually kind of un-Jedi like.  Not to mention that the story mode is pretty short as well, and the final battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin will be there before you know it.  The duel mode is nice, and it suggests that if LucasArts was serious about a Star Wars fighting game (such as a previous reviewer stated, like Soul Calibur) that they could make something really special (not like that horrible PS1 Star Wars fighting game, Knights of the Teras Kasi).  All in all, Revenge of the Sith isn't a bad game at all, and it's definitely worth playing for Star Wars fanboys, but don't expect anything great from it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2005"}

Coupled with a variety of gameplay modes including single player, multiplayer and the co-op Special Ops Mode, it is destined to be one of the most popular games of 2009 and a worthy addition to theCall of Dutyseries..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }","reviewerName":"B.

The story is excellent and the replay value of this game is amazing! If you enjoyed the other Pokemon games or you are interested in buying this game, you should definitely get it!! I love the 3d effects (even though they are pixelated) and I thought the 3d scenes really spiced up the game. The only problem is that some of the Pokemon are really ugly and have terrible names, but the excellent gameplay makes up for that problem. The new online features are great and I especially love the GTS Negotiations which lets your trade with random players.

{"product_name":"B001QXNBJM","reviewerName":"F. B","summary":"Oh so refreshing!","reviewText":"The single player is great, you wont be disappointed!  Graphics are awesome, and the backdrops are very nice eye candy.  You can switch out your guns for different ones of your choosing when you come across certain \"special crates\" scattered around any given level, which is nice because that means you can switch up your play style when YOU want too.  The single player campaign is short and sweet (prob 8-10 hours play time), the story doesn't grab you like MW2's, but enjoyable none-the-less.  Assuming that the bulk of people buying this game are doing so for the multiplayer, i'll move on to that and devote the rest of my review to it.I downloaded the demo for this game a little while ago and hated it.  The controls were completely different then MW2 - i especially dislike that they use the right movement stick for ducking.  Can't tell you how many times i try to shoot a guy and ended up ducking and shooting at the same time.  So i put it away and went back to MW2, as i was playing i realized that - \"i hate this game\", i'm at the 4th prestige and have over saturated myself with it. I cant stand the quick kill quick death formula anymore, the horrible spawn system, the team selection system, and especially the lack of team work i constantly come across.  There is also the infamous \"MW2 law\", similar to \"Murphy's Law\", where anything can go wrong in a match and when it does, it always seems to happen to YOU.  Ofcourse MW2 is a great game and a worthy purchase, but i personally have had my fill.That being said, it was unfair to judge BFBC2 so quickly when i had put such an insane amount hours into MW2.  So i picked it up again and gave it another shot...i was hooked!  I was playing as a medic and realized that i actually wasn't focused on killing people, i was running around reviving my teammates and dropping health packs to keep them going, ofcourse i took out a few stray enemies here and there.  \"Wow, this is different\" i thought, and when i realized how many points i was racking up i liked it even more.  I\"m actually HELPING my team and getting a ton of points for it.  That brings me to the most important aspect of the multiplayer, you are actually encouraged to work as a team, which is a nice change of pace compared to MW2.  I get just the same amount of points for shooting someone as i get for reviving them.  It works beautifully.There is a leveling up system which is similar to MW2, nothing as developed though, but there is enough there to keep you coming back for more and you do unlock different sights, guns, gadgets etc...  Some are just for the particular class you use i.e - medic unlocks larger health packs, but others are more general and can be used for any class, i.e - heavy vehicle perks.The first BFBC had 2 deal breakers for me.  One was their crazy health system where you jam a needle into your stomach when your health got low, which ofcourse is something you would have to do 50 times a match.  The other was the lack of any kind of kill cam!  It's no fun being sniped over and over again and having no idea where the sniper is when you respawn.  THANKFULLY, both of those deal breakers have been removed.  Your health regenerates (no needle to the stomach required) and there is a kill cam, you don't actually see the enemy kill you like in MW2, but you follow them around until you respawn so you know where they are and can carry out the proper justice.Also, locating enemies is somewhat unique to this game, when you see an enemy, you have to press the back button on your controller and then a red insignia appears over their head and they show up on your entire teams map for a brief amount of time.  I can't express how gratifying it was to spot 3 snipers on a hill, press the back button, and watch them get lit up by my team - rockets, bullets, you name it, it went their way.  Also, you get assit kill points for things like that, again, encouraging team work.BFBC2 is a great game, very different then MW2 but in a good way.  If you need a break from MW2, give it a try, you wont be disappointed.  Again, one of the most impressive things about the multiplayer is how it rewards you for team work and incourages it.  If actually playing a first person shooter AS a team, not just \"lone wolfin it\" while you're IN a team, sounds good to you, pick this game up, you wont be dissapointed.I gave this game 4 out of 5 stars because it's not perfect.  What game is?  I have experienced some issues actually getting into a multiplayer match (can't find a match, busy, error, whatever,it means that their servers are full and they can't handle it, and several matchs have ended abruptly due to server issues.  But once you actually get into a match, it's a ton of fun.FYI:  Snipers, snipers, snipers!  What is the deal, everyone and their Mom wants to be a sniper.  It seems that atleast a third to half of the players in the game are snipers.  Not sure why, they always have the least amount of points and seem to stay in one spot most of the game.......i digress.  Switch it up!***UPDATE (03/14/10)***I've been playing this came for quite sometime (all medic, recon, and heavy vehicle upgrades have been unlocked), i must say that it has held up well, although some of its flaws are more noticeable, nothing major per say, but worth mentioning, 1st one being the most important.1)It's much easier to be a skilled pilot then to be a skilled engineer w/the rocket launcher.Apache helicopters with missles are extremly unbalanced.  What i mean by that is it is far to easy for a skilled pilot to get an insane amount of kills, to the point of feeling unfair because it's so hard to take it down.  None of the rocket launchers \"LOCK\" on, yes you can guide the rocket, but you can't actually \"LOCK\" on, which is frustrating.  When playing 'rush' on the map featured in the demo (the snow map which takes place during the day), there is a powerful Apache on that map, but you're given a good amount of tanks which help with taking it down, so it's not that extreme.But......This unbalance issue is taken to a whole new level on the map consisting of the 3 islands (with an autumn backdrop), when you're playing 'rush', the defenders are given an EXTREMLY OVERPOWERED Apache helicopter when/if they reach the 3rd island.  I've played 2 games thus far where my team was about to seal the deal and take the 3rd island when the defenders hopped in that freakin apache and annihilated everyone, it got so bad that most of my team dropped out, including myself.  No point in playing any longer when you've died 5 times in a row because the apache is hovering over your spawn base firing rockets at you as you spawn in.  I equipped the engineer class and so did half my team and we were shooting rocket after rocket trying to take it down, nothing was working.  By my 5th death in a row, of not be alive more then 30 secs, i dropped out.The first time it happend, it was extremly frustrating because my team was actually good, everyone was playing their role well, that's why it seemed extremely unfair.The second time, i knew the drill at this point and gave it 5min, if it wasn't taken down in that amount of time, we dropped out.  At that point, it just becomes a waste of time.This is by far the biggest flaw i've found in the game.  Basically, you've invested 20-30min to get that far in a match, then putting all player skills to the side, it boils down to who can get to the Apache first.  They need to either lower the health of that particular Apache or make the rocked launcher system easier to use against it, ie-better guidance, tracking, more powerful, something!  It just seems incredibility unbalanced.2)Spawning is a lot better then MW2, but could use a bit of work.I was playing a 'rush' match and my team was defending and we were actually able to jump the spawn base of the attackers and smother them the entire match, they didn't get to set one 'com station' off, seemed unfair for the other team, we should'nt have been able to do that.Also, i've spawned into mortar strikes twice (spawning on a teammate), that was purely bad luck on my part though, nothing against the game.3)Match making protocol can use some work.I've found it useful to hit/hold the 'back button' when i first get into a match because some of the time i find that i'm put on a team that only has, let's say 7 people, compared to the other team which as 12.  Or i'm put on a team where the top player has 500 pts and the other teams top player has 1600 points, usually a good measure of how \"good\" your team is going to be.Again, my rating still stands, it's a great game and a ton of fun, just be aware of the 3 island map playing rush, try to get to that Apache first, if not, be ready for game over.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2010"}

McKenzie","summary":"A Worthy Companion Piece To \"GTA 4\"","reviewText":"\"Episodes From Liberty City Stories\" is comprised of two games that were originally only available via downloading.  They both use the world, gameplay, and story of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".  If you can stomach some of the problems with these two games, then this will be a fine addition to your collection.The Two Games included:* The Lost and Damned* The Ballad of Gay Tony--------------------------------------The Premise* Both games take place during Niko Bellic's criminal activities from \"GTA 4\".  Although both have their own unique story, they will often center around what happened with the diamond heist that went horribly wrong in \"GTA 4\".--------------------------------------The Story* \"The Lost and Damned\" chronicles the turmoils of a biker gang, currently led by Johnny Klebitz.  However, when gang president Billy comes home from prison, Johnny clashes with Billy's more violent, care-free way of doing business.* \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" tells the story of Luis Lopez, a man who was saved from a lowly life of crime by Tony Prince, owner of the hottest nightclubs in Liberty City.  But Tony's indiscretions and personal demons force Luis to get involved with some dangerous people to keep the businesses - and his personal & working relationship with Tony - stable.--------------------------------------Gameplay* \"The Lost and Damned\" is heavily based around running with the biker gang.  You often ride with other gang members to complete missions, your home is the L&D; bar, and several members are available to call for backup or sell you weapons.  Most of the missions take place in the state of Alderney.* \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" is mostly based in Algonquin, since that's where Tony's businesses and dealings are.  You have your own safehouse and more fanciful wardrobe, and the gameplay is more similar to \"GTA 4\" where you tend to be more of a solo operator with some friends on the side.--------------------------------------Side Activites* Both games feature unique mini-games outside of the main story.  Because \"Lost and Damned\" is mostly based around the gang, your side activities revolve around them.  You can fight Gang Wars, where your crew will try to take out some competing gangs.  The biker hangout allows you to arm wrestle, gamble on a hi-low card game, and just hang out.* \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", on the other hand, allows you to fight in an underground fight club, do some baseline jumps off the skyscrapers, shoot at the golf driving range, help a couple of old friends with Drug Wars (take out the competition), and watch over one of Tony's nightclubs.Either title's minigames are good and bad.  It's nice to watch over a nightclub, but it gets repetitve.  I love playing hi-lo, but you can't increase your gambling wage.  The Gang and Drug Wars are very fun, but they don't do much except increase your completion percentage.--------------------------------------Which Game Is Better?* I prefer \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" in almost every way.  I think controlling a motorcycle in any of the \"GTA 4\"-based games is annoying (though it's probably more realistic than past \"GTA\" games).  I love doing missions in Algonquin (the Manhattan-inspired city), but pretty much hate doing missions in Alderney (the Jersey-inspired state).  \"Ballad of Gay Tony\" is a more colorful story and world overall, whereas \"Lost and Damned\" features a more grungy, hardrock kind of backdrop.  I had a hard time telling the L&D; gang members apart; in \"Ballad\", I never once forgot who anybody was.  I enjoyed the minigames in \"Ballad\" more than the activities available in \"Lost\".Overall, I thought \"The Lost and Damned\" was a pretty good, whereas \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" was even better.--------------------------------------OVERALL* Now, I want to be clear about this: Both games are good, and both are worth playing.  I just thought that \"Ballad of Gay Tony\" had a more compelling lead character in Luis Lopez, and the story flowed smoother from start to finish, especially since many characters play a part in the main story.  In \"Lost and Damned\", I knew where the gang's infighting would lead, and I wasn't terribly surprised by the conclusion.The great thing about \"Episodes From Liberty City\" is that both games are unique enough that there will fans of both.  The bad side is that I believe players are gonna really like one, and feel indifferent towards the other, just like I did.The sad part about this is that even when you combine the games together, there still isn't much to do compared to \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".  The characters were deeper, the story more surprising, and the things to do to kill time more plentiful.  These two expansions had a lot to live up to, and for the most part, they're satisfying add-ons.I recommend picking this two-pack compilation up.  Both \"The Lost and Damned\" & \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" are good games.  Just don't expect the masterful epic that was \"GTA 4\".  They weren't meant to surpass that game in the first place.THE LOST AND DAMNED = 8.0 / 10THE BALLAD OF GAY TONY = 8.5 / 10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2010"}

The graphics engine is holding up pretty well being two years old and looks rather good. There is an option to turn of the grain in the menu and I advise that you do because without grain the game looks a lot better. The missions at the beginning are pretty boring and monotonous. Basically you go after the rival gang and kill them. After you get past the first maybe ten missions the game gets more interesting along with the story. I feel like the characters in the gang could have been branched out more, because I didn't really know who was who. It does connect a few times with the story of GTA IV and you get to fight alongside Niko on a few ocassions.The story does kick into gear a few hours in and ends on a satisfying final level. I wish the game developers could take out the first few missions because a lot of people will get bored of them and stop playing the game, which is a shame because there are some fun missions to play. The end does feel rushed and some characters are left on the sideline in the final few missions. Like Niko and other characters that Johnny meets throughout the game.The gameplay is mostly the same as GTA IV with the exception of the gang and motorcycle controls. The bikes drive better and make turns with a lot more precision. Some weapons and vehicles have been added, but considering you drive a bike 99 percent of the time its hard to notice the vehicles. The weapons though are pretty cool. There is an automatic shotgun that obliterates cars in seconds along with pipe bombs that can be thrown like grenades. The cover system along with the auto aim really feel dated and need an overhaul. There just too stiff when compared to some other games in the third person genre namely Uncharted.The gang itself is pretty fun to ride with. It is annoying to follow Billy around, but its nice to have backup at the touch of a button on your cell phone. If members of your gang die they are replaced with worse members. I accidentally shot one of my members in the face because he was stupid enough to walk in front of my shotgun. I really wish they would have made the crew invincible or at least let them re-spawn after the current mission, because the guys you have at the end are really stupid.A major flaw in the game is the lack of med kits. They are added at the end of the game, but for most of the game you are left to committing suicide before a mission to get full health. Another problem besides that is that you ammo does not return to pre death state when you re-spawn. You start with the same ammo that you died with which is really annoying when you can't get to a gun shop during a mission. Also there is male nudity in this add on. Why must we see a mans family jewels but the women are covered up. Does Rockstar not know it's audience?Overall a decent game. If they could have taken the first few levels away it would receive a higher score. Another problem along with a slow start is that it can be beat in seven hours. Now I know what you're saying it is just an add on, but I expect more compared to the forty hour campaign from the original. There are some bike races and arm wrestling modes added in, but you'll get tired of them very quickly. Riding in a gang of bikers is a cool concept, but I wish Rockstar would have worked on making some better missions to keep your interest. Overall 3.5/5The Ballad of Gay Tony is the true sequel to GTA IV. It is right off the bat a whole lot more interesting than The Lost and the Damned. The graphics are more colorful in this ad-on due to the \"gay\" color scheme. Which has a lot more glitz and color compared to the other games. I really like the scheme because it brightens up Liberty City and it's no where near as dreary as the normal game.The story in this game is a lot more absurd than The Lost and the Damned, but that is a great thing as it is a lot of fun. The characters are zany and power hungry and are fun to work with throughout the campaign. You are Luis who is the right hand man to Gay Tony. He runs night clubs and Luis has to keep his partners happy by helping them do odds and ends jobs. The final level and end of the story itself are very well done, and I can only hope these characters are in a future game, but if not at least they got a great sendoff.A cool feature that is added is the mission select option. Once you beat the game you can go back and redo any mission which is pretty cool considering there is a good number of them I want to do again. There are some new vehicles added like a tank which blows the police and any bystander to hell, a good handling muscle car, and a helicopter with missiles among many others. Another fun feature is parachuting which is very welcomed when online and your buddy decides to bail out of the helicopter leaving you to die. Now you just pull your chute and get even with him when you hit the ground. Perhaps you could use the new shotgun with explosive shells to settle the score.Unfortunately the gameplay issues that plagued TLAD are still there in this one like the cover system and overall gunplay mechanic. Thankfully there are not a lot of gunplay missions and the ones that do exist are not nearly as handicapped by these issues, and are fun to play unlike the missions in TLAD.Overall this add on is everything that made GTA IV great along with some great new features that made the experience even better. The game time is about nine and a half hours which is a great length for me and it also doesn't drag on like other titles of that length. The characters are another reason to buy this game. They are really fun to watch and interact with. This is a great game that is well worth the money. 4.5/5This set is a great deal if you want to play both titles. I can't recommend the Lost and the Damned though. If you are a completionist then you might as well buy the set with them both, but if you want to save money then just buy The Ballad of Gay Tony and just leave TLAD alone as it is more pain than fun. Overall 4/5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2010"}

The dialogue and cutscenes have hilarious dialogue and the story is light-hearted.- Gameplay: Racing is full of strategy and fast-paced action. Drifting feels \"right\" and while the weapons can be a bit too powerful, they are still fun to use. Creating your own character, tracks and vehicles is easy for beginners but there are enough options for the most creative players to make what they desire.- Graphics: Attractive visuals with great presentation. Load times are very long but that's a small price to pay for the smooth gameplay and sheer amount of options.- Audio: Good voice acting, great dialogue and solid sound effects. Dodging incoming rockets can be done with good timing and listening.- Replay Value: 5-hour campaign mode with mountains of unlockables.

SOME THINGS CHANGED . . .For the first time, we get to experience the world of Fallout in the 3rd or even 1st person view. While a refreshing change from the top-down views of old, these new views and ways of playing Fallout have their fair share of problems.For example, the third person view has some of the goofiest animations I've seen in a while and is useless for combat reasons. It looks like your character is skating over the ground or hovering over it instead of running or walking on it.The first-person view was great for general wandering around and bashing the heads of Mutants with the Sledgehammer, but I found that trying to fire guns in this view was clunky and often not as effective as VATS.Thankfully they included VATS, as it lets you target specific areas and conserve your ammo somewhat.. . . BUT WAR. WAR NEVER CHANGES.Overall, I found Fallout 3 to be far more enjoyable than Oblivion and more appealing than the original Fallout 1 and 2. I did have the game crash a few times, but anyone who has played video games should know enough to keep a few manual saves on hand, just in case. The main quest was pretty short, which I found actually refreshing, although I found the ending a bit of a letdown (spoiled by Final Fantasy 6's 30 minute ending).There is so much variety in this game I can easily see myself playing it far longer than Oblivion.Enjoy!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2009"}
{"product_name":"B004NRN5EO","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"flaviolius","summary":"Scary, tough, frustrating....and totally awesome.","reviewText":"At the risk of being repetitive, I'll not go into great detail about Dark Souls here.  I'll also not get into the online components for the same reason.  As a person who put hundreds of hours into Demon's Souls, I thought I'd list some differences that might help those on the fence or new to the game.Dark Souls has an open-world format now.  This is good and bad.  As the world is so massive, there's much more backtracking and repeating sections compared to Demon's Souls.  You'll unlock shortcuts as you go, Metroid-style, and you'll practically cheer when you find one.  No, scratch that, you WILL cheer.  Still, I think the world is actually too large for as punishing as Dark Souls' gameplay can be.  While the world is larger in scope, and packed with secret chambers and tunnels and respawning enemies, it feels more confining as you move through it.A massive improvement is the removal of the weight limit.  Don't get me wrong, you still have an equip limit, but the lack of Stockpile Thomas from Demon's Souls sort of demanded Dark Souls to give you a bottomless inventory....which it does.  This is great.  You can carry multiple spears, removing the worry that your items might wear out.  Equipment does still degrade, and becomes useless if it degrades completely, but being able to stack them makes the going a teensy bit easier.  It's one of the few concessions within a game that's designed to be a challenge.The combat is essentially the same as the first game, with its careful and strategic swordplay and sorcery, but I have noticed far more narrow hallways and catwalks in the game design.  Remember how \"fun\" it was to navigate Stonefang Tunnel in Demon's Souls?  Huge chunks of Dark Souls are modeled in a similar fashion.  In many places, you have little to no room to maneuver, which can hurt the combat.  The lack of open areas can make the combat repetitive: funnel everyone into a hallway and take em out one at a time.  I recommend getting a stabbing-type weapon and shield as early as you possibly can; it makes the early going more manageable.  Oh, and close-quarters boss fights are not fun, especially when the camera fights to give you a clear view.  I suppose this is also the place to mention that the slowdown in Dark Souls is much more prevalent than in Demon's.Here's a non-spoiler hint:  if you encounter an awesome-looking large creature or heavily armored soldier that's not a boss, RUN.  Enemies are more tenacious in Dark Souls, and will climb ladders to chase you.  However, you now have a plunging attack that you can use when falling off a ledge with an enemy and ground below you.  These attacks do a lot of damage, and even more two-handed.  This is a hint that saved me many times in the early going.And if I may make a final suggestion:  don't spoil Dark Souls.  Don't follow walkthroughs or watch youtube footage.  I started as a Deprived, and I have died many many MANY times, but the sense of exploration and discovery is unmatched.  There's always a new bridge to cross or stairway to follow, and what awaits is terrifying and amazing.  I'm thrilled that the game doesn't hold your hand, or point you in the right direction.  At one point I found a key, and I had no clue where I was supposed to use it.  But I kept my eyes out, and finally found the correct locked door, in a place I'd forgotten.  Another time, I was having a heap of trouble defeating a certain enemy.  I switched from my Deprived's dear ol club to a spear, and things went better - still tough, mind you, but I finally felt like I had a chance.  A third: I was fleeing screaming from a crowd of relentlessly pursuing enemies, and ran into a dead end with a lever to the side of a locked gate.  I pulled the lever and died, but the gate opened a shortcut, saving me future work.  It was a heroic death.  The point is, if you leave things as surprises and keep your wits about you, you'll be surprised in a way that few games have ever been able to create.Dark Souls is tough, but it rewards the patient and persistent.  It is not for everyone.  It has its roots fully and stubbornly planted from a former age of gaming.  It can be beaten, as long as you are careful and try different approaches and equipment.  I personally prefer Demon's Souls (barely) because it feels more cohesive, isn't as sprawling, and wasn't quite as frustrating.  But games like Dark Souls just aren't made anymore.  Beneath the difficulty is a sense of freedom, discovery, and ever-present danger that's completely and utterly hypnotic.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0000DJX7I","description":"Praised for brilliant scripts and open-ended gameplay, vilified for unapologetic violence and mature themes,Grand Theft Autohas deservedly become one of the most popular game franchises in history. This double pack contains the full versions of bothGrand Theft Auto IIIandGrand Theft Auto III: Vice City, enhanced for Xbox. Xbox gamers can rejoice that the grand king of video games--The Sopranoswith a gamepad--is finally available on the big black box.Grand Theft AutoWithGrand Theft Auto IIIRockstar proves that not all developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games. This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking more structure can embark on dozens of missions driven by a genuinely interesting crime-story plot or steal cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and you can go on vigilante missions. Grab a cab and you can play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi. Take a fire truck and you can earn money putting out fires. The minigames are a good way to unwind after a particularly difficult mission. With so much to do, the game just never gets boring.As you'd expect, there are consequences for criminality. As your random acts of mayhem mount up the police start hounding you, eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic, pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing. Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerGrand Theft Auto III: Vice CityHow big is this game? Even publicists for other games end up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto IIInever dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action. InVice Citythis is--to use a clich&#xE9; that is for once apropos--taken to a whole new level.--David StoeszPros:Open-ended gameplay; player can chose to be relatively law-abiding or engage in wanton virtual destructionVaried missionsBrilliant scripts with Hollywood voice actingRocking sound track (also available in our Music store)Xbox-enhanced graphicsCons:As theThe Sopranosof games,GTA 3draws unwanted attention from overzealous legislatorsNo multiplayer","reviewerName":"The Game \"B\"","summary":"The best of the best!","reviewText":"Grand Theft Auto has always been a hit on PS2 which includes GTA 1, 2, 3 and Vice City.

I can imagine that when this came out it probably blew a few minds.  I've got to be honest, i don't know whether im just a jaded PC FPS gamer or does Resistance have some of the worst console FPS controls ever conceived?  When i actually hit something using the analog stick it feels pretty good, but all i can think about is how if i just had a mouse and keyboard i would devastate the opposition instead of running around struggling to even aim at the enemy, firing wildly in all directions as i take out window after window never even grazing the enemy.  I liked the weapons right off the bat, especially the gun that allows you to tag an enemy then fire homing rounds so you don't have to aim, but its that initial homing tag that is difficult to even land because of the horrid aiming scheme.  This game sealed the coffin on console first person shooters for me, but if you like console FPS then you can't go wrong with Resistance especially with how cheap it is now.  But if you are like me and are used to accurately hitting your enemies with a mouse and keyboard, steer clear of this one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2010"}

It was only AMD Athlon 2000+, 512mb ram, GeForce 4 MX 440 64mb, with DSL and I was able to run it with no bugs, no lags, and on medium settings. But you guys who whines that this game is filled with bugs, try to see if your system meets the requirments. If it does, then try to see if there is anything else wrong with your PC. But if the game is still not working or has bugs, try downloading a patch or return it. You guys don't have to make bad comments and rate it bad just because it doesn't run on your PC and it does on mine. If you didn't play the game itself you shouldn't rate it.Now back to the game itself, this game is amazing. I have played it and enjoyed every minute playing this game. It's so much better than Battlefield 1942 because you have newer weapons, more maps, and different vehicles. Not only that, you will have more wide variety of tactics such as the Vietcong's Hit and Run or set up a trap with logs. It definitly has better sounds with radios in vehicles and better graphics. And no, it doesn't have worse graphics then Battlefield 1942. Oh crap, I have to go. Just make sure you have better computer than Pentium 3 1.4 or Athlon XP 1600+ with 512mb ram, GeForce 4 TI and Radeon 9000 or higher with DSL or higher connection to play without so much lags. The reason why the graphics reccomendation is so high is because this will make a big diffrence in the game. If you only have a GeForce 2, 3, Radeon 8500 or lower, it might not run very fast. To play it on highest settings with no lags, get at least Athlon XP 3200+, 1GB ram, Radeon 9600XT or GeForce 5700 Ultra with cable modem.

By contrast, Resistance 2 falls flat in almost every way...very disappointing considering the top-notch developer.  The biggest problem here is the complete lack of engagement the game offers.  I remember playing the first game and being on the edge of my seat, frantically searching for health packs and afraid to turn a corner.  This game I felt like I was just trudging through.  The story is weak, and doesn't really make you want to keep going.  The game is easier than the first one, and seemed quite a bit shorter too.  However, there are times where you'll get a handful of enemies that can kill you instantly.  Since they're invisible, you have no choice but to die 4 or 5 times so that you can try again...this time wiping the floor with them because you know where they are.  The graphics in this game are quite sub-par to the first game and far below what the PlayStation 3 is capable of.  Jaggies abound, textures are just flat-out missing in several places, and enemy fire looks heavily pixelated.  Still, there are a few times where the game looks quite beautiful...unfortunately those are few and far between.  And after all is said and done and you reach the end, you're rewarded with a 2-minute ending followed by 30 minutes of credits (and I'll save you the time...there's nothing after the credits).Multiplayer is done well, and is one of this game's bright spots.  You get an entirely different co-op campaign as well as the standard competitive multiplayer fare, going up to 60 players.  Not bad.  Another great feature of this title is its connectivity to the PSP game, Resistance: Retribution.  If you have that game, trust me that using this feature in Resistance 2 can help tremendously!So yeah, in the end, Resistance 2 is just an okay title.  Falls short of the system-seller it was intended to be.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-28-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"Jub Jub","summary":"Halo 4 game review","reviewText":"Halo Man's back in action! Er... Master Chief's back in action. I can't say I'm the biggest Halo fan. I generally like the series but definitely felt it was going in the wrong direction since Halo 3 and ODS or whatever that other one was called. Halo Reach did bring me back to respect the series again with a good story acting as a prequel and a farewell from Bungie. When it was announced that there was going to be a Halo 4 my first thought was `...really? I thought Master Chief died.' I only found out about the true ending to Halo 3 last year...  Yeah, I didn't really care to play through the game on legendary. So my very first impressions for Halo 4 weren't too good and it has really stayed off my radar till this week and sometimes it's best to not have your hopes up for a pleasant surprise. Maybe it's because AC3 was such a disappointment but I really liked Halo 4. It's also been awhile since I've played a shooter. I stopped playing them for awhile because I had grown tired of them (THANKS CoD...). I have to say this is the best Halo game I've played since Halo 2 back in 2004. It has some miss steps in game play and story but seems to be a promising start to a new chapter in the Halo series.STORY: The game starts aboard the wreckage of the UNSC starship Forward Unto Dawn, four years after the events of Halo 3. The holographic vixen AI that is Cortana wakes up Master Chief from his long cryogenically induced sleep as the remains of the ship they are on is being attacked by Covenant forces. They discover that they have drifted near the mysterious Forerunner planet Requiem. During the battle, the planet activates a gravity well and sucks them into it. On the surface they encounter the Covenant who are searching for something and they also encounter cybernetic beings known as Prometheans. As they explore and battle through this bizarre planet, they discover a being called The Didact that was imprisoned here and inadvertently release him. He, of course, wants to kill all humans and take over the universe. In the midst of all this, Cortana reveals to Master Chief, who has been with him since the beginning of the series, that she is going rampant, a condition that happens to AI's over 7 years old and ultimately results being shut down aka death. And this plot point is the strongest part of the story. The interesting relationship between Master Chief and Cortana gets really looked at and developed here or more so than in the previous games. You know that the fate of Cortana can't end well and it weighs in on the heart strings throughout the game. It also shows that Cortana, a computer AI seems to be more human than Master Chief, a human. Not an ordinary human, but human none the less.The campaign finishes up around 10 hours, which is sadly rather long for an FPS game these days. The story is presented well and has a good pace. It kind of sags in the middle which is not helped by game play that gets a little repetitive by that time but it does pick up again. It is a bit predictable, especially if you've played other Halo games. Outside of Master Chief and Cortana, other characters are not really explored. They are just mainly there to move the plot along. There are some new Spartans including a female Spartan who is there, says a couple lines then is gone. I think she is supposed to be from the expanded universe but I'm not sure. Speaking of expanded universe, I think there are a lot of references to the Halo books in this game but, me having not read them, did not pick up on them. Like I said, the best part of the story is the relationship between Chief and Cortana and even that I wish was developed a little more. The story and game doesn't do much to take any risks outside the usual fair that the series puts on. I will say it does have a bitter sweet ending and I am curious to see what comes of this new chapter in the Halo series.GAMEPLAY: For those who are familiar to the Halo series, there are no big surprises to the controls and plays like pretty much all the games before it. Heh, though some hardcore Halo fans are mighty pissed at some new additions because it's too much like Call of Duty. I don't know what they're going on about because the only thing I can see that was added was a sprint button which is great. I would have liked to see the ability to aim down the sights with all the weapons besides the ones with optics but then again, some of the weapons in Halo don't even have sights. I don't know how anyone is supposed to actually aim with the assault rifle but anyway. There are a lot of weapons we know from previous games that return a long with all new weapons use by the Prometheans. The coolest thing about these guns is how they look and act. They disassemble and reassemble on their own when you pick them up and reload. The first time you see it, you'll be like WOAH THAT'S AWESOME! Some of the weapons feel a bit under powered but that's mainly the assault rifle type weapons, the other guns feel just right. A really cool new weapon that was added is called the sticky launcher and is fun to use. It shoots a little sticky explosive that you can remote detonate. It's great for killing large groups of enemies.The new HUD is neat looking with the corners of Master Chief's visor visible in the corners of the screen so it feels more like it's from his POV, kind of like Samus in the Metriod Prime games. It does, however, make the screen a little cluttered, especially when holding a big weapon. Makes me feel kind of claustrophobic, I don't know. Now one thing that has always bothered me about Halo is that, Master Chief, this guy with super power armor, doesn't really feel all that powerful outside of a regenerating shield and being able to jump like he's on the moon. Now I never gave this all that much thought until I played Crysis 2. Crysis is the way to do an FPS with a character with power armor. In Crysis, your character has invisibility, hard armor mode, increased speed, jumping, and strength that are all regulated by a power meter in your HUD. You don't need any items to do any of this, it's up to you to manage these powers with the energy meter and it adds a dynamic that lets you play the game however you want. I was hoping there would be more things like that in Halo 4. My wish was half granted in the form of power ups that you can swap out. Things like hard energy shields, cloaking, thermal vision, portable sentry bots, come in the form of these powers that you can find and swap out. These are kind of like the shield items from Halo 3 but instead of being one time use, they recharge when they are not being used. They're not bad but sometimes it's hard to really know which one would be more useful to you as you progress through certain areas and most of the time it doesn't exactly matter.The game play tries to stay exciting and varied with some fun vehicle levels and flying type space shooter levels that return from Halo Reach, though I feel the space combat level from Reach was better. There are some levels near the middle of the game where some of the repetitiveness from some of the older games shows through, ie run and gun from way point to way point. It would have been nice to see Halo try and step out of its safe zone more than it has. That's the problem a lot of these mega franchises have; they are afraid to step out of their comfort zone in fear of upsetting and losing their fans and the majority of their fans pretty much ask for the same thing over and over again, be it they realize it or not. I'm looking at you Call of Duty. Speaking of which, there is this multiplayer part. Totally not the reason I bought the game but I know it is the reason millions of fans did buy the game. Now, I have no way to play it online at this time so I know I'm missing out on the meat of the game that the fans really care about and if you want me to invite me to your house to play online or whatever, I'd be down with that. I do miss the old Halo parties I used to go in the mid-2000s. But we didn't need the internet; we just needed a bunch of tvs and networking hubs. Anyway, from what I've seen, the actual game play in multiplayer looks pretty much like it has been since Halo 2. I know there is a new class system that is supposed to be a lot like how Call of Duty's multiplayer system which has a lot of fans up in arms since they want Halo to be nothing like CoD even though Halo's multiplayer success is what paved the way for the success of Call of Duty's multiplayer and becoming the money making machine it is today. Multiplayer is no big deal to me. I'm an old school gamer in the sense that multiplayer is that extra little thing you do after you beat the game and have some friends over. If there are any real changes in the multiplayer that I should be aware of, please let me know.GRAPHICS: So I've been kind of ragging on this game about the game play and such but I can proudly say this about Halo 4: This is one of the BEST looking games I have ever seen on the Xbox 360. This game is just beautiful. The environments are so lush, vibrantly colored, have amazing lighting and are heavily detailed. You have look, I mean, really look to find any slightly blurry textures or anything. The weapon effects and explosions all look awesome. The HUD and sights for the weapons are all nicely detailed and look great. The character models all look fantastic and use facial scanning animation technology which I love and add depth and feeling to the characters. Master Chief looks amazing and his armor is so finely detailed. Cortana looks hotter than ever. Yes, I think Cortana is the hottest hologram AI ever. The rendered cut scenes are so high quality I honestly thought I was watching something that was filmed live action at first. Best of all, there is absolutely no slow down or frame rate drop in the game. 343 Industries really knew how to use the 360's hardware and produced one of the best looking games for the system ever.SOUND: Just like the graphics, the sound design is something to marvel at. To the loud explosions and sounds of battle to the little clicks of reloading your weapon, everything sounds so crisp and clean. The musical score is beautiful and I even went and downloaded the soundtrack after playing the game. All the voice acting is well done and believable with the exception of Master Chief. This game is probably the most I've heard him talk and while he sounds great in his usual calm and cool voice, it's the few moments where he actually has to raise his voice and make an emotion that made me laugh. However, it's Jen Taylor performance, who voices Cortana, which really steals the show. The heavy emotional state that Cortana is going through is brought to life by Taylor and oddly makes her feel like the most human character in the game. Excellent sound for an excellent looking game.Overall, Halo 4 is a beautiful game that sadly has a few missed opportunities. If it had just found a way to expand the game play more, take some more risks, and enrich the story a little more, I'd say this would be THE game of the year but it misses the mark. This game is meant to start a new chapter in the series so I am curious to see where they go with it and hope they can do more to really expand it in the future. If you're a Halo fan, what I say probably isn't going to bother you because I know you've probably already beaten it and are spending hours playing online. If you absolutely hate Halo, this game isn't going to change your mind at all. If you're on the fence, I'd say it's definitely worth picking up in a couple months after the price goes down some.OVERALL: 7.5/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"R. Reining \"Old School Zinger\"","summary":"Missed Opportunity: The Game","reviewText":"I am a casual fan of Halo. I own all of the games. They aren't a franchise I dearly love, but it has provided me with a lot of entertainment over the years. It's always been sort of a given that when a new Halo comes out, I will buy it eventually. After this one though, I'm not sure I will continue doing so.Visually, the game is fantastic. Very few games I've ever played match the visual quality. It's obvious great care was taken in the graphic design of everything. Likewise, the score is also amazing. It's not the usual Halo music, but it's a change that I actually like. The original Halo theme and general music is pretty much gone in this iteration, but it was very noticeable and added layers to the story. Unfortunately, when all you have in a story are layers of music, you really don't have anything.Good lord, the story. I don't know who wrote the script for this game, but if George Lucas had a hand in it I wouldn't be surprised. There was a moment early on in the game (and I wish I could remember the line) where Master Chief responds to something Cortana says, and I had an involuntary reaction of \"Ugh.\" It was that bad.I don't expect literary genius from video games in general, and especially not in first person shooters, but this was noticeably bad. And it wasn't only the scripted dialog, it was the the way characters were written and how almost the entire plot made no sense.The game opens with a cinematic wherein Catherine Halsey (the person Cortana is modeled after) is being interrogated by some person whom you never meet. It's a quick and very vague exchange of words that I imagine is meant to give you the impression that Dr. Halsey is keeping some sort of secret about the Master Chief. This aspect is never revisited and never pays off in any way, and you never see her again. That's okay though because the dialog was so godawful the less there is the better.Generally the plot to the game is Cortana wakes Master Chief up out of cryostasis because she detects there are hull breaches in the aft section of the ship. I actually liked the first chunk of the game, because it was more tutorial-like and wasn't horribly padded with pointless \"You need to go here and push buttons in three different locations.\" So after the tutorial you crash land on a Forerunner planet, and this is where the problems really begin. You start to receive strange transmissions that are very garbled, and come to find out it's from a UNSC ship called Infinity, who seems to be transmitting from the core of the planet. So you go to investigate.The tracking of the Infinity and journey to the planet's core in itself isn't a problem, but after you're told why that is where the signal was coming from, everything that happened before makes no sense. It turns out that a Forerunner called the Didact is manipulating the Infinity's signal in order to fool you into coming down to investigate, and shutting down two beams of light that are garbling the signal from the ship so that you can transmit back to them. But once you do that, you inadvertently release the Didact from where he has been imprisoned for a long-ass time. And as soon as he is released his magic armor automatically appears or was already there for some inexplicable reason, even though he was imprisoned by his own people for the extreme actions he took in the past. All of that is fine and I can give it a pass, except that the Covenent are also trying to release the Didact, and you have to fight them all the way there. So...why didn't the Covenent just release him and spare Master Chief from doing all this pointless legwork for no reason? For some odd reason he also has telekinetic powers and so like the comical villain he is, he needlessly chokes Master Chief and then throws him against a wall even though he could just kill him right then since by then it must be obvious to the Didact that he has cut a bloody swath though the Covenent ranks to get this far. He also says something generic about humanity being a plague or somesuch. It was dumb and I already didn't care because it was so shallow and his motivations were so weak or unexplained.But instead he gets in his comical bad guy sphere and flies away as his slipstream rupture makes the structure blow up real good, and for the first time in the game Master Chief survives a huge explosion, but not for the last.Anyways I'm already sick of wasting more time explaining how nonsensical the story is. The biggest tragedy is that there is a separate story going on with Cortana and how she has been an active AI for eight years, and normal AI's begin to decay after six. This should have been the core conflict in the game. The problem wasn't that it wasn't, it's that it was done so badly that it came off and cheesy and ultimately supremely unsatisfying. There are also a couple of new characters introduced that genuinely seem interesting, but they are given hardly any chance to shine. I imagine they will be more heavily involved in the next game, but it was another aspect that was really disappointing. Instead of doing things cooperatively or in a way that allows the player to emotionally connect with them, you're forced to do mind-numbing tasks that are at least 80% \"Go here and push a button to insert Cortana into the network.\" It is so dry and dull that eventually I just turned the difficulty down and began running through the sections of levels where it was possible. That's horrible to say, but I just got so tired of doing the exact same thing.As with games like Crysis 2 or movies like Avatar, I don't care how amazing the picture or the sound is if there is no substance to the story. There is no satisfying payoff at the end. You can't just throw words out there with implied grandiose importance and expect me to care or think it's really epic. Words like Composer, Mantle, Gateway, Reclaimer, and on and on. What you're subjected to at the end is an overly forced cinematic that is supposed to be emotional (???) or something. But since it was handled in such a clunky way I wasn't moved at all (when I should have been). And then after the credits the Didact is doing narration in the past tense as if he survived the final confrontation (wouldn't surprise me) and is going to continue to be the villain. I mean if your bad guy is going to be senseless at least make him interesting, and not have him say such cliche things as \"Humanity is the single greatest threat the galaxy has ever seen,\" when in the game humanity has done nothing without being first provoked. It's just so stupid, and I shouldn't be sitting and laughing at how simplistic the dialog is in a game like this. Again, it's okay to have corny dialog in action games or movies, as long as the people working on the game or movie know that it's cheesy. When the dialog and the tone are clashing though, the player is taken out of the immersion and then has to think about why that felt so wrong. Or maybe not everyone, based on the reviews, but for me at least.I'm really not trying to come across as that guy who is nitpicking this game to death because I hate its popularity or whatever. I'm sure if I went back and analyzed the first three Halo games and Reach you could nitpick the logic to death in those games as well. And I know that all games have busy work in them designed to pad the playing time. That's fine, but the job as developers is to disguise it in a way where you aren't constantly feeling dread every time you go to do something, knowing that it's not going to be as simple as it's planned. Sometimes it should be as simple as it's planned. It's called diversity and it's a beautiful thing.So yeah if you're a fan of games where you get fire cool weapons at aliens and robots and don't give a damn about story or characterization in even the most basic way, buy this game. Likewise if you want it just for the multi-player, I'm sure that's good as well. If you're looking for substance though, look elsewhere. This game earns two stars only for the time they spent making the game look and sound beautiful.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2012"}

Peavey","summary":"Sonic Adventures","reviewText":"Sonic Adventure is an amazing game for the Sega Dreamcast in 1999 this game is a success to the 2d Sonic games but now with added story.Characters: Sonic adventure is where we play as any of the characters starting with Sonic then Tails and Knuckles with better abilities for example Knuckles can dig under ground. Amy Rose returns from her Sonic Cd debut with abilities that require her hammer. Big the cat has nothing interesting except for fishing.Then there's Gamma Dr Robotniks newest robot with abilities. When u beat all the character stories unlock the Super Sonic story.Story:  On Angel Island, an island floating above Earth. The Knuckles Tribe's ruler Pachacamac plans for world domination. His daughter Tikal enters a shrine, discovering the Chaos Emeralds and the Master Emerald, a group of mysterious emeralds with unlimited power. She befriends a peaceful entity known as Chaos, the guardian of the emeralds, as well as the Chao. Despite warnings from Tikal, Pachacamac and the tribe run into the shrine. However, Chaos transforms into Perfect Chaos, destroying the island and killing everyone there. Following Chaos' attack, Tikal seals the entity and herself inside the Master Emerald.Three thousand years later, Knuckles the Echidna guards the Master Emerald on the floating Angel Island when the evil scientist Doctor Eggman sets free Chaos. The Master Emerald is shattered and Angel Island plunges into the sea, causing the Master Emerald's shards and the seven Chaos Emeralds to be scattered. Resolving to search for the shards of the Master Emerald, Knuckles sets off. In Station Square, Sonic the Hedgehog sets off and defeats Chaos after witnessing an attack by the police. Miles \"Tails\" Prower tests his Chaos Emerald-powered airplane, only to crash on the beach of Emerald Coast. After Sonic rescues Tails, they go to his workshop in the Mystic Ruins, where they are confronted by Eggman. The mad scientist uses Tails' emerald to transform Chaos and he reveals his ultimate plan: with the power harnessed from the Emeralds, Chaos will eventually become invincible and destroy Station Square and Eggman will build Robotnikland over the city's ruins. Sonic and Tails set off searching for emeralds to prevent Eggman from getting them first, but eventually lose the ones they find to Dr. Eggman and Chaos. Dr. Eggman escapes in his airship, the Egg Carrier, which shoots down Sonic and Tails's pursuing plane.After Eggman activates E-102 Gamma and fights E-101 Beta during his training, Eggman orders the rest of the E-Series robots to search for Froggy, a frog who has eaten Chaos's tail as well as a Chaos Emerald. Gamma finds Froggy but is chased back to the ship by Froggy's owner Big the Cat. After his crash, Tails finds another emerald and uses it to prepare the Tornado II plane to find Sonic while Sonic lands in Station Square once again. While lamenting her time with Sonic, Amy Rose discovers a Flicky bird and names him Birdie. However, Eggman, having discovered Birdie's location, dispatches his robot Zero to chase the Flicky down. After Sonic turns down an offer to protect Birdie, Zero captures Amy and Birdies and detains them both on Eggman's ship, the Egg Carrier. Sonic and Tails board the Tornado II and infiltrates the Egg Carrier. Knuckles also boards the aircraft after collecting pieces of the Master Emerald and seeing an image of the Egg Carrier in the emerald.On board the Egg Carrier, Eggman removes the E-Series robots and stations Gamma in Amy's cell. However, Gamma witnesses Beta being rebuilt, Amy convinces him that Gamma should not work for Eggman, as he is an enemy. In a confusion of newly discovered emotions, Gamma releases Amy and Birdie. While being chased by Zero, Amy goes to the ship's deck. Meanwhile, Sonic and Tails confront Eggman, but Gamma is dispatched to attack Sonic. Despite attacking Sonic with lasers, Sonic defeats Gamma, but Amy interferes and has Sonic spare Gamma. Gamma, understanding that Eggman is an enemy, decides to follow the others. The ship loses altitude and Tails, Amy, and Gamma flee, while Sonic restores the ship to its original form. Sonic is confronted by Chaos, who now has six Chaos Emeralds, and defeats it once more before pursuing Eggman. Meanwhile, Knuckles steals back the six Chaos Emeralds and Big uses the Tornado II; they both flee from the ship as it crashes.Gamma decides to track down his brother robots. After freeing the animals inside the robots, he goes to the Egg Carrier and confronts Beta, in his rebuilt form. Beta uses lasers and missiles to attack Gamma, only to be defeated once more by Gamma. However, the fight also causes Gamma to be destroyed and Birdie's parents are released. Returning to the Egg Carrier, Amy reunites Birdie with its family, but she is confronted by Zero after he knocks down the Flicky. After avoiding contact with Zero's lasers, Amy defeats the robot by using her Piko Piko Hammer and the electrical fences. She sees Birdie and his family off, much to her happiness, and vows to try her best. Sonic and Tails, meanwhile, defeat Eggman in the Egg Viper and Egg Walker, respectively.A day later, Knuckles restores the shards of the Master Emerald, but Angel Island collapses into the sea once again when Chaos attacks him and Dr. Eggman. Chaos absorbs the 6 Chaos Emeralds and locates the seventh aboard the Tornado II, which crashed after Big used it to escape the Egg Carrier. With all the Chaos Emeralds, Chaos transforms into Perfect Chaos, depleting the Chaos Emeralds of their negative energy, and flooding and destroying Station Square. Tikal appears, having taken each main character into the past numerous times beforehand, demanding that Chaos must be sealed back in the Master Emerald. Sonic objects, saying that Chaos's heart would still be filled with anger and sadness if he were to be sealed inside the Master Emerald. Sonic's friends cheer him on, and Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds' still-present positive energy to become Super Sonic and face off against Perfect Chaos. Following Chaos' defeat, Sonic discovers that the Chao he once was guardian of now live in Station Square, so he leaves them on Earth to live there. United with Tikal, Chaos peacefully departs to the past. The game ends with Sonic chasing after the fleeing Dr. Eggman.Music: Sonic Adventure shows new music from crush 40 as well as old music from another Sonic game.In this game we get powerups and upgrades for Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Gamma,& Big the cat.When u played all the story's u unlock final story where chaos has all 7 emeralds and u must defeat him.Controls: This games controls are easy to get use to once u start playing it.Abilities: Sonic has his spindash on a seperate button as well as introducing the light speed dash.

{"product_name":"B002ELCV00","description":"","reviewerName":"J. W. Mullins","summary":"good, but could be better","reviewText":"I've been waiting for this to come out for years now, and since its arrived I can't say I am all that impressed. It is a good solid squad based tactical shooter, but it doesn't really set itself apart. The missions are good but not a single one stands out. The stealth missions thrown in are a good break from the shooting, but have some annoying trial and error moments. The maps in the campaign feel sort of crowded and linear. You just move from one group of enemies to the next. Also your squad's AI is pretty good. So on the easier settings they will often kill everything while you look on.The weapon mods are good but take longer than they should to unlock. While the variety of weapons is neat you have to switch so often that you don't really get attached to any specific one. The story is just terrible and the character development ranges from poor to none at all for most characters. Games overall are much better now, I see no reason why a great shooter shouldn't have a great story to go with it. You may very well skip the little story briefs in this game because you really gain nothing for following them. I also don't really see where the SOCOM title falls into the game. The main character is some sort of 'NATO Ops Commander' and one team is made up of ROK 707 troopers. The second team of two varies, in the US they are SEALs but in other countries they can be SAS or SASR. It seems a break with the 'Navy SEAL' linage of the past games.The custom campaign option does add some interesting variety to the game and makes replay more enjoyable. Since the PS3 network has been down for the last month I've not gotten a chance to try the online game, I will post an update when I can.Overall it is a good solid game, just not great, and certainly didn't live up to the hype around it. I think it would be a good rental for all but the most hardcore SOCOM fans or those planning to log long hours in multiplayer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000O5DS32","description":"Prepare to experience an evolution in the first person shooter. Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"MoultonHawk \"Threadstarter\"","summary":"Deflating HYPE machine","reviewText":"Wow.

{"product_name":"B002I0KOSI","description":"","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Infinitely Amazing","reviewText":"The great thing about the original Bioshock is that it contained a fairly well-defined story that wraps itself up neatly, beginning to end. This was the Achilles heel of Bioshock 2: in order to give us more of the same, it tried to retread familiar ground in a different way.Bioshock Infinite represents a wonderful departure from Rapture: there is that balance of retaining the best elements of the previous games while moving into an all-new setting and world. There are parts of the story that may not make sense--and may even frustrate fans of the previous games--but if you stick with it, the story will start to come together in an amazing way that ties it all together oh-so-neatly.  A lot of the story elements are clever in the way the Doctor Who TV series is:  strange events and the tiniest details end up meaning a lot in a bigger-picture story later on, with many unexpected twists and turns in the plot.  While you can still find audio recordings that fill in the story, you can also view many short 'Kinetoscope' films placed throughout the world.Bioshock Infinite takes place in a fantasy floating city named Columbia. The time is the early 20th Century, around the end of the Industrial Revolution and the rise of the age of the Tycoon. In Columbia, the symbolism of Freemasonry, American history and Christianity have melded together to make American idealism and traditions sacred. The city's founder Zachary Comstock views the world below as fraught with sin, and has poured his hopes and dreams for the future into his daughter Elizabeth, a young woman with a very unusual power to open 'tears' in reality that bleed through to alternate timelines. It is up to you to rescue Elizabeth before Comstock turns her powers to destroying the world below. You play Booker DeWitt, a former Pinkerton detective who got in over his head with the wrong people, and now has retrieve Elizabeth to 'wipe the slate clean.' Where the original Bioshock had Adam (to give you unusual abilities) and Eve (to power those abilities), we rename them 'Tonics' (the powers) and 'Salts' (the fuel for those powers). Enemies can be fairly smart on the hardest difficulties, and if you use your abilities creatively you will find yourself rewarded:  for example, it's very easy to use your Tonics to lay a trap in the floor that the enemy will blunder into.Gameplay for Bioshock Infinite is fairly streamlined: there isn't a 'hacking' component per se. You ask Elizabeth to help you unlock doors and safes and you collect keys to help her. You 'hack' vending machines using a power instead of playing a puzzle or quicktime game like the previous Bioshock titles. Powers and weapons are easy to upgrade, but you can't have everything so you are forced to make choices about what to improve and what to leave behind.  Weapon upgrades are no longer hard-to-find:  there are vending machines on every level that let you buy upgrades.What makes Bioshock Infinite amazing is not just the uniqueness of the vision or the well fleshed-out spectacle of the city: it is the story. You come to Columbia in the midst of a power struggle: the Founders are the wealthy conservatives who believe in racial purity, while the Vox Populi are sick of being at the bottom of society's barrel. There are racist and supremacist elements throughout the city, and yet the tension between these two factions mirrors the Occupy Movement and other events of modern day. It takes about 10-15 hours to get through the main story, but it is enjoyable enough for replay. I found myself wanting to try different combinations of abilities and re-do key battles in different ways.One of the best things about Bioshock Infinite's gameplay is that Elizabeth isn't in so much danger that you have to worry about protecting her.  When a fight breaks out, she takes cover.  She's also more like a 'bot co-op partner:  when you're low on ammo, health or salts, she'll try to toss things to you to keep you alive.  Idle moments typically have her rummaging around looking for loot for you, and she'll randomly flip money your way if you need cash.  It makes for a great 'partner' dynamic.If you're a fan of the series, accept that this isn't Rapture any more and you should enjoy the fact that we still have a strong story, interesting characters, and a fascinating world that is very replayable. If you're new to the series, Bioshock Infinite is a valiant entry that stands strong on its own. I've deliberately left a few details out of this review for you to discover and enjoy, and I certainly hope you do.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00002CF9M","description":"InDiablo II, players return to a world of dark fantasy. As one of five distinct character types, players explore the world ofDiablo II, journey across distant lands, fight new villains, discover new treasures, and uncover ancient mysteries. Since the beginning of time, the forces of order and chaos have been engaged in an eternal struggle to decide the fate of all creation. That struggle has now come to the mortal realm, and neither man, demon, nor angel will be left unscathed. Diablo, lord of terror and youngest of the three prime evils, awakes from his long sleep beneath the dark earth. Setting in motion a grand scheme to free his exiled brothers, Mephisto and Baal, Diablo takes control of the small western kingdom of Khanduras. Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo grips the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia. Ultimately, as even Khanduras's good King Leoric falls under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arises to challenge the darkness that engulfs the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronts the lord of terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit can never be truly destroyed, the hero makes the noblest sacrifice of all--casting his soul and his very sanity aside, he takes the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will can contain the demon within.

{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"T. Paslay","summary":"The Next Great MMO","reviewText":"Before getting into the review, I feel it necessary to outline my MMO experience. Not to brag or pat myself on the back, but so you know what experiences I have had and determine to what degree you can relate to the content found in this review. It will also give you an idea of where I'm drawing my comparisons from. Also, I have only played up to level 14, and completed the starting area 100% but generally you know whether you're going to stick with an MMO at that point.I have played Final Fantasy XI up to the Wings of the Goddess expansion, Final Fantasy XIV for approximately 2 months when it launched, World of Warcraft off an on from Beta until Cataclysm, Hellgate: London, Warhammer for about 3 months after launch. Warcraft was clearly my longest stint and because it's been the most successful MMO (in terms of playerbase and revenue generated) most of the comparison will be drawn from my experiences with it.Guild Wars 2 starts off much like your typical MMO. You are presented with 4 races each with male and female counterparts to choose from. Each race has its own backstory. You are then taken to the customization screen. There are loads of options here and you will most likely see a variety of faces and heights during your travels. Next you will select one of 8 classes from your typical magic/melee/tank archetypes. Finally you will be asked several questions which will affect your character's temperament (not sure how that all works out in the end). Once you have created the character you will be presented with a beautifully illustrated narrative of what your race's motivations are, why they are where they are and what is happening in their world right now. The common theme seems to be that some greater force kicked them out of their home and they're trying to scratch out a living in their new location working towards eventually taking back their home.You begin your game in what could be called the hub of the starting area. Trainers and vendors and the auction house are located here as well as your first waypoint. The help function points you to the first quest giver and you start your journey. Quests are handled a bit different in GW2 and I would definitely say it's for the better. In my experience most early quests in mmos are something like, \"Hey you! Armor-clad adventurer! Go pick me five apples!\" and then a little 0/5 pops up in your tracker and you run off to collect five apples. In GW2 a quest giver will give you a quick monologue about their motivation and why they're there doing what they're doing. They will then give you several objectives, for example pick apples because wolves scared away all my workers, kill wolves you see, aid any workers that have been attacked by wolves. A completion bar will then appear in your quest tracker. Every time you pick an apple the bar will increase, every time you kill a wolf the bar will increase and every time you help a worker it will increase until it's full and the quest is completed. There are some advantages to this. Maybe I'm a caster so my armor and hp are pretty low, the wolves are giving me trouble and I'm getting frustrated. Ok, ignore the wolves and pick apples and help people and you will still complete the quest. Or if you don't want to gather or help people, just kill wolves until your bar is filled. You can do all the objectives as the opportunity presents itself or you can do one or two. This is also nice because if you have multiple people doing the same quest the multiple objectives make it less likely that people are getting to the objectives before you. Also, when you finish a quest, the quest giver will just mail your reward to you so you can keep on going without running back to turn in. Mail is present in your HUD and you can send/receive mail anytime/anywhere.Other quests include events. World events aren't necessarily something new in mmos. For those unfamiliar world events are un-instanced happenings (generally battling an army of enemies or one super powerful enemy) that anyone can participate in. World events are all over the place constantly in GW2. Whether they consist of escort missions, defending structures against raids, following NPCs as they raid an enemy structure or battling large and powerful creatures, it's all here. It's fun, it breaks up the monotony of questing and you get experience and loot based on participation. If you started from the beginning and stayed until completion, you'll probably get a gold medal for participation and perhaps a loot chest (it pops up in your HUD and you just click on it, no hunting for a chest or worrying about ninjas.). If you came in on the tail end you'll still get a bronze and some exp. Loot drops off mobs for everyone as well, so even in normal situations there's no worry about someone swooping in and taking your rewards. The great thing about the multitude and nature of these events is that it makes the world seem alive. Things are always happening and your help is always needed. It's not a stagnant world where Dragons sit in their lair and brood while everything outside is business as usual and NPCs just stand around waiting to dole out quests. Although, there is some of that too.Travel, so far, is simple. I'm not sure if mounts will be available down the road, but I haven't seen anyone riding one or heard anything about their inclusion. The countryside is littered with waypoints that you unlock when you find them. When standing under one, open your map and select one you've already visited. For a fee you will be transported instantly. It's very similar to the gryphon system in WoW only faster and there are more locations. There are also abilities and items that increase run speed.Crafting is something I've only scratched the surface of. You can gather all materials at any level. You don't need to select mining or herbalism, you will need to buy consumable implements (picks, scythes, axes) and when you approach a node (they're constantly displayed on your map) you can harvest/mine. Each node is available for all players so you don't have to worry about clearing a cave full of beasts to get to a copper vein only to have some jerk run in as you fight the last mob and mine it dry. Even if someone does run in and mine it until it's empty for them, it will be full for you when you finish. You may select two professions, armorcrafting, weaponcrafting, leathercrafting, tailoring, cooking and artificing are all the professions (I think) and basically what you'd expect from a mmo. You pay to train and then as you increase in skill more recipes will be made available. There's a way to learn new recipes by experimenting and combining multiple materials as well. A welcome improvement to the typical crafting system is the collections mechanic. Collections are like a bank for your crafting mats and there's even an option in your bag to send all materials to your collection that will automatically transfer every crafting mat in your bag to your collection which has a slot for type of material. It's great for saving space!Like most mmos there's a level system. You get experience from gathering materials, crafting materials, killing mosters, completing quests and discovering places. When your experience bar fills, you gain a level. When you gain a level you obtain a skill point and a trait point. Skill points are spent on skills. For those of you familiar with WoW, GW2 has a variation of a talent tree. Each tier has a pool of about 10-15 skills/abilities. You must unlock five of them by spending skill points in order to unlock the next tier of skills. It's an interesting system and does allow for some customization. I do have a couple issues with it though. Sometimes I just don't like or see a use for all the skills so I'm blowing points to get to the next tier. Maybe it's balancing, maybe I don't understand the utility of my class, I dunno. Secondly, you only have a certain number of ability slots available to you. The first 5 number keys are reserved for weapon based attacks and cannot be customized aside from switching weapons (more on that later). The 6 key is reserved for your healing ability, there are 3 different healing abilities you can slot in there, the first one you start out with, the others are purchased with skill points but don't go towards your 5/5 skill requirement needed to unlock the next tier of skills. 7 through 0 are reserved for your skills and you can change them whenever you like as long as they're not on cooldown. However, you have to unlock them first. So until level 10, you only have one skill to use. At ten the second unlocks, now you have two. The problem is, I'm level 14, I have something like 7 skills unlocked, but can only select 2 to use. It's an interesting mechanic and definitely makes things challenging. It's nice not to have a double border of skills cluttering up my UI but at times it's irritating. I'm a necromancer, I would like to have my pets out, but if I use two skill slots for my two pets, I'm locking out my spells and must rely on my weapon abilities alone. Again, it's still early in the game and may not be an issue once I get used to it.One of the best mechanics of the game is the level normalization. Each area has a level cap. So say you're a level 40 and your friend has a level 10. You want to play with him but you don't want to make a new character and you'd like to continue working on leveling your 40. Just roll on over to their area and automatically your level is going to be adjusted to the level cap of that area. It will show your current level and then a little green arrow will point to a green number depicting your capped level. This means that you can play with your lower level friend without destroying everything or screwing up their exp gains. The great thing is that you're still earning full exp based on what you would've earned at that level from whatever gave you exp so you're not completely wasting your time either.Traits are essentially class tweaks. You must purchase the training to unlock the ability to spend your trait points. Trait points generally modify your existing abilities and stats. And there's a trait line for each aspect of your class. So, for instance, I want to focus on spell damage as a necromancer. I decide to spend points in the death magic line. I spend five trait points to unlock the first node and receive a new trait that every time I kill an enemy a bone minion will be summoned. Also, my armor is increased by 50 and my power is increased 50%. So you get a new perk and a stat boost based on which line you choose. Again, it's a nice bit of customization that ensures not all necromancers (or whatever class you choose) are created equal, and each person can tailor the class to their play style. If you don't like your choice, you can pay to retrain which will wipe your traits and start over. At current max level you will be able to fully complete 2 of the five trait lines and have 10 points to put in additional lines. Each line requires 30 points to complete.Weapons are the last bit of character customization. Each class can only use certain weapons. For instance, as a necromancer, I can use staves, daggers, axes, scepters, focus items, war horns and I believe that's it. Single handed weapons can be dual-wielded. Some weapons can only be held in the off-hand, some require two hands. Each weapon has a set of traits depending on what hand you hold it in. Single handed weapons that can be held in the main hand will have 3 abilities that will occupy the first 3 numbers on your keyboard. Off-hand weapons have two which will be your 4 and 5 key. Weapons that can be held in either will have different abilities for all five keys that are available based on which hand your holding them. Abilities are based on weapon type, not the specific weapon so a rusted dagger and a divine dagger of swift judgment will have the same weapon abilities. To access these abilities you must use the weapon. When you first pick up a dagger, you can just stab enemies with it. As you stab more enemies the rest of the abilities for that hand will unlock much like an exp bar. It's pretty quick to unlock them and I think I had all abilities for every weapon I could use unlocked at level 8 or so. The nice thing about this is that you can decide how you want to play and which abilities you find most effective and equip yourself accordingly. Personally I like the damage output of dual-wielding daggers, but it may require being too up close and personal for others. In which case, a staff may be their weapon of choice. It's really a great system and I think it's one of the more ingenious improvements over the traditional MMO model. You have underwater weapons as well that follow the same principle. Options for weapon attacks may change or unlock down the road, but again, level 14, so I haven't seen anything that indicates that.The auction house is pretty standard. However there is an option to purchase gem currency with real world money. This currency can be used to purchase in game items, either consumables (like speed boosts) that have temporary affects or vanity items like pets or clothing items to wear in town. One of my favorite items available are these sets of vanity armor that you can apply (one time per purchase) to your actual armor to change the appearance. There's really only one set for each armor type which could obviously result in everyone looking the same, but hopefully they'll expand it in the future. Either way they're pretty cool looking and could add some much desired flair to your gear if you're bored with it. I forget the exact pricing on the gem currency and items you can buy with it but I remember feeling that it was reasonable. Like vanity pets ending up being a couple bucks or so. Another way to look at it is that GW2 is free to play. Most mmos (particularly of this caliber) are fifteen bucks. Use the fifteen bucks you're saving to purchase gem currency and actually get something in return for your monthly fee.Lastly, graphics and sound. Unfortunately I'm only running on an Intel HD chipset so my video settings are close to the bottom. However, even at those settings it's a pretty game. Models and animations are well done. Textures are detailed. I've cranked the settings while stationary just to see what it would look like and it's beautiful. Lighting and reflections are great. Models and textures are very detailed. It's extremely impressive graphically and easily on par with Final Fantasy XIV. Sound is very good, characters say phrases and make noises, background music is very ambient.In conclusion, if you're looking for a fresh mmo that still has the same foundation that you've come to be familiar with, GW2 is it. You'll find enough familiar here to be comfortable and easily transition from your previous mmo, while presented with enough new mechanics to give you something to learn, think about and strategize. They've made a lot of improvements over previous titles in the genre and you'll find yourself thinking \"Wow, that's great! Why didn't anyone else think of this?\" The lack of monthly fee makes this a no-brainer. At standard price for a PC game you get the full mmo package. Yes micro-transactions are present but not at all required and don't seem to do anything to give you an extra advantage other than looking cooler. All in all, as long as NC Soft keeps it going, I think GW2 will be around for a while.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00004TSXC","reviewerName":"Peter","summary":"An ambitious experiment in PC gaming but a failure","reviewText":"Neverwinter Nights is really not a computer game in the traditional sense.  It's more of an electronic version of the pen and paper role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons.  If you are an avid D&D; player who can't get your group together at your own house, you now have the internet to do it.  While this is fine for pen and paper D&D; groupies, the rest of us are left out in the cold.Basically, Neverwinter Nights is set up in the hopes that a community will help it grow.  The game comes with a sample campaign to play but it also comes with a complete editor that lets anyone design their own D&D; adventures.  Either with the official campaign included in box or some of the community made mods (there are already 500+ available online), you can play Neverwinter Nights by yourself or online with a group of players.  To further enhance the pen and paper D&D; experience, there is even a dungeon master client in the game.  If you don't know what a dungeon master is I can already tell you you're purchasing the wrong game.  Basically, a DM watches over the mod and controls the adventure to hopefully provide a better game for the players.  Sort of like an invisible referee.This all sounds great when reading it on the back of the box but I'm not sure it really works.  For one thing, while the editor has a lot of capabilities, every map has that same square-look to it to fit in the D&D; grid system.  Nothing looks natural and after playing a few mods you've seen everything the game has to offer and it all starts to repeat itself.  Also, for a game that relies on the community to invent new adventures, the editor is more difficult than it should be.  If you don't know programming basics, you're going to have a difficult time with the editor as every simple action has to be scripted which is basically simple C+ programming.  To accomodate this new system and catch up with its competitors, Neverwinter Nights also has a new 3-D system that reminds me of hack and slash games like Diablo more than the company's previous classic release Baldur's Gate I and II.  In fact, the official campaign included in the game is NOTHING compared to the Baldur's Gate games and I would recommend that you not buy this game if the official campaign is the only thing you will play.  The included campaign is boring, linear and not that creative, it's more of a sample for the editor rather than an epic adventure.If you plan on only playing online, be careful if you only have a 56K modem.  You'll never be able to host more than 3 players on your computer without lag.  Also, you'll have a difficult time joining the large servers with 20+ players if your connection is slow.  Neverwinter Nights comes with an ingame browser that divides online games by category.  You can join the action channel, the roleplaying channel, etc.  Most of these games are called persistent worlds and are basically smaller versions of Everquest. While they can be for awhile because of their small size and limited equipment, quests, etc., they never provide much fun.  The best way to play the game is to get together with a group of friends and meet on a weekly basis just like you would the pen and paper D&D.;  While you can find people to play with through online fan sites, you'll have a much better time with this game if you already know people that own it and are willing to play the same mod with you at scheduled times.After trying this game for a month, frankly, I feel cheated.  I bought the game because it promised gamers that even if they didn't want to play online or use the editor they could play the official campaign included in the game by themselves and have just as much fun as they did with the company's other epic releases Baldur's Gate I and II.  That's a misleading claim because the new mechanics of Neverwinter Nights and the boring campaign included are pitiful attempts to live up to the company's previous PC D&D; games.  This game is really only for people that want to enjoy an electronic pen and paper version of D&D;, the rest of us should move on to Icewind Dale II or Morrowind or hope that another company manages to design a great singleplayer RPG as fantastic as the Baldur's Gate series.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2002"}

Turtle Beach is generally known as the cream of the crop, and as long as you get a fairly priced set without branding, they always get a well deserved 5 star rating.  Worth pointing out that an adapter is required to use these on the Xbox One, but the adapter is included in the box.  I only mention it because its one more piece of the puzzle that you need to not lose or break.  It's unfortunate Microsoft couldn't build a decent controller that negated the need for an adapter.

{"product_name":"B00006LEM9","description":"For even the mildest fans, anything related to this beloved book deserves top-notch treatment. Vivendi's officially authorizedThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringfalls disappointingly short of that goal. The game is intriguing enough (credit the source material) to play through entirely--once. For the cost of the game, you are guaranteed a reasonably pleasurable 10 hours of gameplay. After that, it will likely sit on your shelf.There are good things in this game: the RPG mechanics are fine (at various points in the story you play as Frodo, Aragorn, and Gandalf), the visuals are beautiful in parts, and certain aspects of game design are fantastic (Gandalf's magic-casting stands out). Little touches make it appealing to true fans, like when Aragorn receives the repaired Sword of Elendil, and it glows during fighting. It would be a great game for even non-LOTRfans to play, since a good deal of backstory is provided in lengthy cinematics throughout the game.Fellowship's greatest asset, of course, is the story itself, as well as the bevy of villainous creatures that provide great boss-fight material. I'm sure many other gameswishedthey had a Balrog to offer.But the story deviates strangely from the book in order to satisfy the format of an RPG game. The final boss-fight (which we won't spoil here) is completely unrelated to anything devised by J.R.R. Tolkien, and it seems hollow, strange, and unsatisfying. The puzzles sprinkled throughout the game are random and often frustrating, as is your first encounter with the Ringwraiths (inevitably, you die many times--too steep a difficulty curve right out of the gate). This game is still strongly recommended, but with many caveats. Proceed with caution and you're likely to enjoy yourself. Expect a masterpiece and you'll be wishing you saved your money for a different PS2 title.--Jennifer BuckendorffPros:Great story and great characters (of course)Missions that require problem-solving as well as combatGorgeous mapsGetting to play as GandalfCons:Painfully long cutaway scenesCheesy endingOften-tedious fights","reviewerName":"Daniel Garcia Montes","summary":"The Quest for the Ring Begins","reviewText":"If you've only seen the movie and have never read the novel, then you should buy or at least rent this game. It's a good summary of the story and includes a lot of things that weren't in the movie. Here's a spoiler on one of those different things: Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippen didn't actually go straight from Buckleberry Ferry to Bree on their journey; they went to the Old Forest and met Tom Bombadill(the eldest being) and his wife Goldberry=they were also attacked by a living tree, Old Man Willow. They even faced off against a dead Barrow-Wite in a creepy place called the Barrow-Downs.As for the characters you get to play as Frodo Baggins, Aragorn, and yes, even Gandalf the Grey. Gandalf is definitely the best character in whole game; he's good with his sword and has a good arsenal of magic spells. This game's graphics are rather good (although it looks like it was originally made as a computer game). The fighting system kind of [smells] though, compared to the one in \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\", but otherwise it's a rather solid and strangely addicting game. The best thing about it though is the save system; when you save a game, you restart the game at the EXACT same place where you left off and you can save whenever you want.I give this game 3.5 stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2003"}

There are better looking 360 games out there.Sound: 7.5/10. The cars and crashes sound good, but the music is pretty annoying and there is nothing above average about any of the sound in Full Auto.Control: 7.5/10. It's kind of hard to control this game, especially on 1 player. You have to concentrate on when to get ready to emergency brake into a turn, aim your weapons, shoot your weapons, when to use your turbo, where there are mines on the road, and more. After awhile, you'll get used to it, though.Fun: 7.5/10. Overall, Full Auto could be better. It's career mode leaves something to be desired; it's extremely short. It will take you no more than 8 hours to beat the game, and it really is for the most part to get gold medals. This game is for people of any age to beat; it's that easy. You'll have all the cars ( except one ) after playing 40% through career mode. Multiplayer is fun, but there is no \"rewind\" mode, so it seems like a different game.

{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A wonderful game, and this is coming from someone who didn't care for Metal Gear","reviewText":"The Good: Amazing audio/visual experience, well crafted story, plenty of weapons, fully fledged multiplayer, tons of elements to keep you busyThe Bad: Disappointing bosses, not many people are playing online, cut scenes are dragged out way too long, why all the installing?Metal Gear Solid is one of the most memorable game series ever created and MGS4 is a great topping on the cake. Not only does MGS4 offer an incredibly riveting story, but also some great multiplayer as well as hidden stuff for long time MGS fans irking all the way back to the original game.Starting out with MGS4 is kind of daunting due to the deep storyline that is hard to follow unless you have played the other three games, but you can manage if you are smart enough and stick with the story. The only problem I had with the story are the drawn out cut scenes that can last over 30 minutes thanks to Hideo Kojima's love for cinematic storytelling. Most of the length comes at the end of every chapter, the mission briefing, then the beginning of the next chapter. Each chapter took over 30 minutes to start, and sometimes the dialog can drag on and become sleep inducing.Metal Gear has always been known for its stealth game play and MGS4 is the first Metal Gear game to give you complete control of the camera and even implementing a first person mode. The greatest improvement (for me) was the fact that sneaking through compounds, camps, and war frontlines didn't feel like a puzzle anymore, but like a stealth game. The amount of stuff in your HUD may be overwhelming at first, but you will adjust. You have a health meter, psyche meter (that I never found any reason to keep track of), item and weapon menu, camouflage gauge, and a radar screen. You can also buy weapons and ammo from Drebin's Shop using Drebin points that are accumulated by picking up weapons on the battlefield. You can also customize weapons now with silencers, grenade launchers, shotguns, flashlights and more. There are dozens of weapons to buy and each come in handy for certain situations.Using your camouflage is one of my favorite elements because whenever you lie still your suit copies the texture on the ground and lets your blend in better. Throughout the game you will acquire more types of camouflage, but the suit is great. You can even change the color of your vest and face. Another element that I love is the change of pace in the game. No longer are you confined to stealth only elements since there will be full-out fire fights through some levels, vehicle sections, and even a section where you use a mech. That doesn't sound like Metal Gear to you? Welcome to evolution.The game just feels fluid, smooth, and transitions well and has a perfect play time of about 15-20 hours. You can also partly interact with the cinematic by zooming in, and at key points pressing L1 for a first person view and pressing X or flashbacks of previous games. I do have to say my biggest disappointment were the boss fights since they aren't as original as in previous games. Most just have you shooting enemies to death and using a key element to figure out how to actually kill them.There are a multitude of CQC moves for you to use against enemies or just a good silenced shot to the head works too. Hiding bodies isn't such a big deal anymore since you are in a war and crawling through dead bodies will be like tomorrow's chores after a while. Using camouflage to blend is just probably the key element to the sneaking in this game since using shadows and lying still is key.When it comes to multiplayer you are in for a treat because Metal Gear Online is a fully integrated online system that is separate from the game. You have several different game types (all the ones you can expect) all while using Drebin points to use guns during matches, and using your experience points to level up and buy stuff for your character through the Konami website. There are several expansions available, but Metal Gear just never felt like an online thing for me. It is fun, but trying to find a room with 16 people is kind of rare especially at lower levels. The online element of Metal Gear is strangely deep for a game that doesn't get much online traffic since Metal Gear feel strictly like a single player only experience, but it's there for people who want it.If Metal Gear turned you off before you should give it another shot because it truly mixes stealth and action beautifully and even someone who doesn't care too much for Metal Gear (me) can love this game. The game looks amazing and all the characters look life-like and are rendered beautifully. The voice acting is top-notch, and nothing can type the fight scenes.

{"product_name":"B0050SW8OS","description":"","reviewerName":"Fred","summary":"Mind Blowing","reviewText":"I'm about to chapter 7? just got it last night... the best hand held game on earth. It holds up to the canon Uncharted games and i've beaten all the first 3 on crushing. So far this is a lot less shooting which i love. The aiming is a bit flailing with the tinier sticks but you can use the motion sensing aiming to make up for that although I wish you could make the motion sensing aim track faster by at least another 25% or more. The graphics are insanely great, the gun sounds are more realistic than the PS3 games. This game has it all graphically, amazing lighting, shadows, water effects etc, it's just nuts... I've taken tons of screen captures just to gawk at the graphics it's that impressive for a hand held.I've yet to beat the game but I rank it Uncharted 3.1 in wait for Uncharted 4. I bought it off PSN but I will get the card copy when it's down to $20 or so.EDIT: just beat it on normal, credits playing... yes indeed WOW. Probably the greatest hand held action adventure game ever created. There was no big \"creature\" reveal moment but that only made this game feel more grounded in reality story wise... so many puzzles to solve so I'll be playing this over and over again. The level design is amazing, the details are so rich and beautiful I took probably one hundred screen captures lol. I hope BEND makes another portable Uncharted and improves upon what they achieved with this amazing game. I'd like improved motion aiming, needs to track faster and further via settings. WORTH EVERY PENNY FOR THE VITA AND THIS GREAT GAME.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"Whipple McTeelson the Third \"Purveryor of Mad...","summary":"The One True Game in a Sea of Countless Pretenders.","reviewText":"Before I could review this game I had to do two things first.  One was to finish the game.  The second was far more difficult and that was too look within my very self to see if I am even worthy to review this grand dame of video games.  I've spent a lifetime dreaming of a game that could do exactly what GTAV does.  And trust me I still came up short.  What I imagined this game to do is only a fifth of what is actually slapped onto the wonderful blu ray disc those saints at Rockstar coded onto it.  This isn't just the culmination and the ongoing continuation of what they've done before in all the previous GTA games.  This is the pinnacle of video games and mass culture itself.Though I fall short as a human to truly begin to grasp it's beauty and rock deep significance I'm going to blindly flail away at my keyboard to at least try.Unlike the haters and those haughty fools that are disappointed or disgusted with this game I'm telling you this is it.  And why?  It's the city.  It's the characters.  It's the missions.  It's the cars.  It's the people on the street.  It's the side quests.  It's the parachuting.  It's the cult.  It's the recreation of No Country for Old Men I stumbled upon.  It's the bikers.  It's the tow truck.  It's the hookers and strippers-those lovely lovely gals.  It's the psychiatrist.  It's the yoga.  It's the selfies.  It's the ramps.  It's the gun range.  It's the radio stations.  It's the illicit substances.  It's a million other things I can barely remember and never forget.But it's none of that either.  Because it's all Trevor.  You are Trevor and Trevor is you.  Yep, I'm pretty much hammering the point on what every other player knows.  The point is obvious.  The point has to be made though.  It's the central point to everything that is GTAV.  It's all Trevor.  Michael and Franklin are fascinating.  When I completed the game I looked at the stats and turns out I played each character for a near equal 22 hours each.  Michael and Franklin drew me into the game but Trevor drew me into his sick black tremorous heart.  Playing as Trevor is holding up to two mirrors facing each other.  Trevor is infinite Regression.As for the missions I welcome the inclusion of the multi-stage heists.  Just fascinating.  And then getting hosed time after time and not getting any money after the missions was pure genius.  That brought up an emotion in me on a whole different level than any other game has ever achieved.  Linger on that thought a few times if you will.  The mad maniacs at Rockstar made every last one of us sweat out the details of these complex heists only for us to not get any payoff.  Nil.  Nada.  And each and every time the in-story reason for it was completely logical to the situation and the characters.  This was not cheap heat ala WCW Monday Nitro style.  This drove up my rage that I channeled through to Trevor.  And Trevor reciprocated in kind.  He wasn't taking it either at a certain point and that's when my love for Trevor turned into him becoming my soul mate.  Even Gladdos didn't elicit such deep connection within me.And yes I played the game for about 66 hours before I got around to finishing it.  When I have a good book I don't rush to the end.  I don't binge watch Netflix shows either.  I want to live within the confines of the created universe with the characters.  Instant gratification is for fools.  Rockstar spent over 4 years making this game.  Who am I to complete over a weekend marathon session.  If you did then good for you; you slapped a thousand developers and creators in the face.  Bully for you.For more honesty I didn't replay a single mission either during them 66 hours.  Nor after as I've wandered through Los Santos mopping up a few story details.  That was 66+hours and counting of original game time.  I'll replay the missions only when I completely replay the game.  I don't spit my wine back in the bottle after I swirl it in my mouth.  I swig it nice and slow and pull out a whole new bottle of the same for some more.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0000A2MCN","description":"Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academyis a dynamic single and multiplayer action experience featuring an all-new epic story. Players are immersed in the role of apprentice at Luke Skywalker's Jedi Academy where they learn the power - and danger - of the Force. Amidst a multitude of complex and richly detailed Star Wars environments, including twice as many unique locales as those inStar Wars: Jedi Outcast, players face a variety of powerful and insidious enemies.For the first time in a Jedi Knight series game,Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academyallows players to create and customize their own characters by choosing various characteristics including species, gender, clothing, and physical attributes such as hair and facial features. In addition, players can create a custom lightsaber, selecting from hilt design and blade color. As apprentices progress in their training, different lightsabers will become available, such as the double-bladed lightsaber or dual lightsabers.Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academybegins shortly after the conclusion of events inStar Wars: Jedi Outcast. Players create a Jedi apprentice character and join the Jedi Academy on Yavin 4 to learn the ways of the Force under the tutelage of Luke Skywalker and Kyle Katarn. While the young apprentice embarks on various missions to hone their skills and abilities, a mysterious group is discovered creating havoc throughout the galaxy. Until order is restored, the fate of the Jedi Academy - and the future of the Star Wars galaxy itself - hangs precariously in the balance.While players are able to accomplish more by using the lightsaber inStar Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, they also will have a variety of weapons - new and old - at their disposal including a blaster, blaster rifle, Wookiee bowcaster, Imperial repeater, and a Destructive Electro-Magnetic Pulse gun. A unique level selection system allows players to choose their own path through the game as well as the missions they undertake to improve their Jedi skills. The game adds new multiplayer modes and bring back the most popular modes fromStar Wars: Jedi Outcast.","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"If You Enjoyed Jedi Outcast, You'll Enjoy Jedi Academy","reviewText":"Not everyone liked Jedi Outcast.  For instance, I've heard many complaints about the lightsaber mechanics.  I however loved Jedi Outcast and found Jedi Academy to be more of the same saber swinging fun.  I admit, I'm a Star Wars fan, so maybe the ability to force push people to their death while the classic John Williams Star Wars music plays in the background is too much gaming bliss for me to resist but I still think this game would be fun for people not in love with the Star Wars universe.  I'm sure it helps though to at least have watched the original trilogy.  For those that played the first game, there are two significant changes.  One is that your Jedi can now wield dual lightsabers (i.e. Anakin Skywalker vs. Count Dooku in Episode II) or a double-bladed lightsaber (i.e. Darth Maul in Episode I).  The second largest difference is that you can now pick your missions instead of following a linear story driven path like Jedi Outcast did.  There is still a terrific story in Jedi Academy and every so often you're forced to go on a specific mission to move the story but you're allowed a little more freedom than the other game.  Perhaps my only complaint about this game would be a weak online community.  Only time will tell if gamers will design their own modifications for the sequel but compared to other popular first-person shooters, there aren't many servers available for online play and most of them don't allow you to use your force powers.  If you've ever desired to wield a lightsaber, this is the game for you!  It's a fun title that breathes fresh life into the first-person shooter genre.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00020V4N0","reviewerName":"Cg Customs","summary":"5/5!!","reviewText":"The biggest game developer around is back with it's NFL reprise of Madden 2005. It boasts gobs of new features to warrant a buy and most importantly for XBOX owners, this game is XBOX Live compatible. But let's hold that thought, E.A. recently released NCAA 2005 and I still stand by my thoughts on that game, it's still in beta stages an was not released, will Madden suffer the same fate? Read on.If you don't know already and if you own the game, you know NCAA has some technical issues and there certainly was a concern that Madden might suffer the same. Most noteworthy is the \"slowdown\" during gameplay and bugs that occur on XBOX Live; disconnects, getting charged for losses, slow gameplay and a gob of frustration for XBOX owners. Well, now we come to Madden. Three weeks to iron things out is an eternity for E.A. because it seems like things are ironed out and I'm happy to say Madden plays much better in terms of overall bugginess, it's a finished product.The big feature this year of course is the \"XBOX Live\" addition along with PS2's online capability. Both run magnificently and I only noticed a couple of times where I would get disconnected. Even better the game plays very smooth overall and does not suffer any problems that NCAA had or still has. Madden includes some nice new features, nothing massive, but keeps the game from getting stale next to 2004, and now being online, that alone is a good enough upgrade for me anyway.Gameplay: Madden is Madden and the feel of Madden has not really changed year after year. But what E.A. does year after year is tweak the already great feel of the series. Considering the big picture, the gameplay is basically identical from last year with the exception of a few additions.. The same standard button layout is here for both offense and defense, jukes, spins, dives, stiff arms, celebrations etc. They did do away with the \"hurdle\" button this year which was executed with the \"triangle (Ps2) and \"Y\" button on XBOX. Instead, this button is basically the \"put your head down\" and get extra yards button. It's somewhat reminiscent of the \"shoulder charge\" button on ESPN's game which is good for punishing the defense when you need that extra yard. On E.A's game it's more for protecting the ball from a fumble, so press this button down when you're getting swarmed by multiple tacklers to prevent a turnover..The big hit button is the nicest new addition on defense. It really is fun to use and can take a toll on the offense if used frequently and successfully enough. It's causes the offense to incur more turnovers, especially after a big catch or handoff. Time it right a millisecond before the receiver catches the ball then slam him with the big hit button and watch the ball pop out. It takes timing, but perfect it and you'll be hard to stop on the defensive side. Speaking of defense, the A.I. is much better at reacting to a high power offense in 2005. As in 2004, Game players who rely solely on the pass will have fits of rage when the defense intercepts the quarterback on a frequent basis after figuring out your play-calling methods. The challenge, especially when you beef up the difficulty, will challenge the hardest-hitting game players out there. The control scheme is identical to last year with some minor differentials in the line audibles and play calling screen. You'll still experience the same cool juke moves, stiff-arms, spins and sprint are all back and the tighter feel is more apparent then ever. Offense still has the advantage this year, but I noticed a lot more intelligent blitzing, better play selection and a much improved computer assistance when playing on defense. Linebackers seem to react better, both in knocking down an reacting to a pass, they always seem to be there waiting for the big hit. 2004 gave up to many big plays, I didn't notice big plays nearly as much, at least not yet. Defending against the pass is a breeze if your defensive corner back is in the right place at the right time. Knocking down passes also seems much easier, with the press of the \"triangle\" button and with good timing on your part, defending the pass can become a breeze if you know a thing or too about calling plays. You can still call the hot routes on the fly and can change your star receivers formation (Playmaker) with a click of the right control stick.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2005"}

That is the game: You. Whatever you decide or think up is what you're going to play. Impatient? You're not going to have a fun time. Don't like thinking? Look elsewhere. LBP is a game all about using the tools in the game to create your own world and idea of a fun game. LBP2 expands this by gearing the tools towards genres of games rather than just platforming. While the tool section may turn most players away, don't fret! Enjoy the thousands of well made levels from other players to keep you busy. I am not a sandbox build-it-yourself type of person, so I didn't spend much time in the editor. Open your mind and enjoy the delightful paper craft world!The story mode consists of 4 very fun worlds to play in to wet your appetite for the world and how everything works. The story is really weird and doesn't make much sense. Your only goal is to destroy the Negativitron from destroying Craftworld and you have to rescue a few people in the process. With the weird story aside, the levels are really fun and show you all the different genres of gaming you play in this game. Races, 2D shooters, platforming, fighters, and many others. Each level is completely different, but plays similarly to the last game. You have to get through each section to the next checkpoint where you can respawn if you die. The main point of the story is to find new stickers and materials for the level editor. These appear as bubbles in the game, some are easy to get, and some require a bit of puzzle solving.LBP2 is really co-op heavy and I found myself finding people to play with online or having friends join me. The game is a blast in co-op and probably the best way to play. I loved the entire story mode because it was just so much fun. Plain and simple. One level had me using different weapons like a sprinkler helmet to put out fires on platforms and grow vines into platforms. Another level used a cupcake launcher which acted as a remote mine. A later level used a few different animals as vehicles such as a bunny, hamster, and a bee was used as a schmup vehicle. It was all fun, colorful, and filled with imagination. The paper craft art style makes you feel like a kid again playing to paper and toys. LBP2 is just one of the most imaginative games you can get your hands on these days.The controls are solid, but feel a bit floaty and slide-y which is okay after you get used to it. One of my favorite features is the Pop-It which is a simplified menu you can bring up to place stickers in the world and customize your Sack Thing. If I were to really complain about the story mode it would be that some sections are ridiculously difficult and required several restarts, but nothing you won't get past. Once you beat the story mode you can either play user made levels or make your own. I won't go into the level editor because it would take 10 paragraphs just to explain, and even then you would be confused. It is more simplified than the first game, but there is more to it so it feels more complicated. I honestly could not build a single decent level so I moved on to user made levels.There are thousands of levels that are organized into categories. Ones that Media Molecule picked (which I recommend playing first) as well as levels sorted by rating. Some are pretty bad, some are spam, but some are amazing or even better than the ones on disc. Thankfully, you don't have to download these levels to your HDD so don't think you have to use precious space for all these levels like most games. I also liked you can sort by category which really brings out one of the main new features of LBP2. These user-created levels just show how powerful the tools in this game are and show how imaginative people can be. Of course it is the most fun with more people, but you can still enjoy the game by yourself.It goes to stand that a developer doesn't have to create an entire world for you to enjoy it. This is some of the most fun I have had in a game in a while and absolutely loved it. However, think carefully before buying this game. Are you a creator or player? If you are just a player you will have fun, but won't be using 80% of what's on the disc, the editor. Enough time has gone by for thousands of excellent levels to be created, so it isn't a huge loss.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2013"}

Though I enjoy every game for what it has to offer, God of War, sadly, did not compare to its successors.  God of War 2 was no match graphically to God of War 3, but the cutscenes and in-game movies were amazing.  First off, God of War's controls are slightly different in that R2 and L2 are the buttons used to open chests and whatnot.  Coming from the R1 and L1 of GOW2 and 3, I kept taking longer to open necessary items due to this - and while this may not be an issue for some, it was for me at least.  Another issue I had with controls was when on a wall surrounded by attackers I couldn't use a circle swipe to kill them all, I could only hit out at them directly to my left, directly to my right, directly on top or directly on bottom - again, might not be an issue for some, but it was annoying for me.  The story line is superb, however lacks the depth that was integrated into God of War 2.  Overall, the God of War series is stellar and this game kicked off the series with a bang.

While staying true to its roots and keeping the familiar game play many fans love, it's updated for modern times and utilizes the \"3D\" filter. It's a blast to play and will keep you playing until you've unlocked everything.The story is still the same: Princess Toadstool gets kidnapped by Bowser and Mario rushes off to rescue her. You go through 8 worlds and multiple stages including Boo Houses, mini castles and various air ships controlled by Bowser and his allies. Controlling Mario is easy as he has all his trademark moves from past games. Familiar and new power ups are featured here as well as the infamous \"infinite power\" leaf which makes you invincible and only shows up if you die a certain number of times in any stage. Once you beat all the stages, you unlock the \"Special\" stages; essentially they are alternate versions of the original stages (some have entirely new layouts while others have a few variations here and there and feature new obstacles.) As usual, the game has three save slots so you and other people can save their respective game sessions.This time around, you can unlock Luigi as a playable character and you also get star ratings. They pop up to show you how well you are doing and you can up to 5 stars; get a 5 star rating and you unlock another \"secret\" section of the game. Don't worry if you think this game is a piece of cake; it starts off easy but by the third world, the challenge ramps up and you will be put to the test as far as getting all the star coins, unlocking secret sections, etc. This game uses the StreetPass feature to encourage gamers to walk around with their 3DS systems. It does so by having \"?\" block challenges within the game. These challenges basically have you clear out enemies and/or grab token coins within a time limit; doing so lets you collect these coins to unlock stages as you get further into the game and also sends out this info to other gamers who have this game to challenge them to do the same.The PROS: The graphics are great. Everything from the enemies to the backgrounds and the effects of everything you see on the screen looks beautiful. The music and sounds are familiar but updated slightly while controlling Mario is as easy as it's always been. It starts out easy but this game will challenge you, especially if you're the type that wants to unlock and complete everything this game has to offer. There are plenty of stages to complete with more to unlock along the way, unlocking Luigi proves to be useful as you need to use him to clear stages (sometimes he makes it easier to do so than Mario) and getting the 5 star rating unlocks more stuff so it is worth going the extra mile. The StreetPass feature this game uses is cool as it makes you want to carry your 3DS around to see if other players send you \"?' block challenges. The same goes for power ups; whenever you go to Toad's house to get power ups, your 3Ds sends out that info to other games so when you come back later, you'll see that another gamer has sent you power ups to use in the game.The CONS: None. If you don't like Mario, this game won't change your mind but then again....maybe it would. :PThis game is sold separately and as part of a bundle (Flame Red 3DS with a copy of this game) so you have a choice of how to get it. Those who are still on the fence should definitely consider buying this game. It's a lot of fun to play, looks great and it also gives you a challenge. I highly recommend it so go for it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2012"}

I really gave it a chance before writing this review and I'm coming away from the game disappointed. I slogged through Homecoming where the combat was great but the puzzles and story were very blah. In the case of Downpour, the town looks great, the story is a bit more coherent... but the combat is a mess. The enemy variety is lacking, trying to shoot a gun is a disaster, it just doesn't work well. Every fight I had the opportunity to run away from, I did. The inadvertent pacifist.I will say that this is the best looking Silent Hill to date, that's a plus. The town looks very crisp, the monsters are cool (well, the first dozen times you see the same one...), and the sound is appropriately eerie. I also like the puzzles and exploration aspect of the game, I just wish it focused way more on those aspects and let the combat fall by the wayside.If you're a fan of the Silent Hill series I'd say play it and try to focus on the positive aspects of the game. Even playing through Homecoming it was worth going back to Silent Hill because it's an awesome locale, it's more of a character than some of the protagonists of the series. If you're NEW to the series, go pick upSilent Hill HD Collection- those are by and far the best games of the series and you will thoroughly enjoy them. Then maybe pick this one up.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2012"}

Having played LBP 1, 2, and LBP on the PSP, I can say without a doubt that this is the finest version of the game to date.  It's not like the other games were bad, but this one has all of the best of those games, and the added features made possible by the vita.I'm not going into the details of gameplay, because it is an LBP game...you probably know what the game is all about.  But one group of features that must be highlighted are the ancillary controls and input options made possible by the vita.  Being able to take a picture and use the picture as sticker in game is awesome.  Yes, this was part of LBP2, but having the cameras built into the console, and having that console be completely portable, makes this feature soooo much more useful and fun.  My camera is no longer tied down to being in front of my TV.  My whole world is now in play.Second, the touch controls.  I typically don't like switching between analog, and then touch controls because it can be distracting. In the fifa games, for example, I turn all that touch screen mess off.  But in this case, it really adds something.  Especially the back touch screen controls.  Pushing things from back to front through the game is a great little gameplay feature that adds to the feeling of being a puppet master controlling this little world.The single player is great.  The community elements, and create level are amazing.

{"product_name":"B007XYBUBE","description":"","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"Finally, a PS3 game that can compete with Super Smash Bros.","reviewText":"Ever since I first played the original PlayStation many years ago, I've always stuck with every new iteration of the system and mostly ignored the other platforms. This wasn't necessarily out of what most of you would call \"fanboyism\", but largely out of loyalty to what I deem to be a great system, as well as the fact that I have simple needs and don't require multiple systems and hundreds of different games to keep me happy...plus, I'm cheap. Still, I've dabbled in a couple of Wii games and few of them impressed me as much as the Super Smash Brothers series. In fact, I almost considered buying myself a Wii just so I could play Super Smash Brothers Brawl, which I had a blast playing alongside other people I knew. Naturally, when I saw trailers of PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, a PS3 version of Super Smash Brothers, and starring many of my favorite characters from games I own, I was overjoyed. Did this game make my dreams come true when I finally played it? Well...YES! There are a couple of slight flaws (and I mean SLIGHT), but PS All-Stars did mostly live up to my expectations. This game is made up of a roster of 20 fighters/characters from some of the most popular PlayStation titles. Since they're all available from the moment you load the game, listing them will not spoil anything for anyone. First mention goes to my all time favorites: Kratos, Cole MacGrath (good and evil versions), Jak and Daxter, and Raiden. Plenty of characters from other well known franchises are included: Nathan Drake, Sly Cooper, Ratchet and Clank, Sir Daniel Fortesque, Nariko, Parappa the Rapper, Heihachi Mishima, Sweet Tooth, Dante (the new version= mixed feelings there), Big Daddy, Sackboy, and Colonel Radec. Finally, there are a few other characters I've never heard of, yet are apparently very popular: Fat Princess, Spike, and Toro the Cat. An impressive roster for a first entry in what could possibly (and hopefully) become a great series.Much like in the Super Smash Brothers games, all these characters control the same and their attacks are executed with the same combinations of button and joystick inputs, but the attacks themselves differ greatly between each character. Some characters like Heihachi and Raiden are almost exclusively close range fighters, others like Kratos, Jak and Daxter, and Dante are more balanced with their long range and close range attacks, and finally others like Nathan Drake and Radec favor long range combat. There's something for every type of gamer here. Special item weapons can appear randomly during matches to aid in combat, such as RPG launchers, freeze bombs, and the Spear of Destiny (from God of War II). The different arenas available to fight in are all based off of locations from the games the All-Stars fighters originate from (God of War, Infamous, Uncharted), as well as locations from other games (Resistance and Patapon). Plenty of hazards unique to each stage make things interesting and help keep you on your toes, and they also involve elements from different games interacting with one another. For example, the Columbia stage from Bioshock Infinite gets invaded by that giant doll/mech thing from Twisted Metal and it attacks the players with missiles. Also, in the Metropolis stage from Ratchet and Clank, you see Captain Qwark in the background suddenly get attacked by the Hydra from God of War, which then turns its attention on the players and attacks them a few times. One key difference between PS All-Stars and Smash Brothers are how you score kills. In this game, the fighters don't possess damage counters and there are no ring-outs, which was the only way to kill others in Smash Brothers. Instead, each character has an AP meter that slowly fills up with juice as they land hits on enemies and they fuel each characters' Super Attacks, which are the only means of killing other enemies (with the exception of one special item weapon).There are 3 levels for Super Attacks and they're all capable of killing different numbers of enemies. Level 1 Super Attacks can normally kill 1 or 2 enemies depending on how well they're timed and aimed, but they can also be dodged or avoided by keeping a certain distance from the attacker. Level 2 Super Attacks are typically more difficult to avoid (depending on the character) and can easily kill 2 or 3 enemies on average, but are still possible to avoid. Level 3 Super Attacks are very much like the Final Smashes from Smash Brothers and usually spell certain doom for anyone else on the screen. I wasn't sure if having these Super Attacks as the only way to kill enemies was going to be a smart gameplay mechanic, but it actually makes battles very exciting, especially timed ones. However, it can be annoying in one-on-one battles, especially against the computer which has a tendency to predict incoming Super Attacks. If you miss enemies with Super Attacks, you have to refill the AP meter again, which can be frustrating. One thing I was hoping for this game to have was a more interesting singleplayer campaign, one that could at least compete with the Subspace Emissary from Super Smash Brothers Brawl. Unfortunately, the singleplayer in this game follows the same formula for all 20 characters: an intro scene plays with the chosen character hearing about a gathering of powerful fighters and then setting off to take part in the tournament. After defeating the other fighters, another scene plays with the character meeting his/her \"rival\" and then they fight. Finally, the character fights the rather unimaginative and disappointing final boss, and then a final scene plays with the character reveling in his/her victory.Accomplishing this 20 times tends to get repetitive, but luckily the scenes for all characters are done well and include most of the voice actors from the original source materials (hearing Kratos, Raiden, and Cole voiced by their original voice actors instead of some second rate understudies was a true pleasure). Also, some of the rivalries between certain characters were pretty cool. They ranged from interesting (Kratos v.s. Sweet Tooth), to appropriate fan-service (Jak and Daxter v.s. Ratchet and Clank), to hilariously bizarre (Evil Cole v.s. Fat Princess). Despite the okay singleplayer, PlayStation All-Stars still succeeds due to its multiplayer, which much like Smash Brothers, is truly the game's main focus. No need to get into too much detail here: up to 4 players can beat the crap out of each other in timed or stock matches and choose the frequency in which item weapons can appear onscreen, if any. Matches can be ranked or unranked, and you can either team up with friends or do free-for-all matches. Online matches tend to freeze at times, but what online games don't these days? I'm still rather new to the multiplayer and I've mostly had my rear handed to me by much more skilled players, but in time my skills will improve and I'm sure I will enjoy the game even more when I start winning matches more often. Also, for those of you who are interested, the more you play with a particular character (online or offline), the more extras you unlock like costumes, taunts, victory music, and so on. PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale is certainly a fun game, but know that the best experience will be the multiplayer, so don't expect the singleplayer to satisfy you on its own if that's all you're interested in. Still, if you're like me and don't want to invest in another system just to have the Smash Brothers experience, then get this game, it's a very worthy alternative. If a sequel is made, let's hope other true PlayStation All-Stars like Solid Snake and Crash Bandicoot get added into the mix.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2013"}

I have noticed that the graphics get slightly dull in border-less windowed rather than running it in full-screen. That is a bit strange, because normally games look identical either way.Not much replay value. I went a year without playing it.

Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide.

Bioshock 1 was not a game that needed a direct sequel as the story was told and concluded perfectly. When this was announced I figured it would be a half-@$$ed cash in on the Bioshock mythos. While I still believe that it was a largely unnecessary sequel, it's still an outstanding game that's just as good as Bioshock 1 in every aspect and (given the current price) well worth picking up.(NOT REALLY A SPOILER)There is one thing I'd like to mention that occurred in the game. Although you play as an early model Big Daddy throughout most of it, there is a very small period where you play as a little sister. This segment is both incredibly beautiful and somewhat sad as the little sisters see the world of Rapture completely differently to the way everyone else does.

While the storyline and gameplay aren't totally revolutionary, it does offer more than many of the &quot;eye candy only&quot; games.In the game you play through a series of scenes intermixed with cut scenes that fill in the story and give context to the scenes you are playing.  Gameplay is simply driving Max around and killing bad guys, possibly having to solve a puzzle or two along the way.  Nothing mind bending, but pretty fun.To enable you to take on more enemies than normal the game has a &quot;bullet time&quot; mode, which is just like the slow motion sequences from The Matrix.  This sets the game apart and is actually useful in some battles.The graphics are mediocre at best.  Scenes are generally dark and the camera can get downright jerky at some points.  Given that none of the scenes are particularly large and there are no large outdoor environments (like Halo), I would have expected better.Overall, Max Payne is worth a rent.

{"product_name":"B006YDPU48","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Pohle","summary":"Dark Souls II: prepare to be lied to edition!","reviewText":"If you've been paying attention and looking forward to Souls II, you may remember watching reveal videos that showed a gorgeous game, one with full, dynamic lighting, ambient occlusion, among other graphical effects that made the game look beautiful and drip with atmosphere, and demos with the producers talking on how their new goal with these visual additions would compliment certain parts of gameplay.  Unfortunately, both console retail releases has been suddenly, inexplicably visually gutted and look nothing of the sort that was shown almost a year ago, and even videos shown mere months back.  I don't mind small changes, but these are so significant it almost appears to be running on another engine in some instances.  If you'd like to see for yourself, search for \"Dark Souls 2 downgrade\" in Google and read up and view some comparison shots.  There's an article written by Technobuffalo that shows a comparison video.The visuals have undergone a significant downgrade in many different areas.  Not just in the lighting, but complex geometry has been lessened, texture detail is lower, among other things.  Souls II looks, quite frankly, almost like a late Xbox game in spots and I'm not being hyperbolic when I say this.  Neither FROM SOFTWARE nor Namco have come out and given reason as to why this has occurred, yet they are still passing off the initial reveal visuals as what is in the final product.  Don't believe any of the screenshots, nor any PR videos you'll see.  Even on YT as many press and early access people got versions that look as advertised (curiously many had PS3 beta versions that ran and looked as advertised), but is not the same as is on shelves right now.I fully understand the developmental process and that target renders and pre-release code is subject to change and often does before hitting retail.  And I would be fully accepting of that, even a downgrade as large as this, had Namco changed the box-art shots, come out and been forthcoming that things had been radically altered and features removed before shipping......then this would be a 5 star review.  But they didn't.  Instead, they decided to keep their mouths shut, downgraded the graphics and outright removed the mechanics those graphical advancements enabled (more on this below), kept deceptive screenshots on the box, and maintained that the game is as was advertised anyway.It's not, and I for one feel very misled and scammed.  For that, 1 star.And I just want to make clear: the 1 star is NOT indicative of quality.  The game's actually quite enjoyable on its own merits.  But whether it's good or not is completely irrelevant to my point.  Namco and FROM SOFTWARE did not announce these changes prior to release.  People only found out about this after purchase.  On top of this, the box-shots are misrepresentative of what the game looks like.  Even worse, much worse, is that these alterations go beyond just the superficial: the developers, since the initial reveal in April of last year, have been touting their new lighting engine and how it will affect certain aspects of play.These are quotes from a few Dark Souls II previews I found:......: \"As another change in expression, another aspect we challenged ourselves with is the use of light.  Use of the torch allows the player to light up dark cages, but also allows for other actions such as lighting up light sources in the environment or using against enemies\".and,......: \"In order the navigate the cellar without getting slaughtered, it's necessary to carry a torch.  But in order to carry a torch, you must first sacrifice your shield, which many Dark Souls fans will know is a high price to pay for the ability to see\".The above quotes no longer apply, as this lighting engine has subsequently been removed and torches are no longer a necessity in darkness that has been artificially lessened to compensate for the absence.  Torch sconces are relegated to being basically useless vestigial relics of a design feature abandoned that now amount to little more than environmental window dressing.  So before anyone accuses me of being some nit-picky graphics w***e, this change fundamentally affects a core mechanic in the game heavily lauded and promoted by the developers themselves.  I just want people to be aware of what's been done here.  What you see on the box is not exactly what you're getting, what you will be playing is not exactly what has been promised, and I'm giving a 1 star not for a poor game, but for poor, deceitful business practices.Hopefully all of this will be addressed in the PC, PS4, and One releases.  I'd heavily advise waiting until then to pick up those version and skipping these for now.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2014"}

I hate to complain about a game so imaginative and cute, but it did become an issue with me the more and more I played through it.You play as a new kid in town, customizable to your discretion, who makes friends with the South Park gang and becomes involved in their fantasy role-playing games when the precious Stick of Truth is stolen from Cartman. A terrifying plot involving aliens, anal probes, zombie Nazis, abortion clinics, and ManBearPig himself, plus many side-quests make up the lengthy adventure which is a hilarious parody of fantasy RPGs, while being a decent RPG in its own right at the same time (but also retaining many of the flaws of the genre).The voice acting by Trey Parker and Matt Stone is, as expected, brilliant, as well as their cute animation style, and their humor which alternates between satirical and grotesque permeates every scene. You really will feel like you are controlling an actual episode of South Park. Nods to 16-bit RPGs during the Canada scenes will appeal to older gamers too.The downside is that there is not enough variation during the short campaign in regards to weapons, armor, and power-ups. The battles eventually become redundant as the XP levels are capped at level 15. Many of the trophies will require multiple play-throughs, and some are even locked-out once the main campaign is over. Bad choices there from the developers.It's worth playing through once, and will appeal to all fans of the show, but boredom will set in at around the halfway mark and you'll probably be somewhat disappointed with it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2014"}

I played it at a time when I had the... time to do that. It's unforgiving. There's essentially no story, and the instructions are hardly helpful; you're basically just dropped into a big, dangerous, exotic world and you have to fend for yourself.How difficult is it? For starters, there's no way to pause the game. It's one thing for a game to (want to) be difficult, but this is just stupid. At the end of the day, it's a damn video game. Real life takes precedence: Phone calls, emails, friends, family, pets, etc. can and will interrupt. There are safe places to wait, but if you happen to choose poorly, you're dead and have to restart the level.In addition, the difficulty is very high. Some early enemies will kill you in 1-2 hits. I almost returned the game after a few hours because it was so frustrating. I hung on however, and became deeply involved and addicted.You must understand 2 things: You will have to grind, and you will have to use the wiki page (shout out to the invaluable demonssouls.wikidot.com). The only good thing about enemies respawning is that you can kill them as often as you like and keep earning experience points (which make your character stronger).And the wiki page helps knowing how to upgrade your character - since the game saves every few seconds and has just one save file, it helps to know beforehand how you want to go.So assuming you are OK with all the above, will you enjoy the game? Definitely. It probably has the best pure combat of any RPG this generation. There's virtually no story to speak of, but it doesn't really matter, because it's beautiful to look at, handles expertly, and offers great progression. It also features some of the best boss fights in gaming, clever and varied enemies, awesome weapons and armor (including a giant butcher's knife and a samurai sword), and unique level design.You have to ask yourself one question: Do I (feel lucky? no) have the time and patience to tackle this challenge? If so, pick this up. (FYI, I'm not planning to buy the sequel, Dark Souls, because of said issues. I don't have the time for it like I did a few years ago for Demons Souls.)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2012"}

No matter what you may have heard though, the one thing that you need to believe first and foremost before you even consider popping this game in is the fact that it is unbelievably difficult, incredibly challenging, and just plain unforgiving.  No mid-level save points, getting sent back to the beginning of a level after you die, re-spawning firerce enemies; yes, Demon's Souls is probably one of the hardest games you'll ever play, regardless of the genre.  That being said however, Demon's Souls is also one of the absolute best action/RPG's you'll ever play as well.  Technically speaking, Demon's Souls is simply a gorgeous sight to behold.  The level designs are foreboding, dark, and varied from one another, while the game's creature designs are brilliant as well.  The game's combat mechanics are intricate and deep, with boss battles being nothing short of epic as well.

As said before, the game's difficulty will frustrate you to almost no end, yet you'll keep coming back regardless.

But my fears dissipated soon after I started playing and as I progressed farther into the game the more pleased I became.The art work and graphics are incredible and very well done in this game. If your used to playing any of the newer Lego releases, you'll know that they pack a ton of hints and helpful things into the environment. The hub is basically the Bat Cave from which you can launch a level. As with all other Lego games, you are required to play all levels in Story Mode to unlock Free Play. These are brought up in a map in the bat cave by using the central console. Once selected you are taken there in the selected mode. There is a massive open play area Gotham City. This area consists of three connected islands, and are chock full of places to go and things to do, and collect. All of the Citizens in Peril, Gold Bricks, Red Bricks, Vehicles, and Characters that you do not achieve in Story Mode or Free Play of the individual levels can be obtained here. In all there are 250 Gold Bricks. During level play you can get 3 Gold Bricks for each, one for reaching the high score to achieve True Hero status, one for finding the Citizen in Peril, and one for completing the Mini-Kit. All Mini-Kit pieces are only found in each level, none are located elsewhere. Once you have achieved all of the three above there is no longer any reason to play the levels and you can concentrate on clearing the main Gotham City areas.To get to Gotham from the Bat Cave, simply move to any one of the three vehicle platforms, ask Alfred for a vehicle and take off. To obtain one of the Gold Bricks in the river, you will need to use one of the boats at least once and navigate a course of cones. To obtain another one of the Gold Bricks you'll need to use a flying machine and look for the green targets and fly through them in order to obtain the brick. Once your free to roam in Gotham, you can start finding stuff you need. If you start your map and press Y you can momentarily see where objects are located. Yellow dots are Gold Bricks, Red dots are Red Bricks, Vehicles are vehicles, Blue dots are Citizens in Peril, and Gold Arches are Character Portals.Personally, I would start and try to collect the Red Bricks first so you can unlock those Extras and get some help in locating the things your looking for. Many of these are very easy to find and obtain, others you'll need to find Joker and Riddler to get to so also go after characters in the early play. Look for the different colored spotlights. Red spotlights lead you to a Red Brick location, Blue spotlights lead you to a communications port with the Bat Cave and you can either transport to another part of the map, or have Alfred send a vehicle. Some Character Portals will not build because you need to have so many Gold Bricks first, just move on and get as many as you can. Also while your out early on, find the Citizen in Peril and save them. None of them are hard at all. Many are just being beaten by thugs and all you need to do is punch the thug and the Citizen is free. Others its as simple as using Superman to freeze a water spout allowing them to jump off. Once you've collected many Red Bricks, characters, and Citizens in Peril, you can start on the Gold Bricks. You obviously have collected some during your search for the Citizens in Peril and Red Bricks, but there are a lot more to find. Some are easy like knocking down 5 mail boxes, or breaking 4 shrubs, others are more involved and require a lot of climbing, and moves to get to the brick with the proper equipment to get it. The hardest part on some of them is finding where to start. I used Superman to fly up and started by getting the ones on rooftops, and high places. This helps to cut down on the number of gold arrows flashing from your Gold Brick finder extra. Use Superman to fly up to a Gold Brick them use him to fly around and follow the trail to a suit port and thus your start point.There are about 6 water course Gold Brick challenges. You will see the yellow arrow marker in the water and not know how to get the brick. Look along the shore or docks for a boat or a Bat Cave communications platform. If its a platform, call Alfred up and have him send a boat of your choice. Some are easier than others to steer. Sometimes a boat will already be there, buy it if you need to, then jump on and the first set of cones will appear. Run the course to get that Gold Brick. Only the police boat was a weird wobbly contraption that was hard to control, all the others were easy and fun. There are also about 6 flying challenges. Most of these are from aircraft you'll find on top of buildings. I found a glitch here in that the indicator on the map showed a gold dot but no aircraft were found. I restarted the game and then they appeared so be aware that if you cannot find an aircraft on a roof top and there should be one, this may be the problem. As you mount the aircraft a green target will open ahead of you. Take off and make your way from target to target until you get your brick. The only aircraft that was hard to control was the helicopter on the building next to Luthor tower. Flying in general is not super easy and takes a lot of practice to get it working. This includes flying characters such as Superman or Wonder Woman.I did not encounter any of the challenges that were hard. Some were quite involved and one was a little frustrating as you had to make some odd jumps and the character would fall and you would have to get back to a point to try again. Most challenges the grasping function was flawless and the areas designed to be very forgiving if you did happen to fall. Some challenges as mentioned before are hard to find the starting points. Those were mainly the buildings, but there are some confusing cues in the Zoo too. Just look for and ride all 4 animals, the rest are easy.Once you have collected all of the items you should have 2 slots left, one Character and one Gold Brick. You can then play the Bonus Level. You may have passed a pile of gold pieces in the park that were not active or if they were you could not enter the portal. You must have a certain number of Gold Bricks to activate the bricks so you can build them, and you must have Clark Kent character. Then you can enter and play this level. As with all Lego games you need to achieve 1 million studs. Stud multiplier extras are Off so you'll have to work for every stud you can find and get. Break everything, solve the puzzles and work all three areas to reach this goal and earn that last Gold Brick. Then you can go back to Gotham to the building near Luthor tower and get that last character. If you've done everything right, you'll have 100% completion.This game over all was a ton of fun to play. Not as big as Lord of The Rings which was also very good, but big enough to keep you occupied for some time. Art work was awesome, controls were very well done in spite of the learning curve for the flying. challenges were easy to difficult without being frustrating. The individual levels were very challenging but nothing any player should not be able to get through with some persistence. If you really get stuck, there are several excellent guides out on the web from which to get a hint. The timed challenges were few and mercifully fairly easy. There are NO driving challenges. This is a fun, winnable game for those who love the franchise. If I had to complain about anything, it would be the thugs in Gotham City. As your playing in this open world if you stop for more than a few seconds to get your bearings or to do something, your constantly attacked by thugs. They do no harm and you can knock them out with one punch, but they were SO annoying when your trying to find your way or hunt down a clue or save a Citizen in Peril. I avoided being on the ground as much as possible, and used superman almost exclusively to get around. This kept them at bay. You can also jump up onto a wall or a vehicle to get a little break. A nuisance, but not a big enough negative to say the game was bad because of it. Once you complete the game, they all go away and you can stroll around Gotham in peace.There have been mention of the game freezing. I did experience the Level 12 bug, and had to restart the level which was frustrating as it is a big level. I had the game freeze two other times when I was moving fast in Gotham playing in the open world. No biggie, I just restarted the console and moved on.If your into the Lego series, and have not played this title yet, I highly recommend you pick up a copy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2014"}

{"product_name":"B001CWXAP2","description":"","reviewerName":"JLeack \"Jleack\"","summary":"The most disappointing MMO in history","reviewText":"Star Wars: The Old Republic is a game that sounds great on paper, but doesn't translate well into real world application.Story is emphasized from the get-go, and it does an excellent job of execution. All NPC interactions are done through cutscenes with full voice over dialogue. Unfortunately, after listening to hours upon hours of conversations you'll notice that they become redundant, and then you'll likely begin skipping them. Since the story is virtually the only thing Star Wars: The Old Republic does different than any other game, the second you begin skipping the cutscenes you're going to find that the game is extremely dry.Gameplay is okay, but there are some glaring issues with the system. Abilities sometimes indicate that they go off, but don't, and other times the global cooldown will refresh when it shouldn't have. This coupled with animations being more important than fluidity means that the game feels a lot like Warhammer Online and other MMOs that don't have their gameplay fleshed out. Since you'll be spending the majority of your game playing the game and combating enemy characters, the lack of fluidity will quickly wear on you as you become frustrated.The graphics are decent, but performance is awful. Myself and many others with great computers play the game with disappointing framerates. The worst part about this is that the game doesn't exactly look great, so it's hard to understand why the game runs so poorly.Lastly, the game is missing dozens of features that have become standard over the past few years. Target of target, assist macros, addons, UI scaling, dungeon finder, item sell-back, and much more have gone unimplemented in Star Wars: The Old Republic. In an age where convenience and satisfaction are everything in video games, it's mind-boggling that a huge development studio like BioWare wouldn't at least add a few of these. This game has fewer features than any other MMO I've payed a monthly fee for.The end result is a game that has some great Star Wars flair and a good story to tell, but simply doesn't compete with modern MMOs. It's fun for a few levels, and because of that it might be worth a few bucks, but everyone I played with has already quit, and I suspect you will too.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00006FDLP","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"Deep, bloody, funny...","reviewText":"In 1992 I was forbidden to play a game I had never heard of called Mortal Kombat. Apparently my mom saw it on the news and instinctively forbade that I even touch the controversial game. Needless to say that my brother, father and I, perhaps through some act of defiance, all sought this game out... more or less to find out what the big deal was. What we discovered is how frighteningly deadly the combination of Daniel Moir behind the controls of Scorpion were. To this day I have gone completely undefeated in the original Mortal Kombat, not even the computer stood a chance.Mortal Kombat 2 followed, and while the computer would get the best of me only one human opponent was able to beat me. My reign as Tooele's champion or Mortal Kombat ended with the third installment of the series, and when Mortal Kombat trilogy and Ultimate MK3 came out I was burnt out. The fatalities were cheesy, the fighting redundant and cheap, and the babalities, friendships, and animalities were just so over done I gave up. Needless to say I was there for Mortal Kombat Mythologies, but like most people ignored Special Forces all together. MK 4 came and went, as did MK Gold, which was fun for a while, but the fatalities were just too complicated to pull off on the Dreamcast controller.Despite having out grown Mortal Kombat, for some reason the title called my name when I went to buy Metroid Prime and Fusion. \"Daniel... master me!\" I couldn't resist and I succumbed to the temptation.The game is completely different in terms of game play, and the story surprisingly refreshing. Liu Kang is dead... now what? New Tournament, new characters, a deep fighting engine, the return of some old favorites, and Scorpion is still as deadly as ever.Like Super Smash Bros Melee there is a ton of stuff to unlock, everything from hidden characters, to production art, and much more. In addition the fatalities are now much easier to do, which is nice. The game no longer requires the perfect distance to execute a fatality, as MK 4 did, which was a pain. The downside is that the fatalities, for the most part, are still cheesy, and while they are bloody they still don't have that horror element that the first two had. There was something scary about those fatalities, but ever since MK 3, they have been outlandish and silly, but they are at least so outlandish that the sick minded (such as myself) will get a genuine chuckle out of the ridiculousness of it all.Graphics are very good, but still could have been better. Sound effects are great, but the music isn't as good as past Mortal Kombat games. All in all this is the best thing to happen to the series since MK 2, but its still not as good as the first two games were. I recommend the XBox version, as the game seems to be optimized for this system, if not go with the GameCube version as its almost just as good, with only subtle differences graphically. The PS 2 version's a bit too slow for my taste.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2002"}

Like Amazon was reading my mind.Or, more realistically, I can't be the only guy thinking that this game is a little short on, uh, pabulum.  Not that a first person Armageddon-style shoot 'em up is supposedly to be heavily intellectual; it's just that we've seen this so many times before:  you go around shooting a whole bunch of monsters, gradually acquiring more and more powerful weapons until basically you're fighting Satan himself at the end.Good stuff!  Classic.  But there's not a twist in sight here, it's just the same ol' same ol'.And it seems like they could have even thought out the brainless butchery a little better:1.  The first section has you tromping through the jungle wasting a bunch of Asians.  What innovation!2.  The second second is, admittedly, trippy.  It involves floating through a Jefferson Airplane-style alien mothership.  Promising, but brief.3.  Guess what happens in the final section?  You've seen it a million times before.  Only here your final adversary is so close and the camerawork is so shaky that you can hardly tell what's going on.In short, nothing new to offer.

Catherine's core themes-those of free will, of the delicate nature of relationships and the choices we make within them, marry perfectly with the intense, terror-filled gameplay that serves to accurately reflect Vincent's growing sense of anxiety. It is an experience wholly unlike any to come before it, and is certain to leave gamers talking and thinking about Vincent's tribulations long after the credits have rolled.","reviewerName":"Chris Chapa","summary":"Unconventional, but pleasing!","reviewText":"Well for starters, those who are looking for a \"racy, sexually driven game\" in hopes of some anime nudity or something along those lines, you will need to seek elsewhere. The adult content that the Rated M ESRB refers to is the nature of the game, revolving around Vincent's one night stand with a woman that is NOT his girlfriend, and the actions he takes that surround his predicament. The way that CATHARINE (and by extension, Vincent the protagonist) deals with infidelity, consequence, and responsiblity is almost identical in comparison to real life.If categorized, I would place this game in the \"Drama/Horror/Puzzle\" section, as it contains equal amounts of all three:Drama - Katharine, Vincent's girlfriend of 5 years, and the impending \"next step\" in their relationship she is prepping him for, which he is hesitant about. Than there is Catharine, the titular minx whom Vincent has a drunken sexual encounter with.Horror - The insane, terrorizing nightmares that Vincent has that seem to root from his infidelity, or the guilt thereof.Puzzle - The actual \"meat\" of the game, which occurs in his nightmares, requires him to undertake many 'climbing' puzzles in an effort to survive the nightmare. If he falls in his dream, he dies in real life.When not dreaming, you have control over Vincent's behavior when he is socializing with his friends or other characters from the game. When given an option to choose the direction of his behavior, it will ultimately effect the outcome of the game's story. The puzzles however, do become SIGNIFICANTLY harder with the level of difficulty you choose.Much like Heavy Rain, this INTERACTIVE DRAMA totally changes the way we look at video games and shows what they are capable of.

I came across the xbox 360 HD Player last night for $199 while i was shopping for a different HD player which ALL were more, $500 for HD,$799 for blue ray and $1,199 for dual hd/blue ray player.I thought there is NO way the 360 hd player would be any better than my current player, WRONG as i found it to be the ONLY hd player to play at 1080p. I purchased the Vega xbox connection to hook up to my xbox and samsung 46\" lcd 1080p tv and of course the player which came with King Kong, Remote and necessary connectors.I was concerned about my wireless xbox connection as the player uses the USB connection on the xbox i previously used for my wireless connection, no problem as the player has a place for the wireless connection and works fine.Hooking up everything is simple and im no electronics guru and took about 10 minutes. When i turned on the tv the picture was HORRIBLE...so i went to the xbox picture controls and changed the Monitor resolution to 1920x1080 as it was hooked to the VGA connector and this would give me 1080p.  Instantly the picture was very crisp and sharp on the xbox live menu. I put the movie in and WOW WOW WOW i could not believe my eyes. The whole family and a friend watched the entire movie as we had not seen such a sharp picture.My friend also has an HD player and as soon as the movie was over went up to the store and purchased the xbox hd player.  Its really a no brainer for the price and is the ONLY hd player that allows 1080P while ALL the other HD players will only play at 1080i. My total cost at best buy was $250 which included the xbox VGA cables, however, the player is a real bargain because you get King Kong which is $30 seperately and the remote is $20+ if purchased seperately.Even if you TV does not support VGA I tried the supplied HD component cables for comparision and it was very very good with no noticeable difference at standard viewing range. For the money its the best bargain on the market for an HD 1080p player I have found.  If you have lots of $$$ go for the dual HD/Blue ray player but again is OVER $1,000.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2007"}

One bazillion guns would have be plenty. About 98% of the guns you pick up are worthless becasuse they are a lower level than what you already have and most of the time are crap guns. I personally only kept like one in every 100 or so weapons I picked up the rest I sold for cash.There are two ways(well actually 3 but the third is never used) to get weapons. either by monster drop or weapon casses you find in the wasteland. The First, by monster drop is very effective in the begining of the game where only a select few enemies drop weapons. However later in the game it becomes a LOT more frequent. Like everything you kill drops a weapon and this is annoying becasue they are never or rarly any good. So when there not you can sell them to vendors. The second way is to find a weapon case and when you open it you get anywhere from 1 to 4 guns and some ammo and grenades. There tends to be a better chance to get a good gun when you open these and that should be the case because they are less frequent than enemies. It doesn't really make sense that there are only two kinds of weapon casses but 8 different weapon manufacturers.About the cash system...well...it's not nessisary because the only thing you use it for it when you die the NEW YOU POLE you respawn at charges you for it's servises.(Opps not weapon related) I never bought a single gun from the venders or grenade mods because the stuff you get from killing enemies is better, even the crappy stuff is. You can also buy ammo from these venders but theres no need to becasue theres ammo casses everywhere you go and they are free.But i have to commend GEARBOX SOFTWARE for trying something new. They didn't hit all the right notes but Borderlands is an enjoyable game that will take you a while to beat.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2009"}

Includes a DVD remote control and an infrared receiver that plugs into an Xbox controller port.Note: this item is required for DVD movie playback on Xbox.","reviewerName":"Jeffrey R. Tilley Jr. \"goatman_1\"","summary":"Pleasantly Surprised","reviewText":"I was very disappointed when I found out that my Xbox did not play DVD's fresh out of the box.  The growing trend of selling a system in pieces rather than shipping a complete system is one that I'm not very fond of.  As much as these game systems cost, they should have everything you need right in the box.While I loathed doing so, I eventually bought the DVD playback kit because I was going on a trip and wanted to be able to play movies and games during my down time.  As it turns out, I like the Xbox so much as a DVD player that I now use it as my primary DVD player.  My previous DVD player was an older model JVC and I've had tons of problems with it.  It won't play some DVD's and I've had to take it to be repaired three times, twice in the first year I owned it.I think the compaints in Amazons review are valid.  The lack of an eject button or power button on the remote makes it less convenient, but I have to get up to change DVD's anyway so I don't find that much of a bother.  I find the in-movie menu easy to use and an improvement over my JVC which basically makes me do the same thign when I want to change subtitles or lanuages.  My biggest problem with the Xbox, and not as big as it may sound: for some reason it won't read some disks when you first put them it.  This is easily cured by turning the system on and the off again, and it's only certain disks (Donnie Darko was one, Shreck was another) but I was concerned when it wouldn't read the disk and a bit irritated.The main reson I replaced my JVC with my Xbox is that I think the picture is better, and clearer.  With the HDTV cables hooked up, the picture quality on my Sony Wega is crystal clear.  Good transfer DVD's like Star Wars TPM look absolutely incredible. I was really surprised at some of the cool high-end features like the ability to zoom.  I can't find any documentation to prove that the Xbox is a progressive scan DVD player, but I do know that when you attach the HDTV cables you are given several options for progressive scan viewing in the video section.  My TV is not HDTV compatible (although it has component hookups) and I could not play the DVD's with any of those settings.  Even though I haven't read anything about it, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this IS a progressive scan DVD player with HDTV compatibility.While I don't think the sound is any better than my old DVD player, it's just as good whether playing Dolby surround, Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS.While I was originally outrgaed at having to buy the ability to do something that I think the system should already be doing (and still do) I do feel like I got my money's worth.  The Xbox DVD playback far surpasses the other DVD playing game systems and even most mid to low end DVD players.  The reviewers that have said they preferred the PS2 DVD playback boggle my mind.  They either don't own an XBox with the full get-up or are loyal PS2 owners and want it to be true.  I own a PS2 and it's far inferior when playing DVD's. Not even in the same league in this particular category.  The Xbox is still the best deal on the market and is only going to get better.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2002"}

This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"coopertex","summary":"No Longer Burnout","reviewText":"Be forewarned that if you go into Burnout Pardise thinking that it is the same game as the others in the Burnout series, then you will be dissappointed. This is not the same Burnout that we have known and loved for so long. Burnout Paradise feels like a whole new racer, some new changes are good while others are bad. But because of these changes the game is losing a lot of its loyal fanbase and gaining a new one. And this is one of those games that divides people that love or hate it.This first major change is that Paradise, is the first open world racer in the Burnout series. Open world means that the map is completely accessible from the beginning of the game and you drive anywhere and do anything within this open world map. This is not a new concept in racing games, but it is new in the Burnout series. I love open world games in general so for me this was a huge plus as it adds lots of replayability. You can cruise around the whole city and go sight-seeing the HUGE map, Since the graphics have recieved an overhaul it looks beautiful, there are urban (city) areas and rural (countryside);there is always something new to see and explore.The other major change is the elimination of Crash Mode. They have replaced it with something called \"Showtime\". Showtime can be activated at anytime during the game by pressing both bumper buttons at the same time. You will then see you car flip and tumble around as you guide it towards street traffic and crash into vehicles to cause accidents and earn points. Your car takes more damage as it hits each vehicle, but can continue tumbling around as a hunk of metal. It is so incredibly stupid of the game developers to replace Crash Mode with this unrealistically lame Showtime Mode- you cannot even detonate your car anymore and Crashbreakers have been removed! I have have to deduct a star on that premise alone. Crash Mode was one of the most fun and unique aspects within the Burnout series. I hope they bring it back in the sequel.Unfortunately, you can no longer check traffic (knock street vehicles out of your way) like in Burnout Revenge. The game developers instead made it more realistic and will punish you for hitting street traffic, a small hit will cause physical damage to your car, a full on collision will demolish it and rubbing against other vehicles can cause your car to swerve out of control. Now racing has become more dangerous because demolishing your car can cause you to loose preciouse seconds which give your opponents a lead and visa-versa, so now your true racing skills come into play. I miss checking traffic, but this does not bother me. Other people are divided on this issue however. But you can now play two new game modes called Stunt Run and Marked Man In Stunt Run you try to race and perform stunts for points while the clock is ticking. In Marked Man other players try to destroy the marked car before they reached the finsish line. I though both games are a lot of fun and expand on the gameplay.Loading screens are virutally gone thanks to streaming technology and joining a race is as easy as stopping at a traffic light and pressing both trigger buttons on your controllers at the same time. Then you are inside a race within seconds about to start. The process feels seamless in both single player and multiplayer online. However, the design that has angered a lot of players is when you join a race and lose the event you have to BACKTRACK all the way to that specific streetlight starting point. Which is a huge pain in the butt. There is no instant retry or replay of the event.Paradise has some major flaws but with it come major improvements which overall add to the replay value of the game. It is like a whole new experience; I love the fact that it is open world, that the maps and cars look beautiful. The speed is still topnotch and I had tons of fun roaming around doing stunts by myself or with online multiplayer. It no longer feels like Burnout but still is an excellent racer. Burnout Paradise is loads of fun for all ages and I can see it attracting new fans.Pros:+Open world gameplay+Huge, beautifully designed map+Excellent multiplayer+Excellent controls+Excellent sound effects+Amazing graphics+Brutal crash animations+Stunt Mode and Marked Man Modes are fun+Virtually no loading times+Do stunts anywhere+Amazing speed is still there+Excellent racerCons:-Crash Mode is no longer there-Showtime Mode is TOTAL garbage-Backtracking to race again is a pain-You cannot set waypoints-No longer feels like Burnout-Lots of trashy music tracksNOTE: If you want other open world racers, I recommend Midnight Club, Need for Speed Underground and Test Drive Unlimited.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2008"}

And there is definately a \"fun factor\" to tearing up a city, taking massive jumps off of bridges and smashing up other cars.But the fun on this game wore off within about 1 hour.  It just seemed like it was doing more of the same thing over and over again.I'm not a big fan of racing games.  So I would imagine that someone who likes racing games might find this much better than I do.  But, even so, I found some of the previous Burnout games and other racing games (Midtown Madness, Project Gotham) to be more engaging because they made it possible to play multi-player on the same console - when I can play it with my kids, it tends to have much more value for me.So, if you're only moderately interested in racing games, and especially if you like to play them multi-player (without having to go online), then you're probably not going to enjoy this one for very long.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2008"}

Where is Crash Mode?","reviewText":"I really enjoy the Burnout series (Even though I have been driving for 30 years, and my 10 year old shows me up in every race!) But what I have enjoyed the most in the past is Crash Mode, where you try to do the most damage possible to other cars and tally the cost of the damage. Burnout Paradise did away with it!!  Why?  I do not know anyone who did not like Crash Mode...it is like doing away with desert after dinner! I feel the same way about the explosions....why is it that cars cannot explode in Paradise..that was a big thrill in Takedown!Next issue I have is the way the car crashes...In Paradise, if I crash into a cement divider, my car accordians...which it should do (as it has happened to me in real life years ago.) but if you hit a wooden fence, it should either go through it or damage the fence....instead, your car accordians, as if you hit a cement divider!  That is just plain silly!I love the free roaming capability, but aside from that, it is not the best of the Burnout series...they could have kept explosions and crash mode in, and it would have been a killer game!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00000DMAT","description":"GoldenEye 007has been a huge success for Rareware, and it's easy to see why. More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"M \"Delicious Strawberry\"","summary":"Fantastic game","reviewText":"Even though this game was released over ten years ago, I still have fond memories of it. This game really pushed the capabilities of the Nintendo 64 with its 3D (if somewhat still pixelated) surroundings. There were enough options and variety to make the game interesting - you could go through the levels in Easy, Normal, and Hard mode, and beating the levels in certain difficulty levels within certain time limits would unlock cheats. Some of the cheats were silly, like Donkey Kong mode, but others were cooler, like Invisible or Infinite Ammo mode.Playing the levels in Easy mode was a great way to prep/'study' for Normal and Hard modes (exploring the surroundings, knowing where to go, so you could complete the extra requirements that came with the difficult mode) The save mode allowed one to explore the levels at their leisure - sometimes I played a level I already beat just for fun and exploration, ignoring the time. Molti-player mode was also a lot of fun.The graphics in this game were not as refined as the Wii and PS3 because Nintendo 64 was a groundbreaking console when it came out and the 3D graphics ability was not quite fully mastered yet, so for those of you used to the smoother graphics of today's current consoles, you might notice a bit of clunkiness, and the characters had blocky hands and limbs, and their faces looked painted on their heads. But the 3D was well-done in terms of set-up and surroundings as far as movement and exploration of the world went, so two thumbs up. Even now, I prefer this game to many newer ones because the plotline and play was very good. A- for a wonderful overall game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2010"}

It has great graphics for the cars - but noticeably mediocre graphics for people and environments, and the steering will more than likely force you to break your controller against the wall or shatter glass as your controller goes sailing swiftly through the air out the window (yeah, at times it is that frustrating)...and warning, if you hulk up like Bruce Banner, don't play this for more than 15 minutes because you'll be green before you know it.Its a fun racing game BUT VERY AGGRAVATING at times.The amount of cars and level of customization is great, the soundtrack is phenomenal, and the amount of races available for you to race are virtually limitless...but the steering control leaves much to be desired and will definitely give you heartburn.It is a fun game but unless you're an actual street racer, you might want to rent it first, as most of us will be bogged down by the noticeable learning curve.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2012"}
