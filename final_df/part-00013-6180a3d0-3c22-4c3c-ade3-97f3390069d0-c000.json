Afterall, Riptide isn't that much different than the original in many aspects.  What it does do differently made it an even more fun and addicting game.  Some people will say that it didn't advance enough and my friend said that it felt more like a massive add-on than a completely new game.  I felt that way at first, but after about 10 hours of play, I changed my mind.  Part of the fun could be due to the fact that I was already used to the gameplay and didn't have to learn so much the hard way.  I didn't like the story quite as much and it didn't feel as epic as the first game but that's often the case with sequels.  I paid $30 for it and it was worth every penny to me.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2013"}
{"product_name":"B003O6HAS2","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Schmidt \"TotalHavoc\"","summary":"Excellent Move Game","reviewText":"If you are looking for a title that uses both the Move and navigation controller, then this is the one for you.  After playing this game you can fully realize the potential of the Move controller.  I would say that this title is probably the best Move title that I have played to date.GRAPHICSThe graphics won't be taking on a title like Crysis by any means but they are still pretty good.  The art design of the game is interesting and the array of characters and enemies I have encountered are unique.  Cutscene art is interesting and is done in a style that makes sense and works for this game.VOICE ACTINGThe voice acting isn't going to win a 'best of' award but it is pretty solid.GAMEPLAYThe gameplay is unique, providing an experience that can be addictive at times.  The Move controller is used as a wand and the navigation controller is used to move your character around.  The Move button is used with specific move control gestures to change spells, and it works seamlessly.  This is the Harry Potter game people were looking for when Harry Potter was still relevant.  Better late than never.  There is also a potions mixing mini game so to speak.  Your permanent ability increases are handled by researching and discovering new potions to increase your overall health, mana, etc.  An interesting aspect to health potions is that you need to shake the bottles up with the Move controller and then tilt the controller to drink them.  Drinking the health potion is done in real time, which adds some excitement if your health is aleady low because you can still take damage while trying to drink the potion.  You can tell that the game developers put a lot of time into integrating as much Move motion controls into the game as possible.  The good thing about it is, they did it without forcing it.  Each move makes sense in the context of it's application in the game and the environment.The fighting in the game is enjoyable and satisfying.  Casting spells is fairly accurate although I have experienced the occasional errand cast.  Enemies are designed such that certain elemental types affect them more than others.  The developers made a deliberate effort to send enemies at you in groups that require you to switch spells often.  For example, shield bearing enemies are impervious to all spells as long as they still have their shield.  This requires you to cast an earth borrowing type of spell to hit them and make them drop their shield.  The earth spell doesn't do much damage, so your are then forced to switch back to your Arcane Bolt in order to damage them.  You can also combine a number of spells for increased damage.  For example, you can lay down a wall of fire to keep enemies at bay and then cast a whirlwind, which combines with the fire making a fiery tornado.  This tornado will suck enemies up into the funnel as they enter the tornado's path and do massive damage.One draw back is related to character movement.  I  have had issues with movement where my character gets temporarily stuck when trying to move.  It hasn't happened a lot, but when it does it can be annoying.STORYThe story is about a young apprentice wizard that, due to circumstances as the story unfolds, is reponsible for protecting a princess.  I don't want to spoil anything so I'll leave it at hat.  There is more to the story than I expected for a Move title.  It's no Heavy Rain by any means in that department, but it also is no Super Mario Brothers either.  The story is enough to keep you interested without affecting the action and pacing of the game.There is an epicness that surrounds getting new spells that as the game progresses you get the real sense that you are becoming a more powerful wizard, even if physically you still look like a puny apprentice.SOUNDThe sound is pretty good in this game.  There is an orchestral score that adds ambience that is not obtrusive and pleasant to hear without becoming repetitive.SCORE/RATINGAs far as Move games are concerned, I would give this title 5 stars.  The game is shorter than I would like, but I think it demonstrates the Move better than any other title I have played to date.As for racking it up against other titles across all control types, I would give it 4 to 4.5 stars.  There are enough minor things that need improvement that I can't flat out give it a 5 star rating overall.  If they gave it another 6 months of polish the game might have earned 5 stars because it definitely is 5 stars in terms of fun.As a gamer I think the game is a buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2012"}
{"product_name":"B003RS8HG6","description":"","reviewerName":"Robin Solsj Hglund","summary":"How Sequels Ought To Be","reviewText":"The graphics have been revamped, the music fine-tuned, one brand new instrument plus the amazing Pro-Mode. TheRock Band-series has always been far ahead of the now defunct Guitar Hero-series, but with their third installment, they truly proved their worth; while Guitar Hero was becoming more and more childish and goofy (monsters, seriously?), Rock Band 3 is one to own; if you're new to music rhythm games, if you already have a mic, plastic guitars and drums, or if you're like me, a hardcore completionist always looking for a better score. The quality shines through from the get-go; the graphics are smoother and more detailed than the previous games, there are now gorgeous dreamscapes (similar toThe Beatles: Rock Band), and when you tilt that guitar or hit the overdrive/star power-button, your success meter will literally burst into flames. Fantastic. Another nice thing is that all the menus are based around your band; you'll see them prepare in the garage, drive to the show, set up their gear, all of it, and that really makes the experience more personal and immersive. Great touch!Overall it's been simplified to the core; jump into quickplay alone or with friends (browse, rate, sort your entire library of songs or create playlists), or complete the various road challenges to collect spades. The \"Career\"-option isn't actually what it sounds like, but a wonderful (and addictive!) list of mini-challenges (similar to achievements). Every instrument has its own set of challenges, and you'll gain new titles for them as you progress. Another menu lets you customize a band and your characters, and view all your stats and settings at any time with the start button. You can now switch your difficulty at any given moment, and every player has their own start-menu for full customization. Once you've got the details down, it's quick, fun and easy to do what matters; jump right into the music and start shredding. It's easy to tell that the game is made to suit those who already have huge DLC-libraries, as you can sort and browse them just about any way you wish. Completing the actual challenge mode won't take too long, it's the music, the party experience and the high scores that count.I'd unfortunately have to say the track list is the downside to the game, but that's subjective. All of the songs are not to my taste, but you can tell they were picked as a sort of \"music 101\" when people pick up the Pro Guitar to start practicing, and Harmonix have now landed just about every classic rock track in music history (save maybe \"Stairway To Heaven\"), which is awesome. If you dislike the main songs then the enormous, varied, and absolutely fantastic DLC makes up for that; you can download anything from Thin Lizzy to Lady Gaga and Slipknot, and playing through it in Rock Band makes for both an awesome party experience and a wonderful way to enjoy the music. There are a few more nitpicks to point out; you still cannot fully \"lock\" a character to an instrument (so even if you make a full band, the drummer won't always be playing drums), there is no \"orange\" button on the Pro-Guitar (so you can't browse through the menus, which means you have to spend a minute or two just scrolling back up to the top), I've experienced some glitchy sound from imported Rock Band 1-songs, and you have to buy a couple of songs in order to get all the achievements (boo!). But none of these complaints take away from the overall great experience Rock Band 3 is; it's really meant to be a huge fun music-world for karaoke diehards and completionists alike.I've bought thePro-Guitar, and it's quite the investment. If you use the Career-menu and go through the tutorials one at a time, it's for the most part well-explained, and won't take too long to get into. But make no mistake; there is no use buying it unless you have the money, the time and the patience to really commit to it, but I'd really recommend it if you're a wannabe-guitarist who lives alone and is unemployed! It's a great tool, not a guitar, but a challenge beyond that of any hardcore button-masher. Positioning your left hand isn't the tough part, it's plucking the exact right string that's the challenge! Sadly mine's now waiting for me in the corner, but I hope to pick it up again when I can spare it at least a few hours per day, because that's what it will take to get to that next little riff.Overall Rock Band 3 is an absolutely great game, even if it caters a bit more to the diehards than to the casual player. If you are willing to really make an investment in the music, I would wholeheartedly recommend it though; whether sitting down to rock through that favourite song one more time or joining your friends for a Friday-night karaoke-session, it's one small game with huge possibilities and literally endless replay value.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0050SVGU0","description":"Mario Party 9","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"One Last Party for the Wii","reviewText":"The Good:+The game goes much faster than previous Mario Party games+Simple mini-games to play, yet they're fun+The motion controls are put to better useThe Bad:-It's no fun to play by yourself-The music is forgettable-The luck factor is still thereWith Nintendo focusing their efforts on their next console, there isn't much left for Nintendo to really focus on with the Wii.  Mario Party takes its last bow on the Wii with Mario Party 9.  After so many installments it's a wonder if the mini-game compilation has any life left.  It still has some life.  Believe it or not, it has been five years since Mario Party 8 came out, and Mario Party 9 actually begins to make some departures from what has been standard.  This is probably a good thing, although the game still suffers from some of the same old problems that the franchise has had for a while now.  Depending on who you are, these issues are invisible after so long, or just more taxing.Right out the gate, there is already a huge difference in how the game progresses.  In the past each player individually traversed the game board in hopes of getting to a star.  Usually then they'd spend coins to buy said power star.  That changes here.  Instead of taking invidiual turns, every character sits in a car that traverses the game board together.  When it's your turn you are the \"captain\" of the vehicle and you'll take the rewards (and downsides) as you go along the map.  The mini-games are reserved for when you land on a \"versus\" marker.  This part is familiar.  And most of the mini-games, as you'd expect from Mario Party, are incredibly simplistic to learn.Most mini-games don't actually involve you using too many of the motion controls, but when you do they're implimented much better than in Mario Party 8.  In Mario Party 8 you had a lot of mini-games that, for the most part, just had you holding the Wii-Remote sideways and tilt it to the left or the right.  Here, there are a few more mini-games that require more than that.  In one, for instance, you use the Wii Remote to turn a dial on a chest.  In another you simply point and click.  Most of the time, however, you don't really use the motion controls at all and you hold the Wii Remote sideways like an NES controller and you play normally.The goal, however, isn't about collecting Power Stars like in previous Mario Party games.  If there's one thing that has changed drastically it is that you are now in direct competition for mini-stars.  They're rewarded as you move about the map.  They're rewarded for winning mini-games.  When all is said and done the one with the most mini-stars wins.  This also means that instead of going around in circles on a gameboard for the required number of turns, there is actually an end to the board.  And this is the other major change.  There are now midbosses and bosses to contend with.  You'll fight them as a team, while still competing for mini-stars (the one who performs the best gets more stars).  These are things that are all welcome changes for the most part.That's not to say Mario Party doesn't still suffer from... well... being Mario Party in some respects.  A lot of the game is based on luck.  Not that you ever really needed to use strategy in Mario Party to begin with, but it's still annoying that no matter how well you do in the mini games and whatnot, the end results could turn the tide in an instant.  There has always been this idea of luck playing an integral part.It probably goes without saying that Mario Party 9 is no fun by yourself.  The CPU will seemingly roll the die well at times, but then they'll perform horribly in the mini-games.  Even with the luck factor involved, the CPU is so horrible you'd have more of a challenge trying to lose than trying to win.  Mario Party has never been much for the single player experience and it shouldn't be.  Nintendo reinforces this rather well because the game is just no fun otherwise.  But this only makes the multiplayer experience stand out more.  You're likely to have fun with your friends.  Even with the luck factor involved.  The game goes faster, the mini games are more fun than Mario Party 8's and they're a lot less gimmicky.  Instead of tacking on the motion controls they try to impliment most of them in better ways.  This, of course, means the majority of the game doesn't have motion controls and that's not really such a bad thing.  In fact, it's one of the things that makes Mario Party 9 better.Mario Party has never been a game you show off because it has good graphics, it has almost always been about the gameplay.  The presentation here is no different, but it certainly does have a bit of a facelift.  A lot of its presentation in particular is inspired by Super Mario Galaxy.  It's actually not a bad looking game by any stretch and it's easy on the eyes.  It's not quite as good looking or as detailed as Super Mario Galaxy or many other games on the Wii, but that doesn't mean it's a bad looking one either.  Where it doesn't hit high is the music.  It's just all around forgettable music.  Mario Party is not exactly a game that stand outs because of its production values but rather because of its gameplay, and this particular entry is actually pretty strong in that department.For Mario Party fans, Mario Party 9 is probably the best release the series has seen in a long time.  The experience isn't too different, but at least some things were changed that actually benefitted the experience more so than detracting from it.  If you've never gotten into Mario Party the changes aren't enough to really make you look at it differently.  It's still the same core concept that it has always been, it's just done a little better here.  If, however, you're still interseted in Mario Party, then the ninth installment is the best we've seen from Mario Party in a while.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2012"}

I was fortunate to have received one from a seller whose previous owner tookgood care of it. The GBA SP can play GBA games, there so many great games to choose from.The GBA SP uses a lithium ion battery that charges in 2 hrs and can last up to 10hrs+ depending on the brightnesssetting. One downside to the GBA SP is that there's no headphone jack, but you can buy an adapter on Amazonthat will work nicely. If you're looking to buy one of these, be sure to ask the seller questions. Ask them if it's theAGS-101 model, condition, do all the buttons work good, back-light works well, battery holds a charge. If the sellerdoes not provide accurate info, look for another honest seller that will be happy to answer your questions.Don't be in a hurry to buy a GBA SP, shop around and get the best deal you can.

They have proven time and time again that no matter how much we boo and hoo each time they create a new entry with 100 some odd new Pokemon, no matter how much we vow tor rage quit because they are making our hard work obsolete, no matter how much we said \"that is IT!\" we always end up buying the new game anyway, and playing it to death. Not only that, they have now proven twice, once with FireRed and LeafGreen, and now with HeartGold and SoulSilver that they can make us buy a game we already bought a few ears ago by making it shinier and including a new peripheral. I'm not sure rather to rejoice or complain about that, to be honest.HeartGold and SoulSilver are Ds remakes of the original Gameboy and Gameboy Color Pokemon gold and Silver games. The graphics have been totally redone, and it has been made compatible with the 4th generation games as well. Of course, all the Pokemon introduced since then have also been included. These are honestly the best graphics in a hand held Pokemon game to date. It uses the isometric viewpoint on generation 4, but there are a couple or rendered cut scenes that are pretty cool as well. The in battle graphics are the same as usual. Flat sprites with a short animation when they first enter the battle.The story is the same as the original Gold and Silver. You are a trainer. You want to be the very best, like no one ever was. To catch them is your real test. To train them is your cause. You will travel across the land, searching far and wide. Teach Pokemon to understand the power that's inside. In the world of Pokemon, trainers battle their trained Pokemon for supremacy, and by defeating gym Leaders in officially sanctioned battles, trainers earn a badge. Badges serve as status symbols, and without all 8, trainers are not allowed to battle the elite 4 to claim the title of Champion. This is the main plot, but there is more however. Team Rocket is up to no good again, but they are just as dumb as always, equipping their recruits with such useful creatures as Zubats and Raticates.Though the majority of the original remains intact, a few things have been added or changed, but they are small things. Some of them are cool, like using the newer generation's PC systems. The first Pokemon in your party now follows you ala Pikachu in Pokemon Yellow, and I think it is pretty neat.When Nintendo remade the first generation for the Gameboy Advance, they included a small infrared wireless adapter, allowing players to battle and trade without a link cable. This remake, they included a new device called the Pokewalker. The Pokewalker is a small, pokeball shaped pedometer like device. using an infrared signal, you can transfer a Pokemon from your game onto it. as you walk, the you collect watts, which can be spent on various things within the device, which can then be transferred to the game with the Pokemon. The Pokemon also gains a bit of experience this way.Although I feel Pokemon has been going down hill for some time, HeartGold and SoulSilver are nostalgic romps for those of us that grew up in the series' golden age (pun unintended). In fact, the only thing more nostalgic that playing these remakes is playing the originals. Even if you've been out of touch with Pokemon for a while, if you played Gold and Silver, you should give the remakes a go.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2012"}

I lasted less than 10 minutes on my own before losing interest, but watched someone else play for under an hour.This game felt less like a real game with a real story to me, and more like a downloadable spin-off for people who just wanted to get together and blindly shoot zombies while waiting for the next inevitable zombie shooter.Since i did not last very long, there in no in-depth analysis on graphics, music, controls, etc. Just my humble opinion.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2012"}

Now I have never played the playstation version, so I can not compare the two, but this game was horrible.You start out in a small town, its being attacked by some evil family. So some chick turns you all to stone so you will not die, then she attacks this guy. All of a sudden your back in the huge building, and some guy says go on a quest. So you leave for no reason and have no info as to who you are, except you are part of the dragon clan. You go to the first town and you kill some dude in a castle. Now the king tells you \"You are awesome!\", and tells you to go to some town and find the quake control to stop the earthquakes. Not only was this task stupid, I do not even know why I did it, because I got no reward. Also, couldn't the king have sent his men to clear out the castle? So you go to the town at night and sneak in past the guards. Keep in mind you have not said one thing at all during the game. You kill a knight and turn off the quake control. Now you go back to the king and he says \"You rock again! I am too lazy to give you anything so your a hero, now leave!\". Then you go to some town and you learn the king is ill. So you play as Nina to go to some other place and get a remedy from a wizard. How did they know the wizard had a remedy? Then you get sent to help Nina kill him. Back at the castle, the king gets up and Nina says \"I am going with Ryu because I need to stop evil in the world\". So then you leave. Notice you have done 3 quests and got nothing but Nina.Not only do you have no info about who you are, you are given weird tasks that give you nothing in the end. I am still not sure anyone knows my name. This game is overrated. Also, there are too many random battles. You cannot walk 10 steps withouht having to fight some weak monster.

Working in the proximity of the palace, Leonard stumbles on a plot to kidnap the enigmatic Princess Cisna. As he helps her escape he also becomes aware of his connection to a transformative power which allows him to take on the ancient shape, and harness the devastating power of the White Knight. Yet there are other elements at work here as well, including the forces of an evil wizard with powers that stretch back to the same ancient times which produced the White Knight. With the help of his friends and the power of the White Knight, these are the forces that Leonard will have to face in his quests.GameplayWhite Knight Chroniclesis a Japanese RPG (JRPG) centered around a turn-based battle system in a local single player story-driven campaign that is supported by online multiplayer functionality. Gameplay questing occurs from a third-person perspective and follows Leonard and up to three other AI companions, which can include the customizable character that players assume in multiplayer mode. Once quest members are assembled, players utilize the strengths of the overall group as a whole, and are able to switch between characters at will. Combat being turn-based, players must be able to cue up and control the actions of each character in quick sequence for each combat scenario faced. The game facilitates this via the Function Palette, located in its Battle Preparation menu, allowing players to prepare in advance a series of commands for each character to carry out. These can involve magic or weapons use and can be merged into combos. Multiple palettes can be saved, making it possible to optimize actions for specific types of enemies, and making for quick changing of commands. As with any RPG, throughout quests players accumulate experience which allows their character to level up, purchase items and abilities and generally grow stronger with an eye towards besting the increasingly challenging creatures, bosses and situations faced.Online MultiplayerAlong with a compelling single player campaign,White Knight Chroniclesalso contains an exciting online multiplayer component. Within this, up to four players can engage in more than 50 multiplayer quests, with each player creating their own unique customizable character which can be leveled up in a combined group effort, and take advantage of created items and new skills. Although unique to the online game mode, which is designed for multiplayer action, these quests can also be played alone if players wish. In addition to this functionality available in the online multiplayer mode also includes a variety of ways to interact with the widerWhite Knight Chroniclescommunity on the PlayStation 3 platform. Included in this is town building through the Georama functionality, which allows players to construct a town to their own specifications that can be populated offline with characters from throughout the single player campaign and then taken online where it serves as a base for quests hosted by players, as well as a persistent online location that other players can visit and buy items your town's population has for sale. The game also offers an online interface known as GeoNet that allows players to communicate with others via blogs, forums, quest logs and voice chat functionality, as well as post snapshots from their journeys using the Crystal Camera in-game tool.Key Game FeaturesWhite Knight Transformation- During single player combat players can transform into the giant White Knight, gaining the ability to challenge large enemies as well as troops of soldiers throughout the adventure.The Customizable Avatar Character- Using a wide array of sliders and customization options, players are able to create a unique character that can join the adventure in single player mode as well as online.Combo Battle System- Engage in an accessible, active turn-based battle system that caters to players of all levels allowing both default attack settings and a system for for maximum damage.JRPG (Japanese RPG) Action for PS3- Experience true JRPG action on PS3 that incorporates a variety of online gameplay elements.Beautiful Environments- Players traverse through 13 stages, as well as visit up to six towns/villages to visit and purchase items at shops or interact with NPCs.

Not to say Capcom has had completely flawless run-ins with the press lately. Devil May Cry 4 had a great first half only to be marred by the entire first half literally played backwards by a different character. Or the really stellar Resident Evil 5 that everyone complained was exactly like Resident Evil 4 when other games are just like prior entries too. So when one hears of oddball game mechanics and approaches to their games in the reviews, you might be a bit hesitant to give Lost Planet 2 a try but this is a game where the reviewers are right in saying this isn't completely flawless but the low scores and negativity thrown at it seems a bit overdone and the best way to gauge whether this game is for you is just play it and see what you think. Stunning graphics, some great score and some of the biggest bosses you'll ever come across also comes with some screwy controls, a near pointless plot and not to mention a game that seems programmed specifically for co-op and you got the makings of a great game that's only good and worth playing but man, if only somebody looked at the bigger picture and said \"hey, wait a minute....what if we were to change...?\"Story: The story takes place on the planet E.D.N. III, a once-frozen planet completely covered in snow now largely changed in the 10 years since the adventures of Wayne and Co. in the first game. Instead of having one character go through the game chapter-hopping, they all involve different groups with different objectives that will come to a head near the end. What this means is that the story feels slightly inconsequential since you control nameless dudes who are trying to do something you're not quite sure yet against people you're not introduced to. However this also means some diversity in locations so you can hop from frozen tundras to thick jungles to deserts and back which makes up for the repetitive-but-pretty all snow environments of the first game.Graphics: Complain all you want about the games of Capcom but you can't argue against their graphic-making abilities which are pretty stellar. From Resident Evil 5 to Street Fighter IV to this, this company knows how to make some really impressive looking games and this game is no different. From the locales you'll see to the absolutely enormous bosses, the MT Framework engine that powers the game is quite a powerful one indeed. However there is some slowdown when things go boom a bit too big and on the train level which I'll get into later, I literally ran into a glitch where the shells required to load into the gun's cannon were floating in mid-air. But from a look standpoint, Lost Planet 2 certainly has the chops but it's not quite 100% smooth but it looks damn fine trying to get there.Sound/Music: When things aren't exploding so loudly that it completely drowns it out, the music in the game is appropriately epic, intense and nicely bombastic. Things get exciting really quickly and the music used reflects it and that main menu music which you'll be hearing a lot of, I'm sure, is catchy but not so it becomes grating after the 105th damn time. Sound effects are also nicely made from the screeches and roars of the Akrid to the gunfire of the different weaponry, this is a game for your surround sound system or some great headphones. The same can't be said for the voice acting which feels appropriately Capcom. Not as much emotion and dialogue choices read exactly as you'd expect them to: almost flat. Occasionally they'll do some good work in other games but it just feels really iffy here.Gameplay: Unlike games like say Halo 3, Borderlands, or Gears of War which can be played single player but the main bulk of fun comes in co-op, Lost Planet 2 in a way feels like it was designed specifically to be played with more than one person. And when you see the near brain-dead AI of your squadmates, it's easy to see why you need extra players. They barely shoot and half the time they stand there while you're running around trying to do the bulk of the work which makes the campaign feel really average but then you have some buddies and everything makes sense. Tactics come into play, players can be relegated to a specific weapon usage or task and strategies can be made more efficiently. Take for example Chapter 3-3 (the chapter nearly every reviewer has complained about, dubbing it the \"train level\"). In this chapter, you start off on a train traveling parallel to an enemy train so you can have one guy with a sniper rifle shooting guys from afar, one with a rocket launcher blowing up the turrets and enemy air support while a 3rd can carry a shield to soak up some damage and keep your other guys safe. Then there's the boss fight in which a huge sense of roles and tasks have to be laid out to each member: you're on a cannon which needs to be fired at weak points of probably the biggest boss you've ever seen. Those shells need to be loaded into the chamber, energized for quicker reloading and potentially given some help with a console that allows for quicker gun rotation. This is not done automatically and whoever is shooting has to rely on the other 3 to supply the shells, load them, energize them and help the rotation speed of the barrel or you're dead. And what if you take damage? Then you need someone to go below decks and activate the coolant systems which act as damage repairmen and gun cooldown. Not to mention there's gun turrets somebody can climb into to shoot down giant meteors or help shooting at the weak points. Think the AI will do all that on its own? Think again.But this co-op has some side effects. The game operates on a lobby system where you can find a game for a specific episode within a specific chapter and hope one of them says \"standing by\" because that means they're in the menus and haven't started yet. If their status is \"playing\" however, you have to wait till they're done before you can come in as there's no join in progress or drop in/drop out co-op in the game. Also co-op can have slight frustrations involving the Battle Gauge. When you activate data posts or accomplish objectives, you add some points to a battle gauge but points get deducted if someone dies. So nearly every death can be treated as a surefire way to get people to yell at you since you're the one who keeps dying and getting your whole team closer to a mission failure. As far as the competitive multiplayer is concerned, it's fun but some issues from campaign carry over. Getting shot puts you in a stun animation, leaving you unable to fire back, heal or do much of anything except rolling or hopefully throwing a grenade which kills the other player first. Unlike games like Call of Duty or Halo where one-on-ones were won by skill and accuracy and which gun you brought, this game feels more like ambush tactics: surprise attack someone and shoot them first before they can do anything. Also nearly every mode has what you'll be doing a lot of in the campaign which is dealing with data posts. In both campaign and multiplayer, these data posts act like spawn points but unlike other games where standing in the area started the capturing, you have to mash B against the data post which leaves you completely vulnerable to weaponry and grenades. This can of course allow players to wait till you try to activate it then kill you while you're completely defenseless. But the modes and gameplay are rarely seen in multiplayer now which makes it quite unique to other games where it's mainly FPS and somewhat familiar.Another gripe is how you unlock things. In a lot of multiplayer games, unlocks came through level progression: more you played, better toys you got to tinker with. In Lost Planet 2 on the other hand, some of that is unlocks while others have to be literally won from a slot machine. The more you collect those \"?\" boxes in campaign, the more points you add to your total which act as your \"quarters\" for the slot machine where you can win new weaponry, abilities that can alter how your character can behave in combat but mainly you'll be seeing emotes and \"noms de guerre\", in other words, nicknames. Emotes are done by pressing the Start button and either any D-pad direction or the shoulder buttons and they're strictly poses whereas noms de guerres are kind of like your callsigns but when you're being bested by players that have better weaponry or better abilities than you in multiplayer, it can be frustrating when all you keep unlocking are names.That being said, the gunfights and Akrid encounters can be incredibly intense, the multiplayer from the first game had a very strong community and that'll no doubt be translated here and the game's achievements and trophies feel designed to do one thing: make you play the game over and over. Level up the different factions to level 99, kill an insane amount of enemies, collect everything from the slot machine and play the chapters a whole bunch. This is one of the longest 1000/Platinums you'll find. The game is certainly not without its faults but avoiding the game altogether isn't really the way to go about it. Unless you're a diehard fan of the first or loved the demos in which case you most likely already played it or about to, give the game a try since everyone will react differently. Some of you will love it so much you won't mind playing the game for the next year or more while some others will think it's just way too flawed and backwards and not worth your trouble. I like it and I'd recommend but keep in mind this is a love-it-or-hate-it kind of game so I'm in the former camp so just have to see which camp you fall into.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2010"}

Our favorite game modes were team deathmatch and search and destroy. I just couldn't get enough of this game and really didn't play anything else the whole year untill COD 4 was released. This was just simply multiplayer greatness.The campaign was good as well and if I wasn't playing multiplayer with my friends I was playing the campaign over and over again. The campaign is just as good in this game as it was in COD 2 , and pretty much kept inline with historical facts. Of course over the years the games have evolved and are now completely fiction , as in completely made up and has nothing to do with anything remotely historical. That doesn't hurt the newer games and provides a different type of story and gameplay. But in every iteration there is a few steps forward and always a step back. None of the COD games are perfect but really they all have that certain something that allows you to have a great time with the game.This game is of course old ( 2006 ) but will still provide you with hours of enjoyment. My friends and I still pop this in from time to time just to play one of our favorites , because its good to get away from the modern games from time to time. There are still enough people playing this game to find a match online and experience this great game and it's multiplayer.Solid 5 out of 5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2014"}

And after every glitch, I would haul myself off the couch, restart my console, and enjoy another 3-4 hours of gaming nirvana. That's right, I don't care in the least that this game glitches more than any game I have ever owned. It doesn't matter that the graphics may actually look worse than Fallout 3's. It is irrelevant to me that on two separate occasions my auto save file was corrupted, forcing me to replay as much as 5 hours of gameplay. Fallout New Vegas is that much fun.For all of this games many technical faults, it is still one of my favorite gaming experiences, ever. The story is excellent and engaging. I found myself playing hours more than I had originally intended just so I could learn more about one of my many interesting companions. I lost even more hours promising myself that the hill that I was cresting in pursuit of the unknown was the last one for the day, knowing that I had to know what was beyond the next hill.There are hundreds of hours worth of gameplay in this game, and that is before you even get to the DLC. You will feel a connection to the character you make in this game that is hard to match because it isn't what you say that defines your experience in this game as much as it is what you do. Your gameplay experience will be unique to you, and the way the Mojave Wasteland reacts to your presence is up to you to decide. The freedom the game offers is staggering, and early on, almost overwhelming. The amount of replay value is almost frightening.If you can look past the dated graphics, constant glitches, and considerable load times, you will find one of the deepest and most rewarding gaming experiences you can find anywhere.

There is a one player driving game, that MAKES you look at the pad and steer with the pad. Now the TV graphics are rubbish but the pad graphics n this game would shame an 8 bit retro gamer. So you looking at the bad graphics on the pad and missing all the action on the screen. They could put what they like on the TV cause you never see it while you only use the pad. Sorry just don't get this game, really low quality graphics and game play. Should be free but no way the price they want for it.

{"product_name":"B000TT4GBG","reviewerName":"Matthew Ivester \"Power User\"","summary":"Great, but not perfect.","reviewText":"'Rock Band' is the latest music/rhythm game release by Harmonix, the original creators of the 'Guitar Hero' franchise (Guitar Hero 3 was actually done by a different company, but they changed very little).  Essentially, 'Rock Band' is Guitar Hero with the ability to play additional instruments (bass guitar and drums) and to sing along.  While there have been several earlier drumming games (the biggest being Konami's 'Beatmania', currently out only in Japan), this is the first US console release of such a game, and the only one to put together multiple types of instruments.  To put it bluntly -- this is, in my opinion, the best multiplayer music/rhythm game made to date.  By far.The meat of the game is the \"Band World Tour\" mode; this is a multiplayer career mode that allows you to progress from a small, local band to become international superstars.  You can create and customize your own band of gnarly musicians, including different animation styles (rock/punk/goth/metal) and an enormous variety of costumes, hair styles, tattoos, and makeup/face paint.  Tattoos and face paint can also be extensively customized, as well as your band's logo; the editing process is laborious, but very flexible.  Once you start playing, your band gains fans as you master harder performances, and has to unlock new modes of transportation (beat-up van, tour bus, plane, etc.) and various rock star perks (roadies!) to be able to access more tour stops.  Rock hard enough and you can wind up in the Hall of Fame!  Various events include not just playing single songs, but having to play preset, random, or customizable 'setlists' of multiple songs back-to-back, and various 'challenge' events that require you to play difficult songs at or above a certain difficulty level.Unfortunately, \"Band World Tour\" can only be played locally, and not online.  Online play is available (in the XBox 360 and Playstation 3 versions), but only in the \"Quickplay\" mode where you pick individual songs from a list and not the full career more.  Harmonix has said that it is unlikely that this will be added later; this will probably be the killer feature of 'Rock Band 2'.  There is ranked 1-on-1 matchmaking through XBox Live in a few different modes, but no way to have your whole band take on another one head(s)-to-head(s) (again, I would look for this in a sequel).One other caveat that deserves mention: In \"Band World Tour\" mode, you must have everyone in your band at least use \"Medium\" difficulty (the second of four settings) to progress more than about halfway through the game, and \"Hard\" difficulty (the second-hardest setting) to unlock a few of the challenge events and the last few arenas.  At \"Medium\" difficulty, most people will need to actually work at/practice the harder songs if they do not have earlier experience with Guitar Hero (or playing a drum kit in real life), and it may prove frustratingly difficult for little kids or particularly tone-deaf/rhythm-challenged players.  You are free to simply play the songs at any difficulty in \"Quickplay\" mode once they are unlocked in either the single-player or multiplayer career mode (there are also cheat codes to unlock all the songs right away).The single-player modes actually take a step back from Guitar Hero 3; there are no special challenges or deviations from the regular \"play through the songlist to unlock everything\" formula of Harmonix's earlier titles.  Clearly the main focus of the game is the multiplayer aspect (which, to be fair, is extremely well done).Underlying all that is an extremely fun and accessible rhythm game.  The basic gameplay is extremely similar to Guitar Hero (not a bad thing).  Players can individually select their difficulty level, ranging from \"Easy\" to \"Expert\".  Higher difficulties require hitting more notes, and much more complex patterns of notes and chords.  While playing, each instrument has a \"crowd meter\" that tracks how well you are doing; if you are not playing well, the meter will go down, and if it hits the bottom you will be booed off the stage!  Playing certain note phrases perfectly fills an \"energy meter\"; when the meter is more than 50% full, each instrument has a way to activate an \"Overdrive\" mode that gives a score multiplier and increases the crowd meter immensely (and if multiple players activate it simultaneously, the entire group gets an additional score multiplier).  Activating \"Overdrive\" also brings eliminated players back, although if they are booed off stage three times in total they are out for the rest of the song.  Some songs feature a \"Big Rock Ending\", where all the players can freestyle and play whatever they want for bonus points (but only if they stop freestyling at the right time and actually hit the last few notes of the song!)  A practice mode is available that lets you play individual sections of a song, and slow it down by up to 50%.Visually, the game looks great, especially on an HDTV.  The musicians are detailed and well-animated.  Close-up shots show individual strings being plucked on a bass, the guitarist rapidly changing their hand positions, or the drummer accurately hitting complex rhythms and fills, unlike the simplistic strumming of the characters in earlier Guitar Hero games.  The musicians interact (for instance, your singer might move next to the guitarist and they'll sing along together for a few bars), and have a wide variety of animations (including the singer occasionally crowd-surfing!)  The only real complaint is that in 4-player modes, the screen gets quite crowded, especially on a smaller television set.  This not only keeps the onlookers from seeing the awesome graphics, but can occasionally make it difficult to follow complex note patterns or to read the lyrics of a song.  On a large HDTV this is not an issue.The guitar/bass gameplay is almost identical to Guitar Hero 3 (although the guitar parts are frequently much easier).  If you have the new \"Fender Stratocaster\" guitar that comes in the Rock Band bundle, there are a few new features available.  There is a selectable effects switch that gives you various special effects during solos (such as echo, chorus, or wah-wah).  There is also a second set of fret buttons near the bottom of the controller's neck; during specified \"guitar solo\" sections you can play using these buttons and not need to actually use the strum bar (that is, you just tap the notes as they come up).  This helps immensely on some songs, although on others I found it easier to just play it normally.  A \"Lefty Mode\" is available that reverses the note positions on the screen, making it easier for a left-handed guitarist to follow along.  The new guitar is also more easily reversible to play lefty than the Guitar Hero 3 model.I have not played any other karaoke games, but the singing in Rock Band is a lot of fun.  A pitch track and lyrics scroll along the screen (or, alternatively, in a static 'follow the bouncing ball'-type setup); if you match the notes and timing closely you get more points and increase your crowd and energy meters.  You have to match the pitch of the vocal track, but you can sing in a higher or lower octave (good for those of us who can't match the vocal range of either Jon Bon Jovi or Kurt Cobain).  Activating \"Overdrive\" mode is done by singing/talking/yelling during specified \"freestyle sections\" where you can sing anything you want.  You can also adjust the volume of the in-game vocal track, as well as how loudly your singing is played through the speakers.  The easier difficulty settings are very forgiving on both pitch and timing, but you will need to be a fairly competent singer to clear most songs on Expert.  A handheld (wired) microphone is included in the bundle package, but any USB microphone (or an XBox Live wired/wireless headset) can be used.The newest addition to the console rhythm game market is drumming.  The bundle package includes a USB electronic drum kit, which consists of an adjustable base, four pads, and a foot pedal.  Similar to playing the guitar parts, a series of colored notes scroll from top to bottom, with each note corresponding to a different drum pad (an orange line across the scroll area indicates a hit on the foot pedal/kick drum).  For the most part, the leftmost pad is the snare drum, the second is the hi-hat, and the third and fourth are various toms and cymbals (the same pad will often make different sounds depending on the context of the song).  A \"Lefty Mode\" is available for southpaws, which reverses the pads and the screen display.  \"Overdrive\" mode is activated by playing a freestyle drum solo (at specific times) and hitting a crash cymbal at the end of the fill.  The drumming is -- while far from the difficulty of playing some of the real drum parts -- quite challenging, especially on the higher difficulty levels of very fast and complex songs.  The drum pads are sensitive, but do not always register hits near the edges (so you have to be more precise than when hitting a real tom or snare drum).The game features an extremely wide variety of musical genres, and a large number of songs (the full list can be seen at [...]  The game ships with about 60 tracks, and there are already more than a dozen released as downloadable extras, with more coming every week (albeit at a cost of around $1.50-$2 per track, which can add up quickly).  Harmonix has stated they will have at least one new track for download every week in 2008, as well as several full albums (the first of which will be 'Who's Next' by The Who.)  About 45 of the starter tracks are in the \"main setlist\", consisting of big-name artists, and another 15 or so are \"bonus tracks\" from up-and-coming bands.  All but a handful of the tracks are the original recordings; the rest are covers by Harmonix's studio musicians.While overall this is a fantastic game, there are a few drawbacks that prevent me from giving it a 5-star overall score:1) The single-player mode is somewhat lacking, and not having an online multiplayer career mode makes it difficult for some people to get to play that part of the game (since you have to get several people together at the same place at the same time).  You *can* play the multiplayer career mode \"solo\" if you are capable of both singing and playing the guitar/bass/drums simultaneously (a headset microphone or mic stand is all but required).2) Some of the menus and modes are confusing, and they made a few very odd design decisions.  First, all the instruments are 'live' in the menu screens even if you have a normal controller attached.  When we had a group of people playing the game and swapping in/out on instruments (and trying to show each other how to play), frequently we'd have problems because someone hitting the drum pads or practicing fingering/strumming on the guitar was moving the game in/out of various menu screens.  Another odd decision is the inability to change the 'leader' of a band once it is created (which is a problem because the 'leader' must be present for the band to play in career mode), and that individual characters cannot change instruments (although guitarists can play either guitar or bass per song).  None of these are dealbreakers, and they may be addressed via downloadable patches in the future, but it gives the impression that the game was rushed.3) There have been reported issues with reliability of the new guitar and drum kit (I have not had any problem with mine, but it seems to be enough of a problem to mention).  The design of the 'strum bar' on the new guitar was changed -- and while most people seem to like the performance of the new design, it also seems somewhat less resistant to abuse then the original Guitar Hero controllers.  Also, some people have reported problems with their drum kit where the pads stop responding reliably.  A few people have even managed to break the foot pedal(!), although I suspect that bad foot positioning and overzealous stomping are factors.  So far EA and Harmonix have been very good about replacing any broken hardware, and are supposedly tweaking the designs to improve reliability when the individual instruments are released.Overall, I would not hesitate to pick up Rock Band if you are fan of rhythm games, or if you are looking for an awesomely fun party game.  However, it is not as compelling a single-player experience, and the online multiplayer does not seem to be completely fleshed out.  But the single-player replay value is still extremely high (since you can play all the songs as a singer/drummer/guitarist, with increasing difficulty levels for each), and if Harmonix follows their downloadable content plans there will be a far larger song list in Rock Band than any of the Guitar Hero games.  Rock Band is the most ambitious rhythm game to date, and is clearly a milestone achievement for Harmonix.  I suspect a lot of people are going to unleash their inner rock star this holiday season, and few will be disappointed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00432O50W","description":"","reviewerName":"Maek","summary":"Deliciously fun...","reviewText":"I only recently came across the deliberately inappropriate world of Suda51 through LOLLIPOP CHAINSAW and after having thoroughly enjoyed that, I thought that I'd give SHADOWS OF THE DAMNED a try.If anything, I am enjoying Shadows Of The Damned even more.  Garcia Hotspur follows the traditional path of \"girlfriend stolen by something incredibly evil\" gameplay.  The twist, of course, comes in the gameplay elements.Garcia Hotspur is armed with the uproariously funny \"Johnson\" (yes, Suda51 went there...what do you expect?), a former demon who is a skull about the size of an apple and can transform himself into a pistol, torch, shotgun, etc. for your needs.  In order to rescue his girlfriend, Garcia heads into the Underworld to pursue Fleming, the Lord of Demons.  There, he not only battles demons, but he also has to contend with the force of Darkness which in addition to the absence of light becomes a visceral living entity of its own which wreaths demons in a protective cloak and also eats at Garcia's well-being.  Light becomes an important combative force, therefore, which comes in the form of goat heads that can be \"light shot\" with Johnson to illuminate areas, or Garcia can find barrels where demons have tried to contain light which act as an \"explosive\" when destroyed with a pistol.Some complain that Garcia already starts out with all his weapons and all that you do in the game is upgrade his basic skillset.  That is very, very true...but it makes sense considering that Garcia's background is that of a well-seasoned demon-hunter.  How else would he have survived thus long?  His upgrades are merely an extension of trying to survive the even more harsh environment of Hell itself.  Although the upgrade system is pretty basic, there are some subtle nuances (reload speed, ammo capacity, and damage) that will have you strategizing your next upgrade as enemies become tougher.As of for the actual gameplay itself, picture Resident Evil 4 except that Garcia can move and shoot at the same time.  It marries the survival horror concept with a combat system that's easier to swallow.  Also, being able to rapidly turn 180 degrees make the combat system all the more fluid and easier to use.  It's satisfying and I have not yet encountered any game gltiches with it.The interaction between Johnson (perfectly voiced by the British Greg Ellis) and Garcia (voiced by Steve Blum...you may know his work as Spike on Cowboy Bebop) is the best part of the game and their matter-of-fact banter throughout the game is fun to listen to and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny.  Being a Suda51 game, there are definitely cringe-worthy and eye-rolling-worthy moments of profanity and the double-entendres are emphasized so hard throughout the game that one can almost call them a SINGLE-entrendre (MST3K fans will get a laugh out of that).  You'll get to find out why demons love strawberries...and why \"*** the cherry\" may not be as simple a euphemism as you think.  Yes, Suda51's inappropriateness knows no bounds and as bad as it can be sometimes, it's still part of the fun and aimed dead center at those who will try to denounce games as the end of western civilization.Others may complain about the non-stop vulgarity.  First and foremost, this is a Suda51 game and if you don't know him by reputation then you will after this game.  If you're easily offended, stay away...Suda51 is not going to pull punches; he just enjoys games that every other major developer out there is afraid to make.  It puzzles me that game critics are so polarized by Suda51 because as much as they enjoy his games, they will then state something to the effect of the vulgarity quickly becoming old after awhile; it's almost as if critics are afraid to be lambasted by those who take offense to this kind of game. Their reviews reveal that they are somehow both entertained and affronted by it.  In the end, it all comes down to realizing that Suda51 is simply toying around with \"delicate sensibilities\"...if you don't tend toward these and are willing to acknowledge that Suda51 is doing it simply as tongue-in-cheek humor at those who DO take offense to it, you'll be ok.I'd give Shadows of the Damned a solid 4.5/5.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00432O50W","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Keegan \"Keegs\"","summary":"Fun, Creative Cheesy Written Story with Fitting Music","reviewText":"This game was a lot of fun. You play as Garcia Hotspur and your a demon hunter with a side kick (your gun) Johnson. With that said, there is a lot of mature content in the game that leads to dick jokes and such. It gets overboard but in a good way in a time when games are taken too much the serious route. Your whole objective is trying to save your girl Paula will gets mutilated throughout the game as you try to save her.The game has an interesting use like Alan Wake where you can't kill your enemies unless they are out of the darkness. You will use that same tactic but in the game your shooting a blast of light at the enemy and or at a goat's head that will bring lighten up a room. This has to be done throughout the game but as you do, you come across unique and different enemies. There are plenty of enemies that have their own strategy to defeat but in most cases (especially with bosses)they have an obvious weak spot. I would say my only frustration was when Paula is insane and chases you. It is a nice thing that keeps things fresh but she just needs to catch up with you, kiss you, and then your dead. There are different little moments but there is some great scenes and moments that really make the game standout as being creative and unique.Before I step further into other details, the shooting mechanic can be a bit challenging. It feels a bit floaty which will unnerve some but my time, you get used to it. The weapons you use will become upgradable by having unique abilities and you can use gems to make them more powerful, faster reload speed, and or hold more ammo. You can also use gems to increase your health bar.The game looks good but in its own style. I would compliment the music. It is very fitting and upbeat with some rock tunes that highlight your character's cheesy style. I would have to forewarn that there is a lot of cheesy lines in the game. It can be over the top but I think its done in a very entertaining way. As for a negative though, the game feels pretty short and can be beaten in 12 hours. I don't feel there is a lot of incentive to go back through a second time but if you want to get all trophies, they for some reason make you have to beat the game on every difficulty level to do so. You won't get the easy or normal trophy for beating it if you beat it on hard. Its a fun game though and its different than a lot of shooters. It has a lot of unique let gameplay moments that is fun to do. There is even side scrolling where you fly but they are not that great but it does help break things up for something different.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2011"}

There is frustration when you die and have to go back to collect your previously collected souls--especially if you die Again in trying to retrieve them thus losing them permanently--but because the game is such fun this takes little from playing the game. That concept really makes this game because you can't just load up and run through the game like it's Halo set on the easy difficulty. Any enemy can kill you at any time if you're not careful, but part of the fun is learning how to battle the different enemies.When making a character and choosing a 'gift' you should choose the Master Key which will allow you access to certain areas earlier on. But do NOT choose the Master Key if you choose to play a Their because the Theif automatically starts with one and two Master Keys are pointless.The MAIN thing that sucks but also adds to the game (depending on your playing style) is that once you reach a new place and finally can save, you want to explore the new area more, ONLY you know that if you do you might get killed, plus you have no idea what new and powerful enemies await you.Make sure if it's your first play-through to level up your Endurance a lot as it effects how much you can block before taking a hit, how long you can run before tiring, how much you can equip and still move, and the like. And leveling any attribute past 45 is pretty much useless as around 45-50 and up, depending on the attribute, the bonuses you receive become very small so you're basically wasting your souls if you think you'll max your strength out at 99 then tear through the game--which you won't.There are several spots to 'soul farm' but I'll let you look those up as detailing them here would entitle way too much describing.I love this game, already have Dark Souls 2 pre-ordered for my Xboix 360, and I highly recommend buying Dark Souls. It is truly one of the best, most fun games I have ever played. There is a sense of 'terror' every time you go to explore a new area for the first time knowing you might die at any second. This is NOT a game you can rent and finish over a weekend, however you can rent it to get a feel for it, though in such a short time you will not experience the true depth of playing this amazing game.Also, and i know i already said this, but this game has earned an unfair rating of super hard.

Sparx also serves as Spyro's health-o-meter, glowing gold when Spyro is healthy and turning dusky green as he tires. To boost his energy, Spryo can blast docile creatures with fire, turning them into butterflies, which Sparx transforms into much-needed fuel.This title has bright graphics in six well-developed worlds, each with several subworlds, including bogs, deserts, and ice worlds. Unlike some action games, inSpyro the Dragonthe enemies are more fun than frightening. In the Peace Keepers world, for example, Spyro must burn down the monster soldiers' tent, sending one of the minions running out, quaking with fear or, if you're lucky, dropping his drawers and shooting a moon.Spyro's movements (fire breathing, gliding, jumping, and climbing) require entry-level gaming skills.

{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S.

Shenmue is about a young man out for revenge to find his fathers murderer but theres WAY more too it, I won't spoil anything other then this game is flat out beautiful and should be played by gamers that won't wyn about the slow paced action..Like the title above, this is Yu Suzukies Masterpiece, the man worked EXTREAMLY hard on this amazing game(Shenmue is also known as one of the most expensive video games ever created).  Sadly Yu Suzukies hard worked game never made any good sales because of the PS2's launch, I like many others got it at the time it was first released, This game is just pure brilliance.  The visuals are some of the best seen in games...This may be the longest game review I've ever done so lets get to it..VisualsThis is one of the if not THEEEE best looking DC game ever made, everything is so detailed and the character models are great.  The building, the Atmoshpere, thank you so much Suzukie.Gameplayok this is probably the reason this game is the most hated/loved game ever created.  IT'S EXTREAMLY SLOW PACED, and may turn off some casual gamers but if you can hold on long enough the action will start to come up.  The game play is simple and easy to get use to very quickly.  The game plays like a mystery novel, ask people question and clues about something and when you find some clues you go ask other people that may know BUT THIS GAME PULLS IT OFF SO WELL IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY!  This game(plus Shenmue II) has THE best fighting engine ever!!!  It's taken straight out of the virtura Fighter games.  And the Free Battle sequences are extreamly rare yet very fun in the game.  Did I mention you can do almost everything in this game?  Well not everything but alot of things like getting a job, gambling and alot of the other things that can be done in real life...Sound/musicWhen I say this games music is beautiful IT IS, Ten times better then MGS 1.  Especially the main theme which you'll notice alot, it's amazing if theres one thing Yu Suzki did well(other then everything els) it's the music in this game, pure brillianceControllsI'm really lazy to get into this but there pretty goodLemmi just some it up right nowThe Good-Superb Visuals-Great Controls-Superb sound-Amazing Inviorments-Loads of things to do-AWESOME FIGHTING ENGINE-One of the most expensive games ever made-A beautiful story about vengence but with alot to itThe bad-action gamers will be turned off by how slow paced this game go's-For some long, for some a SHORT game, took me about 13 hours my first time but that's because I just did all the story parts and not the side quests-The sales for this and Shenmue II did so bad that we probably won't see a Shenmue III anytime soon-For anyone looking for a good challenge for this and Shenmue II, look elswere, it's pretty simple an pretty straight forward..-If you're looking for a unique game try GET THIS GAME, and get it quick because this as well as many other Dreamcast titles are very hard to find these days(and are already out of print and you'll be lucky if you find it used!)Other then that Shenmue is an instant classic with everything on the spot, Yu Suzukie created something more then a game....This game is not just good because it feels like you're acctually in that world and living Ryu'S life.....This is good because Yu Suzukie braught us something that just feels so real, and like as if there really is a world like that....acctually there is, JAPAN, duuhh, but still no other game has hit me or motivated to the point were I HAVE TO PLAY THIS GAME more then shenmue....This game is hands down...One of the greatest video game experiences you'll ever have......

Many levels have you progressing upward and you have the ability to leave one side of the screen and pop up at the other. It's a bit jarring at first but thankfully the controls are spot on.The gameplay has you traversing from hell to the clouds as a trapped angel named pit, armed with a bow and arrow you have to work your way up. Each section of the game is broken up into a few stages capped off with a dungeon and a boss at the end of it. My only real complaint is that the game begins throwing everything at you from the get go, most games slowly step up the difficulty but not here. In fact the game plays a bit like an action rpg where as you progress, you get stronger, therefore making the game much easier in the later stages. I suppose there's nothing wrong with that, it's just really odd.Kid Icarus is a truly classic nes game and it's shameful Pit still isn't featured in a new title besides Smash bros. This game comes with my full recommendation especially if you're the type that can tough through the steep difficulty in the beginning. Believe me, all the hard work pays off in the end. Seriously, the last level is a shooter stage and the game has like three different endings.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2010"}

The only fighting game I have liked since has been soul caliber for it's basic controls and slick graphics.When I heard SF4 was coming to next gen consoles I was excited. I got it the first day it came out and was brought back to my younger years. I consider myself a casual gamer but between this and Killzone 2 which I just purchased I find myself playing games a lot more than I used too.This game is meant to be played online since you have an infinite amount of matches right at your fingertips. Also there are no mini-games or different modes so this game is all about the competition. Playing online is fun but can be annoying since 80% of the time it seems like I'm fighting Ken who I refuse to use for online fighting.The characters are pretty even in the right hands anyone has a chance to win.Sound is great since it had been a while since I played a SF game it was great to hear all the sayings and they seem much more vivid this time around.Graphics take some getting used to but the character models and the fight intro animations are top notch as has been noted the anime cut scenes are bad. Also the impact animations are great eyes bug out and when a fireball hits it looks awesome.It takes skill to play this game I tore through the arcade mode and unlocked all characters except for Seth (didn't care about him) than when I went to play online was getting my butt kicked. There is a difference in being able to do the moves and knowing when to do the moves, which gives the game a lot of depth. I like to used Akuma and he has a very strong ultra combo but it can be easily dodged which is pretty much the same for most other characters so it has to be set up correctly or it will leave you open. Focus attacks also give the fighting a whole new element.Overall gave the game four stars since for 60 bucks I usually want more than just the straight forward-  ness of SF4 however the depth of fighting and each match posing a different challenge is great. I remember back in the day you usually played against the same group of friends and everybody had their own tendencies. Playing online removes this as you pretty much play someone new every time.If you want a great fighting game with depth that will take time to master purchase this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0012N5MIO","reviewerName":"Supreme Warrior","summary":"Street Fighter 4 is the best Capcom fighting game!!!","reviewText":"In my opinion, this is not only the best Street Fighter game but it is perhaps the best Capcom fighting game ever made and that is saying a lot because Capcom has probably made more fighting games than any other video game company (SNK is an exception). I think that this game is better than Street Fighter 2 because it improves on it in every way. It has 3D backgrounds and characters and 2D gameplay. You even have lots of spoken character diologue which is missing from any other street fighter game that I've ever played. I like the addition of EX Special moves which are actually pretty easy to pull off. Super combos are nothing new but the Ultra combos look very cool and powerful; this is one of the greatest new features that the game offers. The many different game modes are interesting, especially the versus mode. Versus Mode is a one player friendly mode because you don't need two people to play the mode. You can actually pick who you want to fight against at any time just like in Soul Calibur 4 versus mode. This is great for when you get tired of playing the arcade mode, don't have anybody to play with, or simply don't want to play it because of the final boss Seth. He can become a major headache and he is very cheap but still an interesting boss. He actually gets a lot harder if you manage to beat him in a round. In the next round after you beat him he has a whole new more powerful moves list so anybody playing against him better be careful. The Trial mode can also be hard because many of the moves that you have to do are hard to pull off with the standard controller. Custom configuration is a great thing that was added to this game and it makes some moves easier to do. Street Fighter 3, Street Fighter Alpha games, Marvel vs. Capcom games and Capcom vs. SNK games have nothing on SF4 either. This is defenantly one of the best fighting games of the current consoles.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2009"}

I think it makes more sense just to have the blades with elemental upgrades then to have four different weapons and I liked the other side weapons as well. I experienced three to four weird glitches during my gameplay that kept this from being my favorite in the series.1. When the bridge collapses in chapter 5 u have to pull a pillar down. The white dot didnt appear for me so I had to start chapter five all over. This is a common glitch.2. At the part where you repair the chain and you fight amongst a bunch of eggs, an enemy got stuck offscreen and I had to restart cuz I couldnt advance.3. When u first get the slow mo amulet you fight enemies in a place. I used the amulet as the gates went up and the gates went right back down. Infinitely spawning enemies occured. I could have gotten thousands of orbs here. I left after getting 6000.There were a few other small things with sound cutting out etc. I loved this game. And the glitches I didnt mind was just surprised because they made 5 games previously with very few problems like this (I never experienced any at least in any of the previous games like this). Maybe they will get fixed. It wouldnt bother me if they didnt they were small in number would have just made my first two playthroughs more enjoyable.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2014"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"For nostalgia's sake alone","reviewText":"Mario's first appearance on the GBA came with the first Super Mario Advance game, which is an updated port of Super Mario Bros. 2 for the original Nintendo console.  For those that don't know, Super Mario Bros. 2 was a departure from the classic, standard setting original game, as Mario now pulled radishes out of the ground to hurl at enemies among other changes (the reason behind these is because the original Super Mario Bros. 2 was deemed too difficult when originally developed, so another in-development game got a Mario facelift and was released as Super Mario 2 here in the states, while the other Mario sequel would see somewhat of a release as Super Mario All-Stars on the Lost Levels segment), but despite it all, the game still offered some solid platforming action and fun.  Choosing to play as Mario, Luigi, Toad, or Princess Peach; you hurl radishes and other items at enemies, look for secrets, and more besides.  The game is pretty simple to get into, and the graphics and sound have been updated for the GBA, but there are some flaws.  The controls aren't as tight as we've seen on Mario games before and after this, and there are moments where the game really doesn't feel like a Mario game (and it's really not, for reasons mentioned above), but despite it's flaws, the first Super Mario Advance is a fun diversion, even though it is the weakest of the four Super Mario Advance games that came out for the GBA over it's lifespan.  All in all, if you're still looking to get some quality, triple-A titles for your GBA before it completely bites the dust, here's one to pick up if you haven't already.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2007"}

I read so much hype that the game couldn't help but to be a let-down after I was so pumped for how cool it sounded.But the fact is Black & White is a fairly shallow, albeit interesting and fun, PC video game.The game starts out interestingly enough with you learning the various, basic functions of the game and building up the abilities of your creature.  This is the fun part actually, in that you see everything for the first time and the creature AI is something to behold for the first several hours.  The graphics aren't too shabby either and the world is immersive and life-like, including a nice weather system integrated with your local forecast through the internet.Eventually the game comes down to doing a couple of things; making scaffolds for buildings and dropping food in the villager food bins.Sure there's more to the game, but the vast majority of your time will be spent doing those two monotous, repetitive tasks.  The side quests can be fun and interesting, but many of them are completely unintuitive and silly.What makes things worse is that your creature is either disabled or not in your posession for too much of the story - which consists of all of 5 different, similar-looking maps.  And the story itself is completely uninteresting and seems to be second to the game's mechanics.Black & White is fun for the first 15-25 hours, but beyond that it gets repetitive, monotonous and stale.

Those looking for a game with speed to match the hardware should add this racer to their list of Xbox must-haves.","reviewerName":"Big Daniel McFoot","summary":"Anyone who considers themselves a car fan should buy this!!!","reviewText":"The Xbox has been on store shelves (and in my living room) for two-and-a-half months. During that time I have played some of the best games I've seen in my long tenure as a video game guru, including Star Wars: Obi-Wan, Halo and, Amped. Being distracted by such wonderful examples of gaming genius, like the ones above, and about a half dozen others, my wandering Blockbuster eye always passed over Project Gotham Racing. Boy, was that a mistake.Now that I've had a good 7 days behind the wheel of PGR, I can honestly say that it is my favorite car racing game to date. PGR combines the best aspects of Gran Turismo 3 (PS2) with the pure fun of Beatle Adventure Racing, the underappreciated racing game for the N64.Like GT3, the graphics, gameplay, and physics are excellent. In fact, graphically speaking, PGR edges out GT3 due mainly to the attention to detail. The way the light reflects off of your shiny silver Audi TT makes you drool as your highly polished windshield glistens in the sun. You watch as your driver (yes, there is actually a person in the car in PGR), leans with the turns and takes his hand off the wheel to shift, a nice touch if you ask me.Gameplay is well thought out and highly customizable. There are six main racing options, three of which I'll talk about: Quick Race, Arcade, and Kudos Challenge. No, the latter isn't sponsored by an early player in the energy bar market, Kudos is a point system. You earn Kudos as bonuses for placing in certain races, pulling off stylish moves, or just generally kicking butt. In order to progress and earn new cars, you have to race in each of the 3 modes. The Quick Race mode pits you against 5 other cars in a classic battle for 3rd, 2nd, or 1st. You progress through various cities and try to get at least a bronze to advance from say NYC to SanFran. The Arcade mode is purely for Kudos. Yes, you have to get very good at going through cones and pulling off cool slides and 360s to earn at least a bronze. The Kudos Challenge is my favorite mode. You work your way through an array of different races including the good ol' me vs. 5 other cars, one on one, overtake challenge (pass \"x\" number of cars before time runs out), speed challenge, and several other creative and challenging ways of putting your driving skills to the test.The Kudos point system is very customizable. By raising or lowering the difficulty level for each race you determine how many Kudos will be awarded. The more difficulty, the higher the reward and vice versa. Getting that bronze medal is not necessarily dependent on whether you place 3rd, but how many Kudos you have earned. It may be a little confusing, but just think of it as a great way to keep score.Despite the warning to the contrary, driving in real life like you drive in PGR will, in fact, probably work for you because the physics and feel of the game is phenomenal. You almost feel a couple of Gs as you blast around a corner doing 75 in a Nissan Skyline GTR. The controller only adds to the complete immersion in this game. Not only does it vibrate in sync with whatever you're doing, but the weight of the controller itself gives you the feel that you're controlling something with power. I don't know how this game would feel with a puny GameCube controller in my hand. You almost need the size to harness the power. Speaking of the controller, the default button and control layout leaves a little to be desired, so I switched it up a little and made the trigger buttons be my up and down shift and \"A\" my gas. This works well enough except for the fact that my right thumb is red and shiny from constantly pushing on the \"A\" button. I know, I know, I could use the right analog stick for that, but I'm just not that type of guy.Unlike GT3, this game is not so big that you get lost in it. There are not hundreds of cars with a plethora of confusing upgrades that you'd have to be an auto mechanic or listen to an absurd amount of \"Car Talk\" to understand. It's very straightforward: win this circuit...get new car. Beautiful. New car faster, now must go back to Quick Race and see if I can win that damn London race. See, it's completely manageable, thus giving it that feel of Beatle Adventure Racing. Pure fun.Let's not forget that PGR is soundtrack enabled which means you can listen to your own CDs that you've put on your Xbox. I can't tell you how nice it is to have my personal playlist of 80+ songs. Oh...cool feature, Radio DJ's announce your music and break in on your songs with contest winners and request hotlines.I hope you get the feeling that this is a well thought out and highly polished game because it is. And all that thought has helped make Project Gotham Racing the best combination possible: both fun and challenging.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2003"}

All of that said, Hotel Dusk blows every other adventure game I've ever played out of the water. It is my firm belief that Hotel Dusk is the greatest adventure game ever made, and I have played dozens upon dozens of them in my life to contrast against.Sure Hotel Dusk has excellent graphics, music, controls, etc. the fundamentals are all there and accounted for. And the plot is highly decent as well, no doubt about that. But what really sets Hotel Dusk above the rest of its ilk, are its characters. Hotel Dusk's characters seem utterly alive and believable as real people. When you converse with them, you feel like you're talking to a real person, not a video game character. Because of this, you will develop true attachment and sentiment for the characters of Kyle Hyde's world. Every single character in the game has multiple dimensions to their personality and will change over the course of the game's plot.All of that said, if you don't have much patience for dialogue and you don't like to read a lot, this is not the game for you. Hotel Dusk has a very slow and methodical pace, it is in no hurry to show you all of its secrets or let you discover its biggest mystery in any quick fashion. However, if you are a gamer with lots of patience, your investment will be massively rewarded by this enchanting and melancholy experience.(Also please note that Hotel Dusk got a DS sequel called &#34;Last Window: The Secret of Cape West&#34;, if you want to continue the story.)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2013"}

Very enjoyable to those who are patient.","reviewText":"Being a Sims fan since The Sims Bustin' Out, and eventually going back to the first Sims (both on the console btw) I then moved onto The Sims 2 on the PC, and I cannot even remember how many hours I put into that game! Then I realized that The Sims 3 was being released in February 2009, which later got delayed to June 2009. I picked it up as soon as I could and spent the 10 dollar credit provided in the box, for a some in game items. Sure the game has its ups and downs but I guess it all comes to down to personal preference. I absolutely loved the freedom in Sims 3 and every now and then, I will fire up The Sims 3 and check on the first house I played on in Sunset Valley. Even when I switched PCs and lost all my data, I would still go back and make a family in that one house just because I liked the feel of it. I guess I loved all the experiences that came with this game; The ghosts, reviving families, chances to get the Grim Reaper in your family, random events, and of course the wacky experiences within the whole neighborhood.And you know you cannot have a Sims game without the addition of expansions! I personally never purchased expansions, but I did try them out at a friend's house a couple of times. I never thought it was worth the money, but it did add a couple more things to do in game, as well as furniture, neighborhoods and etc. depending on the expansion pack. If I had to pick, it would have to be the Supernatural expansion or the Future expansion.One more thing: I highly suggest you do not invest your money on the Sims 3 for the consoles. They have removed the wonders of splitscreen, and have made it slightly more difficult to play.

I have never seen such a creative game that has so much to offer.  This was my first night playing the game and I am hooked.  This game is so much fun I played it for about 6 hours straight.  The levels are amazing and so full of character.  You can unlock tons of upgrades to customize your sackboy or sackgirl.  There are also free downloads on the Playstation network for this game from time to time.  The game is exciting with so much to explore and tons of vehicles and rides like mine cars, skateboards, roller coasters, ferris wheels, bumper cars, spaceships, submarines and so much more.  Your kids will love it!!!  I am 29 and I love the game.  Plus you can create your own levels and even host them online for others to play.  It is a little complicated to create levels but the tutorials do a good job of explaining it.  You can also play with and against others online and even chat with them.  If you own the playstation eye you can upload your own pics and add them to the levels for a truly personalized experience.  I have uploaded several screen shots so you can get a better idea what the game is like.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2008"}

Despite my gripes with it, I just cannot give this game less than 5 stars.  It is overall an awesome game and remains one of my favorites on the PS3.  I won't reiterate the superlatives other reviewers have described, suffice to say I agree with just about all of them regarding graphics, combat gameplay, sound design and so forth.  Rather, my issues with the game could basically be applied to nearly every game of this generation, as well as sequels to games of earlier generations.  These can be essentially boiled down to two issues, which are likely interrelated:Game LengthI try not to be an hourglass watcher when playing a game, but given it is a question every developer is asked just previous to the release of games, it must be an important issue for many gamers.  I am not sure how it is that the \"gold standard\" of this generation's single player experience has become 8 to 12 hours, but it has.  I cannot think of a single game which does not conform to an RPG, sandbox and/or open world style that clocks in longer (for me MGS 4 does not count, nor any game that artificially lengthens a game with cutscenes to such a drastic level).  GOW 3 is no exception, which is disappointing considering the lengthy campaign of its predecessors.  It comes in right where I suppose it should for a game of this gen at about 10 hours.  Given, it is 10 hours of awesome, but it still felt a bit abrupt to me, even more so on my second playthrough.  It seems it's all about style over substance to some degree, where devs are saying, \"Sure it's short but look how pretty!\"  I remember so many of my favorite games on the PS2 being 15 to 20 hours or even more.  Provided that consoles, games and even peripherals get more expensive each generation, it is in my opinion a shame that single player campaigns are giving us less gameplay for our dollar.Less Variation in GameplayApparently, many of this generation of gamers doesn't care much for puzzles, platforming, or pretty much anything that takes the player away for very long from shooting, slashing and/or punching straight through a constant gauntlet of enemies.  I only say that because this is how developers are approaching third person adventure as a whole these days.  As an old adventure gamer, I appreciated these elements that are slowly being incredibly dumbed down or lost completely.  GOW 3 does have some puzzle elements, but for me they were not nearly as rich or engaging as the other two games, particularly GOW 2.  In addition, level design in GOW 3 was really not too varied and necessitated re-tracing one's steps to the point where it felt I was playing through basically three huge levels.These issues notwithstanding, GOW 3 is an incredible game and I wholeheartedly recommend it, even though GOW 2 remains my favorite of the three. It's opening sequence alone is probably the most visually stunning I've ever seen on any platform  and really shows what a next gen game should look like.  If you enjoyed the first two games, then surely you've already played GOW 3.  But for those of you who haven't and love a good third person challenge, go out and get this game and the GOW Collection as well, you almost surely won't be sorry!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000ZKDOV2","reviewerName":"D. K. Malone","summary":"Way less \"thuggy\" than expected","reviewText":"Up until last year, I had zero interest in this sort of game, i.e. open-world/sandbox/gangster/crime whatever. GTA turned me off, and Saints Row seemed like a bad joke, a GTA rip-off tailor made strictly for lame urban gangsta thug wannabes. My idea of the typical Saints Row fan was basically Jesse from Breaking Bad. \"Yo yo yo wear ma homiez at beeotch?\" Ugh. Well, last year I finally let my guard down and played all of the GTAs from 3 on, and I ended up really loving them. Right when I was at the height of my new found fandom, the first big official Saints Row The Third game play video hit, and I thought it looked pretty damn fun. I had no intention of buying or playing it, but just the fact that I thought it looked good at all is pretty mind blowing. I resisted for as long as I could, but about a month ago I decided that I had to play it. In my typical anal retentive MO, I insisted on playing Saints Row 1 and 2 first. I completed SR1 in a about a week, and it was pretty much what I expected: a soulless GTA San Andreas rip-off with the \"wackiness\" factor turned up to 11. In the end I had to admit it was actually pretty fun. Then I moved on to Saints Row 2.Right out of the gate, I noticed major improvements over SR1, and I was damn impressed. SR1 was very rough and almost seemed unfinished in certain ways. SR2, on the other hand, is extremely polished with excellent production values. It's almost as if SR1 was a beta test, and SR2 is the true Saints Row 1. I was glad to see that the main character was an actual *character* this time around, with plenty of a dialogue and a cool, cocky personality. (I always like it when a developer finally comes to the obvious realization that the 'silent protagonist' approach has outlived its usefulness and needs to die. See also: Visceral Games' Dead Space series.) When I play GTA, I generally focus on the missions and do them methodically one at a time. I've always had the impression that most GTA fans tend to not care too much for the missions and just go straight for the cheat codes so they can cause as much mayhem as possible. Saints Row basically caters to that sort of player and is designed such that there is a point to said mayhem. I have to admit, it's a lot of fun. And thankfully the \"YO YO YO WASSUUUUUUUUP **GGA\" gangsta thug crap is surprisingly toned down. It's closer to standard action flick fare, actually. That alone is a huge plus in my book. I know I'm setting the bar pretty low here. All in all, even with the boost in quality, Saints Row is still merely a GTA wannabe. If I had to chose, I'd take GTA IV over SR2 in a heartbeat.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2012"}

It's still a portable powerhouse and it's just as expensive as a DSi(if not cheaper), so the only reason I'd recommend against buying it now is the advent of the next generation of handhelds.The 16:9 widescreen display is really easy on the eyes, it's the first piece of tech I've used that isn't just standard resolution and it makes me want to change that with every TV and monitor I own. The resolution's as high as it needs to be with a screen this large(4.3 inches), and there are five brightness settings for the PSP; sadly, the highest setting can only be used when the thing is plugged into an outlet and one of those settings is \"off\" mode, totally lightless screen. It's very important to buy screen protectors for the PSP since it doesn't utilize the folding design of the DS or 3DS, so luckily screen protectors for the thing are usually cheap. It's still a hassle I'd rather not have to deal with, though; I wish there was a good slide-able faceplate for the PSP. Oh yes, and I have something that looks like lint under my screen near the very center and to the left a little; I don't know if it's the screen protector's fault somehow but it's definitely underneath the screen, I don't have any dead pixels on my PSP screen but this is worse than a few dead pixels could possibly be. It damages the experience a little, but most people probably won't have this issue.The power button is on the right side of the system, it can dig into your palm if you really press it against the system but overall it's not much of an issue... unless you accidentally move the thing upward and either put your system to sleep or turn it off. If you flick the power slide upward a little it puts the system into sleep mode, if you hold it for a few seconds it turns it off completely. It takes around five seconds for the PSP to boot up, and navigating the XMB could be easier, but overall I prefer it to the DSi/3DS application browser.The battery lasts a little longer than the 3DS and just about as long as my 2004 DS system, but it's really not an issue even on the brightest setting if you've been a handheld gamer for years and don't mind plugging your system into a power outlet once a day or two. You can buy an extended life battery for the PSP but they tend to cost $20, I'd only buy a separate battery for my PSP if my current battery got weak enough with subsequent charges that it lasts less than two hours after a full charge.The analog stick of the PSP is vastly inferior to the slide pad of the 3DS or the dual analog sticks of the Vita, but it still gets the job done and after hours of use I'm sure you'll get used to it. The thing's as precise as can be but it isn't as effortless to use as the 3DS' slide pad or any modern console's analog sticks. Luckily, the placement of the analog stick keeps the d-pad placement comfortable, but some people don't like how low it is and apparently get cramps; not an issue with me, even after a ten-hour PSP session. The L and R buttons haven't messed up on me yet(my GBA SP and DS shoulder buttons didn't work after a few years of pocket storage) and they feel really comfortable, the face buttons feel nice(though I don't like when games require that you press the X button over and over again to attack; I'm looking at you here, FF7+8+9, Crisis Core and Birth by Sleep) but with regular use you leave little scratches on the buttons and exterior of the system; not THAT big a problem, but still a problem nonetheless. Under the face buttons it feels like an analog stick is totally missing. I'm sure they could've made room in the system for another analog nub, but aiming with the face buttons in Peace Walker and Resistance Retribution can be accurate if you adjust to it(almost every shot I fire in Peace Walker is a headshot, and I never use auto-aim- though that is an option). I'd say the lack of a second analog stick is my biggest gripe with the PSP, it's the reason I waited over half a decade to get one. I always wanted to see a developer make a game that has you hold the PSP upside-down, aim with the analog nub, move with the face buttons and fire with your palms, just so that they could be the only people to ever do it(to be honest I've just wanted to try that control scheme out since before the PSP released, I thought it'd be so awesome).The game library of the PSP kinda sucked for the first few years, but these last two years it's grown to rival that of the DS in a few regards; it loses out on classic RPGs and platformers but the PSP has the best 3D action titles and action-RPGs(courtesy Square Enix). Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep, Dissidia: Final Fantasy, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, Modnation Racers, LittleBigPlanet and Crisis Core are all experiences that really can't be done on the DS without major concessions in quality or design.If you're willing to ignore the PSN outage(it's not a problem anymore and the Welcome Back games were totally worth it) you'll find that it has a wonderful online store for movies, comics and, most importantly, games. You can rent movies for a few days, buy a license to download and keep them whenever you want, and you can buy tons of popular comics from Marvel, DC and Archie Comics; sadly there are few comic collections, if any at all, and you have to buy comics individually. The game selection on PSN is nice and the pricing is decent, but UMDs tend to be much cheaper, there's a MUCH bigger selection of UMDs than digital downloads on PSN and UMDs don't take up memory stick space(more on that later). There's a sales section hidden in the \"New Releases\" section of the store, but the sales themselves aren't too impressive; once a week or two they change the titles on sale and there are usually around ten titles on sale at once. The selection of PS1 games is better than I could have imagined before getting a PSP, I didn't actually know the PSP could run PS1 games until I got the thing. I consider the PS1 collection the biggest selling point of the PSP, if you like older titles. Lots of PS1 titles are $6, none cost over $10 and every time the sales list changes another PS1 game is half-off(Resident Evil 2 for $3? Don't mind if I do~). Downloading media is a bit of a pain, sadly, since you can't play games during downloads and the download periods are usually longer than they should be. After you download a game or movie you don't have to worry about doing it again, if you have enough storage space on your memory stick.Speaking of storage, the PSP supports memory stick pro duo cards, proprietary of Sony. Memory stick micros are much cheaper than pro duos and you can buy an adapter for the PSP, so go that route if you can. For only $20 I bought a 16 GB memory stick micro and a pro duo adapter along with it, and I don't have any complaints about it besides that it ends up being 14 GB when you use it. I have around five PS1 games, five PSN games and a few game installations(for Dissidia, Birth by Sleep and Peace Walker) on my 14 GB of space, and I have 7 GB left. That's enough for a few albums of music and a few seasons of the Justice League Unlimited or Batman: The Animated Series, to put that into perspective. You'll want a USB cord for your PSP if you want the best media experience on your PSP, that'll run you between $10 and $20.I think that if you're on a budget this is the best handheld system for attractive gaming and media on the go, the library of games should be enough to tide you over long enough for a price drop on either of the next-gen handhelds and the UMD format is such a weird little novelty that you might wanna experience it before it goes the way of the VHS. The PSP is also a great way for a Nintendo fanboy like myself to look across the pond and see what Sony's doing, it's always good to try out each side of a console war if you can afford it and-full circle, people!- this thing's totally affordable compared to its competition. I recommend the PSP highly.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2011"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E1JS","description":"","reviewerName":"Michael Pappalardo","summary":"Like a Phoenix From the Ashes...Mortal Kombat Rises Again!","reviewText":"Face it folks...any true Mortal Kombat fan that's been around since MK was eating our allowances in the Arcades will tell you that the series' venture into the realm of 3D was an utter disaster.  While not necessarily horrible games, if you look in my reviews you'll see how strongly I felt about Deadly Alliance and Deception.  I didn't even bother writing about Armageddon (what I call Mortal Kombat Trilogy 2), since I didn't feel it necessary to review a game I just plain despised.  On the contrary, MK vs. DCU, which was arguably the best of the 3d games, I never got a chance to review, but I felt the most positive about it out of any of the most recent MK titles.  So with the franchise mired in mud and a laughing stock to the fighting game genre (consisting primarily of snobby Street Fight/Tekken elitists), how does the new Mortal Kombat hold up?This is the greatest Mortal Kombat since MK2...and possibly the greatest MK ever.  Like the proverbial phoenix rising from the ashes, Mortal Kombat takes the familiarity of the 2D formula that we loved in the first few generations and rebuilds it.  Taking a cue from the roaring success of Street Fighter 4, Mortal Kombat made good use of the resurgence of the 2D fighting genre and offered up the fastest, smoothest and most entertaining and playable Mortal Kombat experience in 15 years.  Coming in hot off the Midway bankruptcy, the franchise has been purchased by WB and the Mortal Kombat development team has formed its own development company called Netherealm Studios in Chicago, under the WB umbrella.  Despite the rivers of whiney tears cried in protest to MK vs DCU's T rating and lack of gore, the WB partnership was forged early on.  In short, the dissolution of the ultra mediocre Midway, former king of half-assed and rushed games, was the best thing that ever happened to Mortal Kombat.The StoryThis game has been called a reboot and a reimagining...I suppose both could be considered true.  The story begins with Dark Raiden and Shao Kahn squaring off at the end of Armageddon...every other warrior strewn dead across the battlefield, Dark Raiden, still fighting for the preservation of Earthrealm and mortals despite his \"evil\" turn, fights desperately against the empowered Shao Kahn.  As Kahn prepares to deliver the killing blow, Dark Raiden uses the last of his power to deliver a desperate message to his past self...right in time for the Mortal Kombat tournament from the first game.  Raiden receives the message as scattered visions and premonitions, and does his best to steer the outcome of the tournament in favor of Earthrealm to prevent Armageddon.Easily the most fleshed out story mode of ANY fighting game, the story consists of chapters which usually consist of roughly 4 - 5 battles with each player controlled character as the focus of the chapter.  The entire roster is not playable during this time, as it is primarily from the standpoint of the heroes, but you will run into every character.  With Raiden's new premonitions, the story delivers shocking surprises and different outcomes, making the entire Mortal Kombat 1 - 3 storyline a whole new experience.  For example, some characters will have entirely different fates, some may even die...I recall the first true death of a character in the story mode to be utterly shocking for me...I was literally paralyzed with horrified shock when it happened!The GameFluid combat controls and fast paced action make this the Mortal Kombat we've needed in over a decade.  The 3D iterations were slow, sluggish and ultimately felt broken.  This revival of 2D combat brings us back to the way MK used to be.  Players are able to design their own combos, though the standard pre-determined combos do still exist.  The good thing is that you do not have to over-rely on them to be good at the game...some of the best players barely use combos.  Each character has their own unique fighting styles and signature special moves.  New to the game is a super meter that allows you to perform enhanced special moves, combo breakers, or the dreaded new X-Ray move...a vicious, brutal attack that causes immense damage and shows the brutality being done to the opponent via an x-ray look at their body, which shows the severity internal damage being done at the time.Fatalities make a glorious return...after the rivers of tears cried by those who just couldn't bear the T-rated fatalities in MK v DCU (which had probably the most CREATIVE fatalities of the 3D Mortal Kombats), this MK returns everything to its ultra bloody glory.  Fatalities have never been so brutal, and go to extremes not seen in previous games (such as disembowlment).  Noob Saibot in particular has one of the most cringe-worthy fatalities.  Each character has 2 Fatalities, a Pit Fatality input and Babality...yes, Babalities are back, but comical enough to actually enjoy doing once in a while.  Even bosses have their own unique, brutal fatalities and X-ray moves.  The best part is that the fatalities are added to a pause menu move list once you do them...completely eliminating the need to refer to a useless strategy guide!  Some characters have a 3rd fatality as well, available for DLC...which is another huge perk of this game.At the time of this writing, 2 DLC characters have already been released, as well as classic style skins for half the roster.  These DLC characters aren't your typical \"let's rush out more content to the game\" characters, but are fleshed out with their own unique moves, styles, fatalities and stories.  There are at least 2 more DLC characters planned for the rest of the summer of 2011, and who knows what may be available beyond then?  Unlike previous Mortal Kombats, this game is already getting tons of support in terms of updates and DLC, something Midway never bothered with, or could never afford.  The Design Team truly has been blessed to receive the backing of WB.The ExtrasIt wouldn't be MK without Extras, and this MK packs a TON!  Most notable is the Challenge Tower, a series of 300 challenges that test the player's skill, but more often than not tests your patience and frustration thresholds.  Many of these challenges are simple...others are ridiculously hard.  It adds tremendous replay to the game, even if the \"Major Reward\" that was highly hyped and touted before release is ultimately a major disappointment.  Regardless, it adds life to the game and is the best way to earn \"Kurrency\" for use in the \"Krypt\".  The Krypt works much like it has since Deadly Alliance, offering players a chance to get some extras in the game.  Unfortunately, this is easily the most lackluster Krypt yet - other than alternate costumes and fatality command inputs, there is nothing at all useful in the Krypt.  Eveything else is concept art...something I looked at maybe once, and will probably never bother looking at again.In addition to Story Mode, there is the standard Arcade mode, but the real treat comes in the form of 2 on 2, a tag match system that adds a lot of life to the game!  This can be done with up to 4 players, making party gameplay a ton of fun, as well as allowing you to team up with your buddy against online opponents.  There is also Test Your Luck, a fun little mode that adds a variety of random modifiers to a match.DesignThe game is GORGEOUS.  Arenas come to life like never before.  Remember how boring the rooftop and street levels were in MK3?  No longer!  Now in the street, you have a gigantic monster attacking the city, being repelled by the military as vicious winged beasts chase down helicopters and evade missile attacks.  All the while, cars dart around your characters, trying to escape the carnage and terror of Shao Kahn's invasion of earth.  On the rooftop, aerial battles between Dragons and Helicopters light up the sky, and in the evening variant of the level, a tremendous Dragon lord perches atop a far off building, laying claim to the city.  The little details like that, plus the various Day/Night variants of each level keep the game interesting.Characters look better than ever, and all have their own unique voices and pre-match intros.  Some characters are completely overhauled...Ermac looks more like a Sorcerer rather than a ninja, which is a great look for him, while Johnny Cage sports some new tattoos or a nice, sharp suit.  Arguably my favorite additions to the game are the human variations of Cyrax and Sektor, who are not just alternate skins...these variations of everyone's favortie robots actually have their own animations, voices and movements...they perform special moves and fatalities completely differently than their robotic variants, and they are a great addition to the game.  Other characters, such as Sub-Zero, sport the same old familiar look with minimal changes.The VerdictHonestly, I couldn't be happier with this Mortal Kombat.  The series has done nothing but disappoint for over a decade, and became a laughing stock to the fighting game genre enthusiasts.  Well, take this iteration and eat it, naysayers...Mortal Kombat is back.  The WB merger was the best thing to ever happen to this series, and the amount of support and the attention to detail that went into this game alone shows how much the MK team has been itching to really let loose and deliver a great game.  If you are new to the series, if you walked away from it in disappointment in previous years, or if you are just curious, check it out!  Otherwise, MK fans...this is the MK we've been waiting for...the MK we've all DESERVED...for over a decade.Pros:Return to 2D gameplayReturn to the dark, bloody roots of the series - bloodiest fatalities ever!Rich, full story mode that delivers many shocks and surprises - for the first time in the history of MK, people actually...DIEBeautiful character and environment design - some of the most interesting characters in the genreChallenge Tower, 2 v 2 and other bonus modes add tons of longevityFrequent, high quality DLC support - a FIRST for the MK seriesCons:Characters can be overpowered in hands of AI, but next to useless in the hands of a playerSome character imbalances plague the game - Kung Lao, for exampleSurprising lack of stage fatalities - Bell Tower, Wastelands, Armory were discussed as stage fatalities but never implementedSome fatalities still too stupid or out of place for characters - Shang Tsung's Dancing Clown, for exampleDisappointing Challenge Tower reward, lack of anything worthwhile in KryptSome characters lack alternate costumesAs you can see, the Pros outweight he Cons, but there are still some serious Cons.  Regardless, this is the greatest MK since the fist generation.  What are you waiting for?  Let the Tournament begin!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2011"}

I have been playing it ever since and I must say that I am COMPLETELY addicted to it. I am a Level 47 and I'm around 90 hours into it. My game has frozen up on me about 4 times and it seems to be completely random as the first freeze happened about 8 hours into it. A couple of times, I have played for over 6 hours straight with no issues at all. Again, my game has only frozen up on me about 4 times after 90 hours of gameplay. I save quite often so I just simply reloaded the game and my last save and go on my merry way.One thing I want to mention is that I am not connected to the Playstation Network so I have not downloaded any of the patches yet, and I don't plan on doing so. I haven't really come across any glitches either, so as I stated in my title, I guess I'm one of the lucky ones (so far). After reading many of the reviews for this game, it's kind of hard for me to say run right out and buy it because I have no issues, but it seems like many people do, and that's unfortunate.With that said, this game is by far the best game I have ever played! I've been playing games since the days of Atari 2600 with Pitfall, Berzerk, and Outlaw. I've never been so engrossed with a game before, and my wife is getting tired of hearing me talk about it! You can do just about anything in this game. And what I think is so cool about it, is that every person who plays Skyrim, has a completely different character that they created, and they can play the game anyway they want to. I have seen YouTube videos of quests that I have yet to even come across at a Level 47, but the people playing them are at Level 8. Everybody plays completely different.This is my first PS3 game and first RPG and I already cannot wait to complete this game and restart with a completely different character. If there is another Elder Scrolls game, I will gladly be first in line. I just hope I'm as lucky with that one as I am with this one.Good luck!UPDATE...........So after 200 hours of game play and a 19MB save file, my game started to lag so much, that it was becoming frustratingly unplayable. So, I decided to connect to my internet and download the latest 1.05 patch. I was also notified to update my PS3 system as well. So I did both. My save file dropped to 15MB and the game play is just like it was when I first started playing it. No lag issues at all!!! Saving and loading takes about 15 seconds now, and I have gone another 35 hours (235 total) after downloading the patch with no issues whatsoever. I am soooooo glad I got that patch because now I can't stop playing it!! If you haven't downloaded the latest patch for this game, then it's an absolute must!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2012"}

Don't think I've seen anything like this before. Nope, not perfect, but pretty incredible. First off, it takes a while to get used to the whole concept. Folks who wrote a review after playing it for only an hour didn't see enough as usual.Second, looks like you can play this thing for months, and almost never repeat yourself. It is totally open ended, a huge landscape to play in, almost boundless (in the spirit of FarCry, but much much more)The whole thing takes getting used to. The weapons, the weight system, the health approach, the copious amount of bad guys who just never stop coming. LOTS of subtleties. This is not an overt shooter like HL2, Doom etc. This is a whole world in which to live, breath and survive.Yep, its a little buggy. But the devs seem on it as the first patch showed up within weeks of release and definitely made a difference. For such an ambitious piece of software, I can see why it took so long to finish and test, and why there would be bugs first time out. There is so much interwoven complexity, I'm blown away. The dynamic interaction between all the elements in the game world are almost real.The \"AI\" are pretty awesome, with each one having a strategy it seems. Some are dumb, and just do repetitive things, but others sneak up behind you and blow you away. Really cool!!

{"product_name":"B001CMIUYS","reviewerName":"Michigoon \"tech geek\"","summary":"Disappointing","reviewText":"I used to love Final Fantasy. I played 1-6, and loved them all. Final Fantasy 3/6 is one of my favorite games of all time. But personally, for 7 and beyond, I kind of fell off the boat. I never really liked the transition to 3d, especially because it heralded the introduction of the hour-long cutscene. I got very tired of watching movies instead of playing games, and I never really got back on board from these experiences. Hard-up for a good JRPG, I decided I'd try my best to give 13 a go. Square/Enix has had a while to refine the formula, so maybe things would be different.The good:-The graphics are shiny. I won't quite agree with people claiming this is the best-looking game ever, but it's a good-looking game. The game employs a now-common trick where you see much more graphically rich character models while adventuring or in cutscenes, then much lower-quality models in the actual battles. Since I only care about the battles, I see pretty standard graphics for a current game.-Sazh has a chocobo in his afro. It's pretty cute / funny.The bad:-Er, everything else.This game is only as challenging as you want it to be. In battle, you shift between Paradigms, which are basically scripts for the characters. Everything happens so fast that direct control should only be used for micromanagement, so the majority of the time you're just shifting paradigms and watching the results play out (which does not make me happy). Theoretically, you could just use a healing Paradigm all the time and only attack while you're buffed out, to win every battle with little or no challenge. The game tries to balance this by having a reward system that basically gives you more XP for finishing battles faster. However, if you max out your ratings all the time, you will often hit arbitrary level caps which are set throughout the game and are only released as you progress in the story. So really, there's a lot of room to play things conservative, which really defeats the purpose of the ratings system, and you can get really lazy on the ratings if you're going to grind and do side-quests. Speaking of which...Yes, this is Final Fantasy on rails. There is no world map, there basically aren't any towns, and because your levels will max out at various points there's not that much motivation to finish off sidequests. Except that they made gil(money) a little more rare to encourage you to put up with the bother if you want to assemble the best items. The illusion of choice is just so transparent. You only ever have one place to go, and everything else along the way is only there for completionists. Instead of crawling towns to find a store, there's one floating box you'll find appearing throughout every level that's a magical save point / store / options menu rolled into one. They might as well have just had autosaving checkpoints and let you purchase items at any time.So basically, you have to make your own fun. You can shift paradigms, you can manually control characters, you can grind all the sidequests... and you'll have hit the current level cap ten hours ago and just built up a wealth of XP that will mean you have the exact same problem even faster on the next chapter.And the story? For all the millions of dollars spent on animation and voice acting, there's really nothing there. Yes, technically, there's an incredibly complicated backstory and tons of development- everyone in the game rambles on for thirty minutes at a time in cutscenes, so plenty gets said. However, since there's no world map, you never have to worry about where you're going next. Since you're often going to be at max level, there's no need to worry about who you're fighting. Since all you're really doing is going from point A to point B in the meantime, with no real choices to make other how much you feel like grinding, there's no reason to worry about why you're fighting. Cutscenes for me boiled down to waiting for Sazh's Chocobo appear, which didn't happen nearly often enough to balance out all the rambling.So overall, it's just a very mediocre game weighed down by overly long cutscenes. It's pretty, but it's shallow. There's tens of hours of gameplay to be had, but you never really have any reason to care about any of it. Except the baby chocobo. And then only because it's cute.The puzzling:-Orange and blue. There's been a trend in marketing in recent years where it's been discovered that the colors orange and blue have the most visual contrast, and therefore the most impact on viewers. Go ahead and try to find a single minute in this game where the colors orange and blue aren't onscreen together- I dare you.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0002CHJAA","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Genius followed by boredom","reviewText":"If you enjoyed the first Xenosaga and are as curious about the story and where it was headed as I was, then go out and buy this right now.The story in Xenosaga II answers a lot of the questsion and issues raised in the first Xenosaga involving Jr., Albedo and Gaignan. In fact, their story compromises the first 1/2 or so of the game. However, their story is immensely interesting and their conflict is very important to the current struggle. This makes the game very interesting as it raises new questions and digs a little deeper into some subtle religious moments. As an example and THIS IS A SPOILER: look at the color of Rubedo, Albedo and Negrido's hair and look up on the internet (try Wikipedia, I found the information there particularly useful) the four horsemen of the Apocalypse. You will find some very interesting connections. I would also recommend taking some character's names (Canaan, Nephilim, as an example) and do some searching.The game also continues the first's of using Friedrich Nietzche's works of philosphy to shape the current story (particularly his idea of not looking at things in the dichotomy of good and evil, black and white, heaven and hell, etc). Overall, the story in Episode II is at least as good if not better (I'm torn at the moment) than the first game. It is exciting, the cutscenes are well directed, and the plot moves quickly.Which brings me to the title of my review. While the plot is great and continues the Xenosaga tradition, the gameplay is worse than the original. The gameplay is made up for cutscenes and dungeons (with a very very seldom trip to Miltia or the Kukai foundation, and the ships). The dungeons are long and boring, filled with mind-numbing puzzles that involve pushing boxes, setting water levels, making sure bomb detonation flares stike at the same time, going down the right \"light path,\" etc etc. They have all been done before and frankly they are boring.The battles are equally long and boring. Each enemy has a hit zone that is connected to the buttons of the PS2 controller. You have to figure out which areas will \"break\" the opponent's defenses, then boost other characters right after to actually do substantial damage. While interesting on paper, the game takes it too far. When each battle becomes a game of stocking your character's moves, building up a boost bar, then unleashing combos on an enemy, it becomes boring and redundant. It's just used too much and often. Every battle became a struggle of this. I can see merit in having to do it with big important boss battles, but fighting the same white drone over and over and having to do the same zone hits just so I can hit him? Some normal battles took upwards of 10 minutes to complete. That is rare, granted, but these aren't boss battles I'm talking about.Another huge change is that every character learns the same skills. This is a double edged sword for me. On one hand, you're entire group can learn cure spells which eliminates the need to have a \"healer, fighter, mage\" combo all the time. However, it also means that all characters are alike. The only way they differ is by \"double\" attacks and their own regular attacks. As it is, the best strategy in the latter half of the game was to have all of the \"tank\" characters in a group because they could take damage while stocking their turns.Another interesting change was that there are no shops. You don't buy weapon upgrades and you don't buy healing items. The only items you get are dropped from creatures or found in the environment. Because there is no need to buy items, you hardly need to go to towns, and the game becomes a dungeon crawl, albeit one with an extraordinary story.Along with the greatness of the cutscenes and the boredom of the game play comes the music. The musical director of the first game is gone replaced by two directors: one for the cutscenes and one for the game play. The cutscene director has some really excellent songs and some forgetable songs. Overall not as good as the previous director, IMO. The gameplay director's music is horrible; it's jazzy, j-pop that is very very incongrous with what's happening the in the game. You don't want to be creeping around some huge evil base while elevator music is playing in the background...The Gear battles...er...AGWS battles...er....ES Battles are much better and more utilized in this game than the last. It more closely represents Xenogears. It's a welcome change. In fact, because you don't have to stock your turns just to do damage (though it is an option for doing some neat attacks), the ES battles play better than the on foot battles.Finally, the length. Apparently people took 40-60 hours beating Xenosaga I. I took 35 and mostly got everything I needed. It took me about 23-25 hours to beat Xenosaga II. I was shocked when at the 9 hour mark I was flipping to the second disk.Overall, this is a 4 star game. The cutscenes (presented in 5.1 if you have the ability to run it) are superbly directed and have a wonderful sound quality. The voice work is really well done (except for MOMO, I liked her voice from the first game), and they are usually filled with eye candy. The plot is excellent, with wonderful pacing, it makes you want to know what's going to happen next and see how it all ties together. It doesn't tie up all loose ends and the third Xenosaga will probably feature the same cast. The gameplay is a bore. I longed for the cutscenes. I really hope they 1) make the gameplay more fun or 2) make the series into an anime series (which they've done with the first episode) in the future. So, my rating is a 3 for the fun, but the story (5 star) pulls it up to an overall of a 4.If the original Xenosaga left you wanting so much more, then you should definitely buy this game (especially from a website that still offers the preorder bonus, a VERY awesome dvd that has 4.5 hours of cutscenes from the first game). If you're looking for fun gameplay, this game, unfortunately does not do it for me.Please know that for every bad quality I've mentioned in the game, I really really enjoyed it from a story view. My friends and I have spent a lot of time discussing it outside of playing because it really is a rich game. I really wanted to give it the 5 star review. Unfortunately, it's a game, not a movie and I have to review it as such.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0050SWVIQ","description":"","reviewerName":"The Rev \"one chill guy\"","summary":"A horrible final game to end a great start....","reviewText":"My quick review the DS series, DS1: A really creepy, good atmospheric setting that made for really good horror that had a great story to accompany. DS2: Not as creepy and atmospheric, not as scary, predictable encounters, ok story that wasn't as good. DS3: Creepy atmospheric setting? Mostly no. Scary? Definitely not. Story? Even worse than 2. Over the top action annoying frustrating encounters w/ way more shooting and CoD action? YUP! It's like developers from Visceral Games have been slowly leaving as the series has been going farther and farther away from the 1st, or DS may just be another game that succumbed to the greedy and terrible publisher ea. To summarize DS3 I'd say that it caters to the lowest common denominator of gamers, casual CoD/action shooter buyers, throwing out everything that made the DS1 a great game and instead turning on its head in a bad way.Story:The DS story was pretty good, the twist at the end is interesting, but the lame and just seemingly fake sub-romantic plot between Ellie (from DS2), Isaac, and Ellie's bf, just seemed fake and forced, I can't really imagine after DS2 and Isaac going into hiding and them never seeing each other and then suddenly fall in love, or at least have a relationship stronger than friendship that causes Ellies bf to get pissy at Isaac, which end ups just getting kind of annoying. This romantic sub-plot after a while just ends up being a somewhat cliche and sexist \"damsel in distress\" storyline, finally, just to add to what I didn't like about it, this romantic plot is also pretty predictable, killing off any chance of the story being any good.Gameplay:This is the part that I really disliked the most about this game. I LOVED the creepy atmospheric setting in which you were isolated and fighting off Necromorphs that made for really good horror. What do I not like about DS3? It takes what I just talked about and destroys all of it, no creepy atmosphere, no horror, way too much shooting and interactive action cutscenes, horribly done and frustrating ice climbing scenes, boss battles were bad and frustrating that lacked info on what to do and mostly consisted of running around a middle object shooting tentacles, the 2nd battle w/ the same boss alien was just get to it into the targeting zone so harpoon guns could shoot it, which is the definition of a badly designed boss fight that obviously had no creativity put behind it, good amount of boring backtracking through levels, a good amount of bugs (enemies getting stuck, Isaac melee'ing when not pressing button, screen goes black but music plays during final run to the final boss), and I'll talk about the encounters in a little bit.Some of the parts when you have to kill the Unitologists felt almost like any other third-person shooter, then when you were having to take on Necromorphs, encounters got really annoying and just old, towards the end of the game I was hoping to not fight Necromorphs not because they would scare me like in the 1st but because of how annoying they got. When you did have to fight Necromorphs you seriously got way overwhelmed, like Necromorphs would just be piling on top of you and I was literally spamming the trigger just to shoot bodies while you were stuck in a corner, what used to make DS fun turned into what I really disliked about DS3, I don't even know how you could play a survival game on a harder difficulty w/ so many enemies just crowding you. There are new enemies, but I actually really disliked all of them, too hard and annoying to kill, way too slow morphing that only made it more annoying to kill, and the new tar black enemies were terribly annoying because they were way too hard to kill. They introduced a new type of ammunition called \"universal ammo\", which simply, only takes away from the really fun and well designed survival aspect of DS 1. Now with universal ammo you have ammo for everything, like a well made survival game you have to be careful of how much ammo you use and when you run out, you run out until you find more, but in DS3, none of your guns run out (maybe once or twice when I got swarmed by a lot of Necormorphs), there's plenty of ammo scattered around like what again... like every other general shooter.Talking about guns, another part they changed for the worse in DS3 was the absence of customizable weapons, no more power nodes to choose how to upgrade your weapon, instead you get circuit upgrades that give you for example +2 damage +1 reload, taking away the true customizability that the first 2 DS's had. Yes, there is customizability in crafting weapons and upgrades but I found the weapons you could craft weren't nearly as good as a couple of the weapons you could build from blueprints (most weren't even all that good themselves..). Another step down in guns from DS1,2 was how you had 4 weapons but now you only get 2 in DS3. There still are suit upgrades, but unlike how it was in the first 2 DS's new suits gave you upgrades in armor and inventory, but suits in DS3 are just for looks, I loved getting a new suit in earlier DS's because it was exciting to get a new suit w/ upgrades, in DS3 it's not nearly as exciting.I actually rented this game so I wasn't able to play the co-op w/out paying for an online pass, but I watched enough footage and read enough about it that I can informatively say that co-op only just destroys this game further, it takes out even more of the fear and makes it even more into just another shooter. Yes, it is kind of interesting at first to see your partner deal w/ hallucinations but it gets old after a while when you ask, \"Hey, what's going on? Another hallucination?\" \"Yea, another one...\" \"oh.. *uch* hurry up *while standing there watching partner*\".Overall:So I know this was a long review, but there was so much I didn't like about this game that just made me say this game is terrible. Some people call this disgrace to the series innovation, yes there are new things, but it did nothing but destroy what made DS1 great. Some of these people even say they're true fans but, if you've played the first and loved it for the horror survival and great story, you'll find this game terrible like I did. It's DS: CoD, as I said before it's made for the lowest common denominator of gamers, and as ea's Frank Gibeau stated they wanted to open this up to a broader audience, and they did exactly that while killing off the true DS experience. There were a couple of parts I did really like about this game though, the graphics were incredible, some of the best I've seen on the 360, sound was incredible too, I also enjoyed space walking over the planet and the alien planet scenery was really well done as well, and of course, I found out how it all ended. Even if this wasn't a DS game, I'd still call it a bad game, too many frustrating just awful parts that were poorly designed, and an ok story to top it off. So if you're looking for a DS game w/ way more action, or any game w/ action and shooting, I'd suggest renting it, maybe you'll like it more than I did, definitely not buy as it's not really a game you want to play through again, but honestly my recommendation if you're like me and love DS1 for what it is I suggest NOT playing this, it'll ruin what you thought was a great series and instead just watch gameplay/Let's Play off youtube, or read the story off the wiki and start at chapter 14 as you're not really missing much story wise before.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00BRQN2EM","description":"","reviewerName":"Thomas Riccardi","summary":"The best of the series!","reviewText":"Open world games have become commonplace as of lately giving you an entire world to explore and play in. From games such as the Grand Theft Auto series which are more grittier and down to earth to the off the wall Saints Row series which seem to be getting more and more extreme with each release. Now the folks over at Deep Silver have released their latest installment in the Saints Row universe but are you willing to go back to Steelport or should you just pass this one by?The game starts off with you being elected as president of the United States (yes you heard that right). As you find the transition from leading a gang to leading a country much more difficult an alien race called the Zin Empire decides to invade earth. Rushing your way through the White House you fight off the alien invaders but to no avail as you are abducted as well with your friends aboard their ship. You're now in a virtual world of Steelport and you need to figure out not only how you're going to navigate this new world but how to escape as well.Being in this virtual world has it's advantages as you now have an array of superpowers at your disposal to dispatch your enemies. From flight and super speed to an ability called buff (which causes all rounds to be incendiary rounds) you will never be at a disadvantage with these new superpowers under your belt. There are new weapons as well and one of the more unique ones has to be the black hole gun. This gun does exactly as it sounds creating a small black hole that sucks in everything around it and then explodes. There are going to be also countless ways that you can customize your character such as with the previous Saint's Row games. Various costumes and accessories as well as modifications to your character and weapons will also be available to you. The outfits from the previous Saint's Row game seem to be making a comeback as you can dress up as Uncle Sam or as a furry mascot as well.With a new storyline, great upgrades , superpowers, over the top weapons and  more customization options than ever Saint's Row IV looks to be an excellent action based open world game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00008KTVC","reviewerName":"MurphysLaw","summary":"Should have been better...","reviewText":"As a fan of the show, I will probably be a bit more kind to this game than it actually deserves.  The storyline is decent and there are many direct references to the show.  You certainly can't complain about the voice talent as the original characters were on board for this game, not only Mulder and Scully but also the Lone Gunmen, Skinner, Krychek, CSM, Marita, and even Kersh.  There are quite a few nods to the show itself, everything from the black oil that posed a threat throughout the series to posters in the video store (which is also named after an episode), to street names.  A nice touch that will be recognized by fans.  Mulder and Scully have separate but intersecting storylines so you get to play two games for the price of one.  Both are immersing and character-related.  The story is surprisingly addictive and once you get caught up, you'll put it down for probably only one reason,which leads me to...The bad points of the game are extremely hard to overlook.  This feels like a very early (like original playstation early) Resident Evil.  The characters, while having a likeness to the actor seem clunky and clumsy. Somewhere along the line, Mulder became cross-eyed and Scully apparently had breast implants. The controls of the game are HORRENDOUS.  I don't care how much you play it, you never really get used to it and will probably spend a good bit of time running around in circles while something attacks you.  The camera angles are an issue throughout and the \"X\" icon, which cues the discovery of items is so sensitive that if you aren't in the exact right spot, you'll miss it completely.  The auto-aiming feature of the game is beyond annoying and half the time you completely miss the target even though it is literally right in front of you.  The puzzle solving aspect of the game could be quite irritating I suppose, search for a door, search for a key, go back to the beginning of the level to find the door again, combine three or four items in your inventory to create something that you can actually use, etc. but I am willing to overlook that as it is typical of these types of games.  What I can't overlook is the HUGE number of glitches in the game. The FMV don't play half the time and some of the cut scenes actually start skipping or the screen just turns black.  Even if you do see it, it's likely that you won't have any volume.  Nothing like watching Scully spout off for five minutes without being able to hear a word.  Hope it wasn't anything important...oh she's gone now, guess they decided to split up. I never did get to see the ending of the game.So bottom line, the storyline is good and ties in well to the show.  Fans of the show are treated to many references that would be missed by non-fans.  The music and voice talent are excellent and the game effectively captures the mood of the show.  The two separate but intertwined storylines of Mulder and Scully make it the equivalent of two short games in one and both are good.  The controls however are hideous and quite frankly, unforgivable.  Why you are not able to run when you have both the gun and flashlight equipped is beyond me and I'm not even bringing up the camera angles again.  The FMV cut scenes are glitchy and won't play half the time.  The same is true of the bonus features that you unlock.  The extras are actually quite disappointing.  B-Rolls (of everyone in the show except Mulder and Scully), teasers, art work and story boards.  Overall, the game could have been good but the mechanics are so bad that they drag this game down to the clearance bin.  If you are a die-hard fan, then you'll probably still want it.  Otherwise, get something that won't make you want to fling the controller across the room.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2006"}

Starvation, betrayal, heartbreak and more will challenge you as you attempt to survive in the world of The Walking Dead.","reviewerName":"Annihilatrix1138","summary":"\"The dead don't kill their own...\"","reviewText":"I bought the first couple episodes of THE WALKING DEAD on a whim, being a fan of the show only at the time. Though the price was right, in the back of my mind I was still wondering if it was going to turn out to be just another cash-in of a popular franchise, or even if I'd warm up to its \"point and click\" format, with which I had absolutely no experience. All of my skepticism was washed away by the end of the first episode. I've played many, many RPGs that tout choice and consequence, moral dilemmas, etc., only to offer up the superficial good reaction/bad reaction with everything else proceeding as normal. THE WALKING DEAD gives new meaning to the concept of choice in video games, dealing with mature situations that few developers would even think about touching. And this is only the first season.You play as Lee Everett, a former professor on his way to prison in the back of a police car. He's been convicted of murder, and would've gone away for a very long time had the infection not complicated things. Taking shelter from the undead, he meets a young girl named Clementine who has been surviving on her own for several days. The pair make an alliance of circumstance and set out into a world ravaged by the the walking dead. Along the way, they meet up with more groups of survivors - emotional baggage and all - while trying to stay one step ahead of the undead (and, in some cases, the living) and keeping some kind of goal in mind to keep them moving forward.To say much more would be to spoil one of the finest stories ever written into a video game. There's a reason the zombie genre has been gaining popularity, and it's only partly because of the zombies. The threat of the undead places ordinary people in extraordinary situations. They're up against a mass of creatures that always play by the same set of rules, and it's usually a failure of human cooperation that dooms the survivors. This is where THE WALKING DEAD walks the line so brilliantly, even compared to the first couple seasons of the television series. Lee's only goal in the game is to keep Clementine safe, and the best way to do so is to keep his ragtag group of survivors from getting at each other's throats. They'll occasionally have some vague goal in mind: going to this town or that, heading for the coast or trying to find help in other places, but survival is really the main goal of the game, which is where the choices come in.If you've played Obsidian Entertainment'sALPHA PROTOCOL, then you'll be delighted to hear that Telltale Games took heavy inspiration from its fantastic dialog system. Unlike games like MASS EFFECT, where you can sit and think over a decision that's really bugging you and make an informed decision, THE WALKING DEAD employs a time limit on the decisions that need to be made in a hurry. In my opinion, you will likely be faced with some of the most stressful choices you've seen in a game in some time, choices that sometimes have no good outcomes with one only being slightly worse than the other, and you'll have to make them *now*. By the end of each episode, I was absolutely exhausted.This isn't made any better by the fact that you'll likely end up caring about most of the characters. Though you won't necessarily like all of them - in fact, you might actually end up despising some of them - circumstances are such that you rely on them for survival. This requires to either play the peacemaker, the antagonist, or even the indifferent one in the group. The choice is pretty much yours.The \"point and click\" format works in this instance. Make no mistake, this is a cinematic experience first and foremost. The drama unfolding in front of you, and the ways you're allowed to influence it, is the centerpiece of the game. There are only a few isolated sections where you'll see some action, but they're usually just for effect. In large part, you'll be chatting it up with your group, making/breaking alliances and friendships, investigating different environments, and surviving through scattered quick time events. It doesn't require much investment on the gameplay side of things, but you'll want to stay on your toes through every cutscene.I can't say enough good things about this game. On the negative side of things, some people might find it a bit off-putting that their decisions don't have enough repercussions down the line. Characters will react to your choices, but the story doesn't change around all that drastically, except in a few key instances. Some then might argue that your choices don't matter, but I'd say they matter no more or less than in games like MASS EFFECT, though the ending for THE WALKING DEAD is much, much more refined. I can honestly say, given my emotional investment with the characters and the story, each and every choice mattered to me.THE WALKING DEAD has to be one of my favorite games at this point, and I never would've imagined that it would be. In my opinion, it's definitely one of the best zombie stories out there - not to mention one of the best video game stories, period - made all the better by the fact that you can have an impact on it. There are emotional highs, lows, moments when you just want to yell at your fellow survivors through your TV, others when a choice with only seconds left to be made might leave you sweating like a bomb defuser. This is more a story about the human condition than anything else, and how it won't always work in Lee's favor. As one of the characters dutifully points out, \"The dead don't kill their own. It's the living you gotta worry about.\"","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2012"}

It keeps things moving along at a quick pace, because the character you're controlling can be incapacitated and you'll just switch off to the nearest surviving teammate; no constant reloads at the tough bits.The enemies are tricky, and even once you've learned their patterns they can still be a challenge. That goes double for the legionnaires with the overlarge shields. You'll still be on your toes the second time through.The game's neither too hard nor too easy. There are a few spots where you might get have to repeat yourself a couple of times. There is usually a teammember who will shine in that tight spot, however, and once you figure out who, it's a breeze. (Sometimes Black's grenade launcher is what you need. Other times you could just really use Delgado's chaingun to put some lead downrange in a hurry. And other times, Cole's time-stopping power is a real lifesaver.)The wide cast is nice and the banter isn't annoying or stale (yet; but then, I've played it through twice).Each character has different weapons and powers, so there's a bit of learning curve with each as you figure out their controls and uses.The story was dark and entertaining.The only thing this game was missing was an ending.

I really like the wireless controller and find that the interface is easy to navigate.  The only complaint I have is that the fan runs fairly loud.  This may be why I haven't experienced any over heating issues, but it's still a tad loud.  This is the only reason why I gave the system 4 stars as opposed to 5.  I've been playing Gears of War and F.E.A.R. and am thoroughly pleased with the console's performance.  No freezing, no red lights, no crashing, no problems.  I liked my original Xbox and I love my 360.Update 3/19/08:  It finally happened.  I got the RRoD!  It took about a year and a half for it to happen, but it finally happened.  I'm going to send it in to Microsoft for repairs.  We'll see what happens.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2006"}

Compared to the upcoming PS3 though it's well worth it.I was concerned about the fact that I kept reading reviews about needing an HDTV for the thing to work.  I have a Sanyo 32\" television (I guess it is what you call a tube model not sure) it is just a normal television.  I hooked my XBOX 360 to the input on my VCR and bingo I have picture.  I have played a ton of games that I get from Gamefly and knock on wood they look just fine.No, I don't have one of those major entertainment systems with surround sound, etc, but my games play.  I do have a desk fan near it because I heard rumors of it heating up.On the negative side for me was simply the weird menu's too much going on there for me.  I prefer the old put your game in and hit start mode myself.  But as for negatives that's pretty good.  The quality of the games is still developing but the graphics are beautiful.  Some of the gaming manufacturers still have a lot to work on when it comes to loading time.  The games still suffer a lot of lag time which I did think was supposed to be part of the purpose of the XBOX 360 and there is something you need to download or patch in order for regular XBOX games to play on it.  I didn't do that I just simply use my Xbox for xbox games.My 399 system came with the harddrive, the remote controller and remote for dvd watching.  I still need to buy the wireless connector in order to work the xbox live feature.Overall, I give it 5 stars because the quality is good and the controller is lighter than the original XBOX controller.But I'm sure before long the price will come down again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2006"}

{"product_name":"Logitech Wireless Gaming Headset G930 with 7.1 Surround Sound","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Odd USB issues spoil the perfect headset.","reviewText":"I was on the verge of returning this headset when anywhere from 10-15 minutes into a game the audio would cut out completely, even when hooked up directly via USB, and require a restart of the game to regain sound.In the end, the issue was traced down to the fact that my G13, G15 and G930 were on the same USB Bus. Moving the G930's to a different USB Bus, as in the front facing USB ports as opposed to the rear USB ports on the motherboard, resolved the issue.So the headset works great as long as the G13&G15; aren't on the same bus. I can move the keyboard to the front and the headphones to the rear, but not the same bus.It's an odd issue that Logitech needs to work out, I'm not the only one having this exact problem - the solution was posted on their forums where other members described my exact issue. So far Logitech has been claiming that it's an issue with Borderlands 2 or Guild Wars 2 or whatever. Logitech has always had a tough time putting out quality drivers and this is time is no different.So the software is iffy at best and thus the -2 stars.Hardware though is outstanding. I have no complaints about the sound quality, the comfort or the range of this headset. No it won't beat out a $300 pair of wired headphones when it comes to sound reporduction - but it shines as a gaming headset.Finally, before the comments saying my issues were caused by my hardware/software and not Logitech's poor drivers:The PC was built Friday, clean install of Win7, brand new Asus Sabertooth Z77, clean install of chipset drivers, Logitech drivers etc. The PC was as pristine as it gets with no odd non standard hardware or configuration. The issue only appears when G13, G15 and G930 are plugged into the same USB bus. If I use a different brand USB keyboard or leave the G13 unplugged, there are no issues. It seems that Logitech needs to test that all their fancy hardware plays well together.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2012"}

It is certainly up to the standards set by Medal of Honor. In fact, I would say that some of the levels are even more intense. In particular, the Russian campaign is not for the faint of heart.I think it is fair to say that this game perfects the art of WW2 FPS games. There really isn't anything I would have done different if I made this game. Graphics are good. They have also paid attention to the sound, which makes the experience closer to a movie than it was in Medal of Honor. The scripting is great. So is the AI. In fact, this is the first game where I really thought that my squad-mates were of any help to me. Once or twice, one of them even picked up a hand granade that was thrown at us, and threw it back to the enemy before it exploded. Also, the save-game-system is great. You can save anywhere you want. Kudos to the developers.On the downside, this is one of those games that makes you feel like you reached the end of the line. There certainly is a bit of a sense of sadness once you are through this game. It is just hard to imagine what's next. Better graphics? Maybe. But it isn't going to enhance gameplay very much. More intense battles? Hardly. Better scenarios? Not in a WW2 game, I don't think.I am sure there will be better games, but I think as far as WW2 FPS games go, this is probably one of the last truely great ones that stand out. This is better than Medal of Honor, but not a huge leap forward. In fact, considering how old MOH is by now, then the improvement is surprisingly insignificant. Perhaps you might have even gotten more of a kick out of MOH when it originally released. I know I did.Anyway: This is a great game. If you like first person shooters, you can not go wrong with this one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2004"}

Monkey is a young man trapped on a slave ship, but when a girl named Trip escapes and the ship beings to crash Monkey gets out. To make a long story short both of them wakes up in ruins of New York, but Trip have secured Monkey with a headband which let her control him, with this she forces him to help her get home to her village, this is easier said than done as there are combat robots, called mechs everywhere and they want the main characters dead. The game play is much like a platformer, you climb, jump, activate levers and otherwise try to get from point A to point B through a obstacle course of a level. The game play is broken up by fighting sections as well as some puzzle solving. The game's gimmick is that you have to protect Trip, for if she dies, your character dies to, and at the same time Trip has her own set of skills which you have to put to good use in puzzle solving sequences.Enslaved have both good points and bad points in my opinion. Let me mention the bad first. The game do not have the best controls, the button layout is a bit awkward and takes some getting used to. Also when I an my hubby played through this game there where a few times we encountered serious bugs. Enslaved is also very linear, that do not bother me, but if you want a game with multiple choices and endings you will not get that here. I also think the game could be longer, it is not so short as to make the player feel cheated, but it is not a very long game either. In addition I think the ending needed more flashing out. I am not going to spoil anything but the game leaves off with many questions unanswered. The gimmick of the game could be used better, most of the time Trip only run around babbling, there are a few times you have to save her and a few times you have to have her repair some technology or hack something to be able to progress, however most of the time she might just as well not have been there and the game developers have not been creative enough in using the fact that Monkey is enslaved to Trip though a science fiction control device to make the game play original.Now to the good parts of the game. The storyline is extremely good and very involving, after a while I at least started to really care about these characters. The graphics, both on the player character, other characters and objects and backgrounds are superb, the mechs are just beautiful. The music is good and all in all I think Enslaved was allot of fun. The cutscenes are very well rendered and this is obviously a quality game.Enslaved feels like if God of War married ICO, it certainly have some of the feel of both games and it is nearing excellence, however bad controls and a to sudden and cropped ending make it so I can not give this game five stars. However I did like it and I do think it is quite good.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2011"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, doubters say it would be suicide.

As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return, as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games as they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

I&#8217;m glad to say that most of those flaws have been eradicated in ME2. Gone are the endless slow elevator rides. Gone are the tedious, bouncy buggy rides on dull, lifeless planets. And gone is the ridiculously complex HUD. What hasn&#8217;t changed are its strong points, which remain in the storyline and RPG elements. Once again there is a detailed and compelling story along with many side plots and missions, which are more diverse and creative than those in ME1. The voice acting is excellent throughout as are the character models and animations, which are fluid and naturalistic. Graphically it&#8217;s very good for a four-year-old game, although there&#8217;s little in the way of physics, which is a shame. The combat has also improved, although it remains rather clunky and lacklustre compared to other games. The Mass Effect franchise is clearly about providing a rich and developed universe in which to place the player and to give that player a full-bodied RPG experience peppered with combat and action along the way. And in this respect ME2 really delivers. If not for the so-so combat I would have given it 5/5.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2014"}

Being 10 years in development this game could have been out of this world (haha) but instead we get a straight forward run `n' gun FPS. That doesn't make this bad though. Prey introduces the awesome portal engine and it just amazes you through the first few levels. Prey's puzzle solving is simple and uses its gravity engine as well where you'll be flipping rooms around.This game is also very easy even on hard and this is do to the fact you NEVER get a game over if you die. Tommy is a Cherokee Indian so his grandfather takes him to their \"dead world\" and Tommy can then project his soul outside his body and this adds to more puzzle solving elements since he can go through barriers his body can't . When you die you do this \"death walk\" where you shoot enemies flying around to gain more health then you enter your body right where you died.Despite all this Prey has one of the best stories an FPS has had in years. You'll definitely play through this twice and it's worth it at its bargain bin price now. The multiplayer I hear is crap but I don't have XBL Gold so I can't say.

Every character in the MK series is in this game (Mokap, Styker, Motaro and even Meat from MK4 and Chameleon from the PSone version of MK Trilogy), which makes it great to have battles that we never got to see before. The Collector's edition has an extra DVD with is and (I don't know if the regular edition has it) the arcade version of UMK3. The only thing that does disappoint me is the fatality system. It's a good idea but it would be better if you had a choice of doing that or see a cinamatic fatality (which this game could of been on a dual layered DVD). thank goodness that the Konquest mode is a whole lot better than the Deception Konquest mode, which wasn't great.

{"product_name":"B00005LOXE","description":"The two classic RPGs in this compilation not only represent hours upon hours of story, character, and action, they also present the background for two recent bestselling, critically hailed games:Final Fantasy IXandChrono Cross.With all the different names for the original 1991 release of the first title in this compilation (Final Fantasy IVin Japan,Final Fantasy IIin the U.S.), role-players new to the game may get confused. Make no mistake, though:Final Fantasy Chroniclesmarks the first time this pivotal installment of the cherished game series has ever been available on the PlayStation. InFinal Fantasy IV, players take on the role of Cecil, a loyal captain who questions the orders of his king, and for it is sent to slay a mysterious beast in a nearby valley.InChrono Trigger, Chrono must follow princess Marle's teleportation through time and locate her before an intergalactic parasite arrives to destroy the world. The original game, also on the PlayStation for the first time, was one of the first nonlinear role-playing games. The decisions that players make during the game will point them toward one of more than a dozen possible endings.These new versions retain the authentic Japanese SNES stories and characters while updating their graphics and adding new full-motion video sequences and other features.","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"The classics never die!","reviewText":"&quot;Final Fantasy Chronicles&quot; combines Final Fantasy IV (II in the U.S, released in 1991) and Chrono Trigger, two of the most innovative and challenging RPGs of all time.The version of Final Fantasy IV found here is the complete version of the game, with a bit more challenge and velocity than the SNES release. Skin deep, though, they are basically the same game. The original graphics are preserved, but with the added benefit of FMV movies at the beginning and end of the game. The story, dialogue, items, weapons, spells, and all that jazz remain intact. This was released as &quot;Final Fantasy IV Hard Edition&quot; in Japan, and as the title suggests, this game is not easy. You are looking at 60 hours MINIMUM to complete this game, 100 is more realistic. Despite all my praise of FFVI, this is what I consider to be the best game in the Final Fantasy Series. It has a deeper story, and it is far more challenging. I cannot argue that the graphics are a bit, well, dated. But who cares? A great game is still a great game.Ditto for Chrono Trigger. This is one game that I am glad they re-released. It is one of the most pleasant gaming experiences you will ever have. Unlike the Final Fantasy games, the battles happen in real time, and you can use combo attacks with certain characters. The basic elements, like leveling up and attain stronger weapons and magic, are still here. The graphics are way ahead of it's time, and fit well with other Playstation titles like &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; and &quot;Breath of Fire III&quot;. This game is a pure classic.One mistake made by RPG fans (like myself) is that they do not get these games while they are readily available, and wait until they become out of print and hard to find. I urge you not to do the same. There will come a time when this game, like the FF Anthology, will demand a high price because it is extremely rare. Best to get it now while you can.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2001"}
{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Laura","summary":"Not as good as the other Marios...but","reviewText":"Super Mario Sunshine isn't as good as the other Mario games but it's still packed with loads of fun, puzzles and &quot;other stuff&quot; to have you playing for hours and hours.  The one thing I like about this game is that it's somewhat similar to the others as there are different worlds to go to.  The other good thing is that it's not SIMPLE to beat.  Some of the worlds and/or places are a challenge, if you don't cheat (by guide or internet), this game may have you frustrated for a bit...maybe that's because I never listen to anyone, I just push the A button real quick so I don't have to sit there and talk to them (no patience).  But I suggest that's the better thing to do unless you are COMPLETELY stuck that you're losing your mind.  Mario has his E.Gadd (water pumper) which is actually a pretty nifty gadget.  I love how you can float upwards and zoom across the water.  Yoshi is back as well and a fun part of the game.  The worst parts of Yoshi are he needs a certain fruit to open his shell and secondly, he can't go into the water or he'll disappear into thin air.  This game is fun.  If you don't like fun, puzzling games then this isn't for you but if you loved the other Mario games, I recommend you buy it.  It's worth the price for you can replay it as much as you want (similar to the works of Super Mario 64) and the graphics are good.  The sunglasses are kind'a cool too.  Nice control and wonderful game play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2004"}

The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

{"product_name":"B000084318","reviewerName":"Rex Marksmanson \"HEYO!\"","summary":"A close second to the epic Ocarina Of Time","reviewText":"The Zelda series has been ongoing for as long as I can remember, even back when I got my first NES, Zelda was the must play game, not much has changed in that time.  After much anticipation Nintendo finally released the follow-up to the bland Majora's Mask, and to many fans dismay they went for a popular trend at the time, cell shading animation.  Many gamers were too quick to dismiss this game because of it's different animation style, this is not only foolish but just plain stupid.  I'll admit I wasn't too hot on the idea at first, it seemed awkward and childish, not too mention Link looked more like a girl than a hero.  It only took 10 minutes of gameplay to change my mind and make me a believer.  Wind Waker is different, yes, but if you look at Zelda's past no two titles have been the same, accept change as a part of the series if you plan to be a fan of it.It's hard to live up to the Ocarina Of Time for the Nintendo 64, arguably the best game in the series, but as the title stated it's very close.For starters the story is gripping, as long as you suspend any disbelief or doubt which is necessary for pretty much any Zelda game.  Normally I'd tell you about the storyline but in a game as such it is much too essential, therefore I leave that up to you to discover.  What I can tell you is this game is addicting, pure and simple, you'll find yourself driven to complete each quest.  The combat system is similar to the others, with some newer features and weapons to help compliment it.  Another unique twist is the implement of sailing from island to island, a task that can ocassionally be trying, but always worthwhile.  It took me several months to complete this game, keep in mind I played it very casually, sometimes for 10 minutes, other times for hours.  While there is no voice acting, the characters clever and entertaining dialogue more than makes up for it.If you're a fan of the Zelda series this game will please you, I guarantee it.  And if you're just a fanboy complaining about the  \"stupid\" grahpics, grow up, it's your loss for missing out on such a great game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2004"}

Only reason why I gave it 4 instead of 5 is that fact that EACH Wii Remote has to have the Motion +Plus attachment in order to play. So if you only got one that came with the Wii Sports and you got Four(4) remotes that's Three(3) extra Motion +Plus attachments you gotta buy so each player can play not to mention Three(3) Wii Nunchucks too. The game itself is pretty high priced and to add all the extra attachment you'll need for Multi-player play it get's pretty hefty. But with that aside I find Wii Sports Resort to be very relaxing. On stressful days I find much relaxation from sitting down and enjoying a nice flyover the Wuhu Island in my plane or Canoe ride around the lake or to zip around the beach in the Wakeboard or even just a quite time playing frisbee with the Wii Dog.

The familiar white hood returns again, this time during the American Revolutionary War. But is this year's entry in the series as memorable as previous ones?AC 3 stars Connor, a Native American who seeks revenge on the people who have destroyed his home, while also starring Desmond Miles in the present/future. I never was a big fan of Desmond's story; I always felt it was there to &#34;pull you out&#34; of the meat of the game. It is better than previous games (more action based, less rambling) and has some decent twists and turns, but Connor's story is significantly less memorable than Ezio's and Altier's of the previous games. While Ezio was witty, clever, and charming, and Altier was serious but likable, Connor's dialogue is flat and boring. And with a few exceptions involving Connor's tribe being destroyed, he does little to pull the player into the game's large and incredibly detailed world (which is awesome to both play in and look at). That being said, I'm a huge fan of the game's time period, and it put a smile on my face seeing Connor interact with some of the war's significant leaders and soldiers alike.The game's signature block-then-strike gameplay returns, and it flows better than previous games, allowing you to tackle multiple attacking foes at once. The incredibly gory takedowns also return, but are MUCH more varied, and are a treat to watch. This makes the repetitive gameplay seem less so, even if most of the weapons feel the same with different animations. The naval battles in this game are better than most FULL PIRATE games (to the point they made the fourth game into one). Anyone who buys this game and skips these are SERIOUSLY missing out, because they are probably my favorite part of the game. Other side quests involve finding random chests in the woods (boring), a deep hunting system (very fun!), and building up a small town to earn you more money later on (missed opportunity here, I felt it was shallow and a chore to do). There are a LOT of things to do in this game when the main story is done putting you to sleep. The multiplayer returns from previous games, with a few new game modes to change it up. Most of these work, and it is a fun distraction from the game's lengthy single player campaign.Fans of the series have probably bought this one, but for people looking for a fun, open world to mess around with, Assassin's Creed 3 is a good game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2014"}

The game pretty much drags you through major set-piece after major setpiece w/o relief.  Imagine a 6-hour continuous action scene.  It's exciting at first...but quickly gets very old.Aside from that, it's a lot of room clearing with an ridiculous amount of enemies pouring in.  Aside from the ambience/visuals that start out impressive but soon just get boring, the combat can be best described as...tedious.CO-OPSurvival Mode is COD's version of friendly players vs increasingly difficult waves of enemies.  It's good fun the first dozen times...not enough going on to keep it interesting.The Co-Op Missions, however, i had quite a bit of fun with.  They are the sole reason this game gets its second star.  It has a lot more missions with differing roles (ie one person is on foot while the other is in another location).MULTI-PLAYERMulti-player is frustrating because it really does have a great formula, with the same awful implementation from MW2.  The persistent leveling, weapons upgrades/unlocks, and customization want to make you keep going. The actual experience makes you want to quit.  I actually prefer COD's more...hectic multiplyaer style to something like the battlefield series, but multiplayer is far too rife with hackers.  This game also lacks dedicated servers, so your average multiplayer experience is usually high-latency with one guy (on your team or on the opposing team) cleaning up.  On game modes not determined solely by kill count it's not uncommon to have someone have a K/d of ~80+/2ish.  Comical snap-to-head aimbots and shooting through thin cover are the order of the day here.This series' multi-player experience peaked with COD 4: Modern Warfare.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2012"}

If they didn't constantly complain about this game, I would have never heard of it.  In fact, I bought a Playstation 2 in order to play this.  To say this is a great game would be an understatement.  This game definitely belongs in the greatest game of all time lists.Where to start?  First off, it's addictive.  Very, very addictive.  The Surgeon General and FDA better investigate the addictiveness of this game.  In its most basic form, you steal cars in order to complete missions.  The missions themselves vary widely, from running over someone,  stealing the right type of car, rushing to the airport, to assassinating someone.  You're not just regulated to cars.  Sometimes you have to snipe someone, fire a rocket launcher, or go through a boat chase.The realism, or should I say the general feel, is amazing.  You're not handed a car and weapons, but you steal and buy them respectively.  How to get money?  You could steal a cab and take fares, you could mug random people, or complete missions.  You're not just regulated to a straight and narrow road.  The whole city is open to you.  You actually feel like you're in entire city.  As you play longer, you start recognizing streets and neighborhoods.  You slowly become acclimated to whole place.  Just as if you moved and explored a new city.  Some things are just amazing.  For example, it takes place in rapid real time.  If you have to drive to the other end of the city, it takes three hours in GTA 3 time, and the sunlight adjusts accordingly.  That is detail.  Another example is the radio.  When you steal a car, you actually get to adjust the radio stations.  From talk to reggae, it's all there.How real is this game?  I played this game for thirty hours on one weekend, and by Monday, it actually effected my ability to drive.  I actually had to re-adjust myself to real world driving.  That has never, ever happened before.There are also so many things to do.  There are about 70 something missions to play, but you only need to complete 50 to win the game.  Extra missions are just the tip of the iceberg.  You could steal cabs and take fares, steal ambulances and rescue people, take a cop car and go into vigilante mode.  You might find yourself just exploring or killing random people for no reason.Finally, there's no really stupid plot.  You just meet people, they ask for favors, and then pay you.  Simple and straightfoward.Pros:Best Action/Adventure game ever.Open environment.Addictive.Graphics.Radio stations.Missions (Run, stealth, open ended).Not linear - not stuck at one place.Lots of extra stuff.Realistic (sort of).Cons:Mission failed? Got to get briefed again (too long).Too gray, could have used a splash of color.Sometimes forced to drive long distances.Time: 35 hoursDifficulty: MediumFrustration: Low","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2002"}

Your character, let's call him \"Link\", is playing an on line MMORPG. All of the people which Link interacts with are just computer-controlled characters.

You have weapons to hack and slash at creatures. You have magic and can heal your party members or harm the enemies. You can \"chat\" with your party members to ask them to give you a hand or heal you.When you're not \"on line\", you can read message boards about things going on, send messages, and progress through the game. After your first half hour of \"guided tutorial\", one of your friends falls into a coma and you're concerned about it. More things happen as you get deeper and deeper into the game.Amusingly, the graphics are better than most real MMORPGs out there but are not quite as good as many real PS2 games that are out there.

They're around the Dark Cloud level of graphics.The 45 minute anime cartoon that gets you familiar with the game and the players helps to draw you into the world, and feel like this is a real situation with real people you are interacting with.On the downside, you can't customize your character at all.

Blending unique gameplay, humorous characters and interactions, and the aforementioned graphics,Munch's Oddyseesimply feels unlike any other game in the 2001 console gaming lineup. Players control two characters in the game: Munch, a wheelchair-bound hero, and Abe, a character some gamers will recognize from previous Oddworld games. Their goal is to find and free the Mudokon queen, keeper of the remaining eggs of an endangered species.Both characters feature unique talents that, via a tag-team style of play, propel the player through the game. For instance, Abe can climb and jump to reach new areas, as well as temporarily possess an enemy's soul via a chant. The web-footed Munch can swim to new areas and, when on the roll in his wheelchair, use his sonar plug to control machinery remotely. Saving an entire race also requires a coordinated effort on everyone's part. To get the job done quickly, players can deliver verbal commands to kinsmen. They'll gladly greet you (in a witty manner), then gang up on a mean-spirited enemy or accomplish difficult tasks for you. As with the rest of the game world, the finely detailed characters and environments, as well as a refreshing charm, draw you into an experience with the quality of a Pixar film.

{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube. For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies.

That is partially why I turned in my beloved Dreamcast for a gamecube, to play this game.  I had high expectations, of this there is no doubt.  But I have been amply rewarded so far for my move in a new direction.Some of the reviews I read complained about the strange or \"[junky]\" controls.  I am not sure I understand this.  Resident Evil offers a pre-set control that will be comfortable to any returning player.  It also offers another default setting that may be more comfortable to newer players.  And if I am not mistaken (I loved setting A so I didn't look into this too close), option C lets you set the controls however you like.Another complaint I read about was getting lost in the game or quickly running out of ammunition.  This is a totally common experience to all Resident Evil players.  It is part of the game style itself.  The test is whether you drop the controller and run like a [WIMP] or you pick it back up and get BACK IN THE GAME!  Honestly, it is survival horror, not Duke Nukem!  What do you expect, a Gatling gun and red pointing arrows?On the plus side, YES! Resident Evil now has graphics on par with even the best of computer games.  You can prepare to be amazed.  It also has almost perfect physics, meaning the pistol acts like a pistol and your charactor moves like they are real (trust me on this).  Heavy weapons have a very satisfying (i.e. zombie mutilating) effect as well.  At first I was worried that the low weapon count would draw the game down in comparison to RE 2.  But I was wrong.  Each gun is fun and there is more than enough variety to please even a NRA President.New players beware!  This Resident Evil is huge!  It is much larger than any of the other Resident Evil games I have played yet.  Not just in size but in complexity.  Even on easy, I was struggling to slove the puzzles in the game.  You will spend a lot of time exploring and backtracking.  If this is not your bag, do like me and buy a strategy guide.  I tried not to use it at first but...I am weak.  Know if you are too when purchasing.As a final note and one thing I think is important, many players confess being scared by the Resident Evil games.  I was never one.  Even Code Veronica, with its great graphics and ominous tone did not scare me.  Imagine my suprise when I realized I wasn't turning on the Gamecube after dark.  Resident Evil Gamecube is actually scary to me, a vetran of the series.  If you get the creeps and like it, then meet your new best friend....","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2002"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest. This unprecedented 60-player option could revolutionize online multiplayer game play and is sure to provide countless hours of action-packed fun.Resistance 2, set in the United States, is loaded with new weapons, enemies, and an unprecedented online gaming experience.","reviewerName":"YO","summary":"It sucks...","reviewText":"Okay now i loved the first resistance but this one to me is horrible especially when it was released a few months before the astonishing killzone 2.

Obraztsov","summary":"Dark, gritty, and heartfelt - welcome back, Max!","reviewText":"I was so incredibly excited for this game, and was hoping that it would live up to its hype.  Trust me, it will exceed your expectations and beyond.  It has the feel of the original Max Payne, with obviously updated stellar graphics.STORY - not much has changed for Max in nine years.  He's an alcoholic and frequently finds himself in against all-odds situations, still deeply traumatized by his wife's death.  He starts out as a bodyguard for rich people, and then ends up in a much more sinister plot.  And Max is a mixed bag - you'll never know what he's going to do next.GRAPHICS - this game doesn't have the BEST, but is in the top-tier when it comes to graphics. The ambience is very moody and gritty, and the gameplay is so awesome that it's one of those things where you can barely tell it switches from cutscene to you playing.  You won't be disappointed in this department.The game is very stylish.  It seems very glamorous, especially when starting out at a ritzy Brazilian nightclub.  Even though it may seem obnoxious to some, it's rather cool and you'll get used to it.  What I mean by stylish is lots of flashing words, changing viewpoints, loud music, etc.SOUND/VOICE WORK - James McCaffrey is just the perfect Max Payne.  He captures the cynicism, pain, and bitterness of Max, and he makes you feel like you're watching a movie.  It's all very convincing.GAMEPLAY - there are a lot of cutscenes, which some may find intrusive, but like the \"stylish\" look of the game, it's something you can get used to if you find annoying.  I personally enjoy Max's story, so if you do as well, you will love it.Choosing guns is made simple for you.  You can have two side-arms or one two-handed weapon.  And like we all wanted, Bullet Time and Shoot Dodge are back, and sweeter than ever.  They are easy to master, but sometimes you get a little caught up in all the fray that you might forget to use them.  However, when you do, it really makes the game more thrilling than ever.They went a little old school with health re-generation; there is none.  Well, if you die it comes back, but it never regenerates over time, even on easy mode.  You'll love or hate this, but you can't stand behind a wall and wait for your health to regenerate.  It adds to the realism of the game, but also the difficulty.Gameplay is about 12 hours.  But there are other things you can do when you beat it.  You can do score challenges, speed runs, play on different modes of difficulty,  and...MULTIPLAYER - I wish there was a way the main story could have been multiplayer, but that wouldn't have been possible.  Instead, you can play online with people.  It's really just total chaos, but it's fun.  They tried to add some narrative in there which is kind of weird, but the multiplayer mode can get a lot out of the game for you once you've finished the single player storyline.This is definitely a home-run and I would recommend this to anyone who wants to shoot lots of people, feel and watch Max Payne's plight, and have a gaming experience of a lifetime.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2012"}

You learn a bit about your own character based on whatever background set you pick2. You learn that your crew are working with aliens that everyone has mixed feelings about especially since one is on board the ship.3. I p*ssed off said alien race on my ship because he likes working 'alone' and I don't think I can trust them.4. I may have p*ssed off a doc on my ship because she has a nasty 'tude also and my character doesn't take any crap....lol5. I got one of my 'Ensign Jenkins' (hereafter known as EJs)  killed because I sent him forward to take out an emplacement and he accidentally blew up a power cell (dummy!)6. I got a cool peice of armor...heheheThe combat is a bit of a mixed bag because sometimes it seems as even tho you are shooting at something it doesn't quite 'die' the way you want it but this is definently preferred over turn based combat.If you have seen the pix and the videos, the graphics are very well done and if they get around to doing another KOTOR then this right here may be a sneak peek as to where this is going.Also another thing you want to be aware of....check your graphics settings as your are setting up the game...I got a little concerned as I played about a 'grainy' quality my picture had and I thought it was the TV....it's not...in the settings, they have a reading for \"film grain\" so that way the game alomost looks like you are playing a movie.Back to the convos....it's everything that they advertised as far as how fluid it it and each and every choice you make as far as how you want to take definently makes a difference. Sometimes you have to make a choice to glean info from someone vs brushing them off because they are getting a little too familiar. I did find in one instance so far that if you kind of continue along the exact same line of questioning, that you get the same response. But it still doesn't detract from the experience.I think this will be the game that knocks Oblivion off of the throne as the top RPG on the 360 but only time will tell and some downloadable content can't hurt either!Otherwise so far, within the very tiny portion of the game that I have played...it is indeed impressive.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2007"}

{"product_name":"B005VBVQDI","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Let's Rock!","reviewText":"In 2001, just a year after the Playstation 2 launched, a small gem of a game dropped down called Devil May Cry.  The game was originally conceived as another Resident Evil but went so far off that it became it's own thing.  The result was a revolutionary game that helped reshape gaming and redefine a genre for quite some time.  While Devil May Cry isn't always remembered for that now the point is simple: In 2001 we simply hadn't seen a game like it.  It was fluid and smooth.  It had great action and cheesy one-liners.  But most of all, it had stylish combat, the likes of which had never been seen in a video game before.  The original Devil May Cry came out at the perfect time.  Not so far into the PS2's life to be too big of a ripoff, and early enough that it could be considered innovative because no other game COULD have done what it did before it.Let's be frank, most of what Devil May Cry is remembered for is hardly the story.  In fact, until I popped in the HD collection I had pretty much forgotten what the games were about.  The only thing I remembered (as I'm sure many people who played the game just over ten years ago remember) were the crazy moves in combat, the cheesy one liners and the incredible effects you could watch.  Who doesn't remember watching the opening scene of the original Devil May Cry for the first time?  It's laughably cheesy and then you feel content because it's supposed to be.  This was our introduction to the game.  By having a girl ride in on a bike and then immediately attacking our protagonist by impaling him with a sword before throwing the very bike she rode in on at him... to which he blast it away with his gun and it explodes.  This was the make it or break it moment.  If you could go along with this ridiculous action you were going to be rewarded.  If it was \"too much\" for you then you were not likely to dive in beyond that.  It's a great opening cinematic because it perfectly illustrates what Devil May Cry is.  The story isn't what's important.  It's the style, the action and the gameplay.And for the most part it's still fun.  All three games play rather identical.  The first one is a charmer, but the real show here is definitely Devil May Cry 3 more so than the other two.  In fact, because of how things are set up, even newcomers can jump into the third first seeing as how it takes place before the first game.  The combat in all of the games is rather simple and yet... still complex.  You have an assortment of weapons to use (although most times you'll be using a sword) where you can perform combos or hit enemies into the air and blow them away with your guns.  You can perform special moves or go into Devil Form where your abilities and defenses are improved.  It's an interesting system.  The monsters which attack you throughout the games are fierce.  And as you tackle them you generally hear heavy metal music in the background.  You've got guns, tricks, juggles and a lot of variety.  Your moves are ranked as Dull, Crazy, Bravo, Awesome and Stylish to give you a sense of how well your doing.  When you dispatch enemies they drop red orbs for you to use as currency to buy even more crazy moves.  Devil May Cry was, in a way, ahead of its time.  Still using some of the same things which came before it, but using all of it to provide so much variety for the game in and of itself.  Variety that still serves as a strength today.Make no mistake, however, these games are tough.  They included the Special Edition of Devil May Cry 3, for those wondering.  Primarily because including the original I'm sure would've rekindled memories of pure frustration for some gamers.  Regardless, all three games are fairly tough.  They're unforgiving at what they do.  If you need a moment to readjust to the controls the game is likely to give you a rough start.Devil May Cry 2 is perhaps the one that has aged the worst out of all of them, and it's mostly because it already had a lukewarm reception upon release.  The game felt like a step backward.  It was not only easier, but it was shorter and didn't feature nearly as much creativity, detail or even some of the cheesy action we'd come to see.  The combat wasn't bad, though, but it's often considered the weakest of the trilogy by fans.The third one, however, is by far the best of the lot.  And because it's the Special Edition you get all the extras of the special edition.  Likewise, the third game just has the best flowing combat of all three games.  Not to mention a few interesting tweaks that give Dante four different styles to go into each mission as.  It's overall the best experience.I'd actually recommend playing all three.  Not only do you get to experience gaming history but you can see how these games really helped to shape and influence the action games which came after it.  That being said though, you also can't help but notice how dated some of Devil May Cry is.  As good as these games are, gaming has progressed quite a bit since then.  The first and most glaring issue is that the camera angles really get on ones nerves.  The fixed camera angles are going to mess you up.  You're going to miss a couple of jumps because of some of the camera angles.  With no control given to the player and some strange angles you're more apt to mess up some good timing.  Likewise, some of the awkward camera angles can screw up with how you're actually moving.  You'll be running away from the screen only for the angle to change and you're suddenly running toward the screen instead which will sometimes cause you to do a weird awkward turn around before pressing forward.  Simply put, Devil May Cry doesn't control as smoothly as it used to.Some of the controls can throw you for a loop for a brief moment.  For example, in 2012 most of us who play a game that involves using a gun in 3D space are used to pressing one trigger to raise the weapon and the other trigger to fire.  Devil May Cry has you press one trigger to raise the weapon, but square to fire.  You'd think this wouldn't take time to readjust to... but it actually does.  It doesn't keep you out for very long, but it sort of provides an idea for just how much even some of the basic foundation of control schemes have changed.  At the very least, however, Dante always locks on to the nearest target automatically and there's no need to make sure you have enough ammo.  Dante's weapons never run out of ammo.These aren't huge issues by any means.  They're merely what you'd call \"state of the art.\"  This was just how a lot of video games were when Devil May Cry came out.  None of that is changed here, although you do wish that at the very least CAPCOM would've added in the ability to rotate the camera.As far as the HD itself goes, that's a tough one.  The gameplay actually looks great, but some of the other moments not quite as much.  You'll see some ugly textures from time to time, but what's more daunting is how CAPCOM opted not to touch some of it.  CAPCOM left the menus in regular Standard Definition so some people are bound to notice a few strange textures (particularly when you go into the options menu in the first Devil May Cry).  This is really not that big a deal, although with how other games had their HD collections treated it just seems somewhat lazy not to go the whole nine yards.  HD Collections like Ico and Shadow of the Colossus or Metal Gear Solid just did a better job.  Some of the pre-rendered cutscenes also look like they weren't really touched at all.  Again, you're gonna notice a few ugly textures.  During actual gameplay, though and during the cutscenes that aren't pre-rendered the games actually look quite good.  Again, it just seems very odd that CAPCOM wouldn't go the full nine yards with some of this stuff.  It only takes booting up the original Devil May Cry to see this.  The pre-rendered cutscene at the beginning of the first Devil May Cry is in standard for instance, yet the first meeting between Dante and Trish (because it's not pre-rendered) is in HD, but then the next pre-rendered scene that plays in which Trish talks about Mundus is in standard.  Perhaps this is most noticeable when you boot up and watch the pre-rendered cutscene at the beginning of Devil May Cry 3 and then the in-game cutscene that's immediately after it.  It's clear CAPCOM wants you to focus on the gameplay more than the story but... again, why not just go the whole nine yards with it?The other strange nitpick with this collection is when you select a game.  When you boot the HD Collection up you can choose which Devil May Cry you want to play, but once you go into that game, you can't exactly get back to the main menu to let you select a different game.  You have to quit all the way out and then boot up the collection again.  It's another moment that just seems lazy.I wouldn't shun anyone away from this collection.  It's actually a good one.  You get three games for a decent price.  And while not EVERYTHING is in HD at least the gameplay itself is and that's not so bad.  There are a few parts of Devil May Cry that haven't aged as well, but the games are still good in and of themselves.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2012"}

It adds an ability to jump from your car to virtually any other car on the road, to hijack. This part is somewhat entertaining, except that, as you can buy your own vehicles, you are usually only doing this during a quest, since your cars are better than the majority of cars on the road.The \"action any time\" feature, is not exactly what I was expecting. What it does is require you to push a button before your character climbs a fence, wall, or slides over a car, or table, else your character will perform the action a little bit slower, and clumsily. Unfortunately, this becomes more tedious and annoying than interesting, and simply tapping the button all the time works. It's a game play mechanic most games typically automatically do for your anyways.The shooting mechanics are not that bad, though, often it's a pray and spray as you are given a large circle to aim through, rather than a finer cross hair.The mini-game features, such as lock picking and hacking, are extremely simple, and ultimately, after the 10th or 20th time, annoying.The story is OK, and the voice acting is not bad (though the main character is far too excited and angry then he need be).I would have liked to wait until the price dropped a fair bit.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"R.Suarez \"R-Suarez-\"","summary":"Stunning!","reviewText":"After over a year of its release and due to its first anniversary I decided I'd replay MGS4. The experience reminded me of what a great game this is. While it may not be necessary to have played the previous games in the series  to enjoy it, that definitely makes the experience richer, Act 4 for instance, shows the return of Snake to a location from the first game, to me, it was one of the coolest levels played in a videogame , the flashbacks and references (even the music) gave me goose bumps. This game concludes the story arc from previous installments and shows what happens to all characters when you complete it, the ending does pay off.Install time of the game is about 8 minutes, consider though, this is a game that fully utilizes the 50 gig space in a Bluray disc. After the first install and according to your progress in the game, additional chapters may require a 2 minute install as well. While the game is installed, Snake smokes and gives advice to the player, though I do not follow it that much.Despite of what the critics said about the number of cinemas and their length, for fans of the series (and anyone interested in playing a game with a good story) those are essential to tell the complex story being developed, and quite enjoyable, characters returning from previous installments doing the most unexpected things are great to watch (there are some acts that are actually shorter than the preceding/following cinemas)  Graphics are simply stunning and a major improvement from MGS3, which at his time was one of the best games I played. For those who have not played this and just to give you an idea, the cinema displays in this game use the graphics from the game itself!Playability is really easy to get used to, the number of weapons, actions and possibilities are beyond what you could imagine, you can choose to play stealth or to go on a killing rampage to reach your objectives. The boss battles are, like in previous games, challenging and very creative, each one of the beauties has their weak spot and it is up to you to figure it out. There is even a sequence similar to one in MGS2 in which you and other character have to team up against some enemies, epic! Another thing that helps make this an epic game is the score, composed by Harry Gregson-Williams, that and the songs from prior games make some sequences and boss battles really cool to play.At the moment this is being written, there is still no trophy support , Konami has suggested the possibility in a near future of doing so but we have to wait, that would give this game more replay value than the one it already has.As a side note, the PSNetwok has the MGS Database available for free download, it has all the information you may need from previous games in case you did not play them or don't remember, all the information on MGS4 will be hidden until you beat the game to avoid potential spoilers.If you have not played this game yet, take advantage of the price drop as a 'Greatest Hit' and give it a try.

{"product_name":"B00BGA9X9W","description":"","reviewerName":"ChomskyKnows \"ChomskyKnows\"","summary":"Greatest controller ever made thus far...OBJECTIVE REVIEW","reviewText":"PREAMBLEI have nearly every console ever made and controllers for most of them...even esoteric ONEs such as the Nintendo \"Wavebird\" and the more professionally made 3rd party controllers such as the Logitech ONEs with IR receivers for PS2 and the original XBOX (which tended to have some degree of noticeable input lag). Prior to the PS4 DS4 controller, I would say the 360 was the most solidly built controller ever. It felt great to hold and I felt like I couldn't break it with my bare hands the way I could with the PS3 controller...I love controllers.MICROSOFT SPENDS MORE TO GET LESSMS reportedly spent $100,000,000 developing the XBOX ONE controller. They spent 100mil to develop a controller inferior and less ergonomic to the 360 controller. My \"DAY ONE\" XBOX ONE controller has a less solid, more \"plastic-y\" feel to it (similar to the PS3 controller) and the seams tend to cave in as I grip it. I am forced to grip it much much harder because it's wider (for no apparent reason) and that forces my hands apart. Worse, as professional critics have noted, the shoulder (bumper) buttons no longer depress on the outer portions of the button - can't fathom the stupidity of that. If you're used to being able to push the shoulder buttons in anywhere (as you should) you'll screw this up over and over again and fail to throw a grenade or do whatever action the button is supposed to do. I see no intelligent design reason for this. It's just stupid. The only big noticeable things the ONE controller has over competitors are trigger rumble and a removable battery.XBOX ONE CONTROLLER IMPROVEMENTSThe XBOX ONE controller dead zones are supposed to be better and the D-pad is improved. I bet that will please the folks that play stuff in Major League Gaming, but I never really cared about those things to begin with and 360 controller revisions had already fixed the d-pad with a cool interesting transforming method. I can't tell if latency or lag has improved yet. They made it uncomfortable to hold and nearly no functionality was added. NOTE: my TITANFALL controller (which you'd think would be identical) seems to not have the same caving-in-at-the-seams problem the DAY ONE controller has...So there's that...XBOX ONE CONTROLLER / OS INTERFACE PROBLEMS & REDUNDANT BUTTONSEven the way the controller interfaces with the ONE OS is worse. The ONE OS stupidly didn't launch with a battery indicator (patched later) but the controller itself still has no low battery warning indicator (the 360 controller did). So if you're in the heat of battle and the team is counting on you for the big win, your controller will just die randomly...Thanks Obama.Also, the ONE controller has a menu button (previously start) which mimics current website and mobile standards (which is good), another redundant button (previously back) and I don't even know what the hell you call it (app switcher button?) and yet another to turn on/off (the classic middle X button). The middle X button used to be more functional. Tapping it would take you to a very fast, responsive and convenient text-based shortcut menu on the 360, but this was abandoned in the ONE OS rendering the button less useful and more redundant. Worse, when you receive a game/party invite, you're supposed to HOLD the middle X button (IT TELLS YOU TO DO THIS). Because of buggy OS latency problems here, this never works fast enough and takes you to the \"turn off\" menu instead. You're supposed to only hold it down for a few seconds, but IT DOES NOT SAY THAT - you'll learn the hard way and maybe accidentally turn of your system (this still has not been patched). If you're coming from PS to XBOX or are new to XBOX, these buttons may not make any intuitive sense to you at all, may be difficult to get used to and game/party invites will confuse you...Because of all this crap, these 3 buttons really should be ONE button the way it is on the PS4...There isn't enough functionality to them thus there isn't a good reason for them to all exist...A LOT OF PS4 CONTROLLER IMPROVEMENTS AND INTELLIGENT BUTTON PLACEMENTThe PS4 controller feels much more solid than the PS3 controller and yet is light and pleasant to hold. It is improved in every way to its predecessor, has better button placement and more functionality than the XBOX ONE controller. I like the 1-button-tap in the middle to take you to the dashboard (or back to your last app if already at the dashboard) or hold-down-to-turn-off. I don't particularly like the PS4 dashboard (XBOX ONE wins here hands down in my opinion) but this review is for the controller not the dashboard...The PS4 controller has new (or moved) buttons near the shoulder buttons that are OUT OF THE WAY and innocuous. Don't use the share button if you don't want to and you probably won't ever hit it by accident.Many people have remarked that they don't like the big interactive light bar but I find it pleasant and informative (bad things happening on screen = red, good things = green and so on). Nevertheless Sony SHOULD LET YOU TURN THE DAMN THING OFF for those that hate it and Sony claims the won't or can't. That's dumb.I like the speaker addition. This was always a cool function with the Wiimote (a thing it had over other controllers at that time) and now Sony has it as well. This gives developers the ability to play 1 thing over the controller and another over other speakers (audio logs in KILLZONE for example). Also has a built in stereo headphone jack. XBOX ONE controller - you have to buy some extra thing for this and it sticks out, adds major girth and is obtrusive...The clickable touchpad is a great addition. As much controller real estate as it consumes, it's still relatively out of the way. I wonder if they could even improve it more and make it a TOUCHSCREEN! Maybe down the road when the added costs wouldn't be prohibitive.The sticks are much improved, less floaty and wobbly.The SIXAXIS gyro thing was the only benefit the PS3 controller had over the 360 in my opinion...and I believe this tech was changed for the PS4. But so far I haven't played anything that uses it, so I can't comment on it...It was always a cool function but most games never used it and a few that tried to implement it in a serious fashion made gamers hate it and wish it was dead (LAIR).One of the dumber things about PS3 was that the trigger buttons were often not used AS TRIGGERS in shooters - the shoulder buttons were instead confoundedly used for this. As someone that is fairly console neutral, I can't tell you how annoying it is to pop in a shooter, proceed to hit THAT BIG THING THAT LOOKS LIKE A FREAKING TRIGGER ON A GUN to shoot an alien or whatever-it-is and instead a grenade or some other dumb thing pops out. The PS3 trigger buttons themselves were horrible anyway. Holding them down would cause the entire controller to move which is NOT what you want in a twitch shooter or intensely hard gaming session. Somebody at Sony apparently got a brain and fixed all this...Note, there are no real PS4 unimprovements, the way there are with the ONE (other than the lightbar annoyance - which doesn't personally annoy me).Other than turning the touchpad into a touchscreen, the only way I could imagine they could improve this thing is to add a microphone...PS4 CONTROLLER FOR THE WIN.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0009ENA2W","description":"In Meteos you're the last line of defense, in a bad case of planetary overload. As blocks drop down on the lower screen, you must use the DS's stylus to match up blocks of the same color. Once you have enough blocks connected, they'll shoot back up into the sky to form planets on the upper screen.","reviewerName":"bixodoido","summary":"One of the best puzzle games for the DS","reviewText":"Meteos is a game that stands head and shoulders above most of the other puzzle games on the DS.  When you consider just how many puzzlers exist for the DS you'll realize that's a pretty strong statement, but of all the puzzlers I've seen and played for the handheld system I'd rank Meteos very near the top.Audience:  This is a puzzle game that requires fast reflexes and the ability to use the stylus with some precision.  It probably won't be for everyone since coordination (or lack thereof) with the stylus is such a big part of the game.  Still, any fan of puzzle games or anyone who likes Tetris or just wants something to kill a little time should find this game appealing.Graphics and Sound:  The graphics on this game are excellent.  It would seem that graphics wouldn't make much of a difference for a puzzle game, but the great graphics for Meteos would suggest otherwise.  The blocks vary from planet to planet but all look great, the cutscenes and background from space are very attractive, and the animations and explosions are very well done.  The soundtrack is also very good.Gameplay:  While the basic gameplay for Meteos is very simple it, like all great puzzle games, takes a long time to fully master.  The concept is easy to get the hang of--you can drag blocks up or down in columns using the stylus to line up groups of 3 (either horizontally or vertically).  Lining 3 blocks up 'ignites' them, meaning they explode and the blocks above them are propelled upwards.  The object is to send as many blocks as possible up, and once they reach the top of the screen they disappear and are \"collected,\" both as a means for keeping score on whatever stage you're on and also for future use.Meteos you've 'collected' are saved according to color (each color represents an element or basic material) and stored for future use. You can use these meteos, acquired from any of the many gameplay modes, to 'create' (unlock) new planets, items, and rare materials.  Each planet has a different composition of materials, a different gravitational pull (this affects the blocks you send into the sky when you ignite a row of 3 meteos), and offers a very different experience, so these planets are worth unlocking.Control: This game is played entirely with the DS stylus.  Whereas some games seem to throw stylus control in as an afterthought, the whole gameplay of Meteos revolves around it.  Precision is very necessary when using the stylus for this game, however, and at times I find myself grabbing the wrong block.Challenge:  There are so many modes of gameplay available in Meteos that there is always something challenging to do.  You can scale the difficulty in many of the games, though with some of them the blocks just keep getting faster and faster until you eventually lose.  Some modes are actually pretty easy, but some offer such a challenge that I'm not sure how anyone can handle the highest difficulty settings.Multiplayer: Up to 4 people can play with one cartridge.  I consider this a must with puzzle games like this, and Meteos delivers.Meteos is definitely one of those must own games if you're into puzzlers, and should be at least considered by anyone who owns a DS.  This game is relatively difficult to find as of this writing, and for good reason--it's an absolute classic.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2007"}

After playing more than 10 games for each title I have to say ESPN NFL 2K5 is better.ESPN has better presentation. Madden's presentation is lame. The play menu takes up more than half of the bottom TV screen, so you all see is players' top half, their legs looks chopped off. To make things worse, whenever you scroll thru the playbook the action gets paused a bit which makes all action choppy. ESPN has better looking cheerleaders and they do different things. Madden's cheerleaders have only one look type and she is ugly and has Bugs Bunny teeth and its the same sorry ass scene everytime. Madden's game intro always show players with their helmets on during pre-game exercise, ESPN players have face and hair!! ESPN's replay engine is better too, it shows the entire play, unlike Madden's which shows pieces of play.Graphically ESPN is better. You can see vent holes on players' jersey. Madden's stadium/background graphic is a bit more clean, for example the banners and jumbotrons look sharper but this is because Madden's camera engine has NO side and iso views. ESPN has side and iso views, so its understandable that the stadium/background graphic is lesser, but just a bit if any. ESPN's animation is smooth. In Madden 2005 the animation is often choppy. Especially in demo mode.Both games are not perfect, both have bad and good points.Gameplaywise Madden is very arcadey, it kinda plays like Madden on Genesis. On offense you can zip your pass for completion almost everytime in any situation, even into the mass pile of players at the line of scrimmage. You can basically complete your pass to anyone anytime. ESPN's gameplay is more simulation and realistic, you can't zip your pass like Madden else it will be incomplete or intercepted. You have to read the player's route and wait for the right time to pass. In Madden, quarterbacks pass to the receiver; In ESPN, quarterbacks pass to \"the spot\" of the route. Running game in Madden is horrible, you get tackled when you get near opposing players. Madden's running game feels like flag football. The running game in Madden just simply don't work that well. ESPN's running game is much better and realistic, you can bump off, spin, and power your way thru other players. Overall ESPN's passing and running game has good balance and both can and will be used in games. In Madden the passing game dwarfs the glitched running game.Another thing I noticed is that ESPN has more player pictures! Roethlisberger and Eli Manning got pics in ESPN but none in Madden.I purchased Madden 2005 because of the price drop. I was not impressed with Madden so I purchased NFL 2K5 for $20 the same night(even after so many months since its release). Im glad that I tried ESPN 2k5, it is better than Madden 2005.

There are no action games that match the speed and energy that radiate from the gameplay of this PS2 MASTERPIECE.  This mech game is sure to please any adventure game enthusiast that is looking for a quick quest.  Why do I say quick?  It is unfortunate to say that the game is rather short.  The first time I beat it, it took me about 5 hours, and I've played adventure games that have taken twice as long, and even longer than that.  It is very sad that such a brilliant piece of gaming art had to turn out to be so terse; however it is definately worth every penny that one may spend to purchase this game.Bottom line.....this game is GOOOOOOOOOOD!!!

Players will find familiar names like Glass Joe, King Hippo and trainer Doc Louis. These boxers come to life again in cell-shaded 3-D, complete with hilarious fighting animations and backstories that capture all the fun and flair of the originalPunch-Out!!games.The Wii's Motion SensitivityThe motion-sensitive controls of the Wii console mean that when players throw punches, Little Mac throws punches as well. Additionally, you can control hooks and jabs by combining motion control with control-stick movement. The motion-sensing Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers turn real-life swings into on-screen punches, so anyone can play. The game can also be played with classic NES-style controls by turning the Wii Remote sideways.CharactersPunch-Out!!features a total of 13 opponents for Little Mac to step into the ring with. 12 of which are returning from previous games in thePunch-Out!!series. Each have their own backstory and patterns of attacks to learn and learn to counter. Just a few of the characters you can expect to see are:Little MacSmall but extremely game, Little Mac is a young, up-and-coming fighter, who with the help of his trainer, ex-champion Doc Lewis, has set his sights on working his way through the ranks.Glass JoeA fearful French fighter due to his extremely weak chin, Glass Joe will crumple to the mat quickly with just a few well-placed shots, making him an easy mark and a good warm-up for the fighters to follow.King HippoKing Hippo is both huge and an immensely powerful fighter, but can be weakened with the right combinations to the head and body, giving you time to go for the knockout if you can survive his onslaught.Von KaiserAn old-timey fighter whose rumored childhood difficulties have left him eager to dish out punishment in the ring, Von Kaiser is a dangerous opponent, but one who will turn tail if you can find his weakness.Special AttacksPlayers can obtain special 'Star Punches,' which allow Little Mac to take more health from his rival in a single punch. Players can now use multiple stars in a single punch for an extra-powerful attack.Controller OptionsPunch-Out!!features multiple controller options. For players looking to take advantage of the Wii's motion control capabilities,Punch-Out!!uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers to simulate throwing punches. Use the Nunchuck to throw a left punch and the Wii Remote to throw a right punch. Fans of the NES version and core gamers will be excited to see Nintendo has also included the option to playPunch-Out!!using the classic layout from the original NES controller. Use the 1 and 2 buttons along with the cross pad to throw hooks and jabs or to dodge.","reviewerName":"E. David Swan","summary":"The Mac Attack is Back","reviewText":"Punch-Out!! has to be the one Nintendo game that most needed to be redone. I absolutely cannot understand why the big `N' skipped two whole platforms before releasing a new version. Why wasn't Punch-Out!! ported to the DS? We know it can handle Super NES games. Oh well, Punch-Out!! is finally back and I love it. Let me start by saying that Nintendo didn't screw this one up although I can't say that it felt like 1984 again. The technological leap is pretty dramatic and visually it feels like a whole new experience. On the other hand it takes players back with old school pattern recognition and from a control standpoint it's a near clone of the NES Punch-Out!!The characters look fantastic but I was a little disappointed by the opponent's intro's that consisted of nothing more than four still images. On the other hand the characters voices are absolutely hilarious. King Hippo has a voice that sounds like a cross between a grunt and a belch. The line-up of fighters is less then what was in the Super NES version but it's still impressive. I might have liked to have seen Pizza Pasta but no lineup short of every character ever made would have been perfect. The only new character is Disco Kid whose is essentially the new Kid Quick. The lack of new characters shows a little failure of imagination on the part of Next Level Games but such is life. Despite any issues I might have this is a game I really did not want to stop playing and that is about as much as I can demand. The sound of glove on face is positively magical and when Glass Joe went down I wanted him back to his feet so I could continue to deliver more punishment. In fact it is the fighting that Next Level Games really nailed. The first time I fought Don Flamenco he cleaned my clock but I stayed with it until I beat him. I never felt frustrated and the success of planting his Spanish rear on the canvas was outstanding.The opponents in Punch-Out!! move in a predictable pattern but this is definitely to the games benefit. Unlike other fighting games you cannot just mash buttons and win. In games like Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat and Soul Caliber I could often win early battles with my eyes shut tightly. You can't even beat Glass Joe that way. Punch-Out!! requires steely concentration. There is also a sense of discovery in hunting down fighters weaknesses. Great Tiger was plastering me until I found out then when he leans for an upper cut I need to lean the same direction to avoid his punch and when Bear Hugger tries to hug me I can avoid by ducking down and then giving him a shot to the belly.Punch-Out!! isn't going to win any innovation awards but what it does is take old fashioned timing and pattern recognition and perfect it. It is essentially the classic Punch-Out!! with a massive facelift. Now if we could just convince Nintendo that Punch-Out!! needs to come out with every new platform life would be just a little bit better. And while Nintendo is at it where is Wave Race for the Wii?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2009"}

When the game finally released, I was happy to get it day one, but a couple of days into the game, I discovered that the demo was all the game had to offer from the single player perspective - that is, the mechanics and elements never veer from the pattern.The multi-player elements make this game really interesting.  While it's not the best experience for this type of game, there is the sacrifice system that keeps things lively.  Other players can choose to sacrifice you in order to do devastating attacks, even against your will - but you will be rewarded for it.Overall, the game is at it's best in short sessions, and the portable platform was definitely the correct route for this title.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0000503MO","description":"The third title of the Gran Turismo series takes full advantage of the new PlayStation2 game engine, which is capable of rendering about 20 million polygons per second--roughly 10 times the number of total polygons of the series' previous installment,Gran Turismo 2. Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course. They don't drive perfectly, either; some will spin out and make other mistakes over the course of a race.","reviewerName":"Hadi Jones \"The Tree\"","summary":"Still haven't finished playing it.","reviewText":"This game is unique in every way.

Everything about this game is better than the first.  You get better graphics, better gameplay, and the story is just awesome.  It's a short game and I completed it on normal in about 6-7 hours.  Some people miss the co-op campaign but I think it was removed for the better.  Each character now has a special set of challenges that wouldn't have been possible with co-op.  You really do get more diverse gameplay.The multi-player mode is vastly improved and all the maps are fun.  They are not too big but big enough to offer a challenging landscape.  With endless customization everyone can have their own unique look.  High Moon is going to release a lot of DLC for characters so save up some money if you are into that sort of thing.The only thing I would say is a downgrade is Escalation.  My friend and I loved to play that horde mode and we could play for hours.  The new escalation mode is limited to 15 waves, and we beat all those maps the first time we played.  The AI is a lot smarter, and now they don't bum rush, but instead they hide behind walls and shoot, or snipe you from a distance.  it's definitely a lot harder, and if you play it on hard, it is a challenge.  You can now upgrade your weapons and the whole team receives the upgrades, but the level 4 upgrade costs 10,000 points. You can't even get that many points to level up to Lvl 4 until wave 13 of 15.  I really hope they unlock the horde mode to unlimited waves.All in all, this is an awesome game and High Moon did the TF community proud.  It's got special touches that many older fans will appreciate.  I highly recommend this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2012"}

Weapons of mass destruction, deployed with complete impunity razed the land in the blink of an eye. The dire situation forced the two opposing factions to negotiate a cease-fire and an agreement was quickly reached, but although the war may have ended, its effects remained. With the deteriorating environment, Earth's population was drastically reduced and those who survived lived a confined existence trapped in underground cities. Eventually countries joined together to form the Greater United Nations and turned their eyes skyward, to space. With the establishment of the USTA, the Universal Science and Technology Administration, man began to seek new worlds beyond the stars.AD 2087...The first year of the spacedate (SD) calendar. Thanks to the success of Professor Trillas Bachstein's warp drive experiments, mankind's dream of a spacebourne existence has inched closer to reality and the USTA secretly began to implement its SRF project, the Space Reconnaissance Force. Now it is SD 0010, and the first official SRF mission and your adventure has begun.CharactersPlayers ofStar Ocean: The Last Hopewill meet and interact with a wealth of characters from different parts of the galaxy, each with their own history and weapons of choice. Just a few of the more prominent characters to familiarize yourself with include:Edge MaverickAlthough generally possessing good judgment, this young Earthling commander of the maiden deep space voyage of the SRF ship the Calnus, can be reckless. His signature weapon is the sword.Faize Sheifa BelethA young Eldarian committed to etiquette and logic, and capable of astounding feats of engineering, Faize is always honorable of those possessing abilities he lacks. His signature weapon is the rapier.Reimi SaionjiThe kind and levelheaded navigator of the Calnus, Reimi was born in an aristocratic Saionji family and has a shared history with Edge back on Earth. Her signature weapon is the bow.Lymle Lemuri PhiOrphaned on her home planet of Lemrick long ago, Lymle is mischievous, but friendly and inexplicably retains the appearance of a young girl. Her signature weapon is the wand.Gameplay and CombatAlthough Edge Maverick is the main character inStar Ocean: The Last Hope, players will of course experience gameplay action in the form of a number of different characters and utilize the signature attacks assigned to each. The game features a real-time combat system which allows for up to four party members to remain active in battle at a time. Improvements to the game's combat system include 'Rush Mode,' where players can switch out active members of their combat groups for reserve members in real-time; 'Sight In/Sight Out' which allows for timed evasive and counter moves against enemies; and the BEAT (Battle Enhancement Attribute Type) system, through which players can change a character's fighting style at will. Other actions players will master through gameplay include piloting of the spaceship Calnus, a first in theStar Oceanseries; item creation in the form of weapons, healing items and accessories; and Private Actions (PAs), a cause and effect relationship between character in-game actions and the acquisition of new abilities and scenarios. Through the increased flexibility mastery of all these skills provides, players should be able to more easily increase their team and individual team member's combat experience and status, and so unlock more advanced combat styles and linked combinations.Key Game Features:Series prequel-Star Ocean: The Last Hopeis a prequel in the classic series, combining sci-fi and fantasy elements, spanning multiple planets and the vastness of space itself to recount the origins of the Star Ocean universe.Exciting Battles- Exhilarating combat expands upon the franchise's famous real-time battle system, including the amazing graphics and visual effects only possible on Xbox 360.Compelling Scenes- The game features breathtaking CG movies by Visual Works, the cutting-edge studio whose previous work includes cutscenes for the acclaimed Final Fantasy RPG series.","reviewerName":"S. Posey","summary":"Star Ocean: Last Hope Review","reviewText":"Having never played a Star Ocean game before, I was a little iffy about picking this one up. I didn't know if it would be another Final Fantasy clone or really stand out amongst the masses of JRPG games that have been hitting the 360 lately. After checking out some pretty decent reviews, I decided to take the leap and pick up the game on a whim.From the start of the game, I got the feeling that the combat would be a lot like Tales of Vesperia. This is a good thing, as I loved every minute of Tales and for a game to bring up memories of a favorite is definitely a plus. The combat is similar, but not exactly the same. Where Tales used a lot of one button (maybe 2 button) presses to take down most enemies, Star Ocean at least involves a little more strategy. You can whip yourself around bad guys when they least expect it (blindside move) and attack from their rear, issue orders, etc. There's a lot going on in combat, but it's not hard to manage. There are a lot of tools at your disposal, how (or if) you use them, are completely up to you. The combat through the first couple hours of the game remained fresh and exciting, and I actually looked forward to getting new skills and abilities. Where other games kind of throw them at you, I got the feeling SO eases you into them and gives them out a lot less often.The story in this game is different that most RPGs I have played (remember, I never played the other Star Ocean games). The world suffered after World War 3 and sent explorers into the heavens to find a new home for Earthlings. You play Edge Maverick, one of the chosen explorers on the maiden voyage. That's about all you need to know to get started in the game. Like all games though, something has to go horribly wrong and it does, thus throwing you right into the action (if after a pretty long cutscene). There is a support character, named Reimi, who is your childhood bestfriend. The relationship between the two is definitely going to make for some interesting story elements. While they aren't \"in love\", they do have a very deep bond between the two of them. As time goes on, it looks like a love interest could form between the two given the right circumstances. And by circumstances, I mean user inputted actions. I didn't realize this was something the series does, but you control the feelings of people towards you (to a degree). For instance, in the first level, you stumble upon a flower patch. Reimi looks at the flowers and says they are beautiful. You are given 3 options to respond... \"They are beautiful\", \"You are beautiful\", \"You are both beautiful\". Obviously, being a chick, she want's to hear number 2 and if you choose that, you are going to increase the affinity between you and Reimi. If you chose the flowers are beautiful, Reimi may be insulted and the affinity between the two of you will decrease. With increased affinity comes increased cut scenes and pivotal moments between the characters (this doesn't just happen with Reimi, you can form bonds with all characters). When an affinity reaches a high enough level, guys and girls can share a room together...leaving the rest up to the imagination.Graphics are a big thing for me. I love the direction current genre games are taking graphics. Tales of Vesperia was a great looking game, but I'm not too big into the anime scene. Last Remnant was a decent looking game, that had trouble performing/loading. Star Ocean on the other hand, looks great. It's nothing to write home about (a la Gears, MGS, or Killzone 2) but it's a very good looking game! Although the characters do show some anime sides to them (namely the eyes), it's easy to look past because they have normal sized features. But, anime might be your thing so that comment is just opinion. The worlds are varied and the colors are really pretty in some areas. You may not have many stop and smell the roses moments, but you will enjoy the ambiance.Overall, I'm loving Star Ocean: The Last Hope. It's the perfect RPG to hold us fans over until FF13 comes out this year (or next). If you love collecting things, there's a ton of things for you to do. From enemy data, to battle trophies, room items, ship data, spells, it's all there. It's a collector's dream. Finishing this game is said to take around 40-60 hours, but if you want to complete it in it's entirety (all endings, all collectibles, etc.), chalk on another 30-40.If you are a fan of games such as Tales of Vesperia, Last Remnant, and other JRPGs, you're going to love this game. If you are more of a western RPG fan (Mass Effect, Fallout 3) like myself, give this one a try. It's got the sci-fi thing going for it and the combat is very fresh. Battles are in real time and fun. Who knows, maybe it will reawaken your love for JRPGs.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2009"}

The people of Haven City have grown to distrust Jak's dark powers, and as rumors boil of Jak's ties with Krew and Kor, the city blames Jak for its current woeful circumstances. When the palace is destroyed by a surprise Metal Head attack, even Ashelin cannot protect Jak as the High Council's power broker, Count Veger, forces Jak into banishment to the desolate Wasteland. Jak is flown to the harsh island and dumped. With Daxter and Pecker bravely by his side, the three begin their next adventure where the battle for the city has just begun.Five times the size of Haven City, the Wasteland is a desert environment with multiple areas including mines and a volcano. Given the enormity and variance in terrain, vehicles play a large role as off-road transportation is introduced, fueled by a true-to-life physics engine. With a rugged new look and suited with armor, Jak is also equipped with an arsenal of new weapons with upgradeable mods that enable players to increase their firepower and enjoy the freedom to strategize and activate their arsenal at any time.As Jak has been exposed to Light Eco, players can now experience Jak's magnificent transformation to Light Jak. With a glowing electric blue aura and a massive wing span, Light Jak introduces new move sets, including the ability to glide great distances, emit an energy to block enemy attack, and power up at anytime, all of which provide the player with a sense of being invincible. Dark Jak also returns with more capabilities, forcing Jak to find a balance between light and dark.Additionally, game developer Naughty Dog continues to push the genre forward with the introduction of new technology. For the first time in the franchise, enemies feature realistic ragdoll physics, which will allow gamers to witness a unique death for each enemy that is killed. Naughty Dog has also implemented independent cloth movement technology and enhanced the enemy artificial intelligence (AI) with wall climbing and smart formation capabilities.","reviewerName":"XDanteX","summary":"Great Game Series","reviewText":"The Jak & Daxter series is one of the best platform adventure series of video games around.

Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well.

Terrorists operate openly, killing thousands; drugs, disease, and pollution kill even more. The world's economics are close to collapse, and the gap between the insanely wealthy and the desperately poor has grown to the size of the Grand Canyon. Worst of all, an ages-old conspiracy bent on world domination has decided that the time is right to emerge from the shadows and take control. No one believes the conspiracy exists--no one but you.In this thrilling role-playing adventure, you play the part of J.C. Denton, a powerful, nanotechnologically augmented antiterrorist agent. It's up to you to stop the conspirators from achieving their goals. But this world is full of lies and betrayal, a world where nothing is as it seems and entire nations can seemingly be turned against you at the push of a button. To succeed, you must travel the globe in a quest for knowledge, develop your character's nanotech augmentations and strengths as you see fit, build a network of allies to assist you, and determine when stealth and strategy are more important than action. And each time you think you've got the mystery solved, the game figured out, there's another, deeper mystery to be unraveled.

And all I can say is &quot;wow.&quot;Following the tried-and-true format of government conspiracies and viruses gone awry, Deus Ex places you in the futuristic role of JC Denton, an agent for a United Nations Anti-Terrorist Group (UNATCO) who has been augmented w/ superhuman abilities. Immediately, you are taken through a training mission and from there, it's off rescuing Liberty Island, your brother, and eventually, the entire human race. The game is slickly placed, starting slow and then moving into an elusive &quot;who-do-I-trust&quot; mode. Although the game progresses in linear format, HOW you get to the next mission is entirely up to you. For example, if you need to find a way into a warehouse but don't have the computer key code, you can simply blow up the door. Or, find a secret entrance through the basement. With Deus Ex, you're never stuck trying to figure out where to go next or how to do it.  A log is kept of all conversations and any other important information you may need, so you'll never be in a scramble looking for that crumpled Post-It note that had the lock code scrawled on it.

The most unique function of this controller, and the reason to why I bought this in the end, was thanks to the blue LEDs inside the clear controller. The button to turn on/off the LEDs in the controller are located in the back of the controller, near the grip. It's a tiny black button that has a few settings: On, Off, and Vibrate (every time your controller vibrates, the LEDs will flash. Pretty cool in my opinion)And yes, this works with PC games and/or PC use (with the proper program for PC use) But most games will come with gamepad ready features, allowing you to just plug in and play. I have used this feature and found it awesome to play L4D2 and Saints Row 3 on my PC with this controller!I liked this controller and it lasted for a good year before I faced any problems with it. As the year went on, I slowly noticed the left thumbstick's skin was peeling off, and I eventually had too pull it off, shortly after that, the thumbstick slowly broke apart piece by piece upon use, leaving a weird crescent shaped skinless analog stick. Now I did get used that personal problem, but alas the day I feared most had fallen upon me: The day the USB wire got weakened. This had happened to my previous wired controller, so I wasn't caught off guard.

Neither of those XBox games will play on the 360, so it's well worth getting this new version!You are Jack Carver, a marine who was a quiet boat captain, but ended up under attack on a remote tropical island. You're luckily very good with knives, guns and anything else you get your hands on. You're in this alone, so there's a lot of sneaking around, taking out enemies and lurking in the shadows.On the Predator version you have to play through the first game (Far Cry Instincts) before you unlock the sequel (Far Cry Instincts Evolution) which makes sense to me, although it could prove frustrating for people who have already played Instincts and want to get right to Part 2.The graphics are really nice on the 360 - they've definitely been updated from the original XBox version. Still, they aren't quite as stellar as some other XBox 360 releases. I suppose it's always hard porting a game up, to use the same code but make it look \"nicer\" without spending years doing it. Still, it looks more like XBox + instead of XBox 360. Still, it's nice to see the grasses swaying in the wind and the dappled shadows playing across the sand.The sound is rather well done. You get the chirping of jungle birds, the hollow footsteps on planks, the crackle of radio transmission. There isn't a pounding rock soundtrack, which I really appreciate. If I'm a covert soldier creeping through vegetation, I want to be listening as hard as I can for odd noises - not having to screen out the fake music.The game does give you objectives as you go along, but how you achieve those objectives is pretty much up to you. You can race in with guns blazing, sneak in quietly through the woods, march up the main path, or any other option you can think up. While the game is relatively short (a few days to finish) this also means that you can replay quite a bit, trying out other options and seeing what happens.Of course, single player mode is just the beginning - it's only a training ground. Check out the incredible map editor, and go online to play your own custom maps LIVE against other skilled players 24 hours a day. It's this aspect that makes the game truly stellar, and one you could play for months without getting bored.Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2006"}

{"product_name":"B0050SZC5U","description":"","reviewerName":"Mr.Chunky Monkey","summary":"Excellent Addicting Experience and OK Collector's Edition","reviewText":"OPINION ON REVIEWING:If you are looking at the review section of Diablo III on Amazon and wonder why all the negative reviews, and why all the complaining? Is this game actually bad? No, the game is not bad, and many of the reviews are simply from disgruntled people who vote down the product because they do not like how Blizzard uses tough measures against piracy by requiring constant internet connection for playing single player, not just for multiplayer. To be fair there are some long and elaborate negative reviews for Diablo III, which actually review the game, content, and gameplay. Those are ok. Read them if you want a fair opinion.  But the majority of the 1 star reviews are simply posted in protest of the publisher developer's practices. If you look at them you can see whether it says \"Amazon Verified Purchase\" next to the 1 star reviews. Not surprisingly they are not. Thing is there is an active community of players over the world. They congregate in some forums where sometimes they are told and encouraged to go and leave a negative review for some games on sites such as Amazon because you do not have to have purchased the game here to leave a review.There are also many reviews from the first week of the game's release which are negative because the servers were down. I'd actually say those are legitimate negative reviews because people wanted to play single player and were barred from it over that week's weekend. However if you wanted more fair reviews of the gameplay itself you should check the aggregate reviews of the game from sites like metacritic and gamerankings and look for average score from professional review websites, which is about 85% , not from disgruntled fans. Even if one were to believe that the \"professional\" review sites were bribed into giving this game higher scores, there is no way it deserves 1 star out of 5, so the rational thing would be just ignore those that are from people who have not purchased the game here on Amazon. Just my opinion.COMMENTS ABOUT THE GAME:Now for the game itself. I must say I am very happy with it. Of course it is not the same as Diablo II and by that I do not mean it is worse. You get a bunch of classes to choose from such as Barbarian, Monk, Witch Doctor etc. You get to choose whether it is a male or a female. Not too much customization there. However, each of the characters you pick has their own mini story and dialogue that unravels through the game. You do not get to pick moral decisions like in D&D; rpgs, it is just not that. For each of the characters you get a rather diverse skill tree and unique skill modifiers in form of runes. However, none of these skills that you unlock as you play are set permanently. You are allowed to redistribute your abilities to try out for the best combos you want. Biggest focus is on finding and managing the exotic and rare weapons. They may not seem as vital at first because if you've just installed and began to play the game, it may be kind of easy until you go further in. When the enemies get tougher you'll start to pay attention to weapons and that is where the focus of this Diablo installment is. You are also given the ability to \"forge\" your own weapons\" but sometimes it is pointless because you are not able to forget that very rare super weapon anyway. It does help when you cannot find appropriate armor for your level however.One feature I enjoyed when playing single player is I that the chest and the items you find are carried over to another playthrough if you start another campaign with an entirely different character. The gold you collect is shared as well. It is helpful because it may encourage the player to replay the game with other characters and find use for that one rare item you may have found as a Barbarian but weren't able to use because it was \"Wizard Only\"Graphics options give a wide variety of settings. This is nice because looks like Blizzard wanted as many players as possible to be able to play Diablo III without upgrading their rig. My PC can run the game on above average settings, but sometimes I prefer the low graphics, high performance mode simply because I like stable framerate without occasional slow downs.COMMENTS ON THE COLLECTOR'S EDITION:I rarely buy collector's editions of games, but a friend recommended I buy it this time. Honestly the package is pretty nice. You get the documentary with the developers talking about game creation. The soundtrack. You get a decorative USB holder that looks like Diablo's skull, and a USB drive shaped like a shard, which contains DIABLO II and and LORD OF DESTRUCTION expansion (No Diablo I) It is strange because it would cost the company nothing to include Diablo I as well. There is a huge album with drawings, but I did not unwrap it. You also get codes for few decorative items for your character for in-game use. It is angel wings and 2 dyes. They seem pretty useless if you ask me.The USB and the USB stand are nice souvenirs and the box itself which contains the collector's edition is huge. It is literally same size as the white XBOX. For collector's it is a must because the skull souvenir is well made. But I think I'd rather have bought the standard edition.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0002BJQDY","description":"Guild Warstakes the best elements of today's massively multiplayer online games and combines them with a new mission-based design that eliminates the tedium of those games. You can meet new friends in towns or outposts, form a party, and then go tackle a quest together. Your party always has its own unique copy of the quest map, so camping, kill-stealing, and long lines to complete quests are all things of the past. Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder.You don't have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don't have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you've previously unlocked. You'll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn't allow bad decisions to ruin a character. And you'll never meet new players only to discover that you can't play with them or compete against them because their characters are on a different server than yours; in Guild Wars, all characters live in one seamless world.Built for CompetitionAfter learning the game and building up your first character, you may choose to test your skills in head-to-head competition or guild warfare. The game is designed to reward player skill and teamwork, not time spent playing, so you won't need to spend hundreds of hours leveling up your character to compete.The game includes integrated support for guilds, with guild banners and halls, chat rooms and forums. Guilds can challenge other guilds to battle, compete for control of key parts of the world, and be ranked on a worldwide ladder.Unique Streaming TechnologyArenaNet's unique streaming technology forever eliminates the concept of patching a game. You don't have to wait a month for the next big patch to experience new content. Instead, the game constantly and intelligently streams new content to your computer in the background while you play. The world can change continually. This allows us to build a much more dynamic game world than any that has existed before.","reviewerName":"Liu Kang","summary":"Free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","reviewText":"Guild Wars takes MMO to a new level.

{"product_name":"B000FRU0NU","reviewerName":"bixodoido","summary":"Great game, but not all it could have been","reviewText":"I'm not sure any game ever made could have lived up to the incredible hype piled on Halo 3, and it's worth bearing that in mind when considering the merits of this game.  That having been said, Halo 3 doesn't break a whole lot of new ground, and much of the game feels like more of the same, though in this case that 'same' is something very worthwhile.  People pick apart and criticize various parts of the game, but many of those same people are online all the time playing this thing like crazy anyway.  Here are some things to consider:THE CAMPAIGN: Okay, so Halo 3's campaign is pretty uninspiring.  The graphics are breathtaking at times and there are several moments of lighthearted dialogue (both the marines and the Covenant say some very funny things if you listen closely), but ultimately the campaign is just about shooting and blowing stuff up while you move toward some sort of relatively bland objective.  The depth of the campaign leaves much to be desired, no doubt about it.Still, I love playing the campaign.  Why?  Simply because there are so many options.  First is the option to play 4 player co-op online.  You can ratchet the difficulty up and blast your way through, and it's a lot of fun.  The game contains several \"skulls,\" which you have to find and which you can activate while playing campaign missions to give your enemy various enhanced abilities (better armor, more grenades, the ability to dodge your grenades, etc).  There is also a meta game where you're scored based on the time it takes you to clear the level, how many times you die, and the style with which you dispatch your enemies.  Skulls give multipliers to your score, as does turning up the difficulty.  There are achievements associated with high meta game scores as well.  This, to me at least, gives the campaign some replay value, which is a good thing since the storyline isn't engaging enough to make me want to play through it again alone.ONLINE MULTIPLAYER: Many people argue this is the true essence of Halo, and in that Halo 3 delivers...well, mostly.  The game offers some great multiplayer maps, some fun weapons, great team modes, and the ability to edit maps to your liking through the Forge.  You can unlock new armor, customize your appearance, and track your service record as you increase in the game's ranking system.  Still, the multiplayer isn't without its drawbacks.  It seems strange that ranked Lone Wolf matches have only 5 players, for example, and that most of the team modes in ranked play have 8 players (4 to a side) when the game supports up to 16.  These are minor complaints and can be resolved with some time and tweaking, and ultimately the fact remains that multiplayer in Halo 3 is a lot of fun.Another note--whenever you play Halo 3, be it during campaign or in multiplayer mode, a temporary video of your game is taken, and you can view, edit, and permanently save these videos after your game (otherwise they're deleted).  You can also share videos and screenshots of your exploits.  Nice touch.Overall I think Halo 3 is a great game.  Is it monumental?  Maybe not, but it should have some great staying power and be a lot of fun to play for some time.  While I can understand the complaints people make about the game I don't think it's enough to ruin the Halo experience.  If your only desire is to play the campaign on single player I'd recommend renting this one before you buy it, but if you want Halo for any sort of multiplayer action I'd say this one is worth owning.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2007"}

Fighter Within, Dead Rising 3 and Ryse.  Out of all of them, Rise is my favorite.  As far as graphics go.  It is the best looking One game I've played.  Everything looks so crisp and clean.  Reminds me of Knack.  The voice work is well done as are the cut scenes.  I am having fun playing the game.That being said, there are some things that annoy me and kind of make me wish I had waited until I could get this for, say $29.99.  First, while things do look great, so many times I have gotten lost.  Not just running around, but while fighting.  Every single thing in this game blends together.  There will be five guys fighting me and they all get lost in the background.  It gets annoying.  The camera always feels off.  It is like I am to far away or not on the right angle.  I can not think of another way to explain it.  As easy as it is to move around, the fighting can get annoying.  I mean, I go to hit and hit a button that makes the guy hit his weapon and shield together.  I will go to fight another enemy and just stand there facing nothing.  It seems that at times, the controls just do not respond.  As far as the story goes, I have no clue what is going on.  I listen, it just isn't important.  I guess that is the reason.  Plus, something that seems to haunt every Xbox One game, the load times.  After like the fifth time I've died and had to sit there for like 60 seconds, I just do not care about it anymore.  The time it takes for the actual game to start is even worse.Update.Ok, I finished the game.  It was very simple.  Hit, guard, hit, guard.  That was it.  You can upgrade.  Well, once you get points, you can buy the upgrades.  They go to level 4.  They seem to want you to spend money to upgrade.  I think it is $3.99 for the points or something.  I am not one who likes paying for stuff in a game.  So after I finished the game, instead of selling it as I was going to and since I am getting my new Mac Pro next month, thus not really wanting to start a new game since I will be spending all my time learning how to use that thing, I decided to play to unlock the last two things I needed.  I got the points fast.  I realized I can do special attacks by hitting buttons.  I had forgotten about that.  You see a skull above an enemy and you hit R1.  Then you see them turn a color and hit the controller button that is that color.  Simple.  Plus, I can try to get the hidden stuff.  What it is for I have no clue.  But it is something to do.  Plus, I can get more points on my gamertag by doing more stuff.  The problem I am having now is that the game is SUPER buggy.  Once, there were enemies standing across the way on the side of a building.  I went to hit them with my spear (throw it at them) and the camera just went crazy and looked down.  Stopping me from being able to see them.  Other times I will go to break a pot.  You get points for doing that as well.  I will hit the thing and it does not break.  After like a minute of me hitting, it breaks.  This did not happen the first time.  But it is so buggy now.  It actually makes it almost not worth playing again.  But, I will.  That is all.Update 2:I was playing this again to get the points.  I hate this game.  I switched from a 3 to a 1.  So glitchy.  My guy looks like he took some kind of drugs and is twitching all over the screen.  Then, after the scene is done, the guy goes and does all the animation again, without the sound.  I am SO sick of watching the same cut scenes over and over again.  I 100% hate this game.  Everyone has their own opinion.  Play it.  Maybe you will love it.  But I hate it with a passion.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2014"}

I usually just play the \"Story\" mode because it's cool, well, some very little isn't fighting, so that's why I only rated it 4 stars overall. It's SO much fun. {That's the one I'll say when I review Mortal Kombat Deception. I AM BLOOOODTHIRSTY!!!!! This game has cursed me almost as much as MK: Deadly Alliance did.

The rest of the blood is on the fighters after they've been injured so bad they can probably barely lift a pebble. The end of the game is a little different than that.

The only problem ( and it's a huge one ) with this game is that for some reason the game doesn't save properly and you might lose hours/days of play time.I was a level 19 yeaserday then when I turned my console on today , I find that I have lost most of my rank AND TIME because I was reverted back to a level 9 .Since I do really like this game I started playing again and gained a few ranks then decided to see if my progress was saving so I entered a garage to save my progress then shut my system down. Upon restarting the console and game I found that I have been reverted back to level 9 again !!! I simply cannot get past level 9 !!!I'm going to try playing off line ( with the net completely disconnected ) to see if the game will save like it is supposed to ( directly to the hard drive and not to cloud servers ). If this works I will continue to play and like the game , if it does not I will be sending this back to Amazon for a refund and pick up Forza 5 .EDIT : 6-29-14I tried playing completely off line and it worked.. After I completed an event or anything really , I went to a garage and saved . Now just to be sure it saved I went in and out of the garage 3 times before continuing on to another event. I know this sounds aggravating but it really doesn't take much time.The problem must be on The EA servers because while I'm not connected to their servers the game saves to my hard drive just like it should . I have many other games that automatically save to the cloud while playing and NONE have had the first issue so I really don't think its Microsoft's fault , especially when the ps4 is having the same issues. Its quite a shame EA doesn't fix this problem because it is a five star game if it worked properly.Since we can play this game ( off line ) like the other need for speed games and still have a blast I will upgrade my stars to a 4 star game , if I could play the game as advertised ( ONLINE ) then I would give it a 5 star review.If you don't mind playing offline then I would recommend this game , if not then stay away , you have been warned. I don't mind the offline play one bit because its so much fun without being online.. I must say again , DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE GOING TO PLAY IT ONLINE !!! also just to be sure it saves go in and out of a garage 2 times , just to be sure it saves.. I hope this helps , happy gaming peps :)Edit : 7-1-2014Well I decided to risk it and go online with my game and I was still able to keep my saves with no problem . The only thing I did was before I quit the game I took my console off line and then saved the game and just for good measure I went out of the garage and back in again to make it save again. I turned my console off , went to bed and got up this morning to play again and it worked flawlessly , my saves , rank and everything were just as I left them. So from now on I will be playing the game online but taking it offline to save and exit the game before turning the console off. I just can't believe no one else has tried these steps to get the saves to work. I can't be the only one to have thought of this. So if you want to play online you can , I would just do what I have done to make sure the game saves before turning the console off.1 - Disconnect console from the net.2 - save the game by visiting a garage , do it twice for good measure.3 - Quit the gameThis has worked every time , I tried this numerous times today and havn't lost a bit of my save data.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-28-2014"}

My main system at my house is as wireless as it can be and this just added a nice component to that setup.  You can hide the box pretty easily and go from there.The headphones last for a while and I was surprised at how long I can use them before I need to recharge them.  Recharging is easy and it doesnt take to long before you are off and running wirelessly again.Nice headphones.  You really do need to spend some money if you want to get a decent pair of headphones.  These are a little outside of what I would normally buy but turtle beach does make some nice stuff.  Comes with everything you need in order to hook them up to an Xbox, a ps3 or a mobile device.  Instructions are easy to read and it is easy to set up.  No real complaints.  Sound is very good as well.  Ordering to delivery only took 2 days as well which was pretty nice.

Also you can't shoot without aiming.  In any game if you know how to use a shotgun you don't need to aim which is effective.  Second because I felt like I was more force to use stealth than a mixed approach.  I enjoy stealth games but this game hardly gives a choice, once a zombie hears you they come at you like hordes and once you get grabbed by a clicker zombie your dead. Third after the amazing and interesting intro I expected the game to continue from there.  It probably would of been more exciting because everything just happened and no body knows what the hell is going on and everyone is running for their life and car accidents are happening everywhere.  Instead the game takes place 20 years later.  At least the game should of been half and half.What I enjoyed most about this game is that its a story driven game more like a drama series.  So it feels like your watching an episode and playing a game at the same time.  The Acting and Sound are excellent.  The graphics I can dare say its more than a perfect 10 and its the best for 2013.

Boy was I wrong.  Without boring you on storyline I will say that story and setting really were the most enjoyable element of this game for me.  I enjoyed the uniqueness and the dark undertone as well as the tie-ins to our society.  Without realizing it I found myself drawn into the Rapture world.  The great attention to level design and details and the spectacular voice acting only further buried me in this fantasy realm.  I give the game a solid 5 star rating.In all fairness, Bioshock isn't your typical game.  The absence of solid gun fighting means it isn't an FPS, though it controls like one.  The pacing is also much too slow and story-driven to be in line with most shooters.  I enjoy a good story and find the console world too saturated with shooters already so this was a boon to me.  Bioshock also isn't an RPG.  You can loot, but it is essentially limited to money and a few invention items and you don't keep an Inventory in the RPG sense.  You can upgrade your weapons somewhat (in unique and interesting ways that actually reflect in the appearance of the weapons) but you don't loot bigger and better like you would in a typical RPG.  And this game, with its forgiving death system and plentiful ammo, is certainly not a survival game either.  I've heard it compared to System Shock but having never played that I can't tell you.  If there is a genre for this type of game I've certainly been missing out.If I had to voice a complain it would be that the much-touted moral decisions are not present in the game.

First is the voice acting.  Everyone in the game does a great job except Altair.  You'd think that the main character would be the one they nailed but the voice acting for him is pretty sad.  The second piece is the overall story.  I won't spoil it for you but having all this played out as the \"genetic memory\" of someone isn't really necessary.

Players can drop in and out of each other's games at any time with no loss of progress as well as the ability to continue on alone or with others.Withthousands of weapons in-gameto collect, from simple wooden bats to fire-axes to heavy rifles, Dead Island is a collector's dream. This in combination with Dead Island'sweapon customization systemwill enable the player to craft the ultimate weapon to ensure their survival.The ability to enhance and develop your character usingRPG-like elementsincluding an XP/leveling system and un-lockable skill trees put the power in your hands to create and play a unique protagonist.Dead Island's damage system gives an unprecedented visual detail of the effects of each attack on enemies pushing the boundaries of visualized gore.With anopen-world setting, Banoi is filled to the brim with things to do and objectives to tackle, allowing a fresh way to advance both the characters and story at the same time and providing for endless replay value.","reviewerName":"That Review Guy","summary":"a Solid New I.P. but with Flaws.","reviewText":"I have been very excited for this game and decided to beat the game before writing this review. the graphics are very good and ultra gory, with an atmosphere that will make you jump and often. you really \"feel\" like you're in a zombie invasion and the world as you know it has ended. pockets of survivors huddle in safe areas (sometimes Not so Safe) and they present a great deal of quests and quest rewards ranging from cash and xp to high end weapons and Mods. Mods are very very important to this game so if you're not the crafting type you might want to rent first. at least it isn't complicated or difficult to make or upgrade the items/weapons in the game. workbenches abound throughout the locations so you're never far from one.when you start off the game it's all bright and sunny, you're mostly on the beaches.this changes when you move to act two and go into the city. it's insane there. act 3 is the jungle and calms down a bit but here is where flaws show up. I have a buddy who's game has corrupted data Twice on him now (pre and post patch 1.11)and he had to restart and it always seems to be act three. hasn't happened to me but I've had a few strange glitches. glitches like saving and loading up the next day only to be back about 3-5 hours from where I was. other times I load up or even Die and end up directly transported to the quest objective. so if you can overlook the bugs the game is probably the best melee game to come along in years (think kings field) the skill trees are varied and fun to tinker with. I recommend kicking often as this doesn't use precious stamina as the weapon attacks do. the guns shoot well and quite accurate though I hate the Wobble they added to make it a lil' harder to shoot. overall it's a really fun game with a few minor and one or two big bugs. it's worth the risk. I've had a blast so far!Graphics: 4 of 5 would've givin it a 5 but got rage yesterday and THATS a five.Sound: excellent, moody, creepy and exactly what should be in a game like this 5 stars!Gameplay: aside from the bugs the gameplay is good controls are easy to learn only collision detection could be a little better. weapon selection is wonderful! 4 starsFun: I can't deny the game is a blast to play but I keep thinking while playing \"is my data going to corrupt?\" and that bothers me so 4 stars here too.Overall: a nice first person hack & slash with guns later on. bullets are scarce (really scarce though you can make OR buy them) graphics are great but just shy of perfection. I think I am thankful for this considering how gory it already is (I like gore don't take me the wrong way lol) I only speak of the gore because I know some prefer non gore games. if you're one of those folks you really want to avoid this. everyone else should rent, then buy  :)Buy Dead Island here (Ps3)Dead Islandand the strategy guide is worth the cash but below!Dead Island Official Strategy Guide (Brady Games)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2011"}

Reining \"Old School Zinger\"","summary":"Most fun you can have with your clothes on","reviewText":"Bulletstorm is a rare game for me, in that not only does it earn five stars from me, but it's a first person shooter at that. In the same way that a movie like Shoot 'Em Up is nowhere near the same level as say, Citizen Kane, they are both near flawless movies, but for entirely different reasons. The same is true of Bulletstorm. It is nearly flawless, but a unique type of game, one that you really won't play for the story, because you really won't get a whole lot out of it. But that's okay, because the developers knew this and didn't try to awkwardly insert any kind of real seriousness into the game. Bulletstorm is over the top in pretty much every single way. It's extremely vulgar, violent and bloody, and it's fantastic.The game takes place on a resort planet, overrun by mutated humans as well as the locals (and even the fauna) after your ship crash lands there post space battle with a warship commanded by the antagonist of the story and the man who betrayed you and your squad and has a bounty on all of your heads. That's all I will say as far as the story is concerned, I will not spoil anything for anyone who hasn't played the game. I will say, however, that the writer(s) of the game did a great job in that even at the end of the game, many issues are left unresolved. There is no Hollywood ending where everything is tied in a neat bow. Your character does have an arc emotionally, but it's much more reserved than most other games (or movies, for that matter) and adds additional layers of depth.When I say resort world, I mean it. Most of the visuals in this game are extraordinary. Colors are vivid, the clouds, sun and sky are breathtaking to look at, and a lot of the game takes place in various tall buildings. The scope of some of the falls are really something to behold. I tell you this only because the care with which each section of the game was detailed is very apparent, and it also really pays off, lending itself greatly to the atmosphere of the game. Immersion can be a beautiful and violent thing.The voice acting is...okay. I'm wasn't really ever playing this game for the story, which is a fairly typical and straightforward revenge deal, so the voice work was pretty much all it needed to be. And besides that, more than half the dialog is sexual innuendo with much swearing thrown in for good measure, so does it really matter how the lines are delivered? Not that much. I think the only complaint I can really make here is that in this game, as in almost all others where the situation arises, the actors use normal speaking volume in a situation that the in-game characters would realistically want to be much quieter in. But hey, nothing's perfect, and the game is so much fun that this complaint is pretty much a non-issue.After crash landing you and one of your squad members have to leave to find some power cells, and in this quest the game really takes a hold of you. You see an elite soldier of the Confederation (the government and former military which you once served), called a Final Echo, battling a group of mutated humans. He is ultimately crushed by a car though, and from his body you take the Leash which will serve you for the remainder of the game. The Leash is made from some sort of matter that can both interact with the environment and pass through parts of it. For instance sometimes to get across a broken bridge you will have to drop something down that you can use to cross over it, so you'll have to wrap it around say, a bus. But you can also throw your Leash through objects to grapple enemies and pull them towards you (the Leash is used by pressing the Left Bumper, and more advanced uses require you to hold the button down). Soon after gaining the Leash, its nano-processors flood your body and you receive your HUD, which fades (another way in which the game is immersive), leaving only your first-person view and no ugly ammo counters or health displays to impede the beauty of the scenery.The Leash serves two functions: Firstly, it is your connection to Confederate DropKits scattered plentifully throughout the game. DropKits allow you to upgrade your weapons and purchase more ammo for them using the points you gain with Skillshots, or, killing enemies in unique and skillful ways. The Leash's second function is that, as previously stated, you can grapple enemies and pull them towards you. Combined with the seven (I think? Maybe eight) weapons and their charged abilities, plus your kick and slide ability (B and double-tapping A, respectively), plus the environment, you must defeat your enemies in new and interesting ways. Some of them are entirely clever, and some will only seem obvious after you accidentally do them the first time. More difficult Skillshots are rewarded with more points you can put towards upgrades and ammo.As far as the weapons in the game go, they are pretty neat and easy to understand. I do think though, that the developers felt like they had to add more weapons than they really needed to. I stuck with four throughout the entire game. Some of them I just found impractical to carry with me, as they only really had very situational uses, and since ammunition in the game isn't plentiful (which I liked), I stuck with weapons that were most effective most of the time). All weapons have a secondary ability, and you can carry three weapons total, or, your default assault rifle plus two others. And here is where my greatest annoyance with the game lies. And once I tell you what it is, you can relax, because it's really not a big deal. There are two different ways to change your weapons. First, quick change, which is whatever secondary weapon you're using plus your assault rifle. So if you have the shotgun equipped and you tap Y, you go right back to the assault rifle. Tap Y again and it will go back to the shotgun. The second way to change your weapon is to hold Y, which brings up a weapon interface on-screen. However, when you're out of ammo, or you have emptied a magazine and want to just switch to a different weapon instead of reloading, holding Y (which does NOT pause gameplay) really leaves you wide open for attack. Since you are only able to carry three weapons at a time anyways, I don't know why the developers don't allow you to simply cycle through all three weapons. Then there'd be no need for a weapon interface at all. Just my opinion though.Wracking my brain, the only other possible complaint I have is about this game's self-awareness. And by that I mean that there are a few instances in the first half of the game where you might come across a horribly dismembered and bloody corpse, or someone impaled on a spike, and your character makes some sort of comment about how awful it all is. But you know, this is right after I just achieved the \"Pricked\" Skillshot for kicking an enemy into a cactus. What I'm doing is really no less violent and deranged than what the murderous locals are doing. Just one more thing that took me out of the moment.However, on to more good. I didn't time it exactly, but the game seemed to be about 8-10 hours, and my first playthrough (which I just finished) was on the Hard difficulty. Difficulties range from Very Easy to Easy, then Normal, then Hard, then Very Hard. I am no hardcore FPS player, and I didn't have but maybe one part give me difficulty. For the most part even playing on Hard wasn't that difficult. 8-10 hours isn't that long, especially when you compare it to something like Fallout: New Vegas, where hundreds of hours can be put into a single playthrough, however, this also means that you aren't required to do pointless filler missions that don't really make sense to the ultimate conclusion of the story. In every objective you know exactly why you're doing what you're doing, and that is needed if you want me to care at all about what's going on in the game. To add to that, even though the story is fairly short, because of the Skillshots it also has a very high replayability factor, which not a lot of games have anymore.Overall, Bulletstorm accomplished a lot, even if it isn't exactly anything mind-blowing. It achieved exactly what it intended to, the game did not crash or lag at all (at ALL), there are some truly epic boss battles, some really hilarious banter between characters, and in the end, there's even a point to the excessive violence in the game. This is one of those few games that I will not say \"Wait until the price drops if you buy it.\" You could, of course, but the game is just such a fun experience that I want everyone to be able to...well, experience it.***Update 2/23/2011*** It was brought to my attention that it is possible to hotkey the weapons you are carrying so as to avoid what I described as my biggest complaint about the game. Therefore that complaint is void. Thanks to Nick C. for bringing it to my attention.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2011"}

I'll try to make my points brief but clear.If you never played the 1st Max Payne, go out and get it. I think it is $10 a Wal-Mart or Target. It is good and well worth playing first. Once the price of MP 2 drops down, grab it and play it. You will appreciate the improvements.This game is great. The graphics are awesome, especially running at 4X antialiasing and anisotropic. The battles range from easy to surprising and tough within each chapter. The cut scenes and dream sequences are annoying and get OLD fast! In their defense: they are original, well done - they give you a break and a chance to calm down, so that your adrenaline can get going all over again. I believe that 50% of the cutscenes and dreams/movies could have been dropped without hurting the game or story line.In &quot;detective&quot; mode, the game was too short. I blew through it in 6 hours. Over the past year, I have noticed many game developers banging out games that are finished in 7 hours but they are still charging $50!!! Send a protest e-mail to them and wait until the price drops to about $30-35. Be proactive and let them know your sick of being jerked around.Now, to be fair, I blew through it quickly on the easy &quot;detective&quot; level. Once you solve the game you can select a harder setting. Now it is taking me a lot longer and I love it!Pros - the graphics, the improved gameplay, the effort to provide a story/plot, the enemy AI can really be tough sometimes, and the awesome slo-mo rag doll death scenes!!!Cons- the enemy AI is so-so(they still blow themselves up and stupidly race around corners!

But it's still so good that I really want to tell someone about it! I didn't buy this game the first day it comes out because I was disappointed by the control lag(and accelerating) issue Kill Zone 2. It makes the game extremely hard to aim. Well, now I realize it was mistake that I didn't get MAG release day!! BTW, I just want to point out that MAG is online only game. It's like a MMO FPS.MAG is already patched 2.1 so it's base on this one. It has new skill tree systems and I also get both new modes/maps(DLC).Good- Solid control. Very responsive. Literally... no frustration or anything. I got right into the game.- Massive players. Although people are separated to different areas for attack/defense because the maps are relatively big. But eventually there'll be a big battle when everyone trying to fight for 1 target on some of the map. It's awesome.- Skill tree. It might not be the best(or balance) setup. It keeps leveling up fun and meaningful. You can reset your skills so no worry for mistakes.- Graphic is decent. When there are 256 players in one battle, you can't ask for more...Bad-Not exactly balanced. I feel like on certain map one group always win. The other group win on other maps. I'm not sure because it could be the difference between weapons or skill level of players.-You'll need to decide to join one of three groups at the beginning of the game. You can't change until reaching max level, deleting character, or create a new one. What's bad about this is that when one of the groups have less or more players, it takes long to join a game. Sometimes you're going to fight 32 enemies while you only have like 20 teammates.-Still some bugs. It freezes occasionally and some invisible walls.A tip for beginner- No matter what skills you're going(engineers,snipers, assault rifles, shot guns etc.) you should start with getting \"medi-kit\" and revive skill first! It's the best(easiest) way to level up. Money is sort of hard to earn. Get gears before dressing up XDEnjoy the game & thanks for reading.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2011"}

New items and assist trophies.","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"HONEST and TRUTHFUL review","reviewText":"****DO NOT pay attention to the numerous 1 and 2 star ratings! They are just bitter people who do not know how to review a game and/or never liked the Smash Bros games to begin with. If you want the real deal on whether to get this game or not, continue to read below****Super Smash Bros Brawl continues the Smash Bros series that started on the Nintendo 64. For those who know about the series, it needs no introduction. For everyone else, it's a fighting game where you choose from several infamous Nintendo characters to fight against others in a match. During the match, you can pick up various weapons, items and power ups that appear for anyone to use. The last player left standing is the winner of the match. This game features various modes to play through with loads of unlockables waiting to be discovered; unlockables range from secret characters, secret stages, trophies, music tracks and game demos. So you can play through the main story mode, practice moves in the training mode, battle it out with friends in the multi player mode, sample demos of classic Nintendo games or connect online to battle other players from around the world. Your stats and everything you unlock are saved automatically every time you play. This game supports multiple controller setups: the Wii Remote by itself, Nunchuk and Wii Remote, Classic Controller (or Pro version) and the Gamecube controller.The PROS: This game is fun, fun and fun! Including the secret characters, you have access to over 30 characters and dozens upon dozens of stages to fight on. The graphics are gorgeous and shows exactly that the Wii can handle games with great graphics. The same goes for the sound effects, music, voice acting and overall presentation. With multiple controller support, you can easily find which controller suits your tastes and the controls are easy to remember and help you get into the game. There are lots of stuff to unlock so after you beat the main story mode, this game will keep you busy for a very long time. Challenge your friends in the multi player modes and connect online to play against other players, even keeping rosters of people you want to play with so you can meet up with them later.The CONS: While this game is great, there are a few issues that I wish it didn't have. First, this game is on a dual layer disc. It means the Wii reads data from both sides of the game disc and there have been reports that peoples' systems have stopped reading game discs or repeatedly crashed while owners played this game. The lens in the Wii optical drive can't handle reading data from a dual layer game disc so Nintendo did offer to fix the Wii systems for free. Second, while having a lot of characters is good, some of them have very similar moves even though they look different. This was a problem before in Super Smash Bros Melee that made its way into Brawl and decreases the variety between the fighters. Lastly, the online multi player works when it wants to. Super Smash Bros Brawl was one of the first games to try out Nintendo's Wi-Fi connection and this was a big request made by the fans: to play it online. When it works, you don't wait long to connect with other players and the matches don't lag or slow down. When it didn't work, it took forever to find other players to start the matches. If someone had a slow connection, every player felt it. Sometimes, you lose the connection and have to go back and connect with other players. If you don't go to internet forums and exchange friend codes with other players, you won't be able to request people to be on your list before or after matches. You can play against random people but they won't be added to your friend roster unless you have their friend codes.While it has flaws, Super Smash Bros Brawl is a good fun that non gamers and gamers alike can play, has lots of modes to check out and allows you to play with or against other players online. With the announcement of the next Wii console already making waves across the internet and setting off massive rumors, it won't be long before the next Smash Bros game will be released to the gaming public. This is a game worth owning and the price has already dropped so it's affordable. I recommend this game to Nintendo fans and gamers in general.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2011"}

Doesn't come with extra screen faceplates, just the black. Picture is sharp and bright, colors and brightness level are a bit less compared to the 2nd model GBA SP. It's cool, too cool possibly. If you're a collector or Nintendo fan or even if you have some GBA games you wanna play again, I suggest this. It's small, has an awesome battery life, head phone jack, adjustable brightness and sharp image with nice colors. Perhaps the best GBA model?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2013"}

Build a snowman, exchange presents with family or decorate your house for the holidays? Take a trip to the city, go on a shopping spree or visit friends from all over the globe? InAnimal Crossing: City Folk, life moves at a relaxed pace, but the world brims with endless possibilities.Build your own communityEnjoy mini-games against friends.View larger.Get to know your neighbors.View larger.Play at all hours of the day.View larger.Feel free to have company over.View larger.GameplayYou make the whole story, as you and up to three other players move into a town and just live life. Befriend your animal neighbors, decorate your house with cool furnishings, fill up your wardrobe, get to know the local wildlife, hop on a bus to visit the new city and just explore the world. There are a million different ways to play. Every charming animal character has a personality: some are grouches while others are chatterboxes. And there's no final goal or high score to hit. The game keeps going for as long as you want to play, and your town will always be there when you return. Move into town, buy a house and then do whatever you want. Time and seasons pass as they do in the real world, so there's always something different happening. Collect more than 2,400 items, go fishing for rare and interesting fish, catch all kind of cool bugs, dig up dinosaur fossils and buried treasure, hang out with other players or spend the day in the city. There's so much to do, and you have all the time in the world to explore it all.DS Suitcase ModeThe DS Suitcase lets you carry your character from your Wii console to a friend's, thus giving people without an Internet connection the ability to experience multiplayer modes. Additionally, you can move your character fromAnimal Crossing: Wild Worldon Nintendo DS and play as him/her inAnimal Crossing: City Folk.Key Game FeaturesThere's Always Something New To Do: In the living, breathing world ofAnimal Crossing: City Folk, days and seasons pass in real time, so there's always something to discover.

If you're in the mood for something a little faster paced, take a bus to a new urban city area that's unique toAnimal Crossing: City Folk.

But if you don't show your face back home for too long, your neighbors will miss you.Play With and Hear Up to Four Friends: Up to four people from your household can live and work together to build the perfect town. Design clothes and patterns, write letters and post messages on the bulletin board for each other, or play online using your broadband connection and invite up to three friends to visit your town using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. With the new optional Wii Speak microphone (sold separately), it's like you're all in the same room. The microphone sits atop the sensor bar and picks up the conversation of everyone in the room to encourage a more inclusive experience.Get to Know Your Neighbors: The heart ofAnimal Crossing: City Folkis building relationships with the animals in your town as well as with other players. Befriend your animal neighbors by exchanging letters, gifts and favors. Animals can also move from town to town, bringing their memories and stories from their old towns with them. And since animals are notoriously loose-lipped, they spill all the juicy details.Express Your Personal Style: Customize your town, your house and yourself by collecting bugs, fish, fossils, art, furniture, clothes and accessories. You can also go to the salon in the city to change your hairstyle and get a Mii makeover. Plus, if you design clothes in the tailor's shop, animals will wear them and maybe even bring them to other towns.Your NeighborsFamiliar faces such as K.K. Slider, Tom Nook, Blathers and Mr. Resetti all appear, as well as a bunch of new characters like Festivale host Pav&eacute; and Bug-Off judge Bud.

And when I say the same, I mean literally, the SAME GAME. You begin by riding a bus (not a train - good job changing things up, Nintendo) to your new digs, followed by a part-time job with Tom Nook (with exactly the same tasks as before, sans the \"helping out neighbors\" stuff). Then, you start playing. You'll dig up fossils (thankfully, you don't have to mail them into a museum in this game - +1 for this version), fish (it's much harder to make money in this fashion, as it is much harder to catch red snapper here), plant trees (the same as before), all on a real-time schedule. Just like before, K.K. will appear in your town on Saturday's at 8 PM, and just like before, holidays and special events will occur on their designated dates (and they will differ depending on the region of the world in which you reside - not that this helps me).The problem is, that's it. The graphics have changed little to not-at-all. The environment no longer has 36 squares, but continuous scrolling actually gives me a sea-sick feeling, as it always seems I am descending/ascending a hill. Switching between items is quite painful in this version as well (some \"hotkey\" buttons would have been helpful). There is little use of the Wii motion control that I have found.All in all, this is a lackluster offering. With the Wii online mode, this game could have been incredible (imagine each player creating a part of a larger world, with the ability of free travel from one town to another). However, Nintendo continues to think that all of its customers are pedophiles and psychotics, and so we continue to be greeted by the silly \"friend code\" nonsense. I am also disappointed in the removal of in-game video games here. While this is to be expected (with the Wii virtual console), it stinks nonetheless.This game is called \"City Folk\" because you can go to a city (the city consists of a few stores). I find this feature mostly unremarkable at present.And yet, I still give the offering three stars. Part of this is the fact that, while this game diverges little to none from the source material, that source material is quite strong. The other part is that I am playing the game in French, and the French was actually done quite well, with many colloquialisms not usually found in formal French learning. If you've never played Animal Crossing before, this is a perfectly perfunctory offering into the series. If you have bought both \"AC\" for the Gamecube and \"AC: Wide World\" for the DS, you are essentially buying the same thing again. Happy gaming!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2009"}

I always start at the hard level so I can appreciate the gameplay.Con:  Too much action.  Sometimes I was frustrated with shooting my own team mates and the enemy is far and distant.
