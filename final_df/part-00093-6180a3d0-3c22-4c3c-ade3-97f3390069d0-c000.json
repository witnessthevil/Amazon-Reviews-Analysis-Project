There are a lot of games lately to go in the wrong direction these days and it makes me glad that i had better games to play in the past. I have been waiting for the Zelda game that looks more realistic and has more seriousness in the gameplay and story.

I have no opinion on how  the multiplayer performed.This game is way to short, probably less than five hours total if you don't count all the times I was killed. The graphics are so-so and a bit hard for me to see what was going on. The enemies were very difficult to see and sometimes seemed to come out of nowhere, even places I had already cleared. The story is hard follow and really makes little sense. The actions of the AI squad are sporadic and they sometimes get stuck in certain places. There is a large variety of weapons, most of which you have to unlock by scoring points during the level or picking them up from dead enemies. I could not figure out how to use the weapon upgrade system. I played this game on the &#34;Normal&#34; level and it was still quite difficult. I did see several bugs throughout the game but I never experienced any lock ups. The first time I played I had to download some upgrades and install a 2 GB portion of the game to the hard drive. Not a big deal, really, but annoying for a high profile game like this. One would think all the bugs would have been worked out before release. I agree with other viewers that this game was released before it was ready. On the plus side the audio was great.On a personal note I find the trend of these games to emphasize the multiplayer and pretty much provide a token attempt at a single player campaign is very discouraging. If they want to release a multiplayer only game then just say so and we single players will buy something else. No problem.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2013"}

Slow down and speed up to achieve your objectives!This game definitely has some fun. The graphics aren't cutting edge or stellar. Instead, they deliberately put \"hairs\" and scratches into the screen view to have you feel like you're watching an old time movie. You get the traditional jumping up to platforms, jumping down to ledges, collecting items, breaking items, killing enemies.Many games feel like that's enough - move along the path, kill enemies, jump up and down. But Viewtiful Joe takes it to a new level. Because you're \"in a movie\", you can control how the movie plays out. If an enemy is racing at you too quickly, you simply slow down time so you can deal with the enemies in a timely fashion. If speed is what you need, put yourself into turbo mode to zip along!It's important to keep in mind that at heart this is a side scroller. If you're a fan of high-quality graphics or Halo-like adventure, this probably isn't the game for you. But if you enjoy side scrollers, cel shading and puzzle styles of games with platformer jumping built in, this will be a lot of fun for you.The game is very family friendly. The hero isn't swearing or ripping limbs off of people. He's simply jumping up, jumping down, gathering items and squishing cartoon enemies.The game is very replayable. If you beat the easier level, there are more challenging levels waiting for you. to really test your abilities.Highly recommended for side scroller fans and families who want to have fun together with classic platforming fun. Even better, if you enjoy the Viewtiful Joe game, there's a Viewtiful Joe 2 sequel to keep your fun going!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2009"}

Ramos \"Voltaire Tempentry\"","summary":"15 years later and still going strong","reviewText":"Back in the late 90's, there wasn't a single place in the US or Japan where you couldn't find something or someone related to Pokemon. The franchise was huge, penetrated popular culture and selling to millions of kiddos around the world things like plush dolls, card games, clothing, accessories, TV shows, spin-offs, and of course the actual games. After a few years, Pokemon mania died off a bit, but 15 years later the series is still popular, still interesting, and still great. Pokemon HeartGold is no exception.Based on the sequels to the original Pokemon(PKMN) games, HeartGold and SoulSilver are remakes of past, similarly named, games, Gold and Silver. The DS games retain all of the originals features, such as real time events, certain PKMN, and characters and regions. The region in these games, Johto, hasn't been seen in about 10 years, and pleasant nostalgia comes along with it. New comers to the games wont find memories, but they will discover a very well polished and designed PKMN adventure.The core game is similar to previous PKMN games, only this time players find themselves in Jotho AND Kanto. Both lands get design, graphical, and contextual upgrades from the original games (or the GBA remakes). Cities now have water fountains or brick roads or more flowers, etc. While these are hardly important in the grand scheme or things, it does provide a more pleasant viewing experience.HeartGold and SoulSilver have many of the same multiplayer features as Platinum, but still retains basic compatibility with all of the DS PKMN games. If a friend has Diamond version, you can still communicate, trade, and battle said friend if your game is HG/SS. More advanced features such as WiFi Plaza and variations to existing minigames and options are locked to HG/SS and Platinum. A select few are only playable if both parties have HG/SS. The games come with a neat booklet including a list of compatible games and how they are compatible.The adventure itself is just as well crafted as were the originals, Gold and Silver. The Johto region earned a graphical face lift, new PKMN are integrated into the older infrastructure, and new features make the adventure feel new and fresh, yet still keep the original's soul (no pun intended). Instead of the traditional 8 Gym Leaders, HG/SS spans 16 Gyms, in two different regions, providing potentially hundereds of hours of enjoyment. Unfortunately, as veterans of the orginals Gold/Silver may remeber, the Kanto region is no where near as interesting as Johto in the games. I dont mean this from a design prospective, but in terms of content. Yes, both regions contain 8 Gyms each, but Johto has many more side quests and plot points than does Kanto. One example of this would be the fact that Team Rocket and their activities are almost exclusive to Johto. This results in the playthrough of Kanto being much faster than that of Johto.For better or for worse, the battle system and overall design is identical to the previous DS games. 2D sprites \"battle\" each other on a 2D plane, certain attack moves use 3D effects, more geometry is employed on the over world than the actual battle screen, and PKMN still \"screech\" with outdated 8-bit sounds. Your still fighting through Gyms to reach the Elite Four, and you still trying to \"catch 'em all\". The overall PKMN system is just as polished as its ever been, but the similarity to previous games may ward off veteran players.Those looking for the next evolution of PKMN games will be sorely disappointed. Those willing to overlook the repeated design, or new comers to the series will find much enjoyment out of the game. Being a PKMN game, its accessible and entertaining to all ages, kiddos will be glued to their DS system for hours, yet older folks will find the surprising depth and customization enjoyable.Despite being very similar to past games, the classic PKMN formula proves itself yet again, and provides a very lengthy and great adventure. The lack of any substantial change and outdated design keeps HeartGold and SoulSilver from reaching \"must-have\" status, but fans of the franchise will find much to like.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Rezivor","summary":"A pretty good system for it's time...And even every now and then.","reviewText":"The N64 was Nintendo's 3rd console (not counting the Game Boy, and Virtaul Boy).It came out shortly after the Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation.

This was Konami's answer to Capcom's Resident Evil, and still is one of the most popular horror games today. The game, unlike REsident Evil ,or many other horror games, chooses to scare you in a more mental, quiet sense (not to say resident evil is bad, I'm mearly saying SH and RE are very different form one another). The game is not for the faint of heart, or those with out a healthy ammount of patience, as the game focuses mainly on puzzle soving and exploration. although the graphics are dated by today's standards, this is easilly overlooked once you start playing. Although the game offers a fantasic story, and haunting atmosphere, I highly recomend Silent Hill 2 over the orrigional, as it has better controlls, smoother visuals, and an even better story. I have played many horror games, and believe me when I say that this one and it's sequels stand out amongst the rest, and shoud be added to any games collection.

This new take on the franchise once again finds three different campaigns to choose from: the Alien, the Predator, and the Marine.  While each campaign starts out spectacularly, eventually boredom will rear its ugly head.  This is due to the poor level design and disappointing controls, which often come off as quite stiff.  Not to mention that what begins as being a quite scary experience in each of the three campaigns, de-evolves into boring tedium.  What saves Aliens VS Predator from being a complete clunker however is that the game is filled with some wonderfully violent moments, as well as some nicely designed character models and some great multiplayer modes.  Other than all that though, there really isn't enough here to warrant Aliens VS Predator as being as worthwhile as it could have been, which is a crying shame considering the potential here for something special was quite high.  It's still worth checking out though, just don't go in expecting any of the past glories that came with the franchise in the past.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Cory K.

This is innovative partly because it does require constant concentration and precise timing to execute.  Basically, additions allow your characters to increase the damage caused by their physical attacks.  You have to push the controller buttons at the precise moment in order to execute these additions.  And, do not expect to master all of the additions for any of the characters.  The most powerful additions require too many timed button presses to execute reliably.The story is fairly standard RPG material.  You play as the main character, Dart.  Dart is on a journey to avenge the destruction of his village and the death of his parents.  Along the way, he meets up with some very eccentric adventurers who follow him on his quests for their own personal reasons.  What starts out as a journey for revenge turns out to be something more significant.  As the story unfolds, it turns out that what people have believed for 10,000 years may not be the actual truth.  What God had in mind for humans may not be in our best interest.  Dart and company travel across three nations to try and unravel the mystery.This game is a very good alternative to the Final Fantasy series for those who love to hack, slash, bash, and cast spells.  The battle system here is much better than Final Fantasy X's.  This is perhaps the most sophisticated RPG for the original playstation.  Playing the game in a PS2 supposedly gives the graphics a boost, but I have not had a chance to compare them side by side.  I can say that on a PS2, the graphics are very good.  The soundtrack sounds great and the variety is wide enough so that the game is pleasant to play for long hours at a time.

I tried it on one of my PSOne consoles and the load times were a little much...but playing it on the PS2 helps with this a great deal.I have not gotten to the second disk yet...so I do not know if I will suffer the fate some of the people, where the second disk of the amazon collectors version does not work...in either case I hear that they will replace it at no cost...so I'll deal with it if it comes to that.Will update this post if it does...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2007"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"The best superhero game you'll ever play","reviewText":"It's usually a foregone conclusion that licensed games, whether they be based on movies or comic books, just tend to suck. Batman: Arkham Asylum changes all that. This eagerly anticipated game is hands down the best superhero game that you will ever play, boasting big production values and enough fun for anyone to pick up and play, even if you're not a Batman fan. The storyline finds Batman trapped in Arkham Asylum, and going toe to toe with waves of thugs and a number of villains from his great rogues gallery. Utilizing some punishing attacks and inventive gadgets, Arkham Asylum is plenty addictive and offers up enough engaging, easy to pull off combat that you can't help but enjoy what you get here. Not to mention that the game also offers up some great moments of stealth, detective work, and almost everything else you'd expect to do if you were Batman (minus drive the Batmobile, which personally would have the icing on the cake here), and it does it all spectacularly well. There's also over 200 riddles from the Riddler (naturally) to solve in order to unlock a horde of extra content including Challenge mode maps, and the game as a whole looks grim, gritty, and superbly detailed and animated. But singing the game's praises here hardly does it the justice that it deserves. It goes without saying that if you're a Batman fan in the least, you need to get your hands on Batman: Arkham Asylum. It is without a doubt the best Batman game, and best superhero game, to ever see the light of day, and it deserves your time and attention. And even if you're not a Batman fan, this game is so good that if action games are your thing, you should definitely check it out regardless.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2009"}

This is perhaps one of the greatest games I have ever played, ever. This is the one NES game that has really stood out to me, out of all the NES games I had in my collection at the time, this one really had a unique charm to it with a fantastic, uplifting soundtrack, great level design, and weapons you collect as you defeat the various robot masters in the game. The difficulty of the game is very well-balanced, especially compared to the first game. While the first game had excellent gameplay and a good soundtrack, the difficulty was quite extreme, but this one balanced it quite a bit better, still keeping the challenge intact, while offering more greatness that was present in the past two titles in the series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2013"}

BADER \"Q8  AL BADER\"","summary":"its awsome","reviewText":"I was seventeen when I played the first God of War, and I was hooked on it all the way through. It had a briliant story, great environments, with a great ancient Greek mythology atmosphere. The story told of a Spartan warrior named Kratos, who is desperate to redeem for his past mistakes. He had pledged his life to the service of the god of war Ares in return for saving his life. Ares had tricked Kratos into killing his wife and only child. In the game he embarked on a quest to get his hands on the unfound pandora's box, containing the ultimate power capable of defeating a god. With this power Kratos managed to defeat Ares and become the new god of war in his place.I was thrilled when I heard a sequal was being made. However I was annoyed when I went to get this on the orginal release date and found I had to wait an extra month until its release. But I have the game now, so no worries. I got the game on the day it was released (it was a friday) and I completed it on monday. The game is just as good as the other, with the same moves, some extras and new weapons. Zeus betrays and murders Kratos. Kratos then seeks out the three legendary sisters, who are his only hope of returning to the past an changing his fate. He attempts to return to when Zeus betrayed him and murder Zeus himself. The game ended with a cliffhanger, indicating there will be a God of War 3. But that of course will be an extra 2 years. Less hopefully.Which one is harder to beat? God of war 1, or God of War 2? There was a point in the first game that took ages for me to get through. It was in the underworld, when you climb the rotating spiked tower. Yet there was no difficult moments in God of War 2. Yet in God of War 2 there were more things to get through that required logic skills, some I got stuck on, but I only got stuck on 1 in the first game. That's something I must warn you about. God of War 2 is excellent and very fun to play, It's a game I promise won't dissapoint you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2009"}
{"product_name":"B003O6CBIG","description":"","reviewerName":"SRS47","summary":"Get ready to get bored & lost in maps !","reviewText":"I'm a 1/2 Battlefield fan 1/2 COD fan, and played all game titles of both games. I might be the only one describing this game as: Crysis 2 + MW3.The character movement & maps kinda reminds of Crysis 2. Maps are in medium to large size with tons of covers. However, the problem is the game is still 6VS6. At some point in mutltiplayer, I feel like I'm the only one playing. Anyway, here are some positive and negative points that I can think of after playing multiplayer for 5 hours. I played the singleplayer for 1 hour, and it doesn't have much to impress me, and who buys COD for SP anyway !Positive:1-The game took a new direction and pretty much it's a good direction.2-Gameplay is slower than BOII and MW3. Movements are smoother.3-You need to have some strategy and teamwork in order to succeed and win.4-Map designs are better but huge and boring at some point.5-Squads game mode is fun and a good way to train yourself. Also, if you want to try new guns and avoid getting humiliated by human players.6-Unlocking characters instead of prestiging. Every time you unlock a new character, everything starts from square one. Even your K/D starts from zero. All guns and attachments will be gone.7-You can have any gun and attachment at any point of the game, as long as you can purchase them with squad points.8-Extinction mode is a good way to spend some time with friends, but not impressive at all !! I rather kill zombies then alien frogs ;)9-Sound effects and calling enemy's locations are done perfectly well.Negative.1-Stupid F***ing lag is still there ! Hopefully Xbox one with dedicated servers can solve this issue. I see players jump from point to point. There is no ping indicator in the score board !!! WTF. Sometimes one team easily dominates the other team, only because lag is in their favor.2-You may think respond points are good now because of larger maps, but you are WRONG. God knows how many times I respawned right next to an enemy, and I how many times enemies just respawned in front of me and gave me an easy kill. This is not acceptable at all. Maps are large, why on earth I get respawned in front of my enemy????!!! I'm not joking, I have respawned in front of my enemy at least 4-5 times in every game!!3-Gun selection is not impressing to me. Where is my Desert eagle?? MY AK-47? MP5?? Or at least MP7. All gone, and re-placed by some ugly looking guns. However, they are balanced. so far no gun is super powered. but most players prefer silenced SMGs.4-As title says, maps are large, and not only that; there are tons of covers and rooms and small windows and cars and walls and,... god knows what in every corner of every map. Perfectly prepared ground for campers and snipers.5-Killstreaks are pointless. I mean really they are pointless ! Maps are very large and some of them has buildings and covered areas, so what does my heli is suppose to do?! Fly in the sky and enjoy the sun ;)6-Graphics feel out dated, but again hopefully next gen will take care of that.7-Last but not least, dogs can fly in this game( they attack and jump on you from a long distance, and you need to empty a full clip on them to kill them), and since it's easy to get, be prepared to see dog party! In one of the games I was playing yesterday, every single player in my team had a dog right next to him/her.8-There are some glitches here and there. I get stuck at doors and around objects time to timeOverall, It's a fun game, and it's like other CODs out there. It has issues and positive points. As I mentioned before, I'm 1/2 Battlefield fan, so large scale maps don't bother me at all, but COD really failed to create a balance between map size and number of players. If it was 10 VS 10, it would be much better. Again, if you like Crysis 2 gameplay and feeling, and also like MW3 style, go get the game right now. If you like BO2 Nucktown style of gaming and run & gun & getting 5 kills with one missile, avoid this game!!! RUN>>I'll keep the game for a month or 2 just to see if they fix these issues.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2013"}

This game is not your average First Person Shooter. You rarely have a gun!!! lolYou punch a lot and have lead pipes and stuff.. Let me tell you that you really feel like your swinging that stuff around! it is brutal violence! You never feel like your a great warrior like you do Halo or have spectacular fire fights like in Gears of War. This is more like Doom 3 but more hand to hand. It plays in a similar way to the sleeper hit \"breakdown\" for the original xbox. The punching seems very believable in both games.The game is a good looking game but it is dark. So its probably best to play it at night.Most people I know arent into horror games but if you are this is one the best around. At this price its almost crazy not to check it out. if you have never played a game like this but do enjoy horror movies I say go for it because you will not regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2009"}

Seriously, if you made a list of all the things that you loved about former Tomb Raider games, then Legend will almost definitely fulfill all of those criteria - as well as coming up with a few new ones for you to enjoy.Unfortunately, while you're busy enjoying all of these things, you'll probably not notice the game's extremely short lifespan creeping to a close, and before you know it, you'll be finished, and mad as hell that there's not more of this excellent title to enjoy. But while you're in the middle of it, 'Tomb Raider: Legend' is an almost-compulsory title for you to own.GRAPHICS: 5/5FINALLY, this is one Tomb Raider game where the secondary characters look as good as Lara does! Bye bye, Bouchard and Mme. Carvier, with your big square hands and lousy textures - Zip, Alistair, Amanda and others are here to take your place! Top marks must go to Visuals here, with the developers are squeezing every last ounce of power from the seven-year-old PS2 technology to create a world for Lara that's as clever in its level design as it is jaw-droppingly beautiful to look at. Leaping about on rooftops in the Japan level, dispatching mercenaries in Bolivia and unlocking huge temples in Ghana all made me sit up and go \"Wow! \". Lighting effects, animation, colours - you can't appreciate it from screen shots: this is an incredible-looking game.SOUND: 5/5Again, top marks to the wonderful aural atmosphere that the music, voice acting and sound effects create in 'Tomb Raider: Legend'. From the remix of the original TR theme at the title screen, to the really cool bike chase level music, the tunes in TR compliment the game's environment and add atmosphere like no other Tomb Raider game before it. The West Africa and Japan levels are awesome to listen to, too, with ambient city and jungle sounds pouring out of your speakers to lend real depth to the already-amazing visuals. And voice acting, happily, is some of the best in a videogame since 'Second Sight'.PLAYABILITY: 5/5What, top marks again? Yup, Lara's got a completely new and redesigned control system, and it's amazing. She is now totally, completely analog - and it works. No more Walk button, no more tapping back once to make a running jump, and no more auto-lock for super-easy combat: it's all changed for the better. Now, moving boulders and crates is a joy, and Lara goes through her animation cycles much faster than before, so it's far easier to stomach when you do something wrong. Puzzles are of a usual mix, but there are several that bear the hallmark of the excellent TR design we've come to know and love. Combat is changed: now, enemies can *gasp* knock Lara over, and the auto-lock feature of former games is gone, meaning you can no longer take out bigger enemies with just your pistols and a backflip, but to counterract this, there's a whole host of hand-to-hand combat moves to learn, and a really cool grappling hook with which to tag and hurt the bad guys. All in all, this game is a dream to play.LASTIBILITY: 2/5And here's the problem: 'Tomb Raider: Legend' is just too damn short. Compared to most other contemporary games, it's not too bad - around eight to ten hours play first time through - but for a Tomb Raider title, the insanely short nature of the game is a real disappointment - particularly since the actual gameplay is just so damn good.Now, it isn't all bad news - you can replay each level multiple times, and unlock new outfits, cinematics, concept art and costumes for Lara as you do, as well as expand on the excellent Croft Manor sub-level - but I know I speak for all TR fans when I say that I'd rather have more levels to complete one time than fewer multiple rides through the same levels - however pretty they might be.OVERALL: 4/5If this game was longer it would stand alongside Final Fantasy 9, Silent Hill 2 and Shenmue 1 as one of my all-time favourite games. As it stands, it's a beautful-looking, brilliantly-executed game that's just too damn short. A real shame, but you should get it anyway: EVERYONE needs to play this at least once. Welcome back to the top of the pile, Lara, we missed you!Totally recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2006"}
{"product_name":"B000TT4GBG","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Tons of fun from a game that started a rhythm revolution","reviewText":"The Good: Songs we wish were in Guitar Hero, All the instruments respond well, easy assembly, multiplayer is a blast, realistic character interactions, frequent song updatesThe Bad: Graphics aren't very good, a lot of poor songs, very easy for GH vets, drums can be too hard sometimesThe answer is no. I would pay, at the most, $140, but I have my reasons. First off the songs aren't nearly as good as any of the Guitar Hero games, but there are about a dozen that I've been waiting to see on GH since the first game. These include Don't Fear the Reaper, Blitzkrieg Pop, Learn to Fly, Dani California, Enter Sandman, Here it Goes Again, and a few others. The other songs just aren't that good such as Maps, In Bloom, Main Offender, Go With the Flow and pretty much all the rest. There are many number of downloadable tracks, but a lot of them aren't worth the 2 bucks a pop. 30 Seconds to Mars, All American-Rejects? I mean c'mon there are better songs. You do have bands like Metallica, Boston, and The Pretenders but it's the lesser known crappy songs that you skip on your CD player. There are some good songs to download like All the Small Things, More Than a Feeling, Still Alive, Call Me and a few others.The meat of this game though is the drums. Yes, it's fun and easy too learn...I think. You have the four colored pads (same order as the controller I didn't even have to memorize where the colors were) and the kick pedal is orange. It's just like drums. You'll have to start out on Easy, but soon you'll make it too Hard, and if you're talented, Expert. The guitar is better than the Guitar Hero controller but a long shot. The buttons are set into the guitar and it feels real, it's bigger, and more sturdy. The strum button doesn't click either! You also have an effect switch so when you go into Overdrive (think Star Power) you can have effects like Wah Wah, Flanger, Reverb etc. A great new feature is the freestyle mode.Every so often when you play drums (when your Overdrive is full) you can just play any notes you want. Once you get used to the drums you can throw in some pretty cool licks. When you play the guitar you get blue sections which are solos and you can use the lower set of buttons and press away without strumming. I found this really hard actually since going from top to bottom takes too long and I failed songs that way. When you play as the singer you can tap along to the beat during solos and you can hear your own voice through the speakers...this is either good or bad depending on you.The singing is just like Karaoke Revolution. Sing to the pitch so the needle hits the lines, read the lyrics and you're good. This game is also a blast online especially when you hear people sing. Sometimes I laughed so much I failed songs! Hey! Speaking of failing, when you're in multiplayer you get three chances when you fail and once someone else does Overdrive it'll bring you back. Along with all this you create your own character. The thing is pretty robust. You can add tattoos, change hair, color it, you can pick from 4 different clothing styles, Punk, Rock, Gothic, and Metal. The graphics are also alright, but nothing special.While not nearly as good as GH3 the game is more realistic. You have crowds that sing along, the band characters have more animations and sometimes the guitarist will lean in and sing with the singer, the drummer plays more than just two notes (he actually plays all the notes like on a real guitar). All of this just makes things great. One final thing, Guitar Hero vets will blow through the guitar section on Expert without breaking a sweat. It's honestly not hard at all. Wait until the price drops and Rock Band is a great purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

After revealing you're a true Hero, you're spirited away to begin cultivating support for a revolution.Graphics are effectively the same, but the loading of the graphics is abysmal. Items wink into existence at 5 feet, and it takes almost a minute to load a full graphics set, which is ridiculous. Graphics aren't even roughed in, ala Mass Effect drawing. Graphics are also rather loopy at times, with laughable clipping issues and fall through floors.Audio is still fairly crisp, though you're rushed through quests so fast that you're pulled past most of the entertaining dialogue. Voices are at clear and well done, and there's enough variety that you won't think you're listening to the same five people.Gameplay is where the best developments and worst failures are. Menus and inventory are effectively removed, replaced with a sort of walk-in closet setup that performs all of the functions of the regular game menu interactions, allowing you a much better feel of involvement. Spells are hammered in from the beginning as an usable alternative to ranged attacks and melee. Use of spells and weapons are juggled well with modifications to equipment so that you're encouraged to find new effective combos of spells and the best use of weapons to improve them. Combat is decent, though some of the summoner enemies do swarm the screen overly quickly. There isn't a real sense of danger, as you have no life bar, and health regenerates rapidly, removing any real sense of difficulty. Outside of the questing and combat is the dull tedium of buying every house and store in sight, as there is no real other application for money. And then there's marriage and sex, which is as dull and pointless as always, though the game will constantly remind you during loading screen how horny you've decided to play the game.Multiplayer is bogged down by a twofold dose of game glitches and lag, which makes combat a agonizing chore unless you're both playing on blazing fast connections. Not to mention the fact that you can't interact with another player like you'd want to, as you have to dance and hug 3 times before getting to the shake hands option that you were waiting for.Overall, this is more of the same thing you've always expected. The same enemies in the same setting, with the same blank faced peasants outside of the small choir of NPC's. It's Fable 2 with another coat of varnish, though with how many game killer glitches and lock downs that this have, its likely that coat of varnish had a healthy dose of lead and uranium present.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2010"}

Antiquity (12,000 B.C.) is an age where the world is divided between people whose continent is buried in snow, and the magical kingdom of Zeal, a highly advanced civilization. The Middle Ages (600 A.D.) is an era of swords and sorcery, a dark time when the armies of Fiendlord rule over the land.The Present (1000 A.D.) is the time period in which Crono, Lucca and Marle live. It is a bright and peaceful age. However, in the Future (2300 A.D.), an era of despair has taken hold with rogue machines ruling the world. After the day of the apocalypse in 1999 A.D., the prosperous civilization of humanity crumbled and the remaining people struggle to stay alive. And, finally, there remains the End of Time -- a place with no era to call its own. This confluence of time's streams transcends spatiotemporal boundaries.

Chrono Trigger features exhilarating combat in which the clock is constantly ticking. Characters must first wait as the ATB gauges charge, and then perform an action.

Certainly it is one of the greatest RPGs ever made, in my own experience equaled only perhaps by Final Fantasy VII (never did care for any other Final Fantasy games). It's a rolicking-good-time for fans of adventure and sci-fi, and as RPGs go a whole lot of fun. More than that, the genius of its design and brilliance of its story is not debatable. It's legendary. Even better, it makes for a game that's fun!When I first started the game I was wondering exactly how the game would make me feel. I like the deep story of RPGs, but hate dungeon crawling, random battles, and that very irritating feeling of having absolutely no idea where to go next to get the story moving again. I need not have feared, though. Chrono trigger has no random battles, it's castles and dungeons are brief not every-lasting, and thankfully, you will always know where to go next.The story starts with you in your village on the day of the millenial fair, and you quickly meet a girl there and (using your friend's new teleportation machine) find the girl gone and yourself back in time trying to rescue a queen who has been kidnapped (and who your friend has been mistaken for because {surprise, surprise} she is the crown princess and the descent of that queen. You have some adventures come back to your time, get put on trial for kidnapping the princess, and see one of the greatest scenes in any videogame ever, as all your actions in the first hour of the game are played back as evidence against or for you. Eventually you get out of that situation (one way or another) and find yourself again traveling through time, only to find that the world was destroyed by a monster far in the future, unless you can stop it...The prologue is awesome but the main story of the game is really amazing. You have all the classic trapping of a great legend, from a hero turned into an animal, to an ancient sword that has to be reforged, to a princess and an unlikely hero out to save the world. That's enough to make a good game. What propels Chrono Trigger into greatness is the power the story is given by the strength of the characters and writing, and absolutely fantastic presentation and gameplay. The game is loaded with humor character, from the little girl accusing you of not rescuing her cat at the trial, to a tiny furry creature who is the master magician (and keeps popping up in different times doing everything from hiking on the mountain of monsters to playing rag-time on the piano in an inn), from the goblins who wonder why you just popped out of a time portal in their closet to the Frog who talks in noble Shakesparian and the cute robot you find in the future. There were so many times when I played this game and felt real joy in the moments it presented. When I first discovered the robot in the future and his theme played, I felt attached to him instantly (he's so cuuuute), and when the hero frog leapt off saying he had failed to protect the queen, I felt so bad for him (he was really handy with sword and saved my bacon). That's the kind of thing that gets to you. I haven't felt that way about an RPG since Xenosaga's Cyborg said \"Call me Ziggy\", and Final Fantasy VII had girls asking a certain brooding hero whether he remembered his promise or would be their bodyguard.It cannot be overstated how much the lack of random battles, and the constant boss battles (which you will almost always win) increase the amount of fun you have with this game. The excellent battle system which highly encourages teamwork amoung your party keeps you constantly on your toes and nervous that you could lose the battle, and never gets tedious or frustrating. The graphics may be old-school, but that about as good sprite-based graphics get. The music is very atmospheric and catchy, and the main themes are just beautiful. The story twists and turns, and how you play can determine the way certain events unfold (the game has more than one ending and you can even play past the \"end\"). But above all, the story and characters are just impossible not to love if you like a good story. If you like RPGs and don't mind if they're a little old, you will LOVE this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2009"}

E Jackson","summary":"watch out for that all-out war","reviewText":"Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is a drastically different game compared to the first two. Now the setting takes place outside in the deep forest-filled jungle, the underwater caves and eventually the mountaintops. Instead of sneaking behind enemies and knocking them out, you can simply stand faraway and shoot them with one of your guns. Minor disappointment there because it unintentionally makes MGS3 more like a regular war game.  However it's still incredibly important to infiltrate areas and go undetected by guards- there's just significantly less emphasis on this trademark aspect compared to the previous two games. Interestingly, I can't recall seeing any security cameras anywhere, a constant nemesis in the very first Metal Gear Solid for the PS1.The bosses are all pretty basic and feel ordinary and uncreative. The strategies required to take them out mostly focuses on standing back and shooting them whenever the moment/timing is right. You can simply use your handgun weapon to take them out as well. Not as strategic as previous MGS games. The boss covered in hornets in the cave/water area and the one where you have to avoid the flames shooting down the hallways are the more memorable ones, however. A lot of people like the old man sniper boss battle where Snake has to avoid being detected and sneak through quite a bit of bushes and trees to find and eliminate him, but it's sometimes confusing finding your way through the paths in the forest which results in cheap shots out of nowhere.However the game has one thing going right for it, and it's an *extraordinary* thing- the storyline. It's so elabrate, well-constructed and gripping on an emotional level involving certain characters (some of which return such as Ocelot) that it would be a foolish decision to skip over them. The characters of Eva- the most attractive woman to EVER appear in a video game, and the Boss- a powerful female soldier, are the best two. Without a DOUBT the best two characters in the game, no question. Ocelot is pretty awesome too- he often shows off by spinning his guns around like a cowboy, and even meows like a cat which is hilarious. The storyline is about stopping a Russian nuclear strike against the United States and capturing important scientists and information to prevent these plans from actually occurring. It's really good and not at all generic.The one area where stealth is pretty important is when you have to climb the mountaintops where the helicopter is flying by. This is later on in the game and it's pretty darn tricky making your way through here. The portions where you have to disguise yourself as a scientist so the guards don't detect you're Snake is pretty boring however, not to mention the facilities aren't enticing to admire. Another character made of electricity named Volgin is pretty fun, but his intimidating features aren't so threatening when it's finally time to battle him. In fact he's one of the easiest fights in the game once you can figure out what to do.Snake has to eat food such as snakes to survive in the jungle, and even has to heal himself with his own carrying medical kit so to speak. An interesting realistic idea. Well, then again, how realistic can it actually *be* to heal yourself if you're in such bad shape, really? Especially when you're in such bad shape as Snake in a couple scenes and yet he prevails regardless. Oh and Snake sure takes a butt whippin' in this game! Quite often in fact, hehe. It's quite shocking how hopeless Snake is on a few occasions, and plus he gets somewhat emotional in a few segments which is equally surprising.Overall, expect a LOT of cutscenes (moreso than the first two MGS games) but also expect a story almost on par with the first two as well. The best cutscene is the one featuring the Boss at the end of the game. I'm not going to spoil it- I'll let your emotions dictate how unbelievably touching it is. Overall, great game. There just needs to be more stealth-style missions that involve less gun shooting segments and more sneaking up and eliminating enemies with Snake's bare hands. That would have officially been the icing on an already really good cake.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2013"}

Taegel","summary":"Beat 'em Up + Shooter Hybrid = a solid 4","reviewText":"Dead to Rights 2 is immediately fun to play and one of the few 3rd person shooters I've found that also works well as a beat 'em up.  Plus you get to play levels as the dog, Shadow.+ As Jack, the action in Dead to Rights 2 is fast-paced and conducive to an aggressive, up close and personal, playing style.  If you're the kind of player who likes to be methodical, stealthy and careful you're going to get frustrated fast.  If you try to stay put too long or play too carefully, the AI closes in and kills you.As Shadow, the opposite is true.  You've got to be super stealthy and clear out an environment by picking off guys one by one.  If you try rushing guys with guns as Shadow, you'll die fast.  The result is that the diverse mechanics keep the experience diverse.+/- That being said, the levels go on longer than you might have come to expect in a shooter.  When playing as Jack (most of the game), there are checkpoints, so you don't get punished too badly for dying.  However as the game goes on and the bad guys just keep coming, the thought enters my mind, \"Sheesh, how many more dudes could there possibly be?\"As Shadow, the challenges are much shorter (e.g. kill all the dudes in a warehouse and retrieve a card key), but there are no checkpoints.  So you might have to lure and stealth kill as many as fifteen or so guys.  If one of them kills you, you have to start over.  If you're an impatient, run and gun kind of player (like me), you might start to get frustrated.  However, playing as Shadow is still pretty fun.+ Ultra-violence, blood and gore.  I like it, but if you're squeamish, there is a gore setting to minimize this.+ Shooting.  There's no \"auto-aim,\" but shooting is intuitive and easy.  You can carry two guns at a time and toggle between them.  After a few levels, Jack finds a stash of awesome weapons.  Unlike some games, you don't keep your weapons once they run out of ammo.  Jack throws them away.  So you have to keep disarming you enemies.  The disarm mechanics are fun and prove to be an easy way to kill enemies.+ Fighting/hand-to-hand.  There are some great blocks and combos and on-screen prompts take you to some gruesome finishers.  It's in-depth enough not to be boring, yet simple enough not to be tedious (e.g. Mortal Kombat).  There are a couple hand-to hand boss fights that can go on a while.  My advice: learn to block and weave out of the way when your health gets low.  Jack's health regenerates, but the boss's does not.+ Jack has a feature called \"focus\" that slows down time for when the combat gets extra intense.  This feature is somewhat similar to the \"Dead-Eye\" feature in Red Dead Redemption.+/- The camera is more like a hand-held camera during fight sequences and while running.  It gives the fights a gritty, chaotic feel -- like being in a rough and tumble melee.  However, it does take some getting used to (about ten minutes of gameplay), as your immediate impression will be that of disorientation and losing control.  (If you can't get over the fact that the camera behaves differently than in other games, you might not like this game).  After a level or two, you won't even notice.+ The controls are responsive and smooth.  The on-screen prompts are clear and easy to follow.  (Another reviewer complained about wonky controls.  I do know that there's a patch when you first load up the game.  Maybe the patch fixed this problem.  Maybe the other reviewer just has crummy eye/hand coordination.  Either way, the controls worked fine for me).  The learning curve on the controls and mechanics was less than ten minutes of gameplay.  After that, I took much delight in creatively dispatching the array of thugs the game threw at Jack and Shadow.+ The hard-boiled cop story isn't the most original (on par with a Michael Bay flick), but it's really quite fun and never takes itself too seriously (e.g. a couple hours after an emotionally crushing event, Jack is already hitting on an attractive doctor).  The overall design and tone of the game are stylized much like a graphic novel.OVERALL:Dead to Rights 2 breathes life into the shooter genre and I highly recommend it.  You've maybe read the lukewarm IGN reviews.  I have no idea what that's about.  I would give this game a solid 8.2 (really good).Comparing DTR:R to other 3rd person shooters (that I've recently played): I have had as much fun playing through Dead to Rights Retribution as I did KILLZONE 2 and more fun than RESISTANCE 2.  But not as much fun as HEAVENLY SWORD or RED DEAD REDEMPTION.I enjoyed the originality of DTR:R and the varied mechanics of shooting, melee and canine stealth attacks in the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2010"}

Hopefully the new features that I have noticed will help you decide as I have played every year of this franchise.* Tons of new animations:  More animations means that not every play will end in a predictable way over and over again.* Improved defense:  Defense no longer have eyes on the back of their head and must actually keep track of the ball in order to make a play.* New Heisman Challenge Mode:  I love this mode:  Pick former Heisman winners and play as them and try to beat their real stats from the seasons when they won.  Players like Barry Sanders, Desmond Howard, Carson Palmer, even RG3 himself.  Unlock videos of these players as they talk about how they won the Heisman.  As a Knicks Fan, I loved playing as Charlie Ward!  If you win the Heisman with these players, you can also use them in \"Road To Glory\" mode.* \"Slow-Down\" animation which can be triggered by holding LT on your controllers.  Those of you who played \"BLITZ\" series should be familiar with these features.  You have a 15-seconds \"bank\" that constantly gets refilled that you can use to slow down the play and make a better decision.  While I think this feature is a tad too \"arcade-like,\" you do not have to use it.  I must admit though, returning kicks using slow-down is very fun, especially with the new coverage system.* Realism on the field:  Wide receivers for instance can now lose a step or slip, especially in wet conditions.  If you throw the ball to them while they have slipped, your best hope is that its a harmless drop and not a pick-6 the other way.  Collision system also feels boosted.Other features from last year are still here(Road to Glory, Coach mode, etc...)  If you are a hardcore NCAA franchise fan, then it is worth it.  If you are starting out as a football gamer and looking to save some money, you may want to buy previous year's game, but don't be surprised if you'd want to get this one as well!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"Adrian Jenkins \"southerndudeman\"","summary":"The death of the JRPG","reviewText":"A great many reviews have called this game, \"A great game, but a mediocre Final Fantasy title,\" but this is deceptive. While there is no doubt that this is a mediocre FF title, it's also a mediocre game in almost every respect. Worse still, this game will probably sound the final death knell for the Japanese Role Playing Game (dubbed JRPG).It's been a strange ride for both FFXIII and the JRPG in general. Without summarizing the great past of the JRPG, however, it is safe to say that it has not found its niche in this generation, particularly on the PS3, where JRPGs have both been scarce and hard sells. That's not to say there haven't been solid titles (\"Eternal Sonata,\" \"Tales of Vesperia,\" and \"Star Ocean have all been quite good), but the American RPG has just been significantly better, both critically and commercially.But this was the one that would change all that, right? Well, not exactly.Remember that FF XIII was supposed to be the title that would \"save\" the poor-performing PS3. Announced years ago as one of THE hot ticket exclusives, people would buy the system just to play this game. Or so the story went.But some curious things happened along the way. First, the title was delayed again and again (for an extended period, Square wouldn't even hint at a release date). Then, in a shot heard round the fanboy world, Square announced that FF XIII would in fact be multi-platform. The Sony fanboys squealed, the X-box devotees delighted.But the PS3 found its legs with cheaper (and better) models, and top-notch exclusives like \"Uncharted 2\". And finally, years after its announcement, FF XIII was released.And so, we come to the biggest problem with the game: this feels like a launch title. If this had been released in 2007 or 2008, it might have made serious waves. I'm sure its graphical quality would have wowed the masses, and probably overcome its woefully boring gameplay. But it's 2010. No one is amazed by a pre-rendered fireworks scene, no matter HOW many times you show it (around 5, incidentally). We've seen \"Uncharted 2,\" and the fact is, these graphics don't improve on that game in the least. Heck, the movies hardly feel better than \"Metal Gear Solid 4,\" and that was released two years ago.It's hard to point out anything exceptional about the game once you fail to be amazed by the graphics. The biggest praise has usually been handed out to the so-called Paradigm System, and indeed, there was much potential here. The problem is that the system is easy to master, and the game inexplicably introduces way too much chance into the proceedings. You can have a party with 5 paradigms that you really like, only to have the game mysteriously change your party around before a big battle. You have no chance to re-configure paradigms, so you're stuck with whatever you are given. Lame.Battles come in two flavors: easy, and cheap. Since you can switch paradigms on the fly, and there is no MP measurement in the game, you can essentially use an attacking paradigm for every battle. When your party starts to get hurt - and this is key, people, so listen - you switch to a...healing paradigm! Then, when you are healed up, you switch back! &lt;gasps!> People who claim a great strategy in this game have obviously never played a game requiring strategy.This works for around 99% of the battles. But every now and then, you just get cheaped. As I mentioned above, sometimes the computer will randomly change the makeup of your party, and force you into a battle with a difficult foe (say, Bahamut). You are then required to react quickly enough to discern all of your new paradigms, and pick an appropriate one before he slaughters you, which happens after around two attacks. Of course, it would be simplistic if you could just have chosen your own paradigms, but that's not possible because of the random switch.An even more egregious example is the \"stop\" spell bosses occasionally cast. During the battle with the final boss, ALL of my party members were hit with stop simultaneously. I had to sit and wait it out. The problem? I died before the spell ended. What a joke.The item creation system is a joke. In order to get some items, you must first find another item, upgrade it, and then dismantle it. There is absolutely no rhyme or reason to which items you should do this for (e.g. I obtained the Sprint Shoes, which cast Haste on a character, from dismantling a Tetradic Tiara, which casts protect, veil...and pretty much everything else EXCEPT haste). What a joke. Upgrading is laughable. There are something like 100 components in the game, but they all do exactly the same thing: add experience to your weapon/accessory. Thus, a bomb core will do just was Murky Ooze does. Why even put all of these different components into the game? Oh right - to make it look like the developers actually did something.The story of this game is pretty weak, and the character interactions are a laugh riot. Most of the game deals with a lot of existentialist hoo-hah about freedom of choice, even as it is clear that the characters dance on puppet strings for the entire game. The end of the game is just baffling, with a lame boss to boot. And the best part? Expect to hear such rich lines as, \"I wanted to tell the truth, but I was afraid people wouldn't like me!\" I think after-school specials were written better than this.There's plenty of other things to rail on about (battles are too long, the game is too linear, with zero exploration, etc.), but I think I've made the point. It begs the question: why did Square need so long to develop this title? The graphics are nice, but they hardly wow, the gameplay is linear and the design is lazy. The sad part of it is that while this game will assuredly sell pretty well (the fact that it is the first FF title for this generation is more than enough to convince people to buy it), it will no doubt hurt the overall market for JRPGs. This is not a game to get excited about. This is a game that you buy and play only to convince yourself that you didn't waste $60.Thumbs down...","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2010"}

The ability to switch between Netflix and a game without stopping either is fantastic for snacks between game playing. The install of the game is seamless - in about a minute you're into the game (standard hard disk, I have not upgraded it).

Also, if you have a PS Vita, you can literally take the gaming anywhere on the home network. I can play from my Vita in the office, or lay in bed and finish up a mission. This is truly an innovation in gaming.It should be noted though that my PS4 did fail at launch (30 minutes into playing and after the 1.50 PS4 update).

However in almost every way this game was a huge let down.Graphics.  Overall an improvement.  Especially the cut sceens were very detailed and well done.  Of the good things I can say, this is one of the few that really shines.Story.  One thing I enjoyed about the first game was they made it fit the original movies storyline very well, in short it was epic.  This games story not only fails to fit but it falls flat.  Without giving too much away the entire purpose of the game is not to help the rebels or take down vader or anything like that but to rescue a girl and darn be to anything else.  Why is the girl so darn important and what does that have to do with ANYTHING?  After about getting halfway into the game I was just hoping we could just let the darn girl die and get back to something that mattered.Length.  Short!!!  Compared to the first game this was the equivilent of about 2-3 levels or more appropriatly, an expansion pack.  I sat down to play it and finished in one brief evening.Eneimes.  Not only was the game super short but it REALLY lacked variety.  In the few levels you play, you fight the same old things over and over again.  The few sub bosses all were very similar and a bore to fight with only one finishing animation for each unlike the first game where you had multiple options.  The big bosses were not very tuff and a few just had fights that were boring repetitive and seemed to drag out for no apparent reason other than to perhaps extend the playtime for such a short game.Gameplay.  Semi improved over the first game.  The skills have been condensed but a little too condensed for my tastes.  It was easy to master the controls as they were very similar to the first game.  Again, lack of variety hurts as you only have a few enemies to fight and only a few animimations to do it.  I did enjoy grappling which was new but it suffered from lack of animations and being a bit too powerful.  Overall this area lacked fluid and creative combos to make the gameplay more enjoyable.  I also was not a fan of the double sabres.  I would have much rather seen options here on what style to use with each having strengths and weaknesses.Another part that really bothered me was there was a lot of precision jumping required where you were not fighting but just having to do long sequences of precise jumping in order to advance the game.  In some spots it was so tedious that I nearly turned the game off (not to be played again) but eventually made it through.Overall just a total let down and rip off for what I paid and the content I recieved.  It might be worth a rental since you can easily finish in one night but if you are hoping for a good story and fun gameplay then I suggest trying something else.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2010"}

J Lewis \"Miss Amii\"","summary":"Playing on Auto-Pilot","reviewText":"Anyone who followed news of Final Fantasy XII, the final installment of the legendary RPG series on the Playstation 2, should know what a troubled history it had. Several years of delays and several key members of the development team leaving before the project's completion definitely shows on the final product. With its balance issues and muddled, poorly done storyline, I can't help but feel that Square-Enix, sensing the final days of the Playstation 2 approaching, just shoved this one out the door and hoped for the best.A departure for the series, Final Fantasy XII uses a quasi-real time battle system similar to what you'd find in an online RPG. Character AIs are controlled by the gambit system, battle routines that you program for each character before hitting the field. Of course, you can still input commands manually, but the gambit system really does make things flow more seemlessly. While the semi-real time combat does speed things up quite a bit by eliminating random battles, it sacrafices most controll and strategy usually required to play these types of games. The gambit system works a little too well, as all you really need is a few properly enabled healing and attack commands enabled and all the game requires of you is to steer the characters around the map. In fact I always turned the AI script off for my party leader just so I could press a button every once in a while. Even boss battles don't require much more strategy than melee attacking and healing every once in a while.The game goes even further in destroying the need for strategy by introducing quickenings. These are super powerful, magic draining attacks that you can chain together for massive damage in you have quick enough fingers. Just wear a boss down to half of its life bar and unleash one of these babies to finish him off. If that doesn't work, switch in your reserve fighters to finish him off.The game has also done away with automatically earning money for every enemy defeated. Instead you have to rely on loot, the items monsters drop at random. You must buy everything from armaments to magic to new gambits and its all very expensive. Imagine how hard it would be too buy that several thousand coin spear if only every fourth monster gave you something to pawn off. Compound that with even late in the game, about 3/4th of the loot dropped pays only a pittance when you sell it. I never had to intentionally build my levels because I was always severely overly powerful from just earning money to buy equipment.Then there is the utterly frustrating treasure system. In Final Fantasy XII there is no set treasure item in each box. The strategy guide tells me that there is a box that might contain a super duper weapon. Unfortunately, you only have a one in three chance of getting that. You have a better chance of ending up with a potion or 13 coins. And that is if the chest even appears at all, because as I trekked through the fields, I found that more often the not the chests containing the better items were suspiciously absent.Character skills are assigned through the licensing board. Not only must you purchase every piece of gear, magic spell, and fighting technique, but you must also buy a license to equip/use it with points earned from fighting monsters. You'd think this would lead to very open ended skill development, but it doesn't.  Like the weapons, certain magic and techniques are only available after certain points in the game and there is nothing more frustrating than purchasing a license for a nifty looking ability and finding out you won't have access to it unless you go an insane sidequest to defeat some giant rock turtle with two million life points. As for the weapons section of the board, it can be ridiculously unorganized. Some weapons like bows, swords, and spears are neatly grouped together, but others like guns, and ninja swords seem to have been placed all around the board at random.I'm sorry but it seems for just about every step forward they took, they took three leaps back.Let's talk about the story, what really makes this a turkey. I'm not going to talk about anything specific after the first five or so hours. After the intense and well-directed opening cinematic, I thought this really would be the masterpiece the hype machine promised it would be. It had everything you'd think an epic should have: large scale battles, death, war, betrayal. The Kingdom of Dalamsca was soundly thrashed in a war against the Archadian Empire. The king surrenders to avoid total annexation by the Empire, but before he can sign the treaty, he is assassinated by Basch, his loyal knight. Several years later, Princess Ashe teams up with a ragtag band of rebels to win the kingdom's freedom back. No one in their right mind should call this well written when one of its few major plot twists is that the assassin was really, that most ridiculous of soap opera clich&eacute;s, Basch's evil twin brother! That is when the story falls down and only struggles back to its feet after another twenty hours. And I absolutely dare anyone to tell me that the first third of this was not totally patterned after the first two Stars Wars movies, the ones from the good trilogy. At about the start of the last 1/3rd it falls down again and never gets back up, as all the carefully drawn political maneuverings are thrown out the window for an increasingly ridiculous and more stereotypical quest for magic rocks. The characters are almost 100% static and I don't think the developers ever really had a clear picture of who they were as, especially towards the end of the game, their personalities seem to change inexplicably from one scene to the next.In the end, Final Fantasy XII didn't demand much out of me and I didn't give much effort in return. I just sort of sleepwalked through it. It was far from addictive, and I, who usually want to complete every sidequest, ended up only doing the bare minimum. When it was over, I was just left feeling cold. I've played worse games, but this is the worst entry into the series in a long, long time.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2007"}

There have only been great & better Mario Kart games, NONE are nowhere close to being bad, and this one continues down that path of greatness. There's always something new in Mario Kart games. Double Dash had to people controlling one Kart, I loved that, and though I miss it, Mario Kart Wii's new gimmicks have grown on me and now I love it in it's own way. Each player has a wide varitey of different vehicles to race in, that's never been done before. You can now use motorcycles, that's never been done before. You can pull off super cool air stunts, that's never been done before. You can race or battle online against your friends, strangers, ghosts, or participate in official Nintendo Mario Kart tournaments, that's never been done before, and it does all of these things very, very well.This game released YEARS ago. You wouldn't notice it playing online cuz it's online crowd is just as alive as ever, still GROWING even. You can ALWAYS get a race online, ALWAYS. There's always a lot of people playing online, no matter the day or time. Online is almost flawless. Most Wii games have crappy online like Smash Bros Brawl, Clash Of Ninja Rev 3 to name a few, but this game does it well and I'm very pleased with it. There are a large amount of tracks, and remakes of old tracks that you loved, and they look gorgeous with the new graphics. It's more karts, more stages, more characters, more online, it's just more everything lol. Online leader boards and ranking systems have you playing this game a lot trying to rank with the best, especially during tournaments, which are still dolled out on a regular basis. Nintendo hasn't started neglecting service to this game one bit, and it's because it never got old or boring to the players. After installing the Mario Kart Channel that comes with the game, you'll be emailed a message by Nintendo letting you know whenever there's tournaments etc.The controls are aggressively tight, and impressively responsive. I've never had a complaint controlling this game. It give you full and total control so you can make necessary, last minutes maneuvers and successfully achieve them. You can play this using the Wii remote only, the Wii remote and nunchuck combo, the Wii steering wheel, the classic controller, and the nintendo gamecube controller. With so much ways to play, any and everyone can find a control scheme they love. Thought I'd be playing this with my gamecube controller but the wii remote/nunchuck combo is the ideal control scheme to master this, and feels the best when doing tricks etc. Over all this game is an easy breezy 5 stars. I've owned it for about a year and finally thought I should give it the praise it deserves. I still play this game. In fact, i raced in a tournament just two days ago. This game has probably the most replay value of any Wii title out there. Get it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2012"}

JUST CAUSE 2 takes that experience and magnifies it in every way. The world is huge, the visuals are crisp and very beautiful, and the action is as over the top as it can get. I'd be lying if I said the writing and the missions were amazing, but even if you set all of that aside, you'll still have one of the best sandbox games on the market.Take these comparisons to OBLIVION lightly. JUST CAUSE 2 doesn't even try to have any kind of depth when it comes to the story, the missions, and the sidequests. This is a game for people who like to explore, cause mayhem (chaos), and test boundaries. The people who made it their life's mission to get to the airplane in GTA 3 without unlocking the third island. If you try to dig any deeper than that, you might find yourself disappointed. If you enjoy JC2 for what it is, you'll have yourself a game you can come back to again and again.Like I said, the story is a flimsy one that would probably be better suited for a '90s Steven Segal flick. You play as Rico Rodriguez, a special agent who's been sent to the (fictional) Southeast Asian island of Panau to track down another agent who has recently gone rogue. To find this rogue agent, you have to gain the trust of the three major gangs on the island. To do this, you have to cause \"chaos\". To cause chaos, you have to, more or less, cause as much damage to the island as you can.There are several ways to cause \"chaos\". One is to destroy military bases; another is to destroy military-owned structures; another is to blow everything else up: cars, planes, gas stations, broadcast towers, water towers, propaganda trailers, surface-to-air missile sites... the list goes on.But to get back to the island of Panau - which was the main selling point for me - this place is HUGE, and I do not use the word lightly. To walk from one end to the other will certainly take hours, and even traveling by plane takes at least fifteen minutes. You'll have over 400 square miles to work with, which is 25x larger than OBLIVION, and 5x larger than WORLD OF WARCRAFT, making it one of the largest video game worlds ever created. And it's not just empty space. The developers put a lot of time into making sure that they reward people for exploring every nook and cranny of the game with plenty of easter eggs and vistas that you'll just want to stare at for hours. From lush jungles and beaches to cities and mountaintop villages, there are plenty of unique places to discover on the island.And just to drive home the \"over-the-topness\" this game allows, you're equipped with a personal grappling hook, and you can do almost anything you can imagine with it. Hook an enemy to the back of your car, tether to an enemy chopper and hijack it in the air, use it to scale mountains or buildings. You're also given a parachute that you can deploy at any time, so if you want to fly as high as you can go, jump out, and land harmlessly: go for it. The game really goes out of its way to make sure that you have a fun time messing around in Panau.If none of that sounds appealing enough to warrant a purchase, then look elsewhere. Outside the massive world, the dozens of unique vehicles, the spectacular graphics, and the ability to go anywhere and do whatever you want, there's not much else. There's the story, achievements, and a lot of collecting to do, but I definitely wouldn't say they're the game's redeeming features. It's everything else, and there's a lot of it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000088KH9","description":"Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis the third in the successful mission-based stealth series that first appeared on the PlayStation in 1998; few changes have been made to the basic format. Players can once again choose to be either Rikimaru, the silent sword-wielding assassin, or Ayama, the acrobatic younger ninja. Both characters pass through the same game world, but each has slightly different goals that take them on different routes. A third character can be unlocked later on.During the first mission, you're required to choose a number of weapons to aid you in your immediate tasks. Throughout the game, more and more weapons--from melee to ranged weapons--are added to your arsenal depending on your performance during each level; your chosen weapons dictate how you approach the mission goals. The silent approach is always encouraged, and there's a variety of graphically satisfying stealth kills that will only work if you remain elusive and strike unexpectedly and silently.Aside from the stealth kills, the game is a mixed bag in terms of its graphics. Light shimmers off your sword menacingly, but the environments are bland and repetitive, and the game fails to maximize on differences between light and dark areas in ways that might have added to the experience. Also, the stealth dynamic is made less challenging by the shortsightedness and slow reactions of the enemy guards and the iffy AI. Since guards give up searching for you within seconds and are unable to follow you through doors, this potentially atmospheric and tactical stealth game is actually just a hack-and-slash arcade romp. Multiplayer options are included, though, so if you feel the need for a more realistic opponent, you may want to call a friend.Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis still an enjoyable experience despite its flaws. It&#x92;s just a shame that, after doing so much to establish and define the stealth-game genre, it fails to raise the bar or introduce any novel elements. The game feels more like an update of the first Tenchu, and while this is no bad thing, fans will probably be expecting more.--Chris Ryan, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Va- Bank","summary":"Could have been great!","reviewText":"Good graphics, great concept, great story, immersive gameplay - ALL of this completely ruined by terrible, uncontrolable camera angles.

{"product_name":"B0050SX7BQ","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Dotzler \"Kasaru\"","summary":"Not a good game, but a decent experience otherwise","reviewText":"There's a few reasons for the two stars, and I'll get there, but I just want to make sure that you know that this isn't a bad experience. It's a bad game. Initially, I had only watched a playthrough of the game, all the way through in one sitting. That was just fine. In fact, I enjoyed it. Think of it as a long movie that way. However, once I played it, it was very evident very quickly that it was going to be a tedious, painful experience.[CONS]The gameplay is the main killer here, for me. I don't mind story driven games, and as long as the other components of the game are up to par, then I'll most likely be enjoying the game. For Beyond: Two Souls, that is not the case. The gameplay kills the experience. Odd controls that aren't always the same, and combat in particular is very confusing. You're supposed to push the stick in the direction that Jodie is moving, but it isn't always so clear. Many of her limbs move in opposing directions or she is moving very slightly in slow motion that it's not detectable at all. But, you can't fail. There's no game over. That's just very poor and lazy game design. It's like a way of saying, \"we don't need to develop a comprehensive control scheme, because eventually they'll get it right.\" Seriously.Another issue is that of the story. I won't spoil anything, but it jumps around a lot. Years sometimes. I understand why, but it's done very poorly as well. They introduce new parts of the story in these parts, that if it were done chronologically, it WOULD make more sense, but it would introduce an idea or aspect of the \"lore\" that wouldn't be explored for a while down the line, just leaving it to simmer while people apparently would forget all about it.Yet another problem this game exhibits is that the longest segment in the game, over an hour of a single chapter, is entirely unnecessary in my mind. It adds absolutely nothing to the story. That's not fair though, because what it tries to add, merely confuses people further. Is there magic in this particular world? It's not explored in depth enough to know. Essentially, it just gives an excuse for one of the final \"choices\" in the game.That's another problem. In a very story driven game, you'd think that if the interaction is predetermined, there'd be at least branching pathways to take in it, right? Nope. Only in the last 10 minutes or so. You decide Jodie's ultimate fate; all choices can be reached no matter what \"choices\" you make in the game previously, through action or inaction, or dialogue. You might as well be nothing more than an observer in this \"game\". Dialogue choices are chosen automatically for you in about 5-20 seconds depending on the situation, and even some actions. I much preferred the experience of this game when it was someone else holding the controller. Perhaps that's the way it will be for you, too, so you'd be much better off watching a playthrough on YouTube of a commentator of your choice, or without commentary. Either has its benefits.[PROS]There are a few things that I do like about this game though, and why I decided to give it more than the minimum stars available. The graphics are phenomenal. Everything is acted out by a couple of high profile actors, Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe. Both offer outstanding performances. Though their characters can drift into and out of favor as well as character, the actors do their best to fill the roles with life and believably. It was clearly a labor of love for both the art and talent departments.The story is quite intricate, and if you're able to piece things together, it can be appreciated how deep this game goes. The script was several thousand pages apparently. I think that the idea would have been served much, much better as a novel instead of the game. You notice many of its faults when it's an \"interactive\" product. There are many action sequences and interactions that are absolutely terrible and painful to watch with how lame or outrageous they are.[Conclusion]After playing it, I'm surprised that reviewers went as easy on it as they did. They mentioned the same problems that I did, but I guess it didn't bother them nearly as much. Overall, I have relatively mixed feelings about this game. I really, really don't recommend buying it, maybe a rental if you're curious. That's what I did. Beat it as fast as I could, about 8 hours, choosing interactions and sequences that I knew would reduce the playing time. I would just suggest watching it on YouTube. There's plenty of full playthroughs out there. If I hadn't played it, I would have given it close to 4 stars. That's not what you're here for though, you're here for the game experience, and I delivered, whether it's what you wanted or not. It's the cold, hard truth. It's a huge depart from Heavy Rain, and it's not a good one at that. Stay away if you're even curious enough to read the reviews. Heavy Rain would be largely recommended instead for a similar experience.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2014"}

The new additions are all great; new weapons, double wrist blades, hidden kills, variety of new stealth kills, easter eggs & subplots, refining your villa, etc.  All wonderful and I'll allow you the joy of discovering them for yourself.  The numbing repetition of the previous game is gone and discovery is, indeed, in its place.  Rennaissance Italy is expertly crafted and amazing to look at, even if it pales in comparison to mid-Crusade ravaged Palestine as far as \"interesting and new places to set my video game\" go (but that's my humble opinion).  So, all in all, giant steps forward.So let's talk about what's still bugging me.  And what (I hope, I hope, I hope, but I'm sure they haven't) fixed in the upcoming \"Revelations\".The voice actor who plays Desmond sucks.  He sucks hard.  Like, Sam Worthington levels of suck.  Get someone else (they won't).Stealth?  Anybody?  I'm starting to think that adding the word 'stealth' to these games is a misnomer and that any hiding spots are there for convenience rather than necessity.  Once you master that 'block-parry-riposte' instant kill button sequence (and it ain't rocket science) you're all but unbeatable in melee combat.  You certainly CAN sneak around on rooftops likeThief: Deadly Shadowsand it's fun to do; but not necessary unless it's an instant fail situation.  The \"Notoriety Level\", or whatever the hell it's called, tries to keep this in check, but it's a small and easily corrected deterent.  And it's only frustrating because SO MUCH of the game is spent giving you tools and teaching you how to be a sneaky freak that to be able to ignore it all makes it feel like wasted time.And what the hell is with this situation: I've reached the spot where my target is, I've got him in my sights, and now I'm forced to watch a damn cut-scene where that guy I'm not allowed to kill yet brutally murders someone literally FEET in front of me.  In front of a super-assassin who I just KNOW could cover that distance blindfolded because I've spent the whole game doin git. Why, why, WHY?  Why the artificial wall, all of a sudden, in a game that gives me complete freedom of movement otherwise?  Why put me in a situation where I'm not allowed to use the skills I've been building that would INSTANTLY FIX THE SITUATION?  And WHY DOES IT KEEP HAPPENING!? Nearly EVERY major target mercilessly slaughters someone while I watch.  And what about this bit in the middle, when you're trailing four people on your hit list (four!) to get information.  You hear what you need to hear, they're all still standing inches from your cold, steely blade, totally oblivious to the righteous death you could bring (indeed, PLAN to bring them) in a heartbeat, and... nothing.  Time jumps and they've all gone.  What do you mean they've all gone!  Did the fat old men escape me?  How?  Did my contact fall out?  Did I have a stroke?  What the hell; they were RIGHT THERE! At least let me have one!  Or the group breaks up and I have to CHOOSE which one I finish hunting or... anything else!  Anything besides this lazy, artificial barrier!I know why it happens, of course; bad writing.  The writers are in a corner where they either need to establish this person you're hunting (whom you, the player, usually know next to nothing about) or need to get you critical information from a key player without allowing you to harm them.  And these fake walls and time lapses are the only ways they can think of to make it happen.  It's lazy, convenience-based story telling.  They might as well just write what I need to know in the instruction booklet and I'll figure it out later; at least that way I don't have to stop playing the game they've established to learn about their (weak to begin with) story.... ... ...still a really good game, though.  If you've never checked it out, it's more that worth a look.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2011"}

You visit cool Japanese style towns, pirate ship, dungeon, many beautiful environment and fight mythological enemies/beast with a Japanese twist. A visual pleasing game.

Minus 0.5 points for overall score.The combat portion does not happen during the 'normal' game, there are talisman in the environment and when you touch it the game switches into combat scenario with confined 'border'. A unique aspect of this game is the 'celestrial brush'. Its hard to describe this gameplay but you basically draw with a brush. There are many different brush powers. You can draw and fill missing bridge gap, draw a line thru enemies and slash them to death, or draw a circle in the sky to make night turn into day or a crescent to make day turn into night.

Assassins of the Carribean","reviewText":"First off, make sure you have about 4.5 GB of hard drive space before trying to play this game because it has a mandatory install.I played about 8 hours of single player mode so far. As you might expect, AC IV plays a lot like previous titles in the franchise. If you've played any of the Assassin's Creeds before this, you've played Black Flag. Stealth kills, combat, camouflage, and climbing/jumping are very much the core gameplay mechanics. Largely free-roamable maps, climbing rooftops, collecting relics and unlockables, and who could forget looking for vantage points to synchronize with eagles and then diving into a cart of hay, a staple of the AC franchise? Once again is the story device of getting hooked up to a big machine to go back in time through your ancestral memory, this time with a corporation called \"Abstergo\". Desynching, which was annoying in previous AC games, is here too if you are too slow and can't chase down your target within an allotted time frame or distance. This basically means you lose and have to restart the mission. Mercifully, when this happens or you die, the load time is very short and no more than maybe 5 seconds. Be prepared to retry some missions over and over because of this.Controls can be a bit frustrating because of auto-jump and auto-climb. When running around trying to evade or chase enemies, for example, and you bump into a crate, the character will start climbing up the crate.Multi-player is a lot of fun and offers PVP as well as co-op play. The game modes are a lot of fun and a great way to waste time. My favorite so far is Wolf Pack which is a co-op mode. All your teammates run around the map killing targets, or protecting treasure chests. Unlockables are paced very well, with constant level-ups. The pacing is in line with other multiplayer games. Multi-player makes the game almost worth the price of admission alone.The game comes with several passcodes for DLC. One is a $10 PS4 version upgrade. A digital manual is included on the disc. No paper one is provided.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000ZKDOV2","reviewerName":"Sicilian Diesel God","summary":"Good Fun Round 2","reviewText":"As someone who loved the original Saints Row, I was glad they made a part 2. I am glad the player gets to talk this time around, though the British accent for a white male is really weird in a game like this. The concept is basically the same as the first game except now you are more of a leader than a follower. I like how they tied together the first and second games with all the characters as I was worried they were going to make this game its own entity with the \"same character\". I love Johnny Gat and he looks even cooler this time around. The graphics are a disappointment - I know its a cartoonish game, but the first one looked a whole lot better in my opinion. There seems to be this haze that makes it even worse when looking at things, no matter the time of day. I think fighting and the weapons are much cooler in their effects and how they are represented.That being said, the originality between this game and the previous really isn't there. It's basically the same story and goals - earning respect, doing missions against rival gangs, conquering rival strongholds, etc. There is more variety with the respect challenges which I like and its not as easy to succeed in the early level of the respect challenges either. This game is fun, but still seems to be lacking something. I wish I got to choose how to attack the rival gangs for once in a sandbox game. It would also be nice to have the AI of my gang be smarter and have more of an effect with their guns. I watched Johnny fire 8 shotgun blasts into someone and it didn't kill the guy. Forget it when he uses a regular pistol. It's like the computer controlled gang members really have no effect.I like the game, but I honestly felt more of a connection and interest in the original rival gangs than this one. These gangs seem very far fetched and weird to see on the streets just walking around like everything is normal. I like that my character is the leader and not just a silent runner for the big guys. I like that the respect bar adds up faster this time around through various methods besides respect activites. It's better than GTA in fun and replay ability but still not a perfect \"gang\" sandbox simulation.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2008"}

For example, pushing up on your controller makes you sidestep your opponent&#x92;s attacks, yet also allows you to jump in the air by tapping up plus a direction. A revamped fighting system offers up three different styles for each fighter (one includes a weapon technique). The multiple styles provide countless varieties of attacks for any given fighter. Different combinations of punches and kicks can be combined for very lengthy and powerful chain attacks similar to those in theMortal Kombatof old. Fatalities are also back and rich in graphic representation.New fighters join the cast of old favorites such as Sonya, Kano, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Kung Lao, Kitana, Quan Chi, Reptile, and Shang Tsung. The lavish environments surround your fighters with animated backgrounds and rich skylines. On some levels there are even breakable objects and hazards that you can interact with, such as pools of acid--the perfect landing place for a thrown opponent.In addition to regular modes of gameplay (arcade, versus, etc.), there is an option called Konquest mode. This mode allows you to learn more about fighting styles, read up on each character&#x92;s personal history, and gain Koins. The koins can then be spent in the Krypt, allowing you to unlock a host of new characters, costumes, and early concept drawings.

DO NOT buy this game expecting it to be very similar to the previous Mortal Kombat games.  As most of you know, the plot of Mortal Kombat is to save Earthrealm from invaders from Outworld.  This time, Shang Sung and Quan Chi have formed an alliance that could doom all the realms.  As Raiden watches from his seat as Elder God (remember his ending in MK4?), he becomes increasingly disturbed at the Elder Gods lack of interest in this dire situation.  He renounces his title and once again becomes the god of thunder.  He then rallies Earth's finest warriors in hopes that they will defeat the two sorcerers before their evil plot is complete.The only other thing connecting this game to the MK series is the characters (plenty of old favorites as well as some new characters).  Other than that, this game is almost a completely new game.  First, as MK veterans will recognize, the X, O, Triangle, and Square buttons no longer function as low punch, low kick, high kick, and low punch.  This is due to the fact that each character has 3 unique fighting styles.  These styles were recreated as accurately as possible, causing the hp lp system to be useless.  Most of your fighting is now based on the correct performance of combos (all of which are listed in game and can be accessed through the pause menu).  Next, most of those familiar special attacks that you know have been removed.  each character has between 2-4 special attacks only, but most of the traditional moves stayed (ex: Sub-Zero's freeze blast).  The graphics in MK:DA are very impressive, only experiencing slowdown when multiple intricate combos are performed at the same time.  I was dissappointed with the fatalities, however, as each character only has one and the animation on all of them could have been done much better (I mean c'mon.  You can hardly tell the difference between a brain and a heart or kidney).  Plus, many of the MK vets favorites aren't there anymore (I can't believe scorpion doesn't do his traditional \"flamethrower\" fatality).  The amount of blood has increased dramatically, as blood now stays on the ground during the battle for added gore.  Each character's third weapon style is a weapon, ranging from swords and daggers to steel fans and nunchaku.  Although you can no longer throw your weapon at your enemies, many weapons can be used to impale them so they continually lose blood during the match.  There are plenty of unlockable features ranging from comic strips and concept art to new battlegrounds and extra characters.  There is also now a training mode that will help you immensely when trying to learn to use many of the characters.  One addition I think every gamer will enjoy is the return of the \"Test Your Might\" mini game.This game definately earns it's mature rating by it's accurate use of many fighting techniques as well as all the blood, gore, and violence that Mortal Kombat is famous for.  While it may seem like the revamped fighting style won't be as fun as the previous MK games,  I found it to be a good change.  I would reccommend this game for MK vets who are willing to try something new (rent it first if you have to) as well as newcomers to the genre.NOTE: I have not played the GCN or X-BOX versions of this game.  The only information I have on the GCN version is that the moves and combos can be very difficult to pull off with the standard GCN controller due to a poorly designed directional pad.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2003"}
{"product_name":"B0001X5YN4","reviewerName":"J.  Martin","summary":"Metacritic was being generous with this title..","reviewText":"STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl fails as both an RPG and a shooter in my opinion. I played roughly 8 hours of this game and put it down, unable to take any more of it. This game consists of bland, lifeless graphics, an awful lot of running around in large open areas, little action in terms of combat, and little in the way of dialog or story. Actually, it's hard to see what this game has going for it at all.The inventory system in this game is incredibly annoying. Your inventory starts weighing you down after picking up only a few guns. As a result, the game saps your endurance quite fast, effectively slowing you down to a crawl. If you've played Neverwinter Nights, the concept is similar to how in that game loot made you become encumbered, except in this game this happens absurdly quickly. Now consider the fact that you have vast distances to cover between each objective or scene in the game, and you should quickly realize what an incredible annoyance this can be.Due to this and a few other factors, the large open areas in this game as opposed to the comparatively linear level design of games like Half-Life and Half-Life 2 result in a whole lot of time spent running around, and a lot less time spent in dialog scenes or combat. Some games manage to pull off having a bigger and more open game environment. Unfortunately, this isn't one of them.If you want a good shooter game, steer clear of this. Go play anything from the Half-Life series. Any of the Half-Life games are outstanding examples of FPS excellence. They all have an interesting story, setting, and keep you interested all the way through to the very end and beyond with gut-wrenching action, flawless gameplay, and intriguing storylines.If you want a good shooter-RPG, Mass Effect and Bioshock have this game beaten by miles. They contain infinitely more interesting storylines, far more interesting action and dialog, and the graphics are stunningly realistic with vibrant colors as opposed to the kind of blocky and bland offering STALKER serves up.Honestly, I'd rather be re-playing Mass Effect, Bioshock, or the Half-Life series than play this game, despite the fact that I've already played these games several times over now. Do yourself a favor and get any of these other games instead. You won't regret it if you enjoy \"thinking man's shooters.\"","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000GH3PYA","description":"Building upon the addictive and easy-to-learn gameplay of a puzzle game by integrating story and character progression elements found in RPGs.  Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords delivers a brand new type of game that pushes the puzzle genre to a previously unseen level.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Hybrid Theory","reviewText":"In the video game world, the puzzle genre and the RPG genre are like apples and oranges.  Both are delicious fruits to be sure, yet they're two completely different genres.  Certainly genres that no one thought could ever actually come together.  Yet here stands Puzzle Quest Challenge of the Warlords.  A hybrid of the puzzle and RPG genre, and the hybrid works!  Puzzle fans and RPG fans alike will absolutely love this game.You'll start the game by choosing a profession.  A warrior, druid, knight or something like that.  And as you go through the game, you'll discover there are tons of RPG elements in play here.  You'll traverse worlds, visit towns, collect items and equipment, and most important of all: you'll battle, and this is where Puzzle Quest truly shines.The only puzzle game which comes to mind to compare this to is Bejeweled, a game several of you have probably played on your PC or cellphone several times over.  You're given an 8x8 grid where you'll swap two tiles in order to get three of the same tile.  When you match up three tiles the tiles will disappear and three more tiles will drop in to fill the void.  If you've played bejeweled, it's exactly that.  However, the color of the tiles represents something.  The purple tiles, for example, are experience points.  Each time you make three purple tiles disappear you'll gain additional experience points from the battle.  Skull tiles deal damage.  You've also got tiles that represent your mana, and when you take those tiles out you get more mana.The way in which battles take place is really quite interesting.  You and your opponent share the same board and will take turns to clear out the grid.  Your goal, of course, should be to go after the skull pieces to deal damage, but it doesn't hurt to do other things as well.  Red, blue, yellow and green tiles represent your mana, and each color pertains to a different spell.  However, you'll want to snag these too to recharge your mana and cast spells.  You'll want to go after the purple tiles for more experience, and after the Gold tiles to get more gold.  This is much more than just trying to kill your enemy before he/she/it kills you.  You'll also want to try and get more than three tiles at a time.  Stringing together combos and getting rid of more than three tiles nets you an extra turn, and believe me, your computer opponents are no dummies, they will take advantage of this and kill you.  It's surprisingly strategic, addictive, and of course, it wouldn't be a puzzle game without multiplayer, and the multiplayer matches against your friends are just as fun and addictive.Yet the game never puts aside its RPG elements either.  Puzzle quest is actually quite a lengthy quest.  Complete with sidequests, optional bosses, characters that join your party and everything!  Believe it or not, this game probably does span the length of an RPG.  That means you could easily spend over fifty hours with this game.  To keep its RPG elements in tact, you get experience points from each of the various battles you'll be in.  When you level up, you get a chance to distribute points among your attributes.  This means giving you a chance to increase things like your strength, HP or your mana skills.Visually the game is quite impressive.  The PSP counterpart looks better, of course, but the DS isn't so bad looking.  The manga style artwork is beautiful.  Sometimes its a little too easy to make a mistake on the DS version, though, mainly because you've got to use the stylus and more often than not you may tap the wrong piece.  It's not too much of a burden, though, and the game still plays just fine.  The 3D graphics and story sequences are also pretty good looking on the DS, as is the battlefield itself.On paper it doesn't sound like a good idea to mix the RPG and puzzle genre together, but the final product is certainly a fantastic one.  RPGers and puzzle gamers alike owe it to themselves to check the game out.  This is more than just another purchase of bejeweled, it's a puzzle game with great RPG elements that keep it interesting for hours on end.  A fantastic combination.Pros:+An interesting hybrid of puzzle and RPG elements that work+Addictive and strategic gameplay+The computer is not stupid+Fun multiplayer experience+Engaging quest+Top notch graphics+Top notch music+Hours upon hours upon HOURS of gameplay+The construction of the games elements (tiles representing mana, gold and so forth) is just so well done and put together and it makes for a far more interesting gaming experienceCons:-With the stylus controls you're bound to do something you don't want to do-Sometimes the computer is unrelenting; thankfully, you're not penalized if you lose a battle!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2007"}

Within moments after installing the ginormous game and finally crawling out into the ever-so bright sunlight the first thing you realize is how beautiful this game is.  I'm talking about a graphics that are as good if not better than Killzone 3.  It's good looking, really good looking.  I should note though that even with the 8gb install, there is a lot, a lot of texture popping and it is rather noticeable.  It's doesn't make the game unplayable, but it's there none the less and it's disappointing when you remember that 8gb of your PS3 hard drive is devoted to this game...so why is there so much texture popping so close to me??  **sigh** Oh well.  Also, some of the textures when you press your nose to them or even your finger are... pixelated.This game is interesting right off the bat.  You find yourself in a world filled with interesting characters.  You begin to wander the wasteland (or should I say \"wastecanyon\") with a pistol and a four wheeler and soon find yourself as in all good sandbox-esq games to be the necessary \"errand boy\" (which apparently is in short supply in video games).  You do things for other friendlies in the game and in return they give you blue prints for new toys you can make on the battlefield or new guns that give you new and improved firepower.The guns are pretty standard fair and straightforward.  The thing that adds variety in this game is various amo that you can load into those guns can give you better firepower.  Despite these upgrades and the various new guns you find throughout the game bring you'll still find many enemies are bullet sponges.  I find it disturbing that it takes two shots from a double barrel shot gun to put down a pesky mutant that is jumping around like gollum on steroids.  That's four bullets for those of you who aren't aware, and the only way you can reduce that is by landing that said first shot as a head shot.  However, I've shot mutants in the head with an assault rifle and yet they still do not go down until a second shot is sunk into their stubborn brains, but when they're jumping around off of walls it's difficult to land any number of shots from assault rifles, shotguns or anything else you can throw at them.  Perhaps some of this is my fault, I wasn't good with a wing-sticks (darn things keep breaking and not returning to me), or that I am bad at shooting at jumping targets.  The shooting in this game feels good and the guns are fun overall.Driving the dune buggies and ATVs in this game are relatively enjoyable but grow old rather fast.  Driving from point to point is boring and feels pointless.  The racing is ok but again feels pointless.  The blue prints, finding items and being able to build rc car bombs, turrets and the like is fun, but doesn't add much to the game.The reason these things don't add up is that this game is BEGGING to be an open world sandbox game.  Instead it continues to shuffle you down a corridor.  If you're driving, you're stuck inside the \"waste-canyon\" as I like to call it.  If you're on foot you're in a town that feels like a limited street corridor that feels so limited, if you're on a mission you're constantly running into the limitations of the area that continues to beg \"why didn't they make this a open-world sandbox game?\"  The idea of collecting junk and driving around seems to lend itself to a open-sand-box game.  Red Dead Redemption offers an open-dusty-world.  Resistance 3 offers a ravaged brown world and an enjoyable shooter.  Motorstorm offers dusty world where you can race dune-buggies and ATVs.  Killzone 3 offers a beautiful sci-fi shooter.  Rage has a lot of similarities with Boarderlands.  Basically everything this game has done before and it has been done better.  If you're itching for another shooter then you should check this game out but otherwise rent first to see if it's your thing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2011"}

Oliver","summary":"Changes are good","reviewText":"Right?Pros:-Good graphics-Good story(Picking up where the 1st one's emotionally bizzare, but excellent story left off)-Pretty good way to get skills(class points to get class, and buy classes, and get skills, it's pretty easy)-Cinematics are fast paced and action packed-No more using bio sphears at save points.  Save points automaticly heal you, and bisphears are used at the menu to completley heal-While fighting you can carry on your boost you have left from the last fight, and carry it on to the next-This series continues in a ok wayCons:-I was under the imression that data from the first one, like HP, attacks and such could be continued on this but NOOOO!!!  They say here's some bonus stuff, good job, and uh, we just screwed you over-I miss a whole lot of stuff like--Buying and selling(This is one of the main pricipals of almost every RPG.  Taking this out just pissed me off.  No more buying cool upgrades, or selling crap like scrap iron(I have enough scrap iron in my game to make a friggin gun)--Voices(They ruined this.  Shion, Kos-Mos, Momo, Chaos, Mary, ect voices were replaced by worse ones.  If they were to replace Al Bhedo's voice, that really would have been horrible, but Kos-Mos' voice change just really ruined her more than anyone)--Models(I thought it would be nice to see them mature a bit, but now, I take it back.  I miss the good ol anime style look.  The worst changes were made to Kos-Mos(At first I thought she looked great, but the voice-acting shut me off like a computer), and Momo, she was so cute in the first one, but now she looks older, and sounds like an obnoxios little girl)--Battle System(Ah the nuber 1 thing I and so many are complaining about.  The first one was almost flawless, it had awsome cinamatics during battle, and had a 2 punch then just blast them the fudge away, or do level up the speed with skill points and kick the crap out of the ASAP.  Now this game just toatly abandoned all of that.  Stocking is a pain, but you have to do it, unless you want a looooooong battle.  But stocking also leaves you volnurable, leaving the enemies to stomp a new @$$-hole in you.  Theres no more big moves like Last Symphony, or X-Buster(Oh wait, the put that on a E.C., who cares?!  It's for Kos-Mos!!)  You can't have 3 E.C.s(or AWGS) on the screen, unlike the 1st one.  The only bigtime cinematic moves are doubles, but they suck, so I tend not to use them.  In the first one I hated the tedious cut-seenes in the first one because I anxious to get back to the battle system, but in this one I'm a wanna sit and watch a cut seene because of the battle system.  Episode 1's battle system was like a automatic, easy to use, and fun, but now it's like they changed it to a for-jorkin' Stick Shift.  It's hard to convert, altho I'm getting a little better with it, I just miss doing tech attacks from the first one.-2 discs!?  For what!?  The first disc of this was only 9 hours, and the second was only 12 hours.  The first one was 40 hours.  And 2 disc RPGs are longer than that(Ex. Star Ocean was 2 discs, and 70 hours of fun)My first review before I edited was based off what I saw when my friend played it, and my first hour of playing.  He let me play a few battles, and it was pretty cool, but when I found out the full story for myself, I understood what he ment by when he said, \"Don't buy it, just remember the story from when I played it\" I didn't wanna listen, because I thought we had our own opinions, and I thought my experience would be diffrent, but it our diffences were close to a simile. At first I thought I could use data from the 1st one one this game, so I leveled up everyone to the point where I could beat the final boss without even worrying, but now that I did all that for nothing, I'm just pissed to a high degree, and not only that alot of the changes weren't satisfactory.  Well, this game is just a sequal that experimented with the wrong things, like Devil May Cry 2, Sukoden IV, The World is not Enough, ect.  Too bad it didn't pull a Splinter Cell(PT), Metal Gear Solid 2, or Resident Evil 4).  Altho all of this is just messed up, this game still is playable, and those who want to keep up with the Xenosaga series should definitly get this.  But those who moderatley liked the first one or hated it, will be dissapointed, hate this, or not even pick it up.  Personaly, I think it wasn't worth the $50 price tag.peace","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2005"}

Players will take the role of Frank Simmons as he tracks down his brother, who went missing on a trak into the Himalayas to find an ancient Buddhist Artifact","reviewerName":"Halicon5","summary":"Cursed controls and tedious game that could have been much better","reviewText":"I have finally given up on Cursed Mountain.  Not because it is too hard, because it isn't.  Not because it has a terrible story, because the story isn't bad.  It's the controls, and boy did the controls break this game.  I don't know how far I am into the game, but it doesn't feel very far and I just have to give up.PROS:+++ Atmospheric graphics and sound+++ Some genuinely creepy stuff+++ Really cool conceptCONS:--- Sluggish, unresponsive controls--- Tedious level designs made worse by the slow and sluggish controls.--- Very low resolution graphics.  Looks good on a low-end TV but on my hi-def TV the textures are blurry and blocky.GAMEPLAY: You play a mountain climber that must find his brother that disappeared on a mountain deep in Asia.  Essentially, this is a survival horror title, and it has much in common, good and bad, with other games in the genre.  Go around, smash pots, find glowing items to pick up, kill ghosts with you magical ice axe, use your third eye to see ghosts and blast them with your ice axe, and use wii-waggle gestures to break seals/spells.  Somehow this should all work, but the gameplay does not feel polished enough.  The game started to feel tedious very quickly, but I think the biggest issue is how the controls and gameplay intersect.  The lack of level maps or exploration maps also annoyed me.GRAPHICS: Sometimes the graphics look great and other times you feel like you are stuck in a low-res pixelated mess.  The only saving grace to this game's graphics is the fact that the developer has some talented artists who can make low-res textures fit together nicely into an atmospheric ambiance.AUDIO: Quite good.  The voice acting of the main character and the monks is forced and strained, but the ambient audio effects and music are actually done amazingly well.  Definitely the most polished aspect of the game.CONTROLS: Sluggish and unresponsive.  The old Resident Evil games feel more responsive than this game.  I can walk faster than the main character can run, which makes no sense because the main character is professional mountain climber.  Mountain climbers are nimble and strong.  This guy feels like someone nailed his feet to the floor.  The climbing sequences feel bland.  The camera isn't bad but it isn't very good either.  Combat is fairly uninspired and the collision detection for attacks makes no sense.  Sometimes I manage to hit targets that I obviously missed while other times attacks seem to pass through without effect.  I might as well flip a coin.VALUE: I couldn't stand to play any more after only a few hours, so I don't rate the value of this title very high.  I understand the game is fairly short based off of other reviews that I have read.I was really looking forward to this game, but now that I've had a chance to play it I am pretty disappointed.  I feel like the game wasn't quite finished, rushed out the door before the proper level of polish could be applied.  I really hope to see this developer create another game, but I just hope they do a better job of it before putting the game out for sale.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2009"}
{"product_name":"B001P5HM64","description":"Cursed Mountain is a survival  horror game designed specifically for the Wii. Players will take the role of Frank Simmons as he tracks down his brother, who went missing on a trak into the Himalayas to find an ancient Buddhist Artifact","reviewerName":"Sloopydrew","summary":"Overlooked Gem of a Game for the Wii!","reviewText":"Cursed Mountain is an even mix between Resident Evil 4 and Fatal Frame 2. Despite it not being as good as either of the two classic games that inspired it; survival horror fans should know that it took its inspiration from the best and is still bound to be a very good game. And a very good game it is.Cursed Mountain is second only to Dead Space as this generation's best survival horror title. Unlike Resident Evil 5 -- which ended up being more of a co-op action/adventure game, rather than horror -- Cursed Mountain proudly sticks with the spooky from beginning to end. While there is plenty of confrontations with ghosts, ghouls, heights and unbearable weather conditions, the game isn't trying to outdo Call of Duty or Killzone 3 in the action department.The game works in spite of the Wii, not because of it. The only real limitations Cursed Mountain shows is the amount of enemies on screen at once, passable graphics that are very much \"last-gen,\" and some irritating motion control that never quite works right. But if you play a lot of games on the Wii, you know that, with rare exception, these problems hinder all Wii games. I debated docking a point due to the control issues, but don't think it's fair to punish an otherwise quality game due to the limited power it had to work with.If you like motion controls, Cursed Mountain does put them to good use. When you've just about defeated an evil spirit, a red circle appears on its chest. You point the Wiimote at the circle, press the A button and are asked to perform a series of gestures with your motion control to finish the meanie off (and gain a little health in the process). This would be fine, except for the fact that about 20% of the time the controller reads your gesture wrong and you have to start all over again. This is only really annoying during a boss fight or fight with multiple enemies that then has to be replayed if your character dies.The fixes that could have been made by the developers are few, but they definitely should have been addressed. The controls are clunky (very similar to RE4) and borrowing a few ideas from Dead Space, which modernized and revolutionized control schemes and HUDs for survival horror titles, wouldn't have been a bad idea. The other thing -- which is the biggest problem of the game -- is that auto-saves continually save BEFORE fights with multiple baddies and BEFORE lengthy cutscenes. This seems totally unnecessary and does slow the game down quite a bit. Then again, it pushed my total gameplay time to 10 hours and 4 minutes, which does end up giving the feel of a better value, despite at least an hour of that being padding.Complaints aside, I gave Cursed Mountain a 4 out of 5 for a reason. The game has great atmosphere. A soundtrack that is truly eerie and adds to the tension throughout. Some scares (not enough, but what's there oftentimes works). An interesting, mature plot. And it does it all without giving into the temptation most \"survival horror\" games have (again, see RE5 as a great example) to add co-op and up the action while diminishing the horror and suspense.Cursed Mountain is an overlooked gem of a game for the Wii. It came out as an exclusive (it has since been released as a downloadable PC game) and sold so poorly that many people who would have loved it obviously ended up missing it entirely. If this is your kind of game (and if you're a fan of RE4 and Fatal Frame 2, this IS your kind of game), it's not to late to pick a copy up. But I'd hurry, as the title has gone out of print and once the new copies are gone, they're gone.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2011"}

{"product_name":"B003VJNPPE","description":"In BriefThe second instalment in the RPG saga about the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia, features a thoroughly engrossing, mature storyline defining new standards for thought-provoking, non-linear game narration. In addition to an epic story, the game features an original, brutal combat system that uniquely combines tactical elements with dynamic action. A new, modern game engine, responsible both for beautiful visuals and sophisticated game mechanics puts players in the most lively and believable world ever created in an RPG game. A captivating story, dynamic combat system, beautiful graphics, and everything else that made the original Witcher such a great game are now executed in a much more advanced and sophisticated way.DEVELOPER: CD Projekt REDBrief Story DescriptionAfter helping to stop the rebellion undertaken by the Order of the Flaming Rose and saving King Foltest&rsquo;s life, Geralt became one of the central figures of political turmoil in the Kingdom of Temeria. Geralt continues to protect the King in the monarch&rsquo;s mission to bring peace to his state. The last bastions of the Order yielded to the royal army. The only remaining task is to pacify the rebellious castle of Baroness La Valette, who announced separation from the Kingdom. It&rsquo;s been a month since the attempted assassination of the king, when his army arrives at the gates of Baroness La Valette&rsquo;s fortress in preparation for the final battle. In the meantime, Geralt, stuck with Foltest, cannot begin his personal quest - to discover the origin and identity of the mysterious witcher-like assassin responsible for the attempt on the king&rsquo;s life - a quest that would answer many questions...Key FeaturesA truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative events are dependent on the player&rsquo;s choices and lead to multiple different game endings and several additional plot forks. This time gameplay time will be shorter than The Witcher 1, but more intense and packed with events.A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter seldom seen in other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and attractive to contemporary gamers. We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt&rsquo;s personal theme, in which he&rsquo;s looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to play.Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski&rsquo;s book series and The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues sequences, thanks to a new game engine.New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in which we observe the link between our past choices with current actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.Sex and eroticism will be introduced in a much more realistic, involving and mature way, thanks to which sexual relationships are presented more credibly than in TW1.Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide an incredible, believable story-driven experience.Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further actions in the game.Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine create a cohesive, fully accessible world!Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a wider range of new tactical options.

The Witcher 2 continues right after the ending of The Witcher and takes the player through a boiling conflict in which the main character, Geralt of Rivia, is tasked with resolving order in the four realms. You will fight monsters, make difficult decisions and romance your way through one of the most gorgeous and excellent RPGs ever made. You play as Geralt of Rivia, a Witcher, a professional monster hunter and curse remover who gets caught up in more politics than anyone would care to.Visual: Assassins of Kings boasts the best graphics ever seen in an RPG, and of all titles released up to this point in history (yes, even better than Crysis). The level of detail applied to everything you see in the game is unparalleled; from the lush, green forests, fire-lit caves and castles to the little creases and fading on leather armor, everything is rendered in so much detail its easy to get caught up in gaping at the graphics rather than the game. Rocky paths are made from individual rocks and dirt, trees have clearly defined, individual leaves, weapons glisten in the amazing sunlight effects. Character models have just as much detail, not only in their armor and clothing but in their faces. Every pock mark, pore and mole can be seen in stunning detail. The full day and night cycles provide excellent atmosphere; sunshafts and shadows play a huge role in framing each environment. A sunset in Assassins of Kings is just as beautiful to behold as it is in real life, basking all before it in a golden glow.I saw a few minor problems, such as minor characters receiving less detail than major plot characters, however these are minor and are overshadowed by the overall graphical experience, which is legendary. The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is the new benchmark for PC rigs, and you can be sure that your PC will be put through the test if you should attempt to run the game on its Ultra graphics setting. Now, unlike other new PC game releases (think Crysis 2), CD Projekt RED included an advanced graphics setting where you can manually adjust graphics settings (such as enabling/disabling Uber Sampling). This helps in easing some of the burden on your smoldering CPU:)Audio: Like many RPGs on the market today, The Witcher 2 boasts a massive amount of spoken dialog, not only during cut-scenes but also idle chatter and passerby conversations. All of the voice work is fairly good, aside from a few phoned-in ones (Triss Merigold, I am looking at you!), and feels quite poignant and highly enveloping via accents and lore dialect. The soundtack is expectantly epic and actually worth listening to.Gameplay: Perhaps this is the biggest bone of contention with The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings that I could find. The combat system has been overhauled from the first game, now being more action-RPG like with real time combat hack-n-slash like play; you have a regular and a hard sword swing, a block and a roll/dodge ability. When it works its fun and engaging and it feels great to cut a swathe through foes, dodge attacks and feel like a true blade master. When it doesn't work its a mess. Its all too easy to target the wrong target during intense melee combat and your character will lunge and roll across the battlefield to attack another assailant, leaving your back wide open for attacks. Overall though the combat is great fun and fitting. In addition to sword play Geralt also has simple magic spells, bombs and throwing daggers at his disposal (all depending on how you level your skill tree). One really cool and unique aspect is that Geralt carries two swords, one for human combat (steel sword) and one for monster combat (silver sword). Its not an amazing aspect but it adds a nice lore component to the game.The skill trees are rather massive, with 3.5 paths to sink points into: Witcher skills, Magic, Sword skill and Alchemy. This allows you to tailor your experience to how you want it. You can sink all your points into magic and deal out area of effect fire spells and powerful knockback stuns, or you can sink your points into the sword tree and be unstoppable with a blade, or you can be a master at alchemy and create tide turning potions and bombs. The great thing about the skill trees is that there aren't too many pointless talents that you are forced to take like in many other RPGs. Sure, you still have a small amount of throw-away talents like 'health +1', but the majority of skills can drastically change the flow of combat.In addition to all the combat fun there is crafting and potion making. Crafting consists of finding diagrams, finding the right ingredients and taking them to a crafter who will them craft gear or weapons for you. Items consist of herbs and monster parts and adds in a nice collecting aspect to the game. Monster parts are gathered from, you guessed it, monsters, and herbs are scattered throughout the world, waiting for you to pick them. Potion making allows you to craft health regenerating potions, potions that allow you to see in the dark, potions that buff your sword and magic skills etc, and at higher difficulty levels these are a must as they can quickly turn the tide in an unfair fight. Bombs can also be crafted and are very effective.The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is a brutal game, in that even on the lowest difficulty setting you can find yourself dying a lot, especially during the first chapter. The combat is designed so that you must use block, dodge and potions to survive a majority of the skirmishes. On easy its a little more forgiving once you level up and gain more skills, but on the harder difficulties (most notably insane mode, where if you die you have to start the whole game over) use of these abilities is an absolute must. Many fights will have you surrounded, and since the game animations cannot be cancelled one small mistake can be deadly. Some may cringe at the difficulty but I applaud it, all too often modern games are too easy so its a welcome change to have a truly challenging RPG.Perhaps the greatest aspect of The Witcher 2 is the story and setting. The world of the Witcher 2 is a dark world full of shades of grey, where there really is no wrong or right, only actions and consequences. Sure, monsters are evil, but so are your fellow man and woman. Corrupt, self-serving and vile, the humans in the world of The Witcher 2 are disgusting and sometimes hardly worth saving. Racism plays a huge role in the game politics, as Elves and Dwarves are mistreated and outcast by humans. Most of the time the people you are tasked with saving are the same that would easily condemn you to death for being a Witcher. This is where The Witcher 2 shines the most; the game world is alive and full of flavor and lore, characters are fully fleshed out with rich back stories, motivations and goals. You will experience the wealthy nobles, the poor folk living in squalor, the rebellious Elves and Dwarves who revolt against the racism and the history that makes each region unique. Books scattered around the world and for purchase in book stores add little bits of lore as well, and dialog options add to the lore. You will see and experience corruption, redemption, hatred, love, joy and sadness, friendship and love.The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings has a Mature rating and it earns it in spades. From visceral, bloody combat to full-on nudity and sex scenes to more filthy language than a gangster rap album CD Projekt RED fully embody the M rating with no shame. At one point in the game there is a sex scene that lasts for at least a minute or two, interspersed with other scenes mind you, but still. There aren't any true romance aspects of the game, as Geralt can sleep with any woman, provided the option comes up, and there are whorehouses available during moments in the game. With that said, its clearly obvious that Gearlt does have a love interest in the game, as you will find out if you choose to partake in this grand adventure.Choice plays a huge role in almost everything you do, starting as early as the very first moments of the first chapter. Unlike most of the modern 'choice inducing' RPGs of today The Witcher 2 makes you face the consequences of your actions in game, not at the end of the game or in the form of extra dialog options or extra loot or something equally trivial. If, for example you choose to side with rebels over an elite soldier group you see and experience that choice right away, and the game plays quite differently in the next chapter depending on which side you chose. Not all the choices are this big, some will ask you to save a town from peril, or save/kill someone etc, but each choice you make has weight and consequence, something a lot of the modern morality games fail to provide. Best of all, neither choice you make is frowned upon and the game never berates you for making one choice over the other; after all, its your story and you get to decide how it plays out.The overall size of The Witcher 2 is arguable as well. Some may say the game is too short with only 3 chapters, however each chapter gives you more than enough to do, more than enough side quests and more than enough dialog to explore and mini games to play. From gambling, fist fighting and arm wrestling there is enough distractions to suck up a few hours. As far as quests go The Witcher 2 features less than most of the modern RPGs on the market, but in the end quality will always trump quantity, and while there may be less quests than one would like they are all great quests and worth undertaking. The main quests are beyond epic and the side quests are actually interesting, from detective style whodunnit mysteries to exploring a haunted mental hospital, everything feels well deserved of your time. The typical 'kill x many monsters' quests that RPGs are known for are present but there are only a few and the fit the lore of what a Witcher does for a living.As for the world, its not an open world game which may turn off some players, however the game is more an Action RPG than an open world RPG. There is a clearly defined overall story that the game follows. With that being said, each region you visit allows you to freely explore its play area and tackle side quests at your discretion. Invisible walls do play a factor, but to be honest I was so engaged with the stellar content that I never felt bored or the desire to go beyond the game borders.The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is the best RPG I've ever played, and easily a contender for RPG of the year. With benchmark graphics, a deep story and fully realized world, The Witcher 2 is a must own experience for all PC gamers.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2011"}

You have to pay attention to the clues and know when to trip up the witnesses to get to the truth.First off, understand that this isn't about fast clicking or bright colors. This is a game of patience. There is a LOT of dialogue to page through and read. You have to keep track of the situation that's going on, just like in a case of Law & Order. When did the murder take place? What was located at the crime scene? You get penalized for presenting wrong evidence, and you only get so many failures before the judge gives up on you. You have to pay attention and know what stands out as being wrong.There are only four cases here, but each one is fairly long - even the first one that helps to train you on how the system works. You start out with amnesia which gives your team excuses to help you out. Of course, it's *really* unbelievable that when you try to tell the judge why you're having problems, he won't even listen! Surely no judge would say \"Oh you have amnesia? Too bad, present your case.\"There are also situations where it's clear what you *want* to say, but because you're stuck clicking on little icons, you get told that you put in the wrong piece. I don't want to give away game clues of course, but in one early situation you are trying to present evidence that someone was afraid of police. There are two different items that can do this, but only one of them \"counts\".It seems unlikely that a real judge would say \"Well you didn't wave the right thing at me the first time, so I'm setting a killer free\". Other games like Law & Order or CSI handle this quite differently so it's still a puzzle, but not quite as \"gamey\". I guess what bugs me a bit is that it's *great* that so many people are learning about how the legal system works, it's important that we all understand our rights and our legal protections. But where games like Law & Order help us learn the system and test our intellect, the Ace game is much more random and makes it seem like the court system is incredibly fickle. It seems a real shame that it is missing out on a valuable opportunity. Even young gamers - or maybe most especially young gamers - could really benefit if they did these games well.I enjoyed this, and I look forward to more sequels. But I really hope they start crafting these to be more realistic - not in a gory way, but in a logical thought process way.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2007"}

The one thing I've always found somewhat annoying was if you played the spider-man movie games while entertaining it just seemed a little like you were just following the character from the movie and his actions which of course is understandable but also felt just a little repetitive too.  While the movie game versions did offer a little difference in the levels with added bonuses of an extra villain or two all in all you didn't really feel you were in the marvel universe unlike when you play this game.  The character Spider-man in this game definitely obviously felt more part of the marvels comic universe than the movie game one and seeing longtime hero's and villains of Spider-man come out to play was a real joy with the added bonus of free roaming New York city,  the voice cast I felt was also vastly superior to the movie game version and I'm not trying to put down Tobey Maguire but when you listen to him narrate or talking his lines in the games it just seemed so flat with so little emotion that there wasn't as much joy to play Spider-man in the movie game versions as there is in this one.  Like most of the Spider-man games you can upgrade you character to use new moves and combos to help him during the game from web swinging leg kicks to combo web strikes an the like,  the graphics in the game are great as well as a nice soundtrack and for this fans out there like me more than enough side quest like helping the cops with some gang thugs to saving the people of the city.

{"product_name":"B005THAX6K","description":"","reviewerName":"Sky","summary":"Eat This!","reviewText":"Nostalgic. Fun. Super easy....My son and I are having a blast with Aliens Colonial Marines! Dead Space it is not, and that's too bad because Aliens Colonial Marines really had the opportunity to be the \"Co-op Dead Space\" that everyone wished there was. (Dead Space 3 does have co-op but frustratingly not split-screen.)Clearly2008's Dead Spacesucceeded and was so outstanding because it was NOT co-op. In Dead Space you're alone; it's creepy and you feel vulnerable (and scared!) during every single moment of the game. Unfortunately, Aliens Colonial Marines is not even close to that; in fact it's just the opposite. In Colonial Marines you're rarely alone; the isolated, creepy feeling is just not there and you feel like someone has got your back for most of the game.But Aliens Colonial Marines is FUN!!! I play co-op split-screen with my son and we are enjoying it thoroughly. My son is 12, and color me a bad parent, but he's seen Aliens dozens of times and I'd say he's an expert at the game Aliens vs. Predator. So between his comparison to the AVP game and my experience with Dead Space (the best game I've ever played), I think that when we say that Aliens Colonial Marines is a good, fun game we have a little credibility.Fans of the movie shouldn't expect a story-rich continuation of the film. You'll hear some familiar voices and see a lot of familiar images, but don't expect much more than that.The graphics in Aliens Colonial Marines are not so good; graphics are way inferior to Dead Space and AVP--which are, what?...5 and 3 years old respectively? AVP was also a SEGA game, so it's surprising that a 2013 game would be not up to par with that. Much of the gameplay in Aliens Colonial Marines seems outdated (like the ability to carry every weapon at once, and the way ammo and other items are lying around all lit up with literal signposts marking many). The game almost has the feel of an arcade game from pre-PS3 days...and that's a while back.The weapons are almost all super powerful...especially the shotguns. The enemies are mindless with no strategy required; they just come right at you for the most part. On a normal difficulty you can rip through the worst enemies with ease and probably finish the short campaign in a single Saturday afternoon sitting.Online co-op and multiplayer options are there but I'll leave those to my 12 year old son. He played multiplayer last night for about 3 hours and said it was just as fun as AVP online, although as I alluded to earlier he added that, \"The graphics aren't as good as AVP.\" Like the game it's FPS when you're a soldier, but when you're an Alien it's 3rd person.My recommendation is check this game out if you're a fan of the movie and shooters, but check it out when it's not 60 bucks anymore. This one should have gone to market at 39 bucks tops.Overall: 3 stars. Fun: 4 stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2013"}

Washington \"CogsnWheels\"","summary":"single player non Co Op review- Its good as always, but frustrating at some points","reviewText":"I have completed played and completed the prior two installments in the Dead Space series so this isn't my 1st dance. I havent completed the game yet, but have gone far enough to give a review. So far so good. What I enjoy the most about Deadspace is the survival horror theme in it.The graphics, lighting, sounds, make the player feel like they are in an interactive movie. I am giving it 4 stars on the premise that the graphics, weapons, thrill factor, violence and gore, and story are top notch. I am not a game game savant by any means. As a matter of fact, it takes me longer to complete games because I do have a life besides playing video games all day, but I am an old school gamer neverless. This game is one of the few games that always holds my interest and keeps me coming back to play until its completed.The save points and story progression makes this easy as opposed to other games that I will play about halfway through and put it down and let it collect dust for several months and come back and complete it or sell the game.Now for what I do like and what I don't like.THE BIGGEST ISSUE that annoys me in this game is the control function that whilst in heated combat trying to manuver Issac dodging, running, rolling, turning around facing multiple necromorphs while holding his weapon is that in toggles the weapon to either the one you are not wanting to use or the scouter droid. I have gotten killed many times and have wanted to smash the controller because I will turn to shoot at another target and I go from shoting my energy blaster to deploying the scouter droid mid battle!! I HATE THIS!!. I don't know if there is a way to change the configuration to only use the arrow buttons to change weapons instead of using the left joysticks while you are trying to fight. This is the main reason I wont give this game five stars.I do like is the new ammo stockpiling system. I like being able to get one type of ammo for all of the weapons that can be attained or crafted.I do like the concept of the scouter droid, and tne building of custom weapons.I don't like the slow opening kinesis operated doors. I have been situations where the doors take too long to open, especially while you are being chased by regenerating necromorphs.There have also been situations where I have had a hard time figuring out what it is I am supposed to be doing. My objective could be to repair parts of a damaged ship, finding items in the weightless space environment & its hard for me to locate the objective because of debris and lighting. I have a hi def LCD 3D tv so its not my television.And this is probably just my skill level, but it seems like the AI sends a lot of enemies after you at once which can be overwhelming. This is on the medium difficulty setting too. It seems like they designed the difficulty higher this installment.All in all I really am enjoying the game except for the unwanted weapon toggling issue in mid battle. And if they comoe out with a Deadspace 4, I will buy that one too. :-)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2013"}

Let me lay out the bullet points of Dishonored.The graphics are very good, and the art style lends itself well to the game. The controls are pretty much spot on. It is extremely easy to get to where you want to go, and you always have the tools to get there. Your main mystical ability, Blink, is a short ranged teleportation spell. In practical terms, a swirling blue reticule appears on the screen and signifies where you will land. It is simple to learn, adding a lot to the game.Combat is well done, with your offensive sword capabilities mostly being centered around parrying and counter attacks. For long range offensive weapons, you have a pistol for when your foes have to die and you don't need to be quiet about it, or the cross bow for a stealthier approach. Springrazors are proximity mines that cut your foes apart as they walk over them. As a side note, there are abilities called \"Bend Time\" and \"Possession\" that add a myriad array of gruesome and satisfying strategies to your arsenal. I won't spoil that fun for you, just be creative and have fun with it.You collect \"Runes\" to upgrade you abilities, which range from: summoning a swarm of rats to attack your foes and dispose of corpses, a blast of wind to open doors or knock your enemies off ledges, dark vision that allows you to see enemies through walls, and a few others that effect your base status. \"Bonecharms\" can be found scattered throughout the world, and they add effects to your actions like: increased lung capacity for swimming, choking your foes faster, being able to move more quickly with bodies, being able to break glass more quietly, ect. Using runes and bonecharms to customize your character is challenging and enjoyable, allowing you to play the game the way you want to.Many people criticized the game because, when going the stealth route, you can't use all your flashy toys and abilities. Let me say this straight out; Dishonored is a fantastic stealth game. The problem seems to lie more in peoples expectations, and less in the games execution. Modern stealth has devolved to the point of having a silencer on your gun while you kick down doors and knife people to death has become the norm. Many people say \"it is too hard to incapacitate people, and hide bodies\", but the problem lies in that very sentiment. The \"Stealthiest\" way to play the game is to not leave bodies at all, aka don't engage.There are two achievements that drastically effect the way you play. One is called \"Mostly flesh and steel\"; to get that you cannot get any abilities past Blink 1. The other is \"Ghost\"; to get it, you have to finish the game without killing anyone, besides key targets, and without ever being seen. Getting these two achievements on the same run forces you to embrace Dishonored's incredible stealth mechanics. Having done this myself, I can tell you that it is completely doable to go through the game with no abilities, and killing no one. For me, it enhanced the experience. Many people complain that the game is \"too easy\", but when you play as a character with an arsenal as broad as yours, with such incredible abilities, I guess it would be. Only when you play the game with the self imposed restrictions of not killing and not using abilities will you truly see the vast world that Arkane Studios has created.Why fight your way through heavily guarded checkpoints, when you can scale an adjacent building and bypass the checkpoint entirely? It is difficult to incapacitate every guard, but isn't it more practical to simply bypass them altogether? Dunwall city, where Dishonored takes place, is a dying city, filled with danger, but also many different paths. From running across roof tops, sneaking though back alleys, to skulking through sewers and drainage pipes, there is ALWAYS a way to get to where you need to go without having to engage the enemy. That is what stealth IS; not engaging the enemy.Now, do you have to play this way? Of course not! You can play any way you want, and it will be just as satisfying. You are not forced to play anyway, and playing the game multiple times, in multiple ways, is encouraged. Go guns blazing your first playthrough, and then try out stealth. Play using elements of both, or only use abilities; the choice is yours. This game wants you to play the way you want to and enjoy it.

It's fun, and it's a good fit for the DS (you click on the objects with your stylus when you find them). The pictures are generally well done, although sometimes it can be frustrating when you click on an object and the game doesn't register your click (presumably because you're clicking on the wrong pixel).The mini-games, such as putting together a jigsaw puzzle, playing mahjongg tiles or playing concentration, are fun enough when they come between the find-the-object puzzles, as part of the main game. You can also unlock them to play them on their own, and I found them far too easy to be entertaining for very long in that mode.This game is fun, and it's always nice to have a game that you can play for short periods (as opposed to something like Zelda or Final Fantasy, which tends to be played for longer times at a sitting). I wouldn't pay full price for it, but if you see it in the bargain bin I'd definitely recommend it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000035XUZ","description":"For years a secluded mansion and its grounds have been the site of top-secret biotechnic experiments. The research staff has been funded by a respected (if slightly unethical) corporation. The weekly laboratory reports have been increasingly vague and now they have stopped completely. Recent gory attacks near the mansion have lead to rumors of unnatural canines on the prowl. Something has gone terribly wrong.Two S.T.A.R.S. teams (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad) are sent to investigate these strange and gruesome developments. Bravo Team mobilizes first and disappears almost immediately. Alpha Team follows, urgently driven towards the mansion. As either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, two valuable parts of the Alpha team, you work your way inside. Everything is quiet... too quiet.","reviewerName":"Vocaloid \"Digi\"","summary":"Residential Slump","reviewText":"This game has seen its life. It lacks the motivation and breath-taking function of others of its genre here on 2009. I find Clocktower for the SNES to be more entertaining.-The graphics-Fuzzy character sprites, blood that is so cheap that it looks like red paint? Resident Evil took a whipping in the visual department. The zombies look like Re-Deads. And a brownish/black fuzzy blob is not scary, it's funny. There's been games like Tomb Raider and Croc that visually look better yet they are both PS1 games.Like a Sweet Home spinoff, Resident Evil starts out with very little weapons, but with scarce ammo. The one major difference between these two however, are the controls.That's right, i'm talking about button-busting control schemes. All the earlier RE games have an annoying tendency of allowing the character to die, a lot. When other games came out (and before) the controls were smoother, RE insisted that the characters turn painfully slow away from an approaching zombie, just giving the zombie enough ample-time to latch on to have lunch, breakfast, and dinner.Now what's so scary about this game?Is it given that M-ratings were considered 'rare' back on the PS1? The script? Or 'knowing' some zombie is gonna come out of that hallway sooner or later? The game starts with the player arriving on the grounds of the mansion (in a grainy video) then inside. Immediately there is conversation. The voice-acting is dull, un-lively and boring. Do I care that there's blood on the floor? No, why? because it looks like paint, that's why! Don't mind the plain-in-sight dead-body laying in the corner there, it's decor! Or not. Again, the voice-acting is as bland and convincing as a monologue broken-record. Ahh. Something's there. Ahhhhh. Bad acting produces bad results.Given that it was the first RE game may be the reason for its praising, considering both it's puzzle-like feature of finding items/unlocking rooms and of course, the zombies in a squashed polygon-rendered environment. But by today's standards (Fallout 3 anyone?) this game simply doesn't cut it. Silent Hill has a remake of it's first game, it may be worth a try. But as for RE 1 original, it's a rent. Try the other games before considering this.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00B3PDHBU","description":"","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Comfortable and lots of features","reviewText":"Ever since I got into gaming, I have been a headset junkie. When you spent most of your PC gaming time playing co-operative games that require VOIP, it just seemed to work better for me than to rely on speakers and a standalone mic. As such, I've gone through more headsets than I could probably describe. Some have been awesome, others not so much. Since I've used and reviews plenty headsets in my time, I've kind of come up with a guideline for reviewing. When I use a headset, I grade it by four things: comfort, sound quality, mic quality and durability. I'm not really used to using headsets with my consoles (except for the mic/headset for my Xbox 360 when playing multiplayer games).  I didn't know how I would like using a console headset when I have 5.1 surround in my room already.  But let's get into the specifics.In terms of comfort, this was easily the most comfortable headset I've used in awhile. I have a large head and a lot of times headsets can give me a headache when first using them because they scrunch my skull.  That's not the case with this headset.  It fits comfortably and will be even more comfortable as time goes by.The sound quality is fantastic. The psuedo surround sound sounds good, though it can't compete to my receiver.  But it does a great job of balancing talking with game sounds, so that I'm never constantly changing settings (of which there are 8 presets).  It's very nice and sounds great.Durability is another area that's important, especially when you're spending over $250 on a headset. The XP510 is very durable. I like the way the mic works and bends.  It's also detachable.Mic quality is also very important to me because I use it to communicate constantly with my friends who are spread out across the nation. Mic quality is also something very hard to review. No one complains when I talk and it pairs well with my cellphone and no one complains with that sound either.Pairing the headset with everything worked really well.  It has about 15 hours of battery life.  If you're looking to spend in the neighborhood of $250, then this is a great choice in headset.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2013"}

Depending on how well you do will also determine how much your dragon grows. In the newest installment your dragon has three forms that it can switch between on the fly. These three forms have different strengths and its up to the player to take advantage of the right form for the right situation. It's really not complicated. One form has rapid fire, but the blast aren't as strong. The form that has strong blasts has weak armor, or maybe it's just slow. To be honest, I don't quite remember the exact differences but it is well balanced between the three.

Everything is made of great quality.  You can wear the belt buckle or Drake ring.  The Drake figure is a cool bonus.  The campaign is really fun.  The graphics are jaw dropping and much improved from Uncharted 2.  The things that bothered me were the plot gaps in the story.  Also the game was way too linear with no player freedom to explore the environments.  I thought the story was ok at times, then  plot gaps.  But the game-play was still awesome despite the story flaws.  This is the perfect game for people that love action adventure games.  The multi-player is very fun as well with lots of customization.  The multi-player will keep you busy for a long time!  Overall I think Uncharted 2 was better than this game unfortunately.Cons:1. Minor gaps in the story plot.2.

The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife.

I adjusted the sensitivity but it just seems to move really slow to a point, and when the joystick is almost fully maxed to either left or right, the movement is sped up beyond control.  So there is the slow -to super fast feel while looking around the environment.  Makes it a b* to aim.The AI is terrible.  People shooting at you from so far away that don't move, just stand there, you cant even tell where it is coming from half the time.  People shoot at you while driving before they can really tell who you are.  They seem really good at being able to hit you while your driving past them at 80 MPH too.The AI also seem artificial, like a texture pop in animation.

Monroe \"Life, is a state of mind.\"","summary":"One of my Favorite games!","reviewText":"Obsidian (with some of the original team from FO1 & FO2) was able to create a great Fallout experience that pays homage to the originals in more than one way.The dark humor, exploration, and unexpectedness of Fallout are well captured in New Vegas, and this game very much rewards creative thinking. Though it's a tad clunky at times and characters may seem a bit stiff, the heart of what Fallout is shines right on through! From the great western tunes, and desert atmosphere, it's very much an apocalyptic cowboy game with enough diversions to suit many different tastes. With so many warring factions and branching quest lines you&#8217;re bound to enjoy at least some aspect of the game. The core experience as always is great and offers quite a lot of customization which adds the replay value of the game.The DLCs as well are all top notch, each one offering a very unique story that adds new characters, weapons, and items to the games running lineup. There are definitely some challenges and goodies to be had with each of the DLCs, and if you stick it out you may even discover a few juicy secrets. The DLCs are included on a separate disk for download. The DLCs are:-DEAD MONEY (a sort of survival horror game with an odd treasure hunt aspect)-HONEST HEARTS (exploring a national park wilderness full of hostile tribes)-OLD WORLD BLUES (Science gone so so wrong, learn the secrets of the wasteland)-LONESOME ROAD (the courier&#8217;s final journey to face off against the mysterious Ulysses)Bethesda made a smart move in letting the original devs make a new addition to the Fallout franchise. As much as I love FO3, New Vegas takes the cake by offering superior story/quest writing and multiple ways to play and complete objectives. I cannot recommend it enough.Check it out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2014"}

Yeah they tried something new with the fatalities and it has its ups and downs but it makes it a lot easier to bust them and there are a lot of options to do. But his other complaint about the ending was stupid. In deception when you beat the game all you saw were pictures that were presented comic book style which was so boring, this one isnt much better but is no way worse than the others. With that being said I will give my thoughts. I personally think this is the best one to date. It brings back virtually every character ever made in the game. Even the secret ones like chameleon, rain, and noob saibot which you can use by himself and not have to team him up with smoke like in deception. It also comes with part 3 with the original graphics and movments which is fun to reflect on how far the game has come. As well as some bonus games like a mario kart style racing game this is fun and funny to watch. But with the insane selection of characters and the option to do air combos and the huge improvement in konquest mode this game is untouchable. It would definitley have been cool to also have original fatalities per player but besides that this is probly the best fighting game to date.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00005LOXE","description":"The two classic RPGs in this compilation not only represent hours upon hours of story, character, and action, they also present the background for two recent bestselling, critically hailed games:Final Fantasy IXandChrono Cross.With all the different names for the original 1991 release of the first title in this compilation (Final Fantasy IVin Japan,Final Fantasy IIin the U.S.), role-players new to the game may get confused. Make no mistake, though:Final Fantasy Chroniclesmarks the first time this pivotal installment of the cherished game series has ever been available on the PlayStation. InFinal Fantasy IV, players take on the role of Cecil, a loyal captain who questions the orders of his king, and for it is sent to slay a mysterious beast in a nearby valley.InChrono Trigger, Chrono must follow princess Marle's teleportation through time and locate her before an intergalactic parasite arrives to destroy the world. The original game, also on the PlayStation for the first time, was one of the first nonlinear role-playing games. The decisions that players make during the game will point them toward one of more than a dozen possible endings.These new versions retain the authentic Japanese SNES stories and characters while updating their graphics and adding new full-motion video sequences and other features.","reviewerName":"Axel Law \"The Happy Seizure Kid\"","summary":"Strictly a Chrono Trigger review","reviewText":"Since my semi-retirement from video games, I feel like I've lost touch with some of the new games of today.  A lot has happened in my life (which is why you'll find a 2+ year gap between a couple of my reviews), and have focused on school and other things.  But I've been meaning to get this review up for a long time, and it's high time I did that.  I'll try not to go \"nerdy\" here, but this is my personal favorite video game, not only on the Super NES, but of all time.I'm probably not the only one that shares this, as in a recent Nintendo Power magazine fans voted Chrono Trigger #3 most wanted game to be put on the Wii console, right behind #2's Super Mario RPG and #1's Terra-Gnigma.  And it's also coming to Nintendo DS.Chrono Trigger follows the tale of time traveling adventurers.  Marle, the princess of Guardia, is whisked through time accidently by Lucca's transporter and Crono (the lead character who rarely speaks) decides to go and save her, which leads to a series of time altering events, new characters, and the ultimate final battle with Lavos.  Lavos is the main villain, a parasitic life form that's been on the planet since the stone age and used the world's resources to allow mankind to evolve, thus empowering Lavos for millenia until 1999 A.D., when Lavos nearly wipes out the human race.  We are introduced to awesome playable characters: Frog, formerly a knight named Glenn from the middle ages; Magus, a sorceror from the dark magical age that Frog seeks revenge upon; Robo, a robot from the future and turns against the evil robots and develops his own personality (a la Data from Star Trek).  Lucca, Crono's friend, is a super smart inventor with a childhood regret.  Ayla, a prehistoric babe that seeks retribution against the Reptites in the Prehistoric Age.  And Marle, the future ruler of Guardia, and is swept up in a tale of high adventure and time.The characters are very memorable and even if you were playing today, you'd be rooting for them during the game.  Magus is out to destroy Lavos and is very narcissistic, especially towards Frog; Frog is a young heroic knight who carries the burden of failing to save Cyrus, his hero.  Marle wants to be free despite her royal upbringing.  Lucca yearns to correct her mistake of failing to save her mother from injury.  Robo aspires to become more human and constructive, and by the end of the game, he'll be one of your favorite characters.  Ayla's warrior-like personality may have you thinking impure thoughts about a Super NES character (and she's bisexual, in the original Japanese translation, LOL)... and Crono is the main hero and rarely speaks, but his heroic nature and adventorous spirit is the drive of the story.There are many aspects of this game to appreciate.  The intricate storyline with multiple endings might seem common now, but back then, it was practically unheard of.  There's also some dark parts in the storyline (Frog having to avenge Cyrus because Magus killed him, Lucca feeling responsible for her mother's injury, etc.) as well as downright goofy parts (\"Knights of the Square Table\"?  And what's with pouring soda on Toma's grave?).  The music, mostly contributed by Yasunori Mitsuda, is considered a classic SNES gem and is actually the most covered game of all time on OCRemix.org (I think it's got 87 remixes, as of this writing).  This soundtrack NEVER gets old.  I read in an interview that Mitsuda had ulcers making the score and Nobuo Uematsu and Norika Matsueda had to finish the soundtrack (only a few tracks); he loved doing the score so much that he had ulcers.  Hardcore!Gameplay wise, it's relatively simple by today's standards.  You've three of your characters in battle and depending on your combination, the double tech and triple tech combinations are different.  I always found this to be unique, and haven't seen it utilized much in later games.  The graphics were outstanding for the time; animated in a colorful and very Toriyama-esque style, its pretty smooth for a Super Nintendo game.  The magic spells look fantastic, even in 1995 when this game first came out.I didn't find this too harsh in difficulty growing up, and I still find it to be relatively easy.  I think this is a definite plus because if you are a young pup and want a good dosage of RPG Heaven, then this would be a GREAT place to start.  This is one of the rare games where the creators didn't want to make money off of it, nor did they want to make a turd for a quick buck.  They spent time, energy, and enthusiasm on Chrono Trigger, and honestly, I think it shows.  The storyline combined with awesome music, smooth gameplay, and emotionally-driven characters makes this a rariety.  This game leaves you with a happy feeling and a sense of accomplishment for beating it (and if you're an old school gamer like me, nostalgia as well.).Part of the reason I also love this game was because the friendships I've attained through this game, which might seem a little silly.  But hey, it was 1996, and Chrono Trigger was caught in the \"growing up\" scheme of things.Overall, I highly recommend this game, especially to the first-time gamer.  It's not too difficult and it has a lot to offer.  Now that it's coming to DS with a revamped translation (kinda like what they did with Castlevania Symphony of the Night...), it's easy to obtain.  Or you can also find it on Final Fantasy Chronicles for PlayStation.  Either way, this game is a must-buy... don't pass on the adventure of a lifetime!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"Not As Good As Mario 64 But Still A Worthy Mario Addition","reviewText":"If you played Super Mario Sunshine's popular predecessor, Super Mario 64, then you already have a good idea what Super Mario Sunshine is like.  It follows the same formula as Mario 64, only the castle is now replaced by an island resort. As you collect several stars and uncover secrets, more portals and worlds open up for you to explore. The new island theme is probably due to the fact that some of the Gamecube's new graphics can best be shown off in this type of environment.  Impressive &quot;shiny water&quot; and advanced shading are everywhere and even the bad guys are liquid-shaped gooey messes which also show-off the Gamecube's graphics.  Although the game goes to extremes sometimes with the aforementioned example, it still doesn't lose that old fashioned Mario gameplay that has made so many of the titles in this classic series a joy to play.  I only have two small complaints about the game. One is that I still occasionally have problems with the 3-D engine, especially when trying to find things above Mario or when objects block my line of sight. I also thought there was too much dialogue in Super Mario Sunshine.  Now, heavy reading in a game is never a bad thing and many of my favorite games are rich in-depth RPG's but sometimes it doesn't belong in certain games, and Mario is one of those titles because the game is about fun gameplay action rather than text heavy dialogue.  It doesn't take away from the game but I thought Mario 64 had a better balance. I probably enjoyed Super Mario 64 more than Super Mario Sunshine but I would still recommend Mario's newest adventure to anyone that owns a Gamecube.  It's a nice addition to one of the best gaming series on any console.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2003"}

The instant game collection always has some of the highest quality games on the market.

This subscription fee has already payed for itself it has saved me numerous amounts of money, I now am getting games I've been wanting to purchase for some time.So you pay 50$ you get numerous amount's of high quality games, it definitely sucks when you already have said game so I can be hit or miss at times. When I first subscribed I kept getting games that I had purchased a year ago and started getting sick and tired of the service, 3 months later the subscription is now paying for itself at this point. You will also being getting extra discounts on games, indie games, DLC, wallpapers, themes and etc.... Some of these discounts can range for 1$-15$ which is pretty nice at times. You also get a few freebie/ such as wallpapers and themes that are pretty cool. And now you have the option to play several games for 1 hour to decide whether the game is for you or not. You also have cloud storage and the ability to turn on automatic updates which will update all of your games which is pretty cool and it will update your system.Now once your PS+ Subscription ends, you will be unable to play any of the games you downloaded. But fear not, once you renew your PS+ Subscription all the games you downloaded whether you still have them on your system or deleted them you will be able to re-download them and start having fun again.I have only tried PS3 PS PLUS and for the price it's an amazing service, it practically pays for itself.

It's hyped to be the second best game on XBOX behind Halo 2, but Halo 2 has been delayed forever and it looks a lot like the original Halo to me.That dude that gave this game 1 star is probably just pissed because he only has a GameCube or something.  Who cares about XBOX live, XBOX is getting enough games with muti-player death matches already. Sorry to say but not all of us care about that.  That's another problem with Halo 2, all the talk is about online play, what about the campaign mode?  Watch it be the second hand focus of the game and turn into a clone of the original.

On the online, it was fun while it lasted ( when it first came out. ) But then again, it wasn't that fun. Afterall; there were glitchers all over the place; and the thing was, the glitches were easy to do. As long as you did not have ' a greatest hit ' version of SOCOM, you could do all the glitches, and they were all easy. Anyways back to the game, the levels are great and always will be for online play, but the thing bad about this game, is its unrealisticality. ( not a word, i don't think. ) You can use a Model 18. ( A terrorist automatic handgun ) and kill someone from halfway across the map. On SOCOM 2, however, you are unable to even take a sliver of health off a guy from that far. I mean an automatic pistol can't be accurate, right? Well forwhatever reason, in SOCOM, it is. Anyways, another thing bad about online, is the lag. Like most online games, its laggy as a mofo. Some other stupid things about online include: You not being able to see your overall stats, not knowing where you're clan mates are at any time, no friends lists... AND, you can kill ANYBODY with ANY GUN in just about the SAME amount of time, so forget about snipers people.That's about it, so in conclusion: if you were thinking about buying this game, you should have bought it before SOCOM 2 came out; or SOCOM 3 ( coming out in september )P.S.: Only about 300 people are on SOCOM at a time, and on SOCOM at its peak ( usually friday or saturday night ) has a staggering 30000 people online at once.

Following the events of the previous game, Kazuma and Haruka (his adopted daughter) have left Kamurochoto to seek a new life in Okinawa where they manage an orphanage for children. However, their peaceful life is soon interrupted when a series of events unfold pulling Kazuma back into the shadowy past he thought he had left behind. Making its first appearance exclusively on the PlayStation 3 platform, the rich story and vibrant world of Yakuza 3 lets players engage in intense brutal clashes within the streets of Okinawa, and the pulsating and often dangerous city of Tokyo where only the strongest will survive.","reviewerName":"Patricia Laverty","summary":"An Absolute Pleasure to Play!","reviewText":"Yakuza 3 takes the GTA formula, matures it, adds a fantastically written storyline and comes up with a very interesting and very mature game which makes it hard to put the controller down before the final credits roll.Yakuza 3 takes place right where Yakuza 2 left off. Kazuma has decided to forget his Yakuza ways and open up an orphanage in Okinawa. Little does he know once it's established both the Japanese Government and Yakuza will make a land grab trying to build a resort and military base on the once peaceful holiday town of Okinawa. With this in mind, Kazuma tries to negotiate his land and from there he ends up being dragged back into the seedy world of the Yakuza.Yakuza is a third person action RPG that plays significantly different to many other games. For example, the first three or so hours could have been the most boring, but it turns out to be quite interesting. In many ways the game reminds us of Heavy Rain, the most menial tasks can seem interesting as they are developing the story. Talking to the orphanage kids, trying to resolve disputes helps you to prepare for the back-half of the game where you are resolving much more violent, intense disputes.The game plays out as you would expect. Get a mission, complete it and get another one in one of the most realised virtual worlds of Japan we have ever seen. Featuring both Kamachuro and Okinawa, we are reliably told that the replications of both towns are second to none with real stores present and the actual layout of each city/town present in the game. There is also a lot of side missions to complete and some of these are full of typical Japanese humor. The game all in all sticking to the main quests takes around fifteen hours to complete, but with the side missions and mini games on offer it can get to as long as fifty.Aside from the main quest, the game also includes a number of mini games to play. Some of them become part of the storyline such as golf, but others on offer include pool, darts, bowling and others. The world itself is incredibly realised and you will find yourself distracted from the main storyline many times. You can go to a restaurant and eat, visit a karaoke bar and sing and even visit an adult club to while your hours away. All this adds to the atmosphere of the Yakuza games and you really do feel like Kazuma is a made man.Another main area of the game is the Kazuma character himself. Throughout the game you get experience and can build either Kazumas health or his fighting styles to become more powerful. Further into the game you get access to weaponry and can purchase and upgrade these weapons which become a key component to the game.Sometimes the animation can seem clunky, especially for Kazuma, but once you look past that you find a fairly solid combat system. On the easy difficulty levels it turns into block, block, punch, kick, but blocking on the higher levels leads to getting Kazumas butt kicked, so you really need to use tactics.However, we can't go further in our congratulations to SEGA without mentioning the problems the U.S. version of the game has. First of all, SEGA has made significant cuts to the game to bring it to the west unfortunately. The first casualty was the hostess clubs, so you will not be entertaining young women in this game and as a result some of the side missions have been cut as well. The game still manages to stand on its own two feet very well, but the question has to be asked about this, especially when they managed to bring Yakuza 1 and 2 to the west without changes.But once you get over that, Yakuza offers an incredible experience. From the realised world of the two Japanese towns/cities you visit, through to the incredible story line and story exposition (some of the cut scenes run a long time and give Kojima a run for his money) as well as one of the most realised virtual worlds you are likely to see, Yakuza 3 despite its problems turns out to be one of the surprises from early 2010. We just hope that SEGA continue to bring this series to the west and fully intact, because the game is so good, it deserves that much.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2010"}

The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

Back in 1986 in Japan, Nintendo made a unique and Tolkein-esque fantasy adventure game that became a major blockbuster and practically invented the video game fantasy genre and influenced many games since like the Final Fantasy series to others. On August 1987 here in the USA, Nintendo released it in a shiny gold cartridge as it was different as if it was like the king of games at the time telling us \"Those NES games you played? nothing compared to this for this will rule your life\" and it did delivered. I remembered back in 1988 when i got my NES with Super Mario Brothers/Duckhunt i also got this game and i was hooked into the world of Zelda and Mario since.It's a game unlike players at seen at the time as it shows us an overhead view to the idea of finding hidden places/dungeons, the idea of the game is to explore the land in hopes of finding required unique items and ways to destroy enemies to earn Rupees (a Hyrulian kind of money in the form of a diamond). The graphics are very good for the time and the music is memorable as hell including that \"Overworld\" theme which rocks. The game is influenced by JRR Tolkein's works, The Black Cauldron and Legend (1985) as this game has created a legacy of it's own that has been around for 26 years since then and is a satisfying game because of it's originality and ideas.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2012"}

Since then I sort of parted ways with the Rayman series though not intentionally. I always enjoyed the color and lighthearted fun of Ubisoft's Rayman games and that holds true with Rayman Legends for my PS3.--------------------STORYLINE:Rayman is the silent protagonist and while that can make storytelling a bit more challenging Ubisoft does a good job setting up the plot for Legends. Rayman and friends have been asleep since his last adventure (Rayman Origins) and 5 evil Teensies (like floating faeries) have captured the other teensies and ten princesses across the land. It's up to Rayman and his friends to stop the evil teensies, rescue the captured princesses and teensies and restore peace to the land.--------------------GRAPHICS:Bright, colorful, fun, and full of character are all words I'd use to describe Rayman Legends. Rayman 2 was impressive all those years ago on my Dreamcast and the PS3's enhanced color palette and graphical horsepower play nicely with Rayman. This is a beautiful game with varied levels and themes (more on that in a bit)Legends presents a main hub where Rayman can enter various rooms to access everything from levels to creature friends, other playable characters, online challenges and more. Worlds are presented as themes like \"Teensies in Trouble\", \"Toad Story\", \"20,000 Lums Under the Sea\", and more. Each \"world\" features a subset of paintings that Rayman jumps into to start a specific level which are also named. Each level features a set amount of Teensies that require rescuing including a 'king' and 'queen' Teensie, and also a specific amount of Lums (think fireflies). At the end of each level your tally of Teensies and Lums are calculated and a level rating is given in the form of a bronze, silver, or gold trophy. Collecting a varying amount of Lums will also unlock bonus tickets that can earn Rayman bonuses like extra Lums or creatures.--------------------ONLINE:The online portion of Legends is presented in the form of daily and weekly challenges. Each challenge is a world-wide competition to set a high-score and your performance is tallied against all other Rayman Legends players. The higher your score the more Lums earned and also a boost to your \"awesomness level\".--------------------OTHER MODES:Also worth mentioning is a 2-player mini-soccer game included in Legends that is both very fun, fast and addictive.--------------------THE GOOD:(+) Appropriate for kids(+) Bright, colorful levels that drip in imagination and creativeness(+) Fun platforming fun in the same vein as Super Mario Bros. and other side-scrolling platformers(+) Levels have checkpoint system so that inevitable resets don't take you to the beginning of the level--------------------THE BAD:(-) Can be quite challenging even for gamer adults, so kids can find the game frustrating--------------------CONCLUSION:Ubisoft delivers another excellent Rayman title that keeps production values high. This is a beautiful, fun game that is appropriate for kids and adults! The degree of challenge will keep even older kids engaged. Recommended!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2013"}

{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"evani1997","summary":"The Best System I've Ever Had!","reviewText":"Nintendo's next generation system, called the Wii U, is the first of the eight generation systems to release in stores. But is it worth your money? Or should you pass it up for another system?Simply put: No! Do not neglect the Wii U, just because the other systems have more power. The Wii U has so many features and upgrades to it, that you'll definitely want to try it! Let's take an examination of each of the important aspects as to what makes a console a good console:1. HardwareThe Wii U's hardware is pretty much a mixture between a PS3 and a Wii. On one hand, you have the online functionality and graphics of the PS3 and the Nintendo innovation of the Wii. The two mix very well, taking my favorite parts of the last generation's systems. Top that off with an innovative way to play games, the off-TV play, and you've got possibly the best hardware in gaming thus far!The off-TV play is much more useful than you might think. Having the Wii U for about a year now, my family and I have used the off-TV play function about as much as the normal function. It's very useful if someone wants to watch the game or their soap operas or even play another system. When someone wants to play our PS3, I can easily play Wii U while they're playing on the pad, which leads to less frustration. Sony tries to mimic this with the PS Vita, but the PS4 and Vita together cost about $400 more than a Wii U.It also comes with bonus features such as Nintendo TV and Miiverse. I want to talk specifically about Miiverse, because I think it's one of the best additions to the Wii U. Miiverse is an online community where users can talk about any games that are on Wii U. It has a strict policy that doesn't allow vulgar language or anything sexually explicit. This is especially nice for people like me who can't play online due to foul-mouths. However, I should mention that certain communities find it easier to get away with things than others.The battery life has been criticized, but I don't think it's a big deal. Though it is short, it can be plugged in and charged at any time, without it needing the system on (I'm looking at you PS3!).2. GraphicsSimply put, the graphics to the Wii U are beautiful! Their slightly better than the PS3 and Xbox 360's, but with Nintendo's talent, they outshine them significantly. NintendoLand, which comes with the Deluxe bundle, has better graphics than anything I've seen on either PS3 or Xbox 360! What took Sony and Microsoft about six years was accomplished by Nintendo in one try! Now it's true that games such as New Super Mario Bros. U don't really push the hardware's limits, but even still, games like The Wind Waker HD and Sonic Lost World show that this system contains some of the best graphics out there.3. PowerOkay, it's true: the Wii U has the power of the last two systems, while the PS4 and Xbox One have significantly more power. To me though, that doesn't matter. One of my favorite games, LittleBigPlanet 2, had almost infinite possibilities, and that was on a PS3's power. True, there were a few things that could have been improved, but for the most part, it was nearly limitless. Adding as much power as the PS4 and Xbox One does seems to be pointless. Games can't get much better. That is, unless they become more expensive. At the same time, Nintendo has won several game-of-the-year awards on Wii (which has significantly less power than the PS3 and Xbox 360). With the power of the Wii U, Nintendo seems to be even more open to making even higher quality games than before!4. GamesPossibly the most important, the Wii U's game line-up is the best of the three next-gen systems. Though it's launch line-up started a bit slow, the Wii U's line-up has been increasing with some of the most varied games out there. PS4 and Xbox One both focus more on the shooter type genre than anything, while the Wii U features shooters, platformers, racers, kid-friendly, and mature games of the like. Unlike the Wii, the Wii U features great family games like Mario and Wii Party, while also featuring mature games like Assassin's Creed and Batman. Speaking of which, the third-party support is also a lot better than it was on Wii. Not to even mention that the next Smash Bros. and Zelda are coming out soon on Wii U.I should also note that the Wii U is the only next-generation system that has backwards compatibility. I really wish that the PS4 or the Xbox One could play PS3 or Xbox 360 games. Sadly, this isn't the case. I know that the Xbox One can play 360 games if you have the 360 hooked up to it, but I'm referring to without the aid of another system. Thanks to this ability, you could download all your Wii game files into the Wii U and sell your Wii, saving you even more money.The VerdictIf you're trying to decide which of the eighth-generation systems you should get, your first choice should be Wii U. Though it might not have as much power as the other two, the Wii U just has the best amount of content and variety for the cheapest price! I'm not saying that you shouldn't get a PS4 or an Xbox One, but rather that this is probably the best option of the three.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000JLIYLC","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"Visceral.","reviewText":"Ladies and gents, it's finally time to get down and dirty on your PlayStation 3. Evolution Studios' MotorStorm, a motocross-style racing game and one of the first PS3 games ever shown, finally explodes out of the gates in style. What makes this filthy, dirty, explosive racer so much fun? Most importantly, despite being a blast, is it actually worth the $60 admission?MotorStorm is a very simple game at face value. In fact, the gameplay is akin to Burnout-braking is hardly ever needed, and alongside accelerating you'll be using a boost feature to stay ahead of the pack. However, Evolution Studios' racer is much more technical in practice-each of the eight tracks featured in beautiful Monument Valley are loaded with jumps, blind turns, hidden paths, and slippery pits of mud. In fact, there are several different lines throughout each track. Rockhopper comes to mind when I think of multiple paths, narrow jumps, and huge drop-offs. The circuit offered in the downloadable demo was the high-altitude Raingod Mesa, which has one of the most exciting banked turns and cliff side stretches in the game. The Coyote Rage track is condensed but still features a lot of different paths and makes a wonderfully varied track for any vehicle. At The Grizzly, anything goes-it's extremely diverse and alway exciting no matter what vehicle you're driving.The racing is very physics-based, and because of the various obstacles and racing lines, Evolution Studios offered seven different types of vehicles. You can choose from several kinds of rally cars, bikes, racing trucks, ATVs, buggies, \"Mud Pluggers,\" and big rigs. In that very order from left to right you lose speed but race the easy ground-bikes will always beat Mud Pluggers in the straight, but the `Pluggers will flat-out dominate them in the slippery low grounds of each track. Big rigs shove everyone around, but are clumsy to drive and incredibly slow to accelerate. Buggies were always enjoyable rides because they have a great balance of speed, control, and can handle most of the game's different lines without a problem. Each vehicle controls differently in different terrain; rally cars can't handle anything less than solid ground while ATVs earn their acronym by handling well in all terrain. Generally every vehicle handles well; I really liked the responsiveness of the ATVs and bikes, but the sluggishness of the big rigs and `Pluggers helped in the low grounds. Different vehicles also have different boosting advantages and disadvantages: big rigs can boost for a much longer time than other vehicles, but the boosting still doesn't make it a speedy candidate. Bikes and rally cars explode forward but take some time to cool down. Learning each vehicle is just as important as knowing each of MotorStorm's tracks.Despite the fact that there are only eight tracks and seven vehicles, none of MotorStorm's races grow tiresome or repetitious thanks to how much fun the racing actually is. You see, MotorStorm usually throws you into races against several different types of vehicles-sometimes all seven-and each vehicle's strengths and weaknesses really show. If you're a rally car you'll be enjoying wonderful handling and speed, but you'll really have to pick a line as far away from the bigger vehicles as possible. MotorStorm's CPU-controller opponents generally form large packs during the race, so gaining positions and fighting to stay alive (especially on bikes or ATVs) is always exciting. The different lines intersect at several points throughout each race, so oftentimes you'll be riding along without anyone around when all of the sudden an entire pack of big rigs come flying out of the low grounds. Again, it's always very exciting.I hadn't mentioned crashes before now, but it would be a sin to further neglect them. I mentioned Burnout earlier, and even EA's \"crash porn\" racing game doesn't have crashes like this. MotorStorm flexes the PS3's muscles with smoky, fiery explosions, destructible vehicles and environments, and all of the itsy-bitsy particle effects that should accompany all of the above. There is nothing more satisfying than fighting through a pack of vehicles, ramming an ATV, and watching the poor sap careen into a huge rock formation, just to explode and be ejected into the abyss.MotorStorm offers 21 \"tickets\" in its main gameplay mode. Each \"ticket\" lets you race in one to four different races, and as you win races, you earn points, new tickets, and new vehicles. It's a design that is completely lacking in flashiness but it never ceases to be a fun challenge. There are five levels of difficulty, and by even the fourth level you'll be forced to know each vehicle's strengths and weaknesses very well before expecting to even place in the top three. MotorStorm's races can be frustrating, especially the long-winded ones, but I never found myself in a position where I didn't want to restart the race or keep the SIXAXIS in my hand. Speaking of the SIXAXIS, MotorStorm features a motion-controlled mode that lets you twist and turn the controller around to steer. It's not the preferred method of control, and it's actually disabled by default, but it works surprisingly well.As stated before, visually MotorStorm is stunning. It is quite easily the best-looking PS3 game to date and jumps in line with some of the best-looking console games to date. The Monument Valley location is absolutely beautiful; you'll never tire of the vibrant red cliff sides contrasting to the baby blue skies. Shrubbery, signage, and other obstructions litter each track. Never did I feel like there wasn't enough to look at while tearing across dangerous rocky ridges. MotorStorm is also quite possibly the loudest game I've ever played. The top-notch, perfectly-fitting soundtrack blares in the background while engines rip and explosions blast out of your speakers like no other. I noticed that the 21 songs in the soundtrack didn't recycle well, though-the game's automatic shuffling of songs seemed to pick \"Breed\" and \"Automatic Thrill\" a whole lot for me, and though I enjoyed the songs every time I heard them, I do like some variety.MotorStorm's praises sadly come to an end when you start to think about long-term value. The single-player mode offers a lot of races and challenges, but once you're done with that, an online mode is the only other method of play. There isn't even a split-screen multiplayer mode-all multiplayer races are done online. Fortunately the online mode allows you to earn ranks and the like, so it's got a decent amount of depth as well. Still, anything else would have been nice-a crash mode, perhaps a stunt mode for the bikes and ATVs. Also, loading times grow very tiring. It takes about 10 seconds to load a vehicle in the vehicle selection screen, and about 30 seconds to load a race. When you consider that Coyote Rage races are only about 2:30, a 30-second load time is pretty long.Overall, MotorStorm is one of the better PlayStation 3 games on the market. It is one of the only racing games I feel deserves to be called \"visceral,\" and only by bolding \"exciting\" do I stress how thrilling this game really is. It's got the top visuals, excellent soundtrack, explosive crashes, detailed courses-really, the only thing more you could want is a little substance, but in the end, MotorStorm is still worth the purchase. PS3 owners needed something to do anyway.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2007"}

Usually you could hit field goals no longer tham 30 yards long and with horrible hangles to occasionally miss extra points. Here you hit the A button for power and again the A button for accuracy.

Put your knowledge to the test as you play with up to 8 friends - buzzing your way to game show stardom!","reviewerName":"Kyle Slayzar","summary":"The Evolutionary, But Not Revolutionary, Party Game","reviewText":"One of my largest criticisms of the Playstation 3 is how it lacks being a party machine or a family-friendly one.  I recently purchased Pure and was extremely disappointed to see NO offline multiplayer.  Sony has seriously capitalized on the growing online market, thinking since World of Warcraft has over ten million members, they should be able to pull off the same.  Wrong!However, as William Shatner once said (again, and again), \"There... is... always... hope!\"  Enter Buzz!: Quiz TV (\"Buzz QT\").In an effort to appeal to the party group that the Nintendo Wii has preyed on and dominated in for over two years, the guys over at Renlentless Software divised Buzz QT to market exclusively for the PS3 to reign in sales over the Wii.  To this extent, they were successful with me as I also own a Nintendo Wii.  I wanted something that would bring the friends together in a setting other than the local bar or bowling alley (that's what Wii Sports is for!).To a fair extent, Buzz QT brought the friends (and the beer) over to my place to face-off each other in a climactic battle of whits over, what appeared to me, very simple questions.  It was pretty much a battle to see who could hit the button the fastest and often differentiated by several hundreds of a second.  This goes to show how accurate the devices are.  You can't even block the signal by standing in front of your opponents or placing your hands on their controllers (believe me, I tried).With over 5000 questions, the chance of a repeat question is rare, but has occured over the course of playing over a week.  My only request is that the questions be harder so we actually have to sit there and think.  Questions like, \"Who plays Rachel in Friends,\" are hardly a challenge... especially since Jennifer Anniston is so hot that anyone can remember that.  I guess my other request is that they be so kind as to provide batteries but that's just a prayer on its own.However, despite the fun my friends and I had playing Buzz QT we got bored of the game after an hour or two and immediately proceeded to kill hoardes of zombies in Left For Dead.  This is an apples to oranges argument, but the buzz (so-to-speak) wore off after a few hours and we desired to play a more complex group game.Then there's the single-player game.  I like to compare Buzz QT to Mario Party 8, a great game for groups but fairly dull if individually played.  If I want to quiz myself, I'll read on tachyons and quantum physics on that bloody online encyclopedia that's always right.  Trivia games are best suited in groups since it adds the element of competition between someone you can sneer at and make Ace Ventura \"loser\" taunts at.  You can't do that to a computer, which is nothing more than a think-fast-beat-your-time thingy.  Such a feature does not hold water for very long.Now, I will admit I have yet to play Scene-It but I have seen it (oy vey, no pun intended) played and while Buzz QT is superior on first impression, it is only an evolutionary step in the right direction and not a revolutionary one.  It's superior, but not by an impressive amount.All in all, Buzz QT is a great party game!  The online content thingy would be cool to review if I used the internet feature, which I don't.  It's not-so-nice with single player but very worthy if you're having guests over and wish to squash them underneath your boots of superior popular culture wisdom!  *evil laughter*","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2008"}

Third-party batteries with less reliability and smaller charging capacity are negligibly cheaper. I've bought about 10 of these batteries by now and they are perfect.I would also recommend picking them up before they stop being produced, since the Xbox One is Microsoft's main concern now. After too much longer, you'll be unable to find these and be forced to use AAs.The very first rechargeable batteries I bought with my Xbox 360 in 2005 finally did die a couple years ago. Be careful not to leave them sitting around uncharged for long periods of time. This will wear out the cells much faster and eventually they'll be unable to be charged again. If you ever plan on not using them for awhile, keep them at about half charge, and try to at least give them a full discharge and recharge at least once a year, and they will last much longer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2014"}

That and having to use both hands is a bit of a turn off.I figured the Perfect shot would be more accurate and realistic. I have owned and still own Nyko products and have never had any problems. Until this item. Which with such great reviews i can only hope i got a lemon!Pros: (and reasons i was excited)-The one handed concept-Solid build-Easy to follow instructions (though they didn't work)-Compatiable with any game that uses the zapper-Had no problem with Trigger, though no spring easy to fire at fast paceCons:I've used the zapper like i've said, which takes mere seconds to put together and get started. But for some reason this gun...wow what a pain! It took nearly 10 minutes (when it looks like it just slides in) because while i was trying to get the Wiimote in, the side slits that should allow the wiimote to slide in were no such help. It took sitting down, really concentrating on it to put it in. It's such a tight fit and when you finally get it down and go to click it into the plug thats located in the back of the gun slot it won't always go. I felt like i was going to either break the Wiimote or the gun.The angle that you have to put the Wiimote in seems too steep. Getting the wiimote out was easier, but i still felt like something was going to break. I could actually hear the plastic moving and cracking (not to the point of breaking) while trying to fit the Wiimote in and out.I'm sure there must be a technique for both getting it in and out, but the easy to follow instructions did not help. Plus i had to take the wiimote strap off because i couldn't snap it in with that either, i'm assuming it's a must do to use it.I hope that it's just a lemon (not sure how, but i can hope to ease my mind) but as for the function of the gun and it's use, it was for the most part flawless. Once forced into place it shot fine, but it just wasn't what i was hopeing for.The plugs worked, i like that you plug the nunchuck into the bottom, but i think the design needs to be worked on. I could actually wipe away scrapings of the wiimote side where the gun had dug into it.I gave it 2 stars because though it worked, i don't want to use it for fear of breaking my Wiimote. Also for the fact that it scratches up the Wiimote (to the point of digging into it).I wouldn't buy it again.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2008"}

Back in 2005, Civilization IV came on to add some musical and graphical enhancements that Civilization III (released in 2001) lacked.  Back then, I wrote a review about Civilization IV as being a true rip-off in every sense of the word: everything from the intentional incomplete original version that required expansion packs to fill it out, to the poor interface that was redundant or logically absent.  I also forewarned, in my review, that expansions were imminent.  With the original title running at $50 at the time, and the expansions running about $30 each (two total), it was a damn insult that they expected us to drop over $100 on a game that was both an insult to our intelligence and a rip-off.  However, per my review, after Civ 4 was finally expanded, it turned out to be a pretty sweet game, though I still recommended that nobody buy it, primarily because the modification process of the game was nearly impossible, in any meaningful sense, for the average gamer.  (Besides the insult to our intelligence.)  Lastly, I made a prediction that about five years would go by, and the \"complete\" version (a fully expanded game) would be less than $20, so if you had to have Civilization IV, just wait a while for it to be worth the expenditure.Well, while I recommended that we wait for Civ 5 to come out and hope that it was better and less of a rip-off, I noticed that Civ 4: Complete Edition is being sold for $12.  Through all this, I have been diligently modifying my magnum opus scenario in Civ 3, which I consider to be the best Civ title to date.  What will Civ 5 be like?  Today's date is 9/14/10; Civ 5 comes out a week from today on Tuesday.  It is listed, as usual, for $50: the price offered for all the new releases of our day.  Seeing this, I had a review for Civ 5 before even playing it, and it is more of a philosophical plea than anything else.To begin, assume the following:1)  Civilization 5 is going to be addictive and fun as hell.  You will spend countless hours learning how to play this thing, plus playing it nonstop once you do master it.  That is just how it works with Sid Meier's games, and that is why we all want to buy and play them.2)  Civilization 5 is just the first title in this fifth installment.  I am willing to bet my life and yours that there will be at least one expansion pack coming out later, maybe next year by Christmas 2011.  This means that Civilization 5, the original title here, is not fully expanded.  This means that there are some really cool features that you and I want but won't be getting until we spend another $30 on the title for the expansion.  Therefore, Civilization 5 is not a complete game.  Is that worth $50 to you?3)  Civilization III: Complete is on sale for $10.  Civilization IV: Complete is on sale for $12.  That is, for $22 (plus tax), you can get one totally awesome, easily moddable game (Civ 3) and a pretty darn good game (Civ 4) for less than half of the cost of a brand new, incomplete, plausible waste of space.  (Well, at least until Civ 5 gets expanded and completed, that is.  Until then, you know what is coming: $30 expansion packs for Civ 5, while Civ 3 and Civ 4 are ready to go.)Given these assumptions and facts, my recommendation is simple - it is the same recommendation that I made five years ago, and the same one I will make so long as my brain understands logic.  That is, wait five years, friends, for Civilization V to be fully expanded and cheaper.  I guaran-damn-tee you that you can buy Civilization V for $15 in 2015.  Let's call it a gentleman's wager.  Here, I wrote it down for everyone to see.  Come back and read this review in five years and tell me I was wrong.  Avoid the impulse and forego Civ 5 for just 60 more months.  Play Civ 3 and Civ 4 complete editions in the meantime.  Heck, there are many Sid Meier games out there - play them for the next five years.  They were awesome when they came out, and they still are.  Build your library of all the video games from 2000 to present.  Call it your Aught Decade Collection and rock it.  (I call mine the Nil Decade Collection.  Nil is one of my favorite words in the English language.)Anyway, save yourself some money and enjoy the classics for a long while.  Heck, do what else I did, which was to download some NES, SNES, GBA, and N64 emulators (you can get SEGA and others, as well) and download hundreds of the classic video games from the 1990s and prior.  On this one laptop of mine, I have over a thousand video games.  (Back them up on DVD, by the way!)  And I am not talking weak sauce games, but I am talking all the greats.  In addition to all those great console games from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, I have about 30 games or so just for the PC.  While Windows 7 is a worthless operating system, and the computer market is hard to discern, I can still say that these investments (in both time and money) have provided me with ample entertainment for as long as I have owned them.  (Going on 25 years now.)So why an impulse buy for games that you know beforehand are incomplete?  My philosophy is that we show these guys who is boss.  In capitalism, the markets are controlled by demand, especially as assisted by price.  In this case, buying incomplete video games for $50 (instead of, say, a complete game, brand new, for $75) and then buying expansion packs at $30 a piece is like buying illicit, controlled substances.  You can only have so much fun with incomplete video games and controlled substances.  After you spend too much money, then you realize the perfect scenario: a drug high that lasts your entire lifetime, and a video game that still rocks your ass 25 years later.  That is, it would be more logical and fair to get it all done at once for one fair price, and not this piecemeal sales technique that is designed to make you look stupid but feel good while you are doing it.C'mon, people: boycott this type of marketing technique where they intentionally leave out the really good stuff, only to charge you more for it later, and then sell you the \"complete edition\" some four or five years later for about an eighth of the initial cost.  We saw this with The Sims games, too, only they usually drum up about six or eight expansion packs, hoping you will buy the completed title for a whopping $250 when it is all said and done.  (As of this date, The Sims 2 has not yet reached the Complete Edition status.  They have been idiotically bundling some of the expansions together, though not all into one complete package.  However, all told, a completed version of The Sims 2 will run you about $125, unless you also want the stuff packs, which cost more.)To close, this is my recommendation: wait until Thanksgiving of 2014 or 2015, and then buy Civilization V: Complete for about $20.  If you wait until after Christmas and into the new year, you can probably get it for $15 or less.  By then, we will have been subjected to Civilization VI, which will not have been completed by that time, either.  Follow the patterns, folks, and let's teach these people how to market games to us.  We are not idiots.  Thwart their schemes with good old-fashioned American market control: don't buy crap.  (Communism, of course, forces everyone to buy crap.  Let's not act like communists!)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2010"}
{"product_name":"B004NRN5EO","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"J. Cadieux","summary":"Highly addictive","reviewText":"I just finished the game and here are my thoughts.  First, the standard warning that if you don't like challenge or only play video games casually, you probably won't like this game.  Go with Batman, Uncharted or Skyrim if that's the case, they're also highly-rated games that I look forward to playing.I am an experienced Demon's Souls player, and finished that game several times.  I feel that experience helped me with Dark Souls, especially with combat.  Just like when I bought Demon's Souls, I really wasn't sure if this game was for me.  When I heard that this one was even harder than Demon's Souls, I hesitated.  But in the end I bought it a few weeks after release and had a good time with it.  It's not as frustrating as you might think.  I knew going in that I was going to die a lot, so it didn't frustrate me all that much when I did.  Use your deaths to learn what doesn't work, then try to figure out what will work.There was a point about 25 hours in when I was about to give up on this game.  I had already beaten several areas and was looking for what to do next.  I went to every area available to me and wasn't able to make much progress, just got my butt handed to me over and over.  I was ready to quit, when I decided to go online to one of the helpful wiki sites to see which area I should be attempting and which ones should be saved for later when my character was stronger.  I learned that there was an entire section of the world that I didn't even know about, and that was where I should be.  After that, I was able to make progress again.  Use the wiki websites if you need advice!The Good:1.  Really addictive.  I went full-out at this game.  When I couldn't play, I wanted nothing more than to get back at it.  It's not good to end the day with a defeat, as you'll be thinking about it until the next time you can play.  Try to end each day with a victory or progress of some kind.2.  Very large world.  The level design in this game makes the world in Demon's Souls look like a high school project in comparison.  It's huge, and has an enormous variety of environments.3.  A very helpful community of players you can summon into your game to help you get through tough parts.  It isn't cheating or cheap, it's the way the designers meant for the game to be played.  Don't be afraid to recruit help!  I used help for a lot of the bosses and it was awesome to work as a team!  I also watched and learned from them if I didn't know what to do, then joined in the fight.  There are also several wiki websites dedicated to this game that you can use for help such as to find out what certain items do or advice on which area you should be attempting next.4.  Full character customisation.  I used a \"tank\" character with the heaviest armour and a hard-hitting weapon who just rushed the enemies.  I only had one spell, to heal myself.  Other players who I summoned into my game were playing as magicians or ninjas, or whatever.  You can choose exactly how you want to play!The Bad:1.  Some major frame-rate and camera problems in one part of the world.  It can get REALLY slow, similar to what it was like back in the NES days when too many objects were on the screen at once.  They must have known about this before release.  I'm told it's because the level is so complex and the enemy AI needed to navigate it, so it takes a lot of processing power.  Either way, the slowdown is not acceptable and I feel the developer should have made the level design compromises necessary to keep it running smoothly.  This is the main reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, but actually I think it deserves 4.5 stars.2.  While a lot of people are complaining that the game gives no instruction at all, I think this is an exaggeration.  A lot can be learned from actually reading the item descriptions and talking to the characters you meet.  However, they do have a point with some of the concepts, such as covenants, which don't seem to be explained at all in the game.3.  The developers bragged that this game had several times the amount of weapons and gear as Demon's Souls did, but a lot of it is pretty useless.  Some of the weaker equipment should definitely have been removed.4.  Not much story.  If you want a story-driven game experience, this is probably not for you.5.  The lock-on system is broken.  It worked really well in Demon's Souls, but in this game you can't easily switch targets while locked-on.  You have to break it and try to lock-on to the correct target manually.  This is supposed to be getting fixed in a patch due shortly.  Update: This has been fixed in the latest patch and now works as it should.6.  There is indeed input lag sometimes, as others have pointed out.  The problem is real, and it will get you killed a couple of times at least, as you hit the button to refill your HP in a boss fight but nothing happens.  This is also supposed to be getting fixed in the patch.  Update: This also seems to be working properly with the new patch.If you liked Demon's Souls, this game will likely give you another 60+ hours of entertainment, and I recommend it!  If you've never played Demon's Souls, I do recommend playing that game first, it's at a Greatest Hits price now.  If you want to skip Demon's Souls and just want to jump straight to this one, PREPARE TO DIE!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2011"}
{"product_name":"B007BJNR6C","description":"Introducing Assassin's Creed III Liberation, the stunning new chapter in the Assassin's Creed saga, designed exclusively for PlayStation Vita handheld entertainment system.  The year is 1765. As the events leading up to the American Revolution heat up in the north, Spanish forces plan to take control of Louisiana in the south - but they have yet to reckon with Aveline, a deadly Assassin who will use every weapon and ability in her arsenal to win freedom for her land and her people. Whether silently eliminating her enemies with slow-motion chain kills or luring them into deadly traps, Aveline strikes mortal fear into the hearts of those who stand in her way.  As an Assassin, Aveline soon finds herself on an unforgettable journey that will take her from the crowded streets of New Orleans to voodoo-haunted swamps and ancient Mayan ruins. She will play a pivotal role in the turbulent birth of a new nation as she fights for freedom, not only for herself, but for her fellow citizens.","reviewerName":"Arch Stanton","summary":"As Good as a Portable Assassin's Creed Can Get","reviewText":"This game is Assassin's Creed Jr. for the Vita. It has most of the features of its big brothers, but on a smaller screen. The big question is how an Assassin's Creed game can hold up on a handheld system. The answer, surprisingly is pretty well. Assassin's Creed has had to make a few compromises to adapt itself to the Vita's less powerful hardware and smaller screen. Texture maps are far more limited and incapable of standing up to close scrutiny. The look of hair and grass/leaves is particularly false looking. Grass is just a series of 2D images lined up perpendicular to each other while hair just looks like oddly-colored lumps. This is particularly obvious in the case of Aveline's stepmother, whose beehive hairstyle is often seen in closeup and looks atrocious. Also taking away slightly from the feel of the game is the fact that you can watch the populace appear from nothing as you get closer.Given these limitations it is impressive what the game CAN manage to achieve. The city of New Orleans itself is rendered entirely, and looks as good as anything from the other games (apart from the problems already noted). The running and climbing animations are perfect as well, and the character design is well done since the city is populated by a whole series of different looking characters. In fact, in almost every detail this feels exactly like the portable Assassin's Creed game you hoped for but didn't really expect.Some of the other compromises made for the portable market are a bit more annoying. Instead of the long cutscenes using in-game graphics, Liberation relies on shorter scenes that don't go into as much detail. I actually didn't mind this at first because I got sick of the overdrawn cutscenes in the main games, but after a while I noticed that this meant it was giving out much less plot as well. Throughout the entire game you are told to do things with no explanation given as to why, except occasionally for those times when they explain a lot very fast talking at you as if you know why you're there. Let's give an example:  at one point you show up in the bayou with no explanation given and then you follow the arrows to get to somebody who tells you you have to kill somebody. Apparently that is because the target is a bad guy or something? They talk about this as if you already know why you're here and what this guy did. There's some guy there you apparently know, don't ask how because they won't tell you. Then it turns out that your mentor, or perhaps friend, or perhaps temporary partner (without having introduced him the game is unclear) has betrayed you? Somehow. The bad guy says something that is apparently contrary to what that guy claimed. Or something. Oh, and apparently there's someone hacking the game to show you what's really happening. Because there's nothing that makes a game better than having to do bonus quests to have the plot explained to you. Then it's back in New Orleans. Oh, and it's under Spanish rule now. Apparently that's why you were there. Is this important?I understand why they're doing this. People playing a portable system often have less time to devote to it, meaning that missions have to be shorter and simpler and exposition less in depth. Instead of making shorter exposition however (and it tended to the longwinded already) they've written it at normal length and simply cut random chunks out. I don't know what's going on, except that I have to obey the computer in my head and follow the little markers. The compromises made for the portable market are extremely bad for the game.On the other hand, from a strictly gameplay focus this works fine. If you're playing the game on the bus on the way to work or during lunch or whatever, this is probably exactly what you want. The miniquests are fun, and the loss of a complex overarching story is less noticeable. The gameplay is exactly like that of AC3, with the exception that some things that were done by the back bumpers are now done by the rear touchpads, and the L3 and R3 buttons have now been moved. The touchscreen, which I always thought of as gimmicky, is now vitally important in providing the extra control inputs that there is no room for on the Vita. The controls are pretty easy and the entire thing flows naturally, even if the analog sticks aren't as responsive as a PS3's. The only complaint I have is that the combat difficulty has been drastically lowered, making it far too simple to kill people.A nice new mechanic has been added allowing Aveline to switch between three different personas: her assassin guise, her slave guise, and her noblewoman guise. Being notorious in one guise won't affect the others, but you can go around in any guise reducing your overall notoriety. This adds a new level to the game as each guise is treated differently by the populace. As a noblewoman you can go pretty much everywhere you want without anyone stopping you, and can even seduce guards into following you. On the other hand you can't run, jump, or swim, so if you can't charm your way in there there isn't much you can fall back on. The slave guise means that people usually ignore you, which makes it easier to investigate or climb things. The assassin's outfit is basically like the slave's, only all your skills work better. The game takes advantage of this new system quite a lot, and for the first time in a while I actually did feel really stealthy while playing.As I mentioned before the story is nothing special. Admittedly, I don't really like the story in most Assassin's Creed games (the contemporary stuff is boring while the historical stuff is often cheesy or forced) so I shouldn't be complaining about it now. However, I really do need a bit more motivation than 'here is your assignment, do it.' It's nice that they toned down the present day material, but in adapting it to the short timescale of a portable system they have removed the motivations. And that is a real problem.The big draw here is Aveline, Assassin's Creed's first female protagonist. And she works pretty well. She's not go much personality because of the limited plot, but what little she displays is charming and entertaining. She's a vast improvement over bland-as-muck Conner, who also shows up here in an unnecessary cameo. Other characters are rather limited. I enjoyed her father and respected her somewhat complicated stepmother, but generally speaking they don't go in much for characterizations. I guess something had to be cut. Too bad it was that.This game is clearly running at the limits of the Vita's capabilities. The game runs well most of the time with only very brief loading times, but I've never had a game more prone to freezing than this one. It's a good thing the game autosaves constantly because otherwise I'd have been screwed. Particularly glitchy are the popup screens telling you how to use the next new function. For some reason if you don't hit X fast enough the game can freeze forcing you to exit to the Vita menu and close the app. It can be very irritating because these are exactly the moments when you want to spend time reading carefully. None of this is bad enough to make the game unplayable, but it is definitely present in a big way.Assassin's Creed is one of those franchises that probably has no business on a portable system. On the other hand, this is about as good an attempt as can be made to do so. I realize that this is an ambivalent review, and that reflects my feelings pretty accurately. It does have a lot of good game mechanics, but it also has some limitations that are detrimental to the game. The addition of a female protagonist is interesting and adds a lot to the story, but there is precious little story to provide support. The plot is complicated and impossible to follow since they cut large chunks out. The costume-switching aspect is clever, and allows for a more varied way of making assassinations. I did enjoy this game, but at the same time I wished for more. It is as good as a portable Assassin's Creed can get, and I did enjoy it more than 3, so if you're a fan of the games and own a Vita give this a try.As for other Assassin's Creed games,Assassin's Creedis the first and is set during the Third Crusade. I liked it a lot (not least for its little-seen locations including Jerusalem, Damascus, and Acre), but it wasn't as good asAssassin's Creed II, which made a number of gameplay improvements making the combat system far less broken and introducing the best character in the series: Ezio Auditore di Firenze. This game is set in Renaissance Italy and takes you to Florence, Forli, and Venice.Assassin's Creed: Brotherhoodis a direct sequel to the second one and features the return of Ezio. This one takes place entirely in Rome, but the map is so big it doesn't matter. It was probably the best of the games. Certainly it was better thanAssassin's Creed: Revelations, which was set in Istanbul but never had as much of a personal touch.Assassin's Creed IIItakes place in the American Revolution. I'm not a big fan, despite the impressive wilderness locations. I just think that the 1700s are too late to set a game like this in, although Liberation did a fairly good job with it.Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flagis set slightly before the third game and tells the tale of a pirate captain, emphasizing and improving upon the ship-to-ship combat that was so fun in number three. There was also a PSP game calledAssassin's Creed: Bloodlines, which is far inferior to any of the other games. The Vita is the first portable system capable of providing an entertaining Assassin experience, and the compromises the PSP game had to make just meant it wasn't worth anyone's time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2014"}

You've been warned.Having played both previous Fable games (and reviewed the second) I was itching to get ahold of the third, especially this collector's edition. Exclusive in-game content is typically enough to convince me to upgrade, and that's especially true here since Fable 2's exclusive content never got released to the rest of us who had to settle for the standard edition. But the deck of cards, the stylish game cover and the Albion Decision Making Machine make this the clear choice of the two.So, what is the Albion Decision Making Machine, or ADMM? I'm glad you asked. It's a circular item, almost but not quite two inches in diameter, and it has two sides to it, a red \"Evil\" side and a blue \"Good\" side. There are many decisions to make while roaming around in Albion and many of those have a time limit. So the ADMM is there to assist you by allowing you to come to a decision when you don't have the time to fully weigh your options. To use it, you turn your hand mostly into a fist, then rest the ADMM on your index finger. Doesn't matter which side is up, it'll work either way. Slide your thumb underneath and push upward with said thumb. The ADMM does the rest. Once it comes to a halt, ideally in your hand, you then study which side is facing up. If you get the red side, then proceed with the evil action. If the blue side faces you, choose the good option. Lionhead made it clear they strongly recommend a liberal use of this amazing breakthrough in decision-making technology, and I have no intention on ignoring this clearly sound advice.But onto the game itself. How does the latest installment stack up? Was it worth the wait? Did Lionhead finally make the video game equivalent of the second coming?To be perfectly honest, it's well, an ADMM moment. There are many things the game gets right. These include much improved minigames for money, a proper co-op experience, a rarely used if ever setting for video games (it takes place in an industrial revolution type-era, something like what you'd see in \"A Tale of Two Cities\") a new area besides Albion in the main game, John Cleese of Monty Python fame as the butler and, as always, plenty of humor, some of which, as usual, pokes fun a Lionhead itself. But there are plenty of missteps as well. The dog's got some very spotty pathfinding, there are WAY TOO MANY dig spots (hard to get into the flow of the quest when every five minutes you hear \"Bark!\") way too few quests, and worst of all, the game is incredibly short and incredibly easy. It is not hard to get through it in a week.(Here be the minor spoilers. Read on at your own risk.)What's more, your decisions as ruler are strictly economical in nature. If you have enough money before coming to the throne, you can make every moral decision with no consequence towards the final battle. This is disappointing, and for a few reasons. One, the Fable franchise has always been about decisions and consequences. Two, there's a lot more to running a kingdom than just balancing the budget. It would've been better if the decisions you had to make also affected the morale of the troops and populace, or if there were quests to take that could bolster the kingdom's strength, or if good decisions had a negative impact on the kingdom/evil decisions had a positive impact. And believe me, I am certainly not saying that Lionhead should've taken the opposite approach. I'd rather shoot myself than play an Albion-style Sim City for the rest of the game. I just wish that they'd have made the section where you rule a little more involved. And longer.(End of minor spoilers.)And Lionhead, for the love all of that is pure and holy, ENOUGH WITH THE DIG SPOTS!!!! I am so sick of dig spots. I hated them in the second game and I hate them in this one too. I mean, you guys put way too many in. WAY too many. Now, I will admit, the treasures are a little better this time; I will give you guys that. But seriously, I'd rather not have the constant distraction, so if he DOES bark, I know that he's barking about something important, like a Silver/Gold key, a treasure chest, or an Auroran flower. Especially when I'm trying to find the last few keys/flowers. Also, Lionhead decided that it would be a GREAT IDEA to make ONE clothing item, out of 106, nearly impossible to get. The item in question is the chef's hat. You can supposedly find it in random dig spots or treasure chests, or you can supposedly get it as a gift from a chef who likes you. Two whole days, no chef's hat! To make an achievement based entirely on blind luck and tedious, mundane, BORING tasks is so asinine even Reaver would hang his head in shame. Is it really so much to ask, Lionhead, that you not have us jump through hoop after hoop just to get ONE article of clothing? Oh yes, and let's not forget that in order to get the clothing achievement, you have to have all sets of clothing at the same time. Brilliant, guys, just brilliant.So why do I still love this game, you ask? Besides the fact that it's Fable, and thus has all of the unique humor and setting? Well, as is par for the course, Lionhead has made what is overall a solid game, complete with weapons that evolve over time, a solid voice cast, an actual voice for the main character, the coop actually works this time around, (and there are both in game and achievement awards for delving into the coop) the Sanctuary is a far better and more intuitive way to manage your stuff than the previous menus upon menus of the past games, plus Cleese is there to sprinkle a little humor in, especially if you fancy walking around in your underwear for awhile, regardless of your gender, and there are some quests that just cannot be skipped, such as one that involves rounding up chickens, another that has you make a special delivery for a garden gnome-loving twit (which has an interesting, long-reaching - but not negative! - consequence as you play through the game), another quest that involves rescuing a princess from the evil baron, the demon doors as usual never disappoint and perhaps best of all, Sam and Max make a return.As far as quests go, though, I do have to say that I was disappointed, as I was waiting for a quest to venture to a castle in the swamp, if for no other reason to hear Cleese mention how he'd had some experience in his younger days dealing with swamp castles; how one good piece of advice is to know when to fight and when a more subtle approach is appropriate. I was also waiting for a quest where I'd be forced to fight against a killer man-eating rabbit. Maybe they'll be in future quests bundled as downloadable content. Given that Cleese did lend his voice to the game, I couldn't think of a more appropriate name for my dog than Sir Barksalot. That's copyrighted. You can't use that unless you pay me a minimum of 1000 gold per day that you use the name. Unless you happen to be a very beautiful bikini super model who has a Swedish accent and a winter home in the Caribbean. Then I'll only make you pay 500 gold. (Women only, please. Must see proof of supermodel status to qualify for 50% waiver.)In any case, Fable fans and newcomers should be aware that this is still not the unicorn of gaming in general nor of the Fable franchise itself, but is certainly not bargain bin material either.My review reflects my particular opinion on the game and should not be presumed to be representative of your own experience, be it positive or negative. You agree to not hold myself, Amazon.com, its subsidiaries, Lionhead, your mom and everyone else liable for your own playthrough and any distress it may cause you, even if one of the above mentioned parties comes to your door and smashes up your game system with a swarm of killer chickens, just because we thought it might be funny to do so.No chickens were harmed in the making of this review. Some have been eaten, however. Although, they were already dead before they were eaten, so really, they weren't harmed either. Well, not by me, anyway.The events in this review are based solely upon a fictional game but the non-fictional experience of playing in it. Any similarity to your own experience of playing this game is purely coincidental, unless my invention to control other peoples' minds has at last worked. In which case, please be aware that that invention is ALSO copyrighted, and you simply cannot have that. Even if you are a hot Swedish bikini model. Although you'll make for a great test subject.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2010"}

Yes they could have done the ending better then what they did but the game is still GOOD! Regardless what people wrote, voted, or who to blame this game is worth the time. The ending you can find in other reviews, what made that person upset about the whole package you can find some where else, blaming Bioware and EA for whatever reasons you can find them in other reviews. Me? I'm going to give it straight:1. They fixed where you scan for resources on planets (this is a plus)2. The game runs smoother. (less crashes then ME2)3. There is a weapons upgrade. (ME2 or ME1 didn't have this)4. More suits of armor (all free and not DLC)5. Great sound6. Great story7. A blast to playWhat has people bent out of shape is the ending and other things I think didn't really take away from the game at all. Again not the best and its by far not the worse either compared to other games on the market. Hell I'll go one even further to say that if you played Mass Effect at all you need to play this one. I don't get paid to write reveiws. But I can understand why some gamers feel the way that they do. I really did like ME3 cause there was a story here and characters that you will care about. Bottomline is don't let the bad comments or low score keep you from playing a game that really did take a chance on a story. Again the end is not the best but its not the worse ending to a great story.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2012"}
{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Gearhead Mania","summary":"Much more simplified than Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 1 - still fun and riveting story","reviewText":"They've provided an expanded ending as free DLC, but aside from the controversial conclusion I felt that ME3 is fun and continues the same style of gameplay as ME1 and ME2. ME1 required an excessive amount of micromanagement in almost every aspect. Some people enjoy that kind of detail, I don't find it very fun in the long run but ME1 had a decent soundtrack. ME2 simplified much of the processes, and many people complained. ME3 took that simplification a bit further with limited areas of exploration in the Citadel, and many mini-quests that require using different computer terminals (which weren't explained very well). Anything and everything that is important shows up on your HUD as you walk close to it, so it eliminates the pointless clicking/searching in many other RPG-action games like Oblivion.The third-person shooting interface is about the same as ME2. After about 2-3 years between playing ME2 and ME3, it took me about 30 minutes to get accustomed to ME3. The Kinect Sensor worked perfectly for me, even with my Jersey accent. I found myself using &#34;Grenade&#34; quite often because I mapped the two RB and LB buttons for biotic powers, I also use voice commands for switching weapons from time to time.The FemShep voice acting is still the best, and I imported my character from ME2 (Xbox 360). Unfortunately, I wasn't able to import my ME1 character into ME2 because I bought ME1 for the PC about 5 years ago.The weapons bench and armor locker are still there, and I always find enjoyment in tweaking the weapons loadouts and their individual mods (2 slots per weapon type). Carrying too many weapons slows down Shepard's power recharging, but I find the Sniper RIfle and Shotgun to be cumbersome and slow with limited capacity anyhow. I find the Assault Rifle and Sub-Machinegun to be my &#34;Go To&#34; weapons for the Soldier and Sentinel (the soldier that has biotic powers and can use all weapons).Overall: 5/5 stars, great voice acting, riveting story line especially if you've played the first 2 games, great sound effects, visuals are top-notch, and I just loved the costumes/weapons/tech/gear.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2013"}

Boy, am I glad I did.As many reviewers have mentioned, this game takes what was great about the first game and ramps it up.  But even more importantly, it made some changes in what got in the way of the last game.  F'rinstance, I was a little weary of the beige desert by the time I finished the first one.  In this game, you get variety in the scenery.  Not a *ton* more (this ain't Skyrim, of course), but enough to break up the monotony.I also appreciate being able to run over things to pick them up.  That's a small touch that makes a big difference.GUNS GUNS GUNS!  Yeah!  Lots of variations with different results, and very satisfying to use.There's a surprising amount of variety in the missions, considering the bottom line is shooting stuff.Load times aren't as annoying because the missions (and they can be pretty long) take place (for the most part) in one or two areas.That being said, I like that even though an objective may seem really far away on your map, it doesn't take forever to get there, even if you're just running.  And yay for the unlimited sprinting!There are a couple of times where you'll be stuck without knowing how to get to where you're going.  There's nothing more I hate than spending 30-60 minutes wandering around looking for an entrance.  Fortunately, those episodes are few and far between.The humor is great.  It's nice to see a shoot-em-up that can truly be funny.All in all, if you liked the first game even a smidgen, you'll find a lot to like here.

Fire upSoul Calibur, and instantly you'll appreciate that the graphics and gameplay are even better than in the arcade version. AndSonic Adventure, with its light-speed gameplay, is sure to wow even the most jaded gamer.It's amazing that such a small machine (it's about the size of your mouse pad) can deliver such incredible performance. Chalk it up to superior engineering. Dreamcast's only downside is that it comes with only one controller and a demo disc. In order to truly take advantage of Dreamcast's capabilities, we recommend outfitting the controller with a Jump Pack and a Visual Memory Unit. Getting one or more extra controllers is also a good idea, because some of the best Dreamcast games support up to four players at once.Why it's so cool:Ultramodern components:Custom-made video, audio, and processor technology blows away the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation and puts Dreamcast in the same league as PS2 and XBox.Integrated modem:In another video-game first, Dreamcast comes with a 56K modem. Use your regular Internet service provider and the separately sold keyboard to access e-mail, shopping, and the World Wide Web. Not only can you upload high scores, participate in chat discussions, and download updates and enhancements for your games, but, through a membership to the SegaNet Internet service provider, you can playQuake III Arena,NFL 2K1, and other games against Dreamcast owners over the Internet.The Visual Memory Unit (VMU):More than just a memory card, the VMU is a miniature portable game system that fits inside a controller--so its LCD screen is easily seen by you but hidden from your opponent.All-in-one entertainment:It plays games. It plays audio CDs. It connects to the Internet and lets you browse the Web or e-mail friends. Our note to the cost-conscious: If you have a Dreamcast system, you just don't need a separate CD player or a separate computer. Dreamcast does it all, and does it well.--Mike Fehlauer","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Great arcade and fighting appeal, plus internet play!","reviewText":"The Dreamcast is the next generation of gaming machine from Sega, most well known for its Sonic the Hedgehog games. With Dreamcast, Sega moves beyond Sonic into a heavily graphic and net-savvy arcade machine.Probably the biggest difference between the Dreamcast and its competitors is the built in 56k modem. This allows Dreamcast owners to log on to the net, surf the web, and fight other opponents head to head. This opens up a HUGE opportunity for finding playmates that until now was restricted to computer gamers. The web surfing ability only sweetens the deal, although like WebTV, there is no ability to download.It's not for free - ... - but for a household that is currently not on the Internet, the price gets both the web access and unlimited gameplay. You also need to buy a keyboard if you wish to do any web work.Like the Sony Playstation, the Dreamcast will play audio CDs. Unlike the Playstation 2, it will not play DVDs, however. Also, while the Playstation 2 can play all Playstation games (since both are CD based) the Sega Dreamcast cannot play older Sega games.Popular Sega games tend to be arcade or fighting games - Rayman 2, Street Fighter Alpha 3. The incredibly high polygon draw rate (three million polygons per second) means that these games fly, giving great gameplay.Even though this is equipped with a 12x CD player, it's still slower than a cartridge system like the N64. On the up-side, CDs are cheaper than cartridges, and can hold a lot more information on them, leading to more involved games.I'm personally not a huge Dreamcast fan - the types of games available on it aren't ones that tend to appeal to me - but my arcade and fighting loving friends enjoy it a great deal.Specifications: CPU: 128-bit RISC Clock Speed: 200 MHz  Sound: CD quality, 64 voices Connector: standard 3-plug video/audio connector 1600 x 1200 resolution","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2000"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"Alex \"47\"","summary":"Game of the Year","reviewText":"It's here. It's finally here. After what I thought was a disappointment in Bungie's final Halo game, Halo: Reach, 343 Industries has taken the helm for a new trilogy. Halo 4 takes place after Halo 3, which was released over 5 years ago now. How is this game different?As far as multiplayer (That will be the highlight of my review, sorry for the campaign fans), 343 has implemented a lot of things from Call of Duty. Don't let that scare you though if that idea doesn't sound good to you -- it works flawlessly in Halo 4. While the perks seem to run the multiplayer in Call of Duty, what truly should be the difference -- the gun -- is what truly matters in Halo 4. Unlike Call of Duty, there doesn't seem to be any overpowered \"perk\" in this game. Some of the guns seem to be excessively powerful, but they all have downfalls. Whether that downfall is a small clip or something else, 343 makes sure nothing in the game is gamebreaking, which is impressive. Something that should also be noted is that everybody in multiplayer now has the ability to sprint for a limited time, which makes the gameplay faster paced and more frantic. That inclusion, unsurprisingly, only makes this game better.The maps in the multiplayer mostly range from good to fantastic, with not even one map that I would say I truly dislike. The maps here have a vast variety from small to large in size, and snowy to grassy. My personal favorite has to be Exile, which is a fairly big map that makes for hectic Capture the Flag matches, and it just looks and plays phenomenally.If you enjoyed Firefight from Reach, I'm sorry to say it's not returning. Instead though, 343 has included Spartan Ops. In this free mode, content will be released weekly with several episodes for you and your friends to play in. While the missions are fairly entertaining, I'm not quite sure what the purpose of them is, mainly because they seem to end before you even start going.As for the campaign, I won't spoil a thing, but I will tell you that this is probably the best campaign yet in the series. The voice acting is better than ever, the humans' facial reactions are spot on, and there are -- thankfully -- very few parts in it that aren't fun. I can also tell you that this is one of the hardest campaigns I've played in a shooter... at least on its highest difficulty setting, Legendary.I tried to keep this review relatively short. There is a lot to say about this game and its contents, but I wouldn't be able to do the game justice. Rather than have you waste 20 minutes reading this review, I'd rather give you that time to go out and get the game if you haven't already.Halo 4 won't exactly change the genre, but it has taken the essences of Halo 3 and the good portions of Halo: Reach (Did I mention there's no Armor Lock in this game?), and made one of the best online gaming experiences for this generation. It could well be the closest thing you'll find to Xbox LIVE multiplayer gaming nirvana.5/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2012"}

Skylanders Spyro&#x2019;s adventure involves real life toys, which players will have to place on the Portal of Power to bring them into the game. The three toy characters that come in the starter pack are: Spyro, Gill Grunt and Trigger Happy. We have some information and some short clips where players can see all three characters in action.","reviewerName":"Wisdom Twin","summary":"Addictive collecting... Pokemon/Yu Gi Oh-like on your screen!","reviewText":"I remember strolling through Best Buy with my husband and coming across Skylanders and the character display in October.  A young gentleman working there saw us staring at the display and went on to tell us that it is an awesome game that he felt would become a big hit for the holidays.  We politely listened as he described how each character has different strengths and 'elemental powers.  Fast forward a bit and my 5 year old starts to tell us how he wants Skylanders and that's all she wrote before my husband became addicted to tracking them down.In short, Skylanders has a portal where up to two characters at a time are placed upon.  The small 3 inch characters once placed on the portal will make a magical entrance on your television screen.  The children love watching the characters come to life as if they are getting ready for the title bout.  Every character has different strengths and are part of a different elemental power.  Different elements open up certain points throughout the boards and game.  Without certain elemental characters then you cannot move forward many times.  That is where the frustration sets in and the addictive collecting begins.  The problem with that is that mostly all of the characters are no longer available.  Scammers bought them out and limited characters like Target only released Whirlwind can be found on EBay or Amazon side sellers for two hundred dollars.  Originally the characters sell for a penny under eight dollars.  WOWZERS!!We received the PS3 version and also own the XBOX 360 version.  Activision thought ahead and made it that the characters are interchangeable between the XBOX, PS3, PC and Wii.  The one thing that makes the 360 version lose a point over the PS3 and Wii version is the fact that the portal is USB wired opposed to the wireless USB that takes batteries that the other two have.  The PC version is also USB wired.  Not a deal breaker but at times it is nice to not always be physically connected.  Game play is the same on the two comparable platforms.The characters store all the of the attributes that you slowly build onto them.  When they are first purchased they come loaded with basic minimum powers that are unique to them.  As you play and shop your character becomes stronger.  A wonderful thing is that you are able to take the characters with you and play on your friends console even if they do not own the character.  There is a chip in each one that remembers all of the strengths that you have developed thus far.  Durability doesn't seem to be an issue if they aren't thrown around!For parents:  Buying any console version will be an expense.  With the game and portal come 3 characters.  I believe that you are able to finish the game but you will not have access to all of areas or collect everything.  That is where the collecting begins and the financial investment.  There are currently two 'adventure packs available that will open up two seperate worlds and extend the game.  The packs come with a character and two powers that are priced at a penny less than twenty dollars.  It becomes expensive and now with scarce limited availibility very frustrating to child and parent.Highly recommend if you had jumped on it while there were characters available.  If you choose to buy now, please understand that you will most likely find one or two more characters to add to the three that come pre-packaged.  If your child doesn't understand that then stay away!  Great clean family fun that every age will love.  Wish there were more female characters though.  Also wish that the company would release more characters for those that weren't able to buy the first time around and release the remaining characters that were never available.  We have 20 characters and have finished the game in co-op mode.  Now the battles have to be played alone with each characters.  Awesome replayability and long term investment until the next craze.  Our ages are 34, 31, 9, 8 and 5.There are 32 characters total with only two females.

Blazkowicz, is back inReturn to Castle Wolfenstein. Set  during World War II,Return to Castle Wolfensteinfinds the Nazis  dabbling in the black arts in an effort to create an army of supersoldiers.  Naturally, Blazkowicz is the only thing standing in the Nazis' way, so he's set  behind enemy lines in an effort to end the madness.On the surface, the single-player game seems like pure gold--after all, everyone  loves killing Nazis. But the story jumps all over the place, the enemy AI is  less than impressive, and most gamers will be able to finish the game in a mere  10 to 15 hours. The single-player game falls short of the standards set by  titles such asHalf-LifeandNo One Lives Forever.In fact, the best thing aboutReturn to Castle Wolfensteinis its  team-based multiplayer mode. Each multiplayer adventure features Axis vs. Allies, and  both sides offer four character classes: engineer (removes obstacles), medic  (heals and revives teammates), lieutenant (calls in air strikes and replenishes  ammo), and soldier (only class able to use sniper rifles, flamethrowers, and  other unusual weapons). The game includes only eight multiplayer maps, but they  are all perfectly designed, and in order to be successful teams have to work  together. The result is a great gaming experience that fans ofCounter-Strikeor the Day of Defeat mode forHalf-Lifewill really  appreciate.Graphically,Return to Castle Wolfensteinlooks amazing. It uses the  powerfulQuake IIIengine to great effect, and the character models,  explosions, and lighting effects are all perfectly done.

Another thing that I like in Wolfenstein a little more than Medal of Honor is that Wolfenstein has plenty of blood and the dead bodies don't disappear as soon as they die. I know that this isn't really a big deal but I think that it adds a bit to the game. On top of all of these bonuses for the single player game, the multiplayer version is also very cool! Running on the Quake III engine, the online game is absolutely great and will keep you coming back for more and more.I highly recommend this game to anyone who appreciates first person shooters. This is a great game and should become a classic in the years to come. Personally, I can't wait for an expansion game or a sequal to come out. Buy the game!!!

Using anything and everything at his disposal, including hand-to-hand weapons, objects in the environment, and powerful elemental magic, Conan takes the fight to his enemies across the massive continent of Hyborea.","reviewerName":"Andariel Halo \"Disillusioned Smark\"","summary":"Always in moderation: Indulge and you'll be overwhelmed","reviewText":"With gameplay like God of War, Conan is a great, gritty, down-to-earth realistic low-fantasy, firmly within a universe like that of Conan the Cimmerian.Rather fantastical elements are added in which only serve to make the story lamer than it could be, such as talk of ancient magic and wizards and demons, and an emphasis on \"Conan the Destroyer\" type magic, rather than firmly hard R-rated action.But there IS plenty of R-rated action; blood is profuse in spilling (not crazy anime-style, but it gushes properly, leaves large permanent stains, etc), and body parts can be hacked off.  Topless women are available to be saved, but other than watching them jig a bit in skimpy panties, you can't do anything with them.The action as of yet has somehow managed to keep from growing stale, as you learn too many new moves too quickly in the game, but there seem to be more things to learn as you progress.  Enemies begin to get too easy to kill, while some enemies are ridiculously difficult not due to any skill on their part, but simply a seemingly impenetrable shirt of armor, and an ability to break your sword parry almost every time they use a strong attack.  Some of the bosses (including a morbidly obese creature on an island carrying a big stick covered in nails) are simply invincible, and can only be killed by utilizing the landscape, or monotonously waiting for them to miss you (quite easily) and then slicing at them with weak speed moves for half an hour.The gore gets excessive to a point where the squeamish will be vomiting, and the non-squeamish, if unaffected, will be dissatisfied with the \"300\"-style gratuitousness of it, because rather than 2 hours of nonstop violence, this can go on for endless hours depending how long you play.And in the end, enjoyment and lasting value comes with moderation.  I've found in my experience that playing an hour or two every day or so makes this game more valuable than flooding an entire day with the game.  Because the gore becomes cartoonishly gratuitous, and much, if not all, of the levels are the same labyrinthine maze requiring lots of simple puzzle work and ridiculously high \"God of War\"-style jumping.Decent game in moderation, destined for irrelevance if indulged, a decent start for a Conan launch in console games, but not the best they could have done.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8LY","description":"As stranded, miniature spaceperson Olimar, you must find the missing 30  parts your spaceship needs to get you back home. The parts are scattered across  a forested area crowded with giant (when compared to our hero's size) animals  and other hazards. Our hero stumbles across a race of part-animal, part-plant,  all-bizarre creatures he names Pikmin. Olimar has to learn how to lead the  Pikmin around the forest as he uses the abilities of the different-colored  Pikmin to overcome the many obstacles in his path.Learning when and how to make the best use of your Pikmins' skills and traits is  the essence of the game. You can control up to 100 Pikmin at a time while  figuring out which Pikmin are best suited for a particular task. Some are better  fighters, while others can survive in water or handle explosive bomb rocks.  However, even the best Pikmin herder will have to sacrifice a few of the  plant-headed beasts for the greater good. It's the making of new strategies to  minimize losses that makesPikminchallenging and fun.For a first-generation GameCube title, the graphics, sound, and music are  fantastic and show an awesome amount of detail. Though it's noPok&eacute;mon, this game should appeal to wide-eyed younger gamers as  well as seasoned vets. The controls are intuitive and feel perfect for the  standard GameCube controller. However, learning to position the camera can be a  tad frustrating during some of the more tense moments, as it has only a few  magnification levels and needs constant adjustment.The biggest obstacle Olimar faces is time. He has only 30 days (each day is  about 15 minutes in real time) in which to find the necessary parts. While this  keeps the pace of the game up, some may find such limits somewhat frustrating,  as it means there will be a lot of repetition and rethinking of strategy. It  also means that diligent gamers may findPikmina rather short game.At the end of your gaming day,Pikminis one of the best games on the  GameCube.--Mark BrooksPros:Very innovative and originalGorgeous graphicsGreat sound and musicAmazing blend of action and strategyCons:Time limit causes players to repeat tasksExperienced strategy gamers may findPikminends too quicklyDifficult to control camera during tense moments","reviewerName":"Sixto Limiac","summary":"Miyamoto has scuplted the GameCube's first classic","reviewText":"What happens when gaming guru, Shigeru  Miyamoto, is oppressed with the role as the integral man for masterminding the next Zelda and Metriod titles?  From the production of Pikmin, it seems as if he seizes a deep, consoling breath and rips open a bag full of relaxation.  Ah, finally all that dreadful anxiety and flagrant expectations from gaming fans everywhere wash away.  His sheer brilliance veers into a jaunty, animated dream world.  Conclusively, he creates a bizarre game where players are ferried  onto a planet where replicas of giant onions come alive and spawn multicolored, cutesy creatures called Pikmin.  Perhaps Miyamoto's latest game is a minor escape from the daunting task of transcending the GameCube into unreachable stratum?  Whatever the case, Pikmin is not what would we ordinarily expect as a first-class launch title, but it doesn't even fall short to deliver one addictive gem.The player assumes the responsibility of Captain Orima who looks like a freshly baked character from Cartoon Network.  With a big, round nose, a mini space outfit, and a fish bowl for a helmet, it's hard not to think about pummeling the daylights outta' the adorable twerp.  Orima's story is basically a cakewalk.  The captain opts to go on vacation through space, in the duration of his flight, he has a sensible meal of onions when a sudden meteor slams onto his rocket.  Surviving the plunge onto an alien planet, Orima's ship has disintegrated into fragments spread across the land.  He must now retrieve the primary ship parts with the aid of the affable and obedient Pikmin before his spacesuit loses function.Playing in Real Time, Pikmin, at the core, is a strategy game.  At the start, the player sets off with a single, trusty Pikmin and is required to feed a three-legged onion with pellets or butchered insects.  After a certain amount of nourishment, the onions plant seeds that'll eventually sprout as Pikmin.  The essential objective to the game is to manage the carrot-shaped Pikmin and lead them on an expedition throughout the planet to recover Captain Orima's missing ship parts.  There are three fundamental breeds of Pikmin, the red ones red are unscathed by fire, the blue ones wade over water, and the yellow ones cart one another and catapult themselves as organic grenades.  Micromanaging elements are also supplemented for good measure.  Bridges are to be constructed for faster mobilization, walls should be demolished for augmented exploration, and strategy preparation must be done to maintain  the life of the Pikmin.  Frequently, goliath-sized vermin like maggots intrude on the Pikmins` progression.  With a whistle command, Captain Orima can order his army to quit their current task, huddle together and unite for a defensive onset.  Also, the Pikmin may proceed in the offensive, attacking a monster when its simply dozing off.  The maximum number of Pikmin a player can shepherd is a grand total of 100 with absolutely no slowdown whatsoever.  Moreover, the game has a time limit.  Working as a clock, the l6 circles atop the screen move from left to right, and once the furthest one is filled, the day draws to a close.  At the end of each day, the Pikmin must rest overnight and an analysis of the player's personal army is evaluated.  Not particularly lengthy, the addicting game can be whizzed within a jiffy of hours.  Crammed with bonus and high score modes, the game retains a good, extended platter of replayability.  What Miyamoto has done is sculpt the GameCube's first true classic.The GameCube's controller, feeling a bit tweaky at first, succeeds to superbly make a first-rate control scheme.  Captain Orima can be directed individually or accompanied with personal escorts.  The analog stick guides Captain Orima, the A button yanks Pikmin from the soil, the B joins Pikmin together, the X is used to distinguish Pikmin groups into separate colors, and the Y button looms the game information and map.  Additionally, the game's camera can be modified in any direction the player fancies, whether it be overhead, side, or the front.The second Pikmin invades the television screen, the player will irrefutably remark on how the graphics are gorgeously crafted or converged with intoxicating vivacity.  From what I have gathered from the many opinions of other gamers, players will either breath in revulsion or approval.  Technology-wise, the rich world of Pikmin is matchless.  With the control of the camera, the player can zoom in and out, screening through the huge landscapes.  Even the tiniest of details will stimulate the players imagination, like the vast region of mountains and shrubbery.  If not enchanting, the game's surroundings adequately present an overall smooth, graphical touch.  From the lighting, various shadowing, and sheer multitude of animation on the creatures, Pikmin is what I imagine as a tingly trip to la-la land.  Ironically, I felt a bit queasy after a few hours on this colorful madness.  While marveling and vacuuming your life on Pikmin, the players will notice how well the music suits this type of genre.  Indolent, tranquil sounds engulf the environment and is deliberately welcomed.  There are the congenial tunes of a pristine day materializing, and the placid kind which hails approaching slumber.  When an antagonistic intruder stumbles upon the Pikmins' camp, the music is swapped into a more rapid, upbeat tempo.  The musical score  proves to be finely executed.  The eccentric yet delightful sounds from the Pikmin, the battle cries, and other noises add deeply to this already remarkable game.Pikmin's basic gist is to genuinely refresh audiences with  entertaining amusement along with hours of nonstop gameplay.  Throughout the game I found myself beaming at the antics of Captain Orima and how ridiculously hilarious the Pikmin behave.  Initially when a tremendous, next-generation home console is released, a monster of a game convoys along, and although,  Nintendo honcho, Shigeru Miyamoto should have unleashed godhood, a Zelda or Star Fox game, Pikmin does not disappoint and is well worth the ownership for the novel, bold GameCube.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2001"}

Le","summary":"Deus Ex 3: Viva La Revolucion","reviewText":"Although I do not quite agree with PC Gamer Magazine staff when they ranked the original Deus Ex # 1 in their \"Top 100 PC Games of All Time\" list, I hold a very high regard for DX1 as my previous review can attest.  Therefore, like many other DX1 fan, I was really disappointed with DX2  -- Because although it is not a bad  game, I deemed it unworthy of  the DX name.From this perspective, I was apprehensive about Deus Ex: Human Revolution not being able to follow the footsteps of its predecessor without tripping.  However, after completing the game, I am happy to report that Eidos Montreal's DX3 certainly met my expectation of what a DX game should be.Indeed, with few exceptions, DX3 is a worthy successor of the original DX.  All of the crucial elements that I loved from the original are present here: Multiple quest completion paths, adequate RPG elements, and a deep-rooted conspiracy story in an immersive and noir-ish cyberpunk atmosphere.First of, in almost every situation, there are always more than one way to complete an objective.  In general, you can choose between the stealthy approach or the direct confrontation path (although unless you are adept at FPS, the latter won't work out too well for you in the early in the game due to your low constitution), or a combination of both.  It should be noted here that, besides being more fun IMO, the game also rewards you rather generously for exploration so a predominantly stealthy approach is usually what I preferred even when I have good weapons. Lastly, I could not help but to smile/smirk at how the game encourages stealth by encouraging you to go soft on crime and to go easy on your inner violence nature by giving you more XP - much more - for non lethal encounters.Also, the cover system in DX3, although far from perfect, is one of the best I've seen yet and is worth mentioning.  The 1st person view changes to 3rd person view when using cover -- Besides having a better tactical view, being able to easily shoot over and around your cover position, and being able to quickly jumping and rolling from cover to cover is a plus.  You also have the ability to hug the cover perpendicularly from wall to wall while moving slowly without breaking cover, which makes a big difference in stealth gameplay.  This is something that was lacking in some other games like Mass Effect 2.  However, like many other games, there is still problem engaging a target if the object you are using for cover is facing the enemies at an angle.Concerning the RPG elements, I personally do not consider DX1 a bona-fide RPG.  Rather, along with System Shock 2  - another great game BTW -  it is one of first games to achieve a perfect hybrid between the FPS and RPG genres (nowadays known as RPS - Role Playing Shooter).  In this regard, DX3 also follows DX1 very closely; however, it is not as well done.  For example, DX1 players will notice that there is not as many augmentation upgrades this time around.  What's even more alarming is that there are only 4 augmentations that you can activate manually - but they are good ones.  I do not think this is shoddy work on the part of Eidos Montreal.  Rather, I think this is a result of the lowest common denominator when you have a multiplatform game - as there are not enough buttons on the gamepad to match the number of the F1 to F12 keys.Another personal complaint is that there are no melee weapons this time around whatsoever.  Perhaps I can eliminate the baton or combat knife from my arsenal, but by all means, give me back my Dragon Tooth Sword so I can feel like a cyborg Jedi once again.In spite of these shortcomings, please do not think that DX3 is poor console port as it is a PC game in many ways and much more so than many other games.  For examples, mouse control is smooth and precise; keyboard can be re-mapped; and for my pet peeves, when you hit `M', the map comes up; likewise, hit `I' and the inventory comes up.  In addition, the big compensation is that the AI in DX3 is vastly improved compared to DX1.  Enemies no longer runs back and forth aimlessly when the alarm goes off; although still lacking consistency, they move in concert and more cautiously in a much better effort to flush you out.As for the story involving conspiracy theories, DX1 already hogged up most of the good ones IMO.  As is, the challenge for Eidos Montreal is to somehow come up with something rooted in the DX universe but without rehashing the old it - And I think DX3 succeeded in doing so. Even though DX1 Veterans will instantly recognize old names such as Morgan Everett, Joseph Manderley, or Bob Page, they will stay in the background.  In short, without giving the story away, Eidos Montral developed a well written conspiracy theory story largely of their own that is relevant to the present day- along with the proper Deus Ex-type of multiple endings to this particular chapter.Lastly, although I am getting a little tired of games trying to be movies, for those who place emphasis on the movie experience, graphics and cut scenes are fairly well done.  Voice acting is very well done.In conclusion, DX3 gets 4 stars with a 1-star deduction for mandatory account tie-in/online activation DRM.  Nonetheless, I recommend DX3 to the DX1 Veterans and newcomers alike.  To the newcomers, this is one of the examples of what a good game should be.  To the DX1 old-timers, although DX3 is not as good, it clearly pays the proper homage and tribute to the original source and is worthy of the Deus Ex name.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2012"}

You'll become entwined in political struggles, battle a doomsday cult, and slay hordes of monsters throughout the realm on your quest.Character Building:  10/10When you create a character, you pick pre-arranged parts and assemble your character Frankenstein-Style.  You choose a torso, arms, legs, head, hair, facial features, and can add details like wrinkles, makeup, and scars.  All of the body parts have slider bars associated with them, so you can make a character fatter, thinner, more muscular, less muscular, wrinkled, and move the facial features around the face.  You can color their skin, hair, right eye, left eye, and facial hair. You can create any type of character you can imagine: heroic warrior with a sword and shield, beautiful sorceress, giant fat bearded Viking warrior, elf ranger, old bearded mage, tiny warrior girl with a massive hammer, old fat woman with a dagger... Anything.  You also chose their voices.Pawns:  9/10As the Arisen, you get one Primary Pawn that will stay with you for the entire adventure.  This is your most loyal servant.  The same character customization tools used when you create your character are available for your Primary Pawn and you also choose their Character Class:  Fighter, Mage, or Archer.  Throughout the adventure, you can equip them, and manage their upgrades.  At a certain point in the story, you can have two more pawns join you, creating a party of four.  These are either NPC's or other Players' Primary Pawns.  You can't change their equipment or even level them up.  So, if you recruit a Level 17 Warrior, they stay a Level 17 Warrior no matter how long they are with you.  At any point, you can release them and substitute another pawn into your party.  When you release them, you can rate their performance and send them off with a gift for their Arisen.  Other Players are free to hire your Primary Pawn as well.  Whenever you use an INN, a copy of your Primary Pawn goes into the rift / internet, and other Players can use a copy of your Pawn in their adventures.  When they are finished with your Pawn and you rest at an INN, you gain gifts from other players, a rating, and Rift Crystals.  Rift Crystals are a currency used to hire pawns that are a higher level than you.  Pawns at your current level or lower are free.  More Rift Crystals are required, depending on the disparity between your Level and your Hired Pawn's Level.Skill Building:  10/10Because this is an RPG, you gain XP for killing enemies and completing quests.  When you level up, you get more Hit Points and Stamina Points.  Hit Points = the amount of damage you take before you die.  Stamina Points = you use these when you use a special ability like when fighters taunt, archers fire multiple arrows, or mages cast a spell.  As you battle enemies, you also accrue Discipline Points, which are used to unlock Special Moves or Magic Spells.  So, an Archer can fire 3 arrows at a time... then upgrade to 5 arrows.  A mage can heal, cast auras of protection, enchant weapons, or unleash powerful magic attacks.  Discipline Points are also used to unlock special attribute boosts:  Mages do more magic damage, fighters have more Hit Points, Archers are more accurate, etc...Once you purchase any of these Skills, you can assign them to your Character and Primary Pawn with a simple menu interface.  A Mage can have 3 Primary Spells, and 3 Secondary Spells.  A fighter can have 3 Shield Moves and 3 Sword Attacks.  A Ranger can have 3 Dagger Attacks and 3 Bow Attacks.  Characters also have slots for their skill boosts as well.  The beauty of this game is that these can be swapped at any time.  So, you won't have to worry about wasting upgrades on things you'll never use again.  No RPG buyer's remorse here!You can ONLY upgrade your Character and your Primary Pawn.  You'll have to round out your party by carefully selecting 2 other pawns from other Players.  This is also great.  If your party isn't affective in a certain region, just go back to town and change out two of the members.  For example:  If you have 2 warriors and 2 fighters and you're fighting flying enemies, you're going to have a bad day.  If you added a mage and a ranger to your group, you'll be able to blast them out of the sky with ease.  Allowing Players to instantly change the makeup of their party is a great idea.You can also change the character class of your Character and Main Pawn, but you will have to level up that class to become more effective with it.  If you want to switch from Fighter to Mage, you can, but it's going to be a while before you can use powerful spells.Exploration:  9/10The gameplay is composed of exploration, minion combat, and boss combat.  The exploration is not as rewarding as Skyrim, but there are an awful lot of hidden chests in the world.  The chests and enemies also respawn after two days in the game.  You can farm certain areas if you want, but it is not necessary.  There's also a ton of crafting in the game, so the items you find can be used to create curatives and tools, as well as upgrading armor and weapons.Combat:  9/10This isn't a simple stat / die roll game.  The gameplay has more in common an action game than a traditional RPG.  Fighters can block incoming attacks, Archers can dash or roll to evade.  Mages... well, they can heal.  Fighters and Archers can evade and time their counterattacks, Rangers and Mages have to aim their missile shots.  The battles can get pretty hectic, too.This game features a ton of conditions during battle.  If you fall in water, you are drenched.  This causes your lantern to go out if you're in the dark, and you take more damage from electric attacks or ice attacks.  You can be poisoned, weakened, blinded, enflamed, frozen, petrified, oiled, cursed, silenced, etc...  Unfortunately, you'll need to carry cheap curatives for specific uses, so a towel will cure your 'drenched' condition.  There are also Cure Alls that are more expensive that cure everything.  Through most of the game, you'll be carrying a virtual medicine cabinet on your back: eye drops, throat drops, absorbent rags, clean towel, etc...  It's almost comical.  But this is a very dangerous world and you need to be prepared.Keep in mind that these conditions work both ways.  If you see an enemy that is weak to fire, a ranger can shoot it with oil arrows or a fighter can throw a flask of oil at the creature.  Once oiled, any fire attack will cause the creature to burst into flames.  Vials of water work the same way if the creature is weak to ice or thunder attacks.When you fight a group of minions, your pawns attack.  You have very simple commands like HELP, GO, Come Back.  So, at times, it is frustrating when you're fighting a Phantom that can only be harmed by magic attacks and your mage waits a minute before attacking.  Most of the time, the game works great, especially if you have good and experienced pawns.  When a flock of harpies swoop down on you, a mage will shout, \"They are weak to fire!\"  And suddenly your bow erupts with flame.  Each shot causes the harpies' wings to catch fire, grounding them.  Your fighters immediately pounce on them and finish them off.If you feel that your pawn is too timid or bold, you can change their statistics at any time in an INN.  Just seat them in a special chair and tell them what you want.  It's like being a counselor or boss.  Pawns that you hire also have experience ratings on all of the quests, locations, and different monsters.  So, if you are having trouble with Chimeras, you can hire Chimera Specialist Pawns and they'll attack it efficiently.Just about every enemy has special attacks and weaknesses, too.  If you know an enemy's weakness, the battle is much, much, easier!  If you're fighting them at night, and your lantern runs out of oil... well... it's better to run.Boss Battles:  10/10Throughout the game, you face dragons, chimeras, giants, ogres, etc...  and all of these creatures have strengths and weaknesses.  The boss battles are epic and remind me of the great Shadow of the Colossus!  You can climb on bosses and attack their weak points, you can break off parts of their armor or disable limbs, you can figure out their weakness to a special kind of damage type and exploit that.  The boss battles are tactical and epic!!!World:  9/10The world is a medieval fantasy world overrun by monsters... and in the deep places of the world, the monsters are truly frightening.  If you find yourself outside the city gates at night, be prepared to run for your life!  The world is populated with ancient ruins, beaches, forests, and caverns.  Just about every place in the world is beautiful or enchanting by day, and scary at night!Graphics:  8.5/10The graphics look a bit gamey instead of realistic, but it's fine.  The environments are beautiful, the enemies are scary, and the characters look great!Sound:  9/10The music definitely sets the mood.  If you want heroic, eerie, enchanting, suspenseful... it's all here.  The voice acting is pretty good as well.Maturity: TeenThis game is full of fantasy violence.  If you're OK with cutting a snake in half or lighting a harpy's wings on fire, you should be OK with this.  When you create your character they appear in their underwear, which is less revealing than the average bathing suit.  There is animated blood though, and that usually gives games an M rating.  As far as M Rated games go, this one is tame.Value:  10/10The game will take about 40-80 hours to complete and the more you put into it, the more you'll enjoy it.  There is a New Game + mode, where you can play again with the skills and items you earned from the first play through.  There's also a Speedrun Mode.  The difficulty rating can be changed at any time between Easy, Normal, and Hard.  There is quite a bit of game here for around $20!Overall:  9.5/10This is a great adventure!  It has actual gameplay, where success in battle is based on tactics and your ability to aim, block, and dodge.  Enemies are agile and try evade your attacks as well, and bosses are really powerful.  It's epic, scary, rewarding, and fun!It's only around $20 now and well worth the price if you like RPG's!Buy it if you like RPG's with actual combat.Buy it if you like hard games with tactics.Buy it if you like epic boss battles.Rent it if you have at least 40 hours to rush through it.Avoid it if you like RPG's where stats are more important than actually hitting your enemy.Avoid it if you love witty banter between characters like in the Bioware games.  The Pawns are just Pawns and they serve YOU.  They have no personalities of their own.If you liked this game:Check out Skyrim if you want great exploration!Check out The Witcher 2 if you want something more adult oriented.Check out Dark Souls if you want a CHALLENGE!!!Check out Dragon Age Origins if you want a somewhat dated party based RPG set in a dark universe.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2013"}

You're immediately put onto a track and given a simple, but fun tutorial on the basics of the game.I thought this was a great touch because you're given a taste of the game before you even see the main menu.  After that, the voice-over guy continues to help you as you race and as you upgrade your ATV.  All of the voice-overs are context sensitive and are actually very helpful for someone new to the game.  This feature might be a huge bonus for someone who's looking to buy this game for a child who might not be patient enough to read manuals or wade through menus.  I don't find the voice-overs annoying at all, but you do have the option of turning down the narrator volume in the game options.When you start racing, the first thing you notice is how pretty this game really is.  The graphics are vibrant and detailed with a touch special effects like HDR and motion blur.  In addition to the solid frame rate and great sense of speed, Pure looks really, really polished.The controls are simple and easy enough to pick up.  Along with the narrator giving you tips, you also have on screen indicators of which buttons to press to try out new things.  Paired with the solid controls, you also get a great camera system that seems to always swivel to an angle that gives you a good view of what's coming up.When you win races, you automatically unlock parts that you can use to upgrade or customize your ATV.  The customization options are almost overwhelming, especially if you're someone who doesn't really know anything about ATVs to begin with.  As you're cycling through all the parts that you can change or customize, the voice-over guy gives a quick explanation of what the part does and how it will affect your performance.You can tune difference performance aspects like acceleration, top speed, handling, tricks, etc. by picking from different parts for your vehicle.  I haven't managed to unlock everything yet, but the upgrade options seem plentiful and unlocking them by winning races is very rewarding.After tuning your ATV, you can also customize how it looks by changing the various body panel pieces, the handle bars, the seat, etc.  You pick from a pretty big variety of options and even change the color on some pieces.Normally, I'm not a big fan of stunt racing kind of games, but Pure is definitely the exception.  It's a fast paced, arcade-style game that just about anyone can pick up and play.  The streamlined help and tutorial system makes it so that anyone (even kids) can immediately start racing and customizing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2008"}

As expected out of all the Zelda games so far this has to be both the most epic and gameplay and features(Not that any of the other Zelda games are any less so).  Until we get the next Zelda for the Wii U we have this game to keep us more then entertained until then.  A little off topic I see many people myself included sometimes going on the new games coming out for the PS3 or the Xbox 360 but in all honesty how many of those characters from those games will be as iconic and as popular as the two most known names in the gaming world. Mario and Zelda still going strong after more then twenty years in the gaming industry and if that doesn't show the gaming world how Nintendo is still one of the great gaming kings I don't know what does.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2012"}

{"product_name":"B002I0K3CK","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Mario Leaps into HD","reviewText":"It's been an incredibly long time since Nintendo actually launched one of their home consoles with a Mario game.  And yes, this was pretty much a big draw for me.  In part because I've enjoyed the New Super Mario Bros. series a great deal.  They've rekindled a nostalgic love for the side scrolling Mario adventures.  While also providing some creative levels (at least in the Wii version).  There are more creative endeavors and even a lot to keep you coming back for a while.  It's a big game, and that's actually saying a lot for a New Super Mario Bros. Game.  It's just a shame that it's going to be all too familiar to anyone who played the previous three games.If you've played just about any Mario game in the past thirty years then you know what to expect.  Bowser is up to no good again and has once more kidnapped the Princess.  His methods have gotten slightly better, at least.  Instead of kidnapping the princess and running he finally does what he never thought to do before, actually just toss Mario aside.  And that's pretty much it.  Mario has never been a game one has played for story.  It's always been about the gameplay, and thankfully New Super Mario Bros. U makes some nice improvements, in part because it's a lot more heavily inspired by Super Mario World and Super Mario Bros. 3.  Meaning you can expect some creative levels, exploration and challenge.The gameplay is going to be familiar to anyone.  You begin each level and have to run and jump your way to the end in the same manner that you've always done.  The new power up, however, is an acorn that turns Mario into a flying squirrel.  While this seems genuinely cool, it's not nearly as awesome as the first time you dawned the Tanooki suit.  You don't \"fly\" with this power up, however, you glide and can give yourself a boost.  Aside from that there aren't really any new power ups.  Everything else that's here you've no-doubt seen before in one of the previous three New Super Mario Bros. games.Nevertheless, the game is at least fun.  In part because it's just got some really creative level designs.  They start off simple enough but they actually grow in difficulty.  One of the things about New Super Mario Bros. is that the games have never really provided that much of a challenge.  This includes New Super Mario Bros. Wii, where the difficulty was--I'm sorry to say--overstated.  Here there actually are some genuinely challenging moments.  In part because of level design is actually quite good.  That's not to say the game is entirely challenging.  Like the previous games, New Super Mario Bros. U is a little generous with giving you tons and tons of extra lives.  No matter how many times you fail for every life you lose you'll probably gain two or three in a short amount of time.  You'll never have to worry about seeing the game over screen.The game also supports multiplayer.  Up to five people can play.  Four can control Mario, Luigi and two of the Toad characters while the fifth uses the tablet to provide blocks for the other players to jump on.  While this is well and good the same problems with multiplayer still plague New Super Mario Bros.  While it's fun to play with friends, four players all running and jumping can still cause some problems for those wanting to actually get through the game.  It's easy to leave players behind, screw up another player's jumps by accident.  This has always been something that you can get around because there has always been this ability for other players to \"bubble\" themselves and let someone else go through all the work.  Nevertheless, I still maintain that it is much better to experience New Super Mario Bros. solo than it is to do with another person.  Likewise, the \"fifth\" player being able to plant blocks is a novel idea but it just feels tacked on as a way to show that you can do this stuff rather than for any sort of necessary purpose.  It makes a lot of the platforming easy for the people who are playing, but you never really get the feeling you \"need\" it at any point.Graphically, New Super Mario Bros. U... strangely doesn't look that much different from the original Wii version of the game.  While the art style is still good looking in many respects, it's strange that New Super Mario Bros. U is only a baby step above the original New Super Mario Bros. Wii.  And while it still looks good aesthetically, it definitely doesn't show off what the Wii U can do.  Likewise, the audio is pretty nice but by now it's getting kind of tiring to see New Super Mario Bros. use the same music over and over and over again, with some tunes slightly remixed.  While many games in the Mario series have remixed tunes they have, at least, provided a ton of new tunes.  Here a lot of it is just recycled.  And yes, the enemies still sometimes dance to the music.It's really the only shortcoming the New Super Mario Bros. U.  It just introduces so little to this particular brand of Mario.  When Mario jumped into third dimension on the N64 for instance, each game that came out after felt very different from the last, despite following the same formula.  They really had ways of making each experience feel fresh and new.  The New Super Mario Bros. games haven't quite reached that pinnacle yet, and it's starting to get worrisome now on its fourth outing.  The game is still a blast to play because there is so much to do.  However it is a little hard not to wonder why Nintendo didn't opt to reach higher when they clearly had the resources to do so this time around.  You will still have a lot of fun because so many of the levels are so well designed, and there is quite a bit here to keep you busy.  But considering the previous three games, there's a certain, \"by the book,\" feel to New Super Mario Bros. U.  On the other hand... it's probably the best New Super Mario Bros. game to come out thus far.  The levels are great and there are a lot of secrets, including the new challenge mode that will test any player's skill.  It's a much more complete package.Overall, if you plan on getting a Wii U, this is a game that you probably should add to your library immediately.  It's a lot of fun, despite that it's only mere baby steps ahead of previous games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2012"}
{"product_name":"B007XVTR3K","description":"","summary":"Call of Duty Black Ops 2 game review","reviewText":"Another year, another Call of Duty. This franchise has come to define the mega-blockbuster in the video game market over the past decade ever since 2007's Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare and its 2009 sequel Modern Warfare 2. There have been two primary studios working on these games since 2002: Infinity Ward and Treyarch. Ironically, the quality in the Infinity Ward titles, the original creator of the franchise, has definitely dropped in quality and originality. On the other hand, Treyarch, who had previously been making crappy entries for the series, has surpassed IW and proved they can make quality Call of Duty games with World at War and Black Ops. These two studios working back to back, has made it possible for Call of Duty to be an annual series. Yes, there has been a major Call of Duty game every single year since 2005. I think this is part of the reason that a lot of people have grown tired of the series. CoD has gotten a lot of bad rap over the past couple years in the gaming world because, well, it's still here! And the reason it is still here is because of the multiplayer. CoD 4's multiplayer and MW 2's multiplayer is what has made Call of Duty the mega-blockbuster franchise it is today. Not the stories or anything like that. As a result, the market has become flooded with FPS games that rip off CoD because other game studios want their own mega-blockbuster franchise that makes billions of dollars. Much like Hollywood, instead of coming up with something original, they just copy whatever the most successful thing is.This is one reason I have come to dislike the Call of Duty series. Now everyone has their own reasons why they like it or not. Mine is what I just talked about and the lack luster stories for the campaign. The Modern Warfare stories were mostly cut and paste, tried too hard to shock you plot points, and almost no character development. Plus everyone kept dying. I know its war and people die but it becomes less and less shocking every time your character dies during a scripted event. Much more care was been given to the multiplayer aspects over the single player until Blacks Ops in 2010.  The story was the best thing about that game and actually had some good plot twists and character development. Not the greatest, but it was something nice to see in a Call of Duty game. Last year Modern Warfare 3 came out and it sucked. A lot. Knowing what I know about Treyarch and having played Black Ops, I had more faith in this title than with MW3 but wasn't expecting much. What we got though was a lot better than I expected. Black Ops 2 is the way to do a Call of Duty sequel. It does so many things this franchise should have been doing 3 years ago and finally makes it happen and I've been ranting long enough, it's time to get to the review.STORY: The story takes place half in the year 2025 and half in flash backs during the 1980's. You primarily play as Alex Mason (during the 80's) with the CIA and as his son David Mason (in 2025) as a Navy SEAL under JSOC. The story mostly deals with the rise of the game's villain Raul Menedez, a Nicaraguan terrorist and the leader of a mysterious group with worldwide influence called `Cordis Die.' The missions set in the 80's are told in flashback by Frank Woods (from the previous game) and primarily deals with how Menedez became the mad man he is in the future and his connection to the main characters. There are even parts of the game where you actually play as Menedez for a little bit to try and feel more of a connection to him. The missions set in the future, you are trying to figure out what, how, and when Menedez is going to do to unleash a massive global attack on the world using drones which characterizes the military of the future. The plot kind of reminds me of the plot to Metal Gear Solid 4 but less complicated.  The future setting for Call of Duty was inevitable and thankfully they don't go too far into the future. Most of the weapons and technology used in the game is actually based on current prototypes and ideas and it's really cool to get to use some of this stuff. Now it sounds pretty straight forward like any Call of Duty game but there is one big thing that changes all of that: branching storylines and outcomes. Yes, this CoD has multiple endings and choices that actually matter. There are 5 different endings based on choices you make throughout the campaign. For a game series like this, this is a huge deal and adds a lot of replay value to the campaign. Your decisions affect the character's fates and development as well and there is quite a bit of character development in the main characters and the villain. There are also some really good twists thrown in throughout the campaign. The story is a lot better than I thought it would be and puts Infinity Ward's Modern Warfare series to shame. Thankfully, the Russians are not the main enemy you encounter like in every post-WWII CoD game. You do fight them in a couple missions but given the context of those individual missions, it makes sense.  Instead, most of the time you are fighting against PMC and Central American forces but that changes based on the set piece and this game takes place all over the world. From flooded streets of Pakistan, a night club on some super ship in the Cayman Islands, Afghanistan, Panama, and it's most shown set piece, Los Angeles, the game makes good use of the set pieces to make some memorable levels and of course they are all over the top like a Michael Bay movie with things exploding all over the place and are very fast paced.The game's story and levels are paced a lot better than in previous games. Not everyone will agree but most of the Call of Duty games would climax too soon and the rest of the game would just be like hitting a wall for me and just become uninteresting. Like in MW2, the missions after the battle in Washington D.C. were just boring and rather pointless to me and it just feels like a drop off point. The drop off point for me in MW3 was after the Paris missions and that was in the middle of the game. Yeah, I really didn't like Modern Warfare 3. Black Ops 2 increasingly builds to its climax at the right times and since there are technically two stories going on here, it does this more than once.  It keeps you interested till the end and the branching story paths help that out a lot. Like the first Black Ops, they also have the likenesses of real people in it such as Jonas Savimbi, an Angolan warlord, Panamanian former leader Manuel Noriega, and David Petraeus. I laughed when I saw he was in this. Black Ops 2 has bad timing. The game is still pretty short however, taking about 6 to 7 hours which is sadly average for these kinds of game. There are 4 optional missions called Strike Missions that function very differently from the story missions but do have an overall effect on the story so you probably shouldn't skip them. I'll explain them more in the game play.GAMEPLAY: If you've played these games before, there is nothing new to the basic game controls and they are as smooth as ever. Controlling vehicles which is rare but when you have to do it, it's not so bad except for when you have to fly an F-22 late in the game. At first, its easy enough till you have to actually fly it at high speeds, and then you are fighting the plane to not crash into building or fly out of the combat zone and cause the mission to fail. This part was done like the Hind flying segment in Black Ops 1 but not done as well or as fun. You also get to control various drones throughout the game like the CLAW which is kind of like an Imperial walker that is about the size of a small car and has a mini gun and grenade launchers on it. You can also fly and command quad rotors which look like those little helicopter hobby toys but have machine guns on them. You get to control most of these during the Strike Force missions. Now these missions are very different from the story missions. They feel more like something from Ghost Recon than Call of Duty. You control infantry, drones, turrets, and a command satellite. You get a full view of the level from the satellite and command your forces to protect or destroy objective points. You can also switch between and play as any of the forces on the ground. This can be tricky as it forces you to multitask and is a definite break away from the traditional CoD game play. Like I said before, these missions are optional but do impact the story so you really should do them and they do get tricky. Sadly, these strike missions are a huge missed opportunity because they are single player only. These would have made for an awesome multiplayer co-op game mode. These types of missions would have lots of fun if they could have tweaked it for more than one person. The AI in these missions and the game in general is no improvement at all from previous games. While it doesn't bother things much in the regular missions, you will definitely feel the aging AI system in the strike force missions, especially on higher difficulties.Another new addition to the single player missions is that you get to fully customize your weapon load outs before a mission which is very welcomed. Not only that, the weapon selection screen now has stats for each gun and how the attachments will affect them. There are some awesome new attachments in this game like x-ray optics, an optic that marks enemies for you and laser sights in addition to the classic red dot and ACOG that we are all used to from these games. I like that the ACOGs have a red dot sight on top that you easily switch to be clicking the left joystick. This was an actual suggestion for an optic and control mechanic I submitted for Modern Warfare 2 three years ago. I'm glad someone took this idea. Way to drop the ball, Infinity Ward. Also select fire acts as a feature which hasn't been seen since the very first Call of Duty on PC back in 2002. You also get some new melee weapons like machetes and stun knuckles that make people throw up. Gross.  The futuristic weapons and attachments are generally fun to use and easy to control. The high degree of customizability just pushes it over the top.Of course there are the other two game modes: zombies and the multiplayer. The zombie mode is designed to be like its own independent game this time instead of a mini-game. I really think Treyarch should just make a complete zombie game at this point, separate from Call of Duty. That said the single player mode for it has been scaled down a lot. I discovered I can only play one map by myself; I would have to have other people for the other two maps. Also there is a story for it but I have no idea what it is as it is not explained. I'm in a 50's style bus station as a guy that says annoying things and there is a bus that you ride in that has a robot bus driver who also says annoying things. What? The zombie mode does have difficulty settings now for the more casual zombie killers as the zombie mode in the past CoD games were rather hard. Finally, we have the multiplayer and sadly, I find it to be the weakest part of the game though there are a couple new things that I like. You can play offline now with bots so no pesky humans to ruin your game. Just kidding. It's just nice to have a more casual multiplayer experience without having to deal with all the bull on xbox live. However, multiplayer is the BIG selling point of this game and the reason this franchise has been so successful. Well, other than new weapons and equipment, there isn't really anything new here at all. More of the same. The kill streaks are handled a little differently I noticed. You gain them based on points instead of kills this time around and you can stack them up and switch between which one's you want to use. This does little to change to over all game play though. It's just more of the same. I'm sure the really hardcore fans could point out small differences for better or worse but the average player probably won't notice.  The single player, to me, is the strongest and best part of Black Ops 2.GRAPHICS: This game looks great for the most part. The future levels look the best with all the fancy computer screens and other sites of the not too distance future. The 1980's settings are a little less impressive to look at. There is more texture pop-in during these missions and everything just looks drab and dull but once again, the settings during these missions are meant to look drab and dull. Hm. The character models of the main characters look great. They use that really neat facial scan animation that I like that really add emotion to the characters. The characters without this however, look pretty bad. Very stiff and stale but you are most likely shooting them so what do you care? This is generally a good looking game and I didn't really notice any graphic glitches or anything major but this game is nowhere near as good looking as Halo 4.SOUND: This game is loud and full of guns and explosions just as you would expect. Thankfully, everything is much easier to hear than in MW3 which had some major audio issues. All the sounds of war sound great. The voice acting is a bit of a different story. It's really hit and miss. It's pretty over the top at some points with some, at times, unnecessary swearing. You can tell it's a Treyarch CoD game with all the hard swearing peppered throughout the script. There are some fairly big Hollywood actors in this game too but their performances are kind of all over the place. They really need to tone it down but I think it's the best they could do with the script they had to work with. The music is generally fitting. You have lots of electric, fast paced music in the future missions with some dub step here and there. The 80's missions tend to have music fitting for whatever country it is set in. The soundtrack is much better than the one from MW3 but not anything I'd rush out to download. Speaking of music.. This kind of a spoiler but after you beat the game you are treated to a game rendered concert of Avenged Seven Fold. Why? Because they can, I guess.Overall, there are a lot of improvements that this series has needed for a long time but is it too late? While I did really like this game, I'm not begging for another CoD game. However, I'm pretty sure there will be a Black Ops 3. For pure curiosity, I probably would play it but this franchise is nearly milked bone dry. I really worry about what Infinity Ward is going to do next. If there is a Modern Warfare 4, no way am I going to even bother with it. Black Ops 2 is a good game if you like to play these games for the single player and want to play through the story to see all the different outcomes and play with all the customizable weapons. If you play CoD just for the multiplayer, you'll probably be disappointed to a degree. I know most fans already have it. If you don't like CoD or shooters are all, this won't change your mind. If you're on the fence about it, I highly recommend renting it and you can judge for yourself. I really liked this game much to my surprise but if the things I talked about don't interest you at all, then this game probably isn't for you. Regardless, if you like Call of Duty or not, these changes are a great addition to the series and a step in the right direction. I'm just giving credit where credit is due and this turned out to be a long review. Thank you for reading!OVERALL: 8/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2012"}

Take control of two  heroes, Jonathan Morris, a vampire killer and his close friend Charlotte Orlean, a girl with tremendous magical ability. Amidst the chaos of World War II,  two mysterious sisters emerge, and design a plan to resurrect Dracula. Join Jonathan and Charlotte as they attempt to thwart the terrible plan to resurrect  Dracula.Fight vicious bosses as you play the character of Jonathan and  Charlotte.Choose which character you want to control on the fly.Explore the depths of the castle.Seek out the evil  Brauner.Game StorylineInCastlevania: Portrait of Ruin, players take on the role of Jonathan Morris and  Charlotte Orlean. During World War II, many lost souls from the global conflict were left to wander the world in search of salvation. Desperate to escape  their terrible plight, they sought to resurrect Dracula's Castle from the rubble of society, assisted by two mysterious vampire sisters. Now Jonathan and  Charlotte must work together to confront the two vampire sisters, and ensure that this villainous catastrophe is not unleashed on the world.GameplayEvolving the action-adventure gameplay that has been the series' trademark for 20 years,Castlevania: Portrait of Ruinlets players switch  freely between Jonathan and Charlotte as they proceed on their heroic mission, each with their own strengths, abilities and style of play. Players can now  utilize powerful combination attacks in which both characters unleash the full extent of their combat abilities to decimate the game's more than 100  different enemies and bosses. In their quest to stop Dracula's resurrection, Jonathan and Charlotte can collect and use different weapons, equipment, and  items to increase their overall skill level and acquire new abilities.As mentioned before, players can switch freely between both characters, a  necessary option to win the game. For instance, you need to analyze certain situations and carefully choose to play either Jonathan or Charlotte in order to  successfully battle against the vampire army. The two characters can also combine their powers to pull-off powerful combo attacks. Their combined abilities  are needed in certain parts of the castle in order to progress through the game.The game has two different endings.

And perhaps best of all, when another player buys the item, the  selling player gains the money but doesn't lose the item.","reviewerName":"T. Sparks","summary":"A for effort . . .","reviewText":"The Castlevania series has undergone its fair share of criticism; i.e., the Metroid-style structure has been done to death, and there simply aren't enough innovations to distinguish the games from each other.  The 3D games have been particularly aligned, with poor level structure being the widest complaint.Portrait of Ruin was Konami's answer to those complaints.  While the design of the game has been restructured, the overall execution is somewhat lacking.For example, the game's protagonists, Jonathan Morris and Charlotte Aulin, must use paintings, much in the style of Super Mario 64, to enter new worlds.  Here's where part of the problem lies--there are only five distinct levels (Dracula's Castle, a city overrun with monsters, a dark forest, Egypt, and a twisted circus sideshow.)  You can find restructured  and more difficult versions of these levels later on in the game, but the overall lack of diversity is disappointing.  Instead of offering different versions of the same levels, Konami could have delved into Castlevania's 20-year history to deliver us mountain ranges, or sleepy villages, or haunted docks, or sunken ruins . . . the list goes on, and its rather aggravating to find such a lack of effort in this title.However, the dual-hero system works well for the game.  Sadly, there aren't very many puzzles in which you must rely on your partner--yes, there is a segment in which the two characters ride motorcycles and the player must shift between the two to clear the course--but events like these are few and far between.  Most often, the only reason you'll switch to Charlotte is to turn into a frog or an owl, or to cast a specific spell.  You'll spend the other 90% of the time as Jonathan.The difficulty is also somewhat skewed.  Most enemies can be ripped through quickly and easily, but boss battles can be intensely difficult, with bosses often using attacks that can drain as much as 200 hit points.  Attention to patterns and a plentiful supply of potions are necessary to win the day, and while its refreshing to have boss battles reminiscent of the old-school 8-bit Castlevanias, players who entered the series with Symphony of the Night are in for a rude awakening.However, the story is top-notch, and follows roughly thirty years after the events of Castlevania: Bloodlines for the Sega Genesis.  The characters are well-written, and the player will become genuinely intrigued by their stories and their pasts.Sounds, as usual, are one of the highlights for the game.  The voice-acting is present, but generally minimal, and the melodies and sound effects continue to be haunting.Enemy design is also one of the game's highest points.  The sprites are well-animated, and, in many portions of the game, comical.  For example, the Persephone enemy shuffles back and forth with a vacuum cleaner; if Jonathan gets too close, he'll be sucked backwards and get his bottom lodged in the end of the appliance.  Charlotte, conversely, will be momentarily inconvenienced as she struggles to prevent her skirt from being blown up.  One boss enemy can also seduce Jonathan with one of her attacks, causing him to attack Charlotte.In conclusion, Portrait of Ruin is a game that belongs in every Castlevania fan's library.  It's just not particularly memorable.Story: ALevel Design: CMusic: ASound Effects: AEnemy design: ACharacter design: ADifficulty: BOverall: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2006"}

I mainly wanted to point out a few pros and cons about this game.  It might seem I'm nitpicking, but I must state that it is a very enjoyable game, and a worthy addition to the 3DS library.My negative points?  Well, for starters, the game has a level type system.  What this means is that you only access each part of the mansion in each 'level'.  Subsequent levels do have access to broader parts of the mansion, though with slightly different bad guys and puzzles.  But I felt the game would have been a bit more solid with a more traditional adventure approach.  Granted, having the 'levels' means you can challenge yourself to get higher scores each time you replay the level, but then again, a 100% completion style challenge would have been acceptable.Second, controls are a bit wonky.  Luigi moves rather slowly, even when running, so it's a bit of a chore sometimes to get to places.  Hand in hand with the control is the button assignments.  They are a bit confusing, and several buttons have multiple functions, so you often find yourself just tapping one button for one thing and then having it reassign due to some other influence, such as the location of a place to 'check'.  Minor, but occasionally annoying.Pros?  Well the challenge is very good.  The game starts you on training wheels and then about halfway through you really notice the difficulty is higher.  You will probably see game over a few times.  Puzzles aren't too tricky, but they can be a bit challenging at times.  Often there is some little object which is overlooked, a crack in the wall or a rug or curtain hiding a key item.There isn't much story, but there is a bit of comedic interaction between Luigi, the ghosts and the Doctor.  My only beef with the story is that Luigi comes off as kind of a wuss.  But it's still funny.So in my opinion, it's a very good game, though with limited replay.  The graphics are impressive for the system.  I didn't use the 3D very much, but it was very good the few times I had it active.  Bottom line?  There are better games for 3DS and games I think 3DS owners should consider first.

Armed with his trusty Poltergust 5000&#x2014;a ghost-catching vacuum cleaner&#x2014;and all the courage of a wet napkin, the green-hatted hero needs your help to battle through five massive mansions full of hidden passages and bone-chilling challenges.  Whether you&#x2019;re charging up the new strobe light to stun a slime-tossing Gobber ghost, revealing illusions with the new Dark Light Device, or reeling in multiple poltergeists with timely button presses, you&#x2019;ll need to use all of your paranormal survival skills.","reviewerName":"Thomas Riccardi","summary":"A scary adventure with Luigi!","reviewText":"When my nephew got a gamecube for Christmas one of the first games he got was Luigi's Mansion. If you're not familiar with the game it focuses on our green plumber friend going around a haunted mansion as he tries to suck up ghosts with a vacuum. Now years later Nintendo is releasing Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon for the 3ds but is this one mansion that you're going to want to enter?The game starts with Luigi in Evershade Valley where a dark moon hangs high in the sky. But when the Dark Moon shatters it turns all the ghosts in the area very violent. It is up to Luigi to restore order as he goes off ghost hunting with his trusty Poltergust 5000. Unlike the original game where you had to just flash ghosts to stun them you now have a strobe light which you have to charge up to stun ghosts. If you do not charge up the light all the way you might not stun the ghosts and waste precious moments until they are upon you. Once you have the ghost stunned you can reel them in with your vacuum but instead of relying on another analog stick you can use button presses or the accelerometer / gyroscope to catch the ghosts.While there is a great singleplayer mode to this game there is also multiplayer modes that can be accessed via a local lan, wifi or download play. Up to four players can battle through a variety of four modes throughout various floors (can be set to as few as 5 or can go on forever). Each floor can have a variety of different modes that will provide the players with various challenges. You can set which modes you want or you can set it on Surprise (which shuffles the game modes randomly throughout the Scare Scraper.) Escape is just what it sounds like as you and your friends have to make it to the exit in the shortest time possible (but you can find time pieces throughout the level to give you more time). Hunter is just that as you try to clear out the floor of all the ghosts within the time limit. Polterpup is the last of the modes as you try to track down and catch all of these ghost dogs. At the top of the Scare Scraper is a ghost boss which you must defeat and if you do you win and it displays who won the game.With an in depth single player and fun multiplayer options this is one of the games that you need to get if you own a 3DS.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}

It also appears that I'm the only reviewer at this point who has completed Project Gotham 2.For newbies and PG1 players, progressing through the game has been made considerably easier than the first game and you can easily teach yourself the ropes of each track and car class by playing for a bronze medal. Also you can jump into the super cars even if you haven't \"unlocked\" them in the single player game yet by visiting your garage.If you're familiar with the series, or have read the other reviews, you know that Microsoft has taken everything that was great in PG1 and upped the ante. For newbies, you'll find Project Gotham 2 is the most intense street racing game ever created. The game begins as a solid \"race for place\" competition against computer opponents, and adds variety events like cone solemn racing, vehicle overtake and photo radar gun top speed contests. In each event, you can select the award level you want to try for, which establishes the difficulty and the specific objectives. Aside from the career mode (which PG2 calls the \"Kudos World Series\") there are also three arcade modes, two time attack modes and numerous online challenges.Aside from the mere thrill of racing against human opponents, the online component has a few innovative features that set PG2 apart from any other racing game ever made. With online scoreboards you can see how you compare on each single player race you complete against everyone else in the world. Your rank, for each and every level is shown, along with the other gamers around you and the number 1 player. In addition, you can download \"ghosts\" which show you how the other people got their scores. And special trials are offered in the \"ghost challenges\" arena, where you can download the best performances from players around the world and try to beat them.Technically, this game is perfect. The load times are extraordinarily fast and the game instantly returns you to the starting line if you restart the level (where many games would require lengthy reload time). There's also a seamless line between online and single player game play.There are 10+ things about this game which are absolutely amazing:1. Online features and functionality (see above)2. Graphics. (This game looks best on a 480i HDTV)3. Music. (And I'm a tough critic, but I really enjoy the songs on this game)4. Vast number of tracks, well designed and well detailed.5. Vast number of game modes6. The environment has detailed elements, like leaves blowing across the track or birds flying in the foreground. Animations (like a ferris wheel) are in the background to provide even more graphic realism.7. Your vehicle sustains incredible damage as you drive and while the performance is not affected, knocking out your headlights on a dark level makes it tough to drive!8. Spectacular lighting effects!9. Replayability10. Achievable unlockable vehicles and accomplishable tasks11. VERY cool secret unlockable cars!There are 3 things that could have used improvement:1. Often, the competitors will fall into two packs. If you get behind the second pack, they will intentionally slow you down or crash into you so that it is almost impossible to reach the front pack.2. Some of the levels are so tight (one/two lane tracks) that playing the same level at easier difficulty is a negligible advantage.3. In the final car circuit, (called the \"Ultimate Series\") the tracks are considerably longer and require an extended number of laps for no apparent reason other than to delay game completion.There are 3 things about this game which are absolutely ridiculous:1. Apparently the AI drivers all have PhDs in automotive physics because they know EXACTLY where to hit your car to send it into a spin. And they will do this to you more often then not.2. When YOU hit a wall it's a reverse/back-up/steer out/gas procedure, but when an AI competitor hits the wall (or, OK, I run them into a wall), they somehow miraculously recover and are instantly behind you.3. AI cars will often \"take the line\" while driving, meaning that they plow into you if you're already in the optimal apex.All-in-all, this game suffers many of the flaws that all racing video games have, and while this game isn't absolutely perfect, it is -by far- the best racing game available on any platform.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00009TW6R","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play.

Halo is not the greatest FPS ever people! Sure, some of the gameplay is great but their are a lot of flaws in this game. here's some:1. For cheaters (like myself), there is NO Console cheats. for those who don't know what this is, you have a menu come down from the screen and it tells what you have reached in the game, but you can type in words that are cheats, like for instance \"GOD\" as in god mode. I was really mad at this because.....2. this game is tough. there aren't a lot of med packs and recharging your shield sure likes to take it's sweet time.3. You only can carry 2 weapons! I understand that this game is trying to be realistic in a real world sense (you can't expect to carry a shotgun, a handgun, hand grenades, a bazooka, a rifle and so forth with you as that would carry a lot of weight around), but this is a game and in games you can be as unrealistic or realistic as you can be, but there's even a limit of both, which is why Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell sucked balls, because it was way too realistic for a spy game and in Metal gear you can be seen and fight back but in that game you can't.4. Driving. Driving sequences are tough and very pointless. I always fall over cliffs or whatever and die.So overall, this game may have some great things to it but it's not really worth spending 20 or higher dollars on.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2006"}

You'll still find yourself slamming into barriers if you try and take corners too quickly, but you can still take them quicker than you can in Forza 2, where the individual car physics are real-life.I would have liked more car customization, as being able to solely pick from solid car colors is a bit drab.The number of cars you can purchase is incredible, with even more that can be purchased from the XBLM.With PGR4 coming out soon, you should be able to find this title on the cheap (I bought mine used for $15.)

You simply plug it into any USB port in your house, and the USB port sends power to charge it up! Yes, this can be your XBox, if you're the type to leave it on. Maybe you're watching a movie or listening to music with it. It doesn't HAVE to be your XBox, though. You can plug it into your computer.

It works just as well for this charging use.So I find this to be a perfect solution. If your wireless controller is low on batteries and you want to keep playing, then keep playing! You plug in the cable and are set, and the controller recharges while you play. If your wireless controller is low on batteries and you do NOT want to keep playing, then you plug the play-and-charge cable into any USB port for an ON SYSTEM and it powers up.I put the emphasis on the \"on system\" because a few people complain that the XBox has to be on in order for the wireless controller to charge. Simply put, an OFF system can't charge. That's a fact of electronics. Really, most homes should have some USB device turned on pretty much 24 hours a day - whether it's your XBox, your computer, or the plug-in-the-wall iPod type power unit. It's about as basic a charger as you could want to have, and I find it perfect!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2005"}

I have part 1, 2, and now brotherhood in my collection and this is my opinion of the game and game play.Pros regarding single player mode:-plays like assassins creed 2-new armor-new moves-you get more money from the guards when u loot them (makes it much easier to accumulate money)-leaves off from assassins creed 2-you get to train your own Assassins!!!!! (To me that is the BEST Part in Assassins Creed brotherhood)-also you get a parachute so u don't have to worry about killing yourself now when u accidentally jump from high places (but it doesn't come until later in the game)now.......Cons regarding single player mode:-you get your own assassins to train but u don't really get to customize there gear, or really what they wear.-the story is really short, makes this an expansion pack at best, beat the game within 20 hrs of play-after playing the main story there really isn't much to do after that. I pretty much have all my trophies in single player except for subject 16 and the Borgia flags.-You only get to stay in Rome which makes it really boring!!!! In other assassins creed games you get to go to different places which made the game play considerably long but in this one not soo.. I believe they did this because of the multiplayer aspect in the game which i could have personally did without.-Also you can play as Desmond more but come on.. who really wants to do that???-Now they have shop request in order to unlock things which to me is kinda dumb because I've accumulated so much money and nothing to really spend it on but thieves, mercenaries, and whores...-Oh yeah, subject 16 puzzles are too hard!!! wtf were they thinking when they made them?? It makes doing the puzzles a pain instead of something fun to do. which makes acquiring trophies hard which is pissing me off.... (I'm all for challenges but nothing too challenging.)now......Multiplayer Pros:-First online assassins creed game-different people to choose from-customizable characters even if its just a little bit-you get to disguise yourselfMultiplayer Cons:-servers are always too busy or messed up in someway-takes forever to get into a game-you cant really choose which game you want to be put in. they have 3 different game choices i believe and i cant play wanted, sometimes they throw me in team mode which i don't wanna play-Too glitchy, i can kill someone yet they ended up getting away, one minute my pursuer is away than right behind me stabbing me outta nowhere. characters move to fast or freeze outta nowhere.-Game-play gets too confusing. If i have my target surrounded by other targets like them its too hard to tell the difference. it gets really confusing. my sensor thing gets really confusing as well-Everyone looks like assassins its no fun when everyone looks the same and there isn't any real regular people in it. (I know its meant to confuse but that makes it too confusing)-You cant level up easily since its hard to get into a game therefore making it hard to get trophies!!Personally my main gripe is why did they put trophies for multiplayer?? Seriously reach 50?? Every time i get on, the network is having a problem or its too glitchy, also online is very repetitive so it gets really boring really fast. I know its not call of duty but come on......At any point, in my humble opinion, i would wait until the price drops to at least $30. Although it has some big improvements from Assassins Creed II its not as extensive and it can get really boring really fast. So at best it really is more like an expansion pack with some improvements. I'm just glad i got my $15 cred from amazon or i would be really disappointed.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2010"}

I traded in my PS 2 and bought a X Box.  I enjoy the X Boxs graphics but thats about all.  In terms of games the PS 2 rules and that will be even more true this year.  Look at the facts.  Even though the X box offers online out of the box and a hard drive the PS 2 is still outselling the X Box 3 or 5 to 1.  Thats amazing.

Decent Campaign Maps, Even better Online Maps.+ Sound is Amazing. Probably the best I have heard in a Game.+ It is a game that grows on you. Almost sold it, then I played on.CONS- Way over-hyped for what it is.- Graphics lack detail and definition.- Multiplayer can be a little glitchy at times. Still working out the bugs.The game is good, don't get me wrong. However the graphics are a HUGE let down. While they are atmospheric and the lighting is good, there is very little detail on walls and objects. Looks cartoonish like, pre-Battlefield 2/Modern Warfare 2 graphics. They advertised it as a leap in graphic technology. Well, they took a leap in the wrong direction. There is a constant filter on the game which looks like someone splattered a can so soda all over your TV. This is a huge distraction and makes it difficult to see who is shooting you. I understand they were going for realism, however I don't see dots everywhere.You work in a team and are very rarely alone. There is a story and it does jump around the time line, however due to the very basic AI I seem to have lost interest quite quickly. Characters move well, however skin looks unrealistic an characters reaction seems off. If you're in a squad and someone gets shot, the other team members don't seem to react, as they should, if they react at all. Also there are floating object like sandbags and other items which are scattered around the map. This is very annoying.Battlefield 3 does have a little more to offer than your basic shooter. It is a difficult game at times and you do need to listen to your teammates and work together at times, which I one reason I disliked it so much. It is a war game, however you need to plan your actions and not just spray bullets everywhere. They were going more for the realism of war. In the game you are not just on foot, you are up in a plane, driving a tank, and even skydiving. There is enough to keep you busy and interested, however I just got bored with basic mechanics of the game. I felt like I have done this again and again. Nothing impressed me about this game and I was ultimately disappointed.With the right surround system, Battlefield 3 has some of the best sound I have heard in a game. Over-all Battlefield does give the fans what they want, however it was hyped up too much for how little graphic detail there is. In the end it is a basic shooter which we played 5 years ago. Nothing new. After playing Infamous 2 and Arkham City I am expecting more from games lately.

{"product_name":"B00004SVS3","description":"Mega man 2 nes cartridge","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"The BEST of the Original Series!","reviewText":"Mega Man II is perhaps the best of the original series on the NES.  It may not have a fantastic plot, but those of us who remember the NES days weren't too concerned with plot anyway (remember, you were Mario going to rescue the Princess from the clutches of King Koopa).  Mega Man II introduced a few things to the series that the first one lacked.  The biggest new assest was perhaps the Energy Tank.  While you could only carry four, it was nice that for once I didn't have to go back and forth killing enemies for energy pellets.The gameplay was a step up for this.  Mega Man II also has more balanced difficulty.  It isn't just the energy tanks, it's that you're more likely to survive in cases where you can't.  There are eight robot masters as opposed to six, and the weapons are a little better.  The element of Robot Masters being weak to other Robot Master weapons is still there, and it works out even better here than it did in the first one.  It's a bit more unpredictable.The difficulty may be balanced, but it isn't by any means the hardest of the Mega Man series (the first one is).  It's actually one of the easier ones in the series.  The bulk of the difficulty may come from Quick Man's stage, and even that can be taken care of quite easily.  Taking on the robot masters a second time is also pretty easy when you've got all their weapons to use against them, and they always drop an energy pellet that restores probably more damage than they'll do to you.  In other words, the game is not a challenge.  There are still moments where it's difficult, but for the most part, unlike the first game, it seems more managable than the first game.The music is also a lot better, and so are the graphics.  There are fewer graphical glitches, and the music gets stuck in your head for a long time.  Mega Man II is a huge step above the original Mega Man in all respects.  It plays better, it's not nearly as difficult (even on the difficult setting) and has fantastic music to boot.  This is the Mega Man game that serves as the staple for the series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2006"}

This was my FIRST strategy- based game I ever played and I enjoyed it greatly. It had the perfect blend of story, humor, great characters, voice-overs (Chell's is my favorite lol...just kidding, GLaDOS FTW) refreshing game-play and soundtrack.Some of the puzzles I got very frustrated with but nothing a little gamefaqs can't fix. So don't dislike this game because of the complexity...find other ways to beat it.The atmosphere of the game was really unique as well. Playing this game I get a boat load of feelings. Not many games can do that to me.Another note is Portal series newcomers NEVER FEAR you may play this game first. I did and still understood most of the story.I think this game can be enjoyed by a vast amount of people. From old to young, AI to human, fat to skinny, adopted to non-adopted. (AND YES I'M MAKING REFERENCES) I was an RPG gamer and was looking to broaden my horizon this game did it for me. This game refreshed my gaming senses. So if you prefer racing games, shooters, RPG's..etc.. give this game a whirl.Personally, I can give this game a five out of five for it's unique game-play, comedy, story, dialogue, voice acting, and quality of game.Rent or buy?: RENT.

Ram","summary":"It has issues, but it's still revolutionary...","reviewText":"Most of the other reviews have the major points covered, but I'd like to add my own thoughts about Heavy Rain. While it's a quality game overall (especially due to its replay value), for nearly every positive there are issues that keep it from perfection. I'll try to keep these points brief:GRAPHICS+The first thing you'll notice is how amazing the graphical quality is. It's as close to photo-realistic as I've ever seen, and I've played my share of eye-popping games. In closeups, you can see the pores and individual hairs on people's faces! The main character models are great. The backgrounds and other areas are impressive too, especially when things change around you.-Unfortunately, it doesn't always run perfectly. There is often a second or two where you see the textures load on top of objects. Sometimes when you walk through an area, the screen will tear/jitter/flicker, like there's a frame rate issue. Rarely, you'll notice a crummy looking floor or wall, or a jagged edge on a desk or cylindrical object (like a trash can). In a few areas, you'll walk through massive groups of people, and they'll all have sort of a \"miscellaneous\" look to them, like high-res versions of The Sims or something. Occasionally, the animations will look clunky; certain actions, like splashing water on your face or kissing, still have a ways to go before they can look convincing.AUDIO+I might as well cover this here. The background music is fittingly eerie for most of the investigation, and exciting during the action sequences. It sounds straight out of the movie Se7en (Norman's segments often have music reminiscent of The Matrix scores, making me think the producers had Agent Smith in mind during the ARI virtual reality scenes). I like how you can turn on a radio in some areas and have that replace the standard music. The voice actors were well cast in their roles. Most of the lip-syncing is perfect.-Sometimes the background music changes fairly abruptly. A few times, the characters would speak about a piece of information before it pops up on screen (usually when picking something up on ARI) or stop talking abruptly when you move your character to another place onscreen. I know I'm in the minority when I say this, but I found most of the voice acting (outside of Shelby) to be somewhat bad. There isn't enough emotion when the characters speak or interact, and though most of them are supposed to be American, most of the voice actors are not, which leads to strange pronunciations at times (\"Ennahthing\" instead of \"Anything\").GAMEPLAY+Like many, I was skeptical about playing an \"interactive cutscene\" type of game, but when the sequences are delivered like this, it's easy to become a believer. You get comfortable with the controls over time, though the action/fight sequences are always thrilling (and if you find them too easy or too hard, you can change the difficulty). I liked that you could change camera angles to get a better view on things, and \"read\" a character's thoughts to get their feelings on the situation.-Early on you'll be doing mundane tasks like getting dressed or checking out the contents of a fridge. These diminish in number later on, but there's still an annoyance when looking around. It felt like 9 out of every 10 drawers I opened were empty (the game encourages you to search every nook and cranny, yet most yield nothing), and taking different stances or talking to people in a certain way usually didn't change the plot. The first playthrough takes around 12 hours but the second takes 8-10, as by then you've realized most of the searching is pointless. At times (even at the end of the game) you'll enter the wrong button sequence (such as pressing one instead of tapping it rapidly) because the prompts are covered up, too similar, or otherwise unclear. A few times it was a pain getting my character to stand in the right place - you press R2 + the left stick to walk, and it doesn't always make you go where you want (mainly with Shelby). The SIXAXIS sequences didn't always seem to register, especially when turning the controller over (like a wheel). One more thing most haven't mentioned - you can't run, only walk. This makes a few places really annoying to get through. Plus, a little boy is about to drown and these people are content to stroll around everywhere.THE WOMEN!+/-(This is an aside)...The game's view towards women isn't the greatest. The minor female characters (Ethan's wife, Lauren, etc) are all victims in one way or another, usually looking towards the men to help them. Madison Paige, the sole female lead, has a bit of a tawdry introduction (and some racy scenes later) and alternates between being a \"damsel in distress\" (though she gets herself out of jams) and sort of a caretaker. She's a tough girl and I liked her a lot, but they could have given her a stronger role in the story. You can unlock the game's trailer in the special features, where the three main shots of her feature her a) getting \"sweet talked\" by the hotel manager, b)dancing in a club and c) taking her top off before a shower. How fair is that?PLOT+Others have said that the game starts off slow, and they're right, but it builds up really nicely over the course of the story, and by the end you won't want to stop until it's complete. Even then, there are so many different outcomes (depending on who lives or dies and what major actions they took during the game) that you'll want to play through it several more times. The second time through, you can pick up on all the little tidbits they scattered throughout the game that pointed towards the identity of the killer.-Sometimes the story goes off on tangents for apparently no reason. Norman's segments sometimes felt disconnected to the rest of the game. Plot holes are sometimes apparent, like why characters go into dream sequences (when the ending reveals they shouldn't) or how characters arrive at locations even though they aren't privy to the others' information. Some of the endings have strange segments where you have to fill in the blanks yourself.All of this might lead to the conclusion that I didn't enjoy the game, which isn't the case. It has annoyances here and there, but the overall experience (especially the reveal towards the end, which floored me when I came upon it) was one of the best I've had this console generation.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00D6PTMSW","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Colonna","summary":"Rocksmith And Roll All Nite - And Lessons Every Day","reviewText":"To start, here's who I am and what I hoped to get out of Rocksmith.  I'm a drummer.  I think all drummers are frustrated guitarists and all guitarists would like to play drums.  I've owned guitars, still own a couple, but never found the time, or really, was willing to dedicate the time to lessons.  Rocksmith came to my rescue.  Like many people, I love to play video games, and enjoy things like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, although I always found them to be games, and not realistic, since what you do to \"win\" on screen has little to do with how you'd play an instrument live.Rocksmith is a great game - and so much more than a game.  It comes in three flavors for Xbox:  Just the game, the game with the cable, and the game, cable and a guitar.  I got the version with a cable included and am using my own guitar, so that is what I am reviewing.  If you do need a guitar, the Rocksmith version which includes one presently comes with an Epiphone Les Paul Junior.  It isn't a bad deal if you need a starter guitar.  A Jr. usually sells for about $130, and this game costs $80 withouta guitar, so a combo selling for $190 is a decent deal.  That said, keep in mind typically you aren't going to want to play a gig with a Junior.So what's in the box?* Rocksmith 2014* \" audio-jack cableYou might assume, at first glance, that the game is similar in concept to other Guitar hero/Rock Band type games.  But it goes way beyond that.  Rather than \"just hitting colors\" to emulate playing an instrument, Rocksmith takes you down the path of learning to play guitar.  You may see familiar style screens, a huge fretboard scrolling at you, lyrics, etc. but this is not Guitar Hero.  Don't mistake what I am saying - the mini-games are present and they are a lot of fun - but they are not the primary focus.  I did not play Rocksmith 2013, but by all accounts the 2014 version keeps the \"guitar lessons\" intact while adding much more fun/games.  You choose what instrument you will be learning/playing, lead guitar, rhythm guitar, or bass guitar.You must use a real guitar or bass with this game.  For example, You CANNOT use the plastic guitars that come with Guitar Hero.  The included cable is a standard guitar cable with an Xbox adapter on one side, so you can disconnect that if you wanted to use this as a straight \" guitar cable.Those expecting all game play, different gaming modes, may be disappointed. There are some \"missions\" you will play out, but the goal here is really to learn to play guitar.  You start off with very basic tasks, how to hold the guitar and pick, tuning the guitar.  In the game play, you progress from notes to chords to songs. Of course, if you already know some things, you can skip ahead to what you want to play/try.There are different modes which allow you to change the speed so you can master a technique.  As you progress, Rocksmith adapts to your skill.  Once you've mastered notes and chords, you will achieve a level where they aren't displayed, fading off the screen.  As you make mistakes, they will fade back in to assist you.I know kids today will often be self-taught by using gutar tabs.  While that works, something like Rocksmith is a more realistic way to learn how to play guitar.  Guitar tabs teach you only how to duplicate a song, not to freely play guitar.  On the other hand, Rocksmith helps you progress through the steps of actually learning to play guitar.I found the playing from what is happening on the screen to be a realistic approach.  There are a few different modes:Session Mode: A chance to play freestyle, but stay within the confines of what is on the screen (the right key, etc.).  This is a jam session, so to speak.Virtual Band Mode: Allows you to play and create music, selecting what instruments accompany you, and in what genre, tempo, etc.  This is fun, but not something anyone will probably sit and do for hours on end.Master Mode: more challenging, but also more fun with \"Guitarcade\" minigames.  These are fun to play while improving you bending, sliding and picking skills.  My favorite was Return to Castle Chordead, combining guitar practice with a arcade shooter game.If you must play this like Guitar Hero or Rock Band, you can switch to Score Attack mode, which follows the tried and true formula of different skill levels, and an arrangement for each level.Rocksmith does track your progress, so it will adjust levels to how it assesses your current skill-set.There are a few limitations.  Remember, the focus is learning how to play guitar, but the game takes you in one direction at a time.  So, for example, you cannot switch \"on the fly\" from rhythm guitar to lead guitar.  If you pick one of those, those are the parts you will see and be expected to play.  You have to pause and choose the other guitar role.  Once you do that, you are now in that role (say, lead) and the role you formerly were playing (rhythm, for example) is the one not displayed.  I would have preferred the freedom to jump as you choose.The song library is pretty good.  There is a good mix of music, so the playlist should appear to a rock fan of most ages.  I won't list the whole thing here, but to give you an idea, there are 3 songs from the `60's, 7 songs from the `70's, 6 from the `80's, 13 from the `90's, 7 from the first decade of this century, and 24 from 2010 to now.  So, clearly someone who listens to today's rock artists may have more they recognize than someone who prefers classic rock of the 70's.  The artist range is excellent, from Aerosmith to Kiss to Alice Cooper, The Police to Nirvana, Weezer to System Of A Down, and more current artists, with works from Arctic Monkeys and Alice In Chains.  If you are a lover of classic and mainstream rock bands, you may find there is not enough of that and too much Indie music.Overall, this is an excellent game, and if you want to have fun while becoming a little better at guitar, it is great.  Novices will surely like it, if they are truly interested in learning guitar, but even an accomplished guitarist will have some fun.  The advanced player probably won't gain anything skill-wise, but will have fun with some of the challenges.  I've been using the game for a few weeks.  It has kept me entertained enough to learn a little more about playing guitar, while making the chore of a lesson more fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2013"}

Complete with the look and feel of the time in both monuments and fashion sense, not to mention music that helps me garner many and many a flashback while driving in my vehicular portion of nostalgia down those roads, you are thrust into a Miami Vice theme where, in a previously unprecedented move, rival factions are trying to establish a foothold in the land of milk and money. Sent to help establish an operational foothold for one such group (and voiced by Ray Liota), you - Tommy Vercetti - find yourself double-crossed, robbed, and vengefully motivated as your life is threatened unless you find out who perpetrated such a grievous offense. This quest leads down many a darkly interactive corridor as you find yourself seemingly jumping through hoops while secretly establishing your own monopoly on the city's nefarious empire.Many things have improved in this version of Grand Theft Auto, making the gaming experience all the better. Your arsenal has the increased to wondrous proportions, giving you the option to become selective as to what types of weaponry you want to carry, thereby allowing you to customize the look and feel of mayhem as you single-handedly write multitudes of epitaphs. You also have the ability to shed your garments like a snake sheds its skins, giving you the ability to mockingly crusade about the city in golfing apparel while hefting your chainsaw in the midst of a crowded streets. Added to that is increased interactive ability when it comes to the deliciousness of a violence-doused world, like the lavish ability to target drivers as they roll helpless by inside cars that would have once protected them from your advances or your ability to enter stores and illustrate your woes with their selections through a hail of gunfire. In fact, many more potentials exist here, in a much more interactive city, allowing you to explore and maim in much more interesting manners.There are also the improvements in the realms of vehicles as well, allowing you to use boats that work better, helicopters that control with relative ease, and even planes that can actually fly - unlike the Dodo planes experienced in the last chapter. There are even motorcycles, mopeds, and the like available for those wanting to experience the thrill of stunt-riding and kissing the concrete of an embracive city. On top of that, the cars handle better, turning when you want to turn and allowing you to control them against the onslaught of police officers that come equipped to handle the more aggressive player a little better; filling the skies with helicopters that bring their own swat teams, spike strips to cover the road, and vice cops to thwart your attempts at grandstanding with the press of sub machine-gun fire.Also, there is a drastic improvement in the mission quality and the gist of what you are doing, making you seem less like an errand boy and more like the walking arsenal you are, allowing you to not only acquire money but to also buy various landmarks and safehouses to further your conquest of the city. This comes in handy because your save points can change, you can spawn newer missions that are all about you, and your money actually means something here. Tie all of these elements together and you have the perfect game built upon the back of a time gone but not forgotten.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2003"}

At the time of writing this review you can get these for under $220 And that is a good price. If you're somebody was looking for headphones and your budgets around $150 save up a little more cash and get something like this for only $70 more. Headphones to me are worthy investment like speakers for your computers they'll last a long time and technology doesn't make them outdated for many many years. Case in point have had my computer speakers for 8+ years and I spent $200 on them and they're still great whereas most technology is thrown away after four years.On a side note wireless headphones are just better than cable headphones for the simple fact you can pull your console off the shelf. As someone who's used a fair amount of cable headphones I constantly would forget I had them on my head and almost for my console off the shelf. What are the thing about wired headphones is nice is that you can go to the fridge or the bathroom and your friends can warn you when the game your playing is about to start or that your crawler zombie died and the new route is started and more zombies are coming. It's little things like this that make wireless headphones so much better and worth a little bit more of an investment.So to me the sound quality of these is spectacular and while not somebody who requires sound whoring (using in game sounds to get tactical advantages over your opponents in multiplayer games like Call of Duty) as I play games like Borderlands 2 and Grand Theft Auto Five.The one thing you need to worry about with wireless headphones is the battery life and these things last forever. When I say forever I mean a full day of gaming without a problem just be sure to charge them every night or every other night. But most times most wireless headphones will last eight hours but these seem to go at least that long.One last thing these are pretty big headphones I have a fathead and these fit my big skull comfortably.

They are earned by playing the game and some are given by your friendhips/rivalries. They are very nice and cover a wide sort of bonuses.In the game, you will have Health, which can only be restored with health kits, and Endurance. Think of Endurance as a shield, since it stops all damage until used, but it does recover. Also, based on your armor rating, there is Damage Reduction.Then there are the conversations and in-mission choices. These will change the story you are playing, somewhat. Some are critical to saving an NPC's life, others will increase the items available for you to purchase on the Black Market (Clearinghouse). You can also buy Intel for your missions.What order you go through the missions, what happens in/on the mission, and how the entire story plays out is up to you. This is an excellent game! It has strong FPS and RPG elements, and only a little exploring (always useful to find free stuff). Weapons and armor and even gadgets all have upgrades .GraphicsUnreal engine. Nothing new here.

This game is awesome and one of the best in the Mario series (Super Mario Bros. 3 first and tied with Super Mario 64).  It's a much better play if you have the Gameboy Player for Gamecube so you can play it on the big screen just like old times but either way, this game will have you playing for hours on end.The best features about this game are the fact that you can be both Mario and Luigi, have Yoshi (in 5 different colours I might add) and the exclaimation mark stages, the first one (yellow) is the best.  This game has so many stages and secrets.  The Star World is awesome, especially the Special Stage World, I wish they still made games like this one.Treading similar waters, this time Mario has a cape and can fly, a lot longer than in Super Mario Bros. 3 where you have the tail and can only fly for a limited time.  In this game you can fly over the whole stage...if you want but what would be the point of that?  The cape is one of the best items to ever grace the Mario series.The whole walk through, through Dinosaur Land is awesome, you go through many areas like the Cave and a Forest.  I also like the secret level where you can easily go get Yoshi and a couple of mushrooms/flowers or capes...whichever floats your boat.  Another great secret is the one stage where you can get 45-50 lives, this should last you the rest of the game.  Butter bridge is one of the harder levels, you'll need those lives and where the &quot;cheat&quot; level is located, you should be using them real soon.In all, this is an amazing game, there isn't much more I have to say, just buy it and you'll understand.  An excellent classic and Mario is the best hero ever (well, second to Link).  Enjoy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2004"}

{"product_name":"B001HB7K6I","reviewerName":"Halicon5","summary":"A simply gorgeous 2D action RPG game","reviewText":"GRAPHICS: Normally, the first thing I focus on in a review is gameplay and then the graphics, but I'm making an exception for Muramasa.  Goodness is this game gorgeous.  The graphics wowed me from the start.  Simply amazing.  The entire game is composed of stunning 2D artwork with multiple layers of animated backgrounds.  The color palette is amazingly deep and rich and everything animates smoothly.  This game is one of the best looking games that I've seen on any of the three current consoles, and that fact is entirely due to the amazing artwork and sense of style that pervades the entire game.GAMEPLAY: The game is a combat-heavy 2D side-scrolling action RPG title made by the same developers as Odin Sphere, and the gameplay is very similar.  For anyone who hasn't played Odin Sphere, the gameplay is somewhat like Castlevania and Metroid meet Smash Brothers and Viewtiful Joe.  I kind of imagine this is what Legend of Kage would have played like if Legend of Kage was actually a good game.  You play as one of two characters, each of which has their own story and acquires their own special abilities throughout the game.  Although the game contains some platforming elements, the focus is on combat and the combat feels excellent.  Some areas of the game already have enemies placed upon them, but usually you are ambushed by a number of enemies and then the game slips into combat mode.  As you progress throughout the game you will constantly be discovering and forging new weapons, and with each new weapon comes a new combat ability to take advantage of.  Weapons are unlocked in a progression tree fashion.  I haven't counted all of the weapons in the tree, but my estimate is there are about a hundred or so different swords to use.  The pacing is just about perfect, and I probably have been unlocking a new weapon every 15 to 30 minutes.  Additionally, the game includes a simple, stylish, and effective in-game map system that is both functional and non-intrusive, which is a huge bonus.  Finally, boss battles are very challenging, especially on the high difficulty setting and always open up a new weapon which opens up new areas of the game to explore.CONTROLS: The controls are very good and precise, for the most part.  The game can be played with remote and nunchuck, the classic controller, and also the GameCube controller.  In fact, if you've played Smash Brothers Melee on the Wii, the controls are almost identical.  Similar to Smash Bros., the game is button-mash friendly but if you take time to learn the nuances of the combat, you can become a devastating force of nature.  Most of all, I prefer to play this game with the classic controller.  My only serious complaint about the controls is that there isn't a separate jump button and the jumping is a little too touchy as it currently stands.SOUND: The music is great, ranging from traditional Japanese themes and instruments to some light rock mixes.  The music almost always seems to fit the scene and feels great.  In particular, I'm in love with the The voice acting is enjoyable, but it is in Japanese.  It might be good or bad voice acting in Japan, but to my untrained American ears I can't really tell and it seems to flows nicely and smoothly.  While I don't understand a lick of Japanese beyond \"konechiwa\", I feel that the choice to use Japanese voices with English sub-titles definitely keeps the game feeling authentic.  Combat sound effects are well done, consisting of exactly what one would expect with a swordplay heavy game.  Clanging weapons and lots of noises that sound link clink, shink, and whoosh.VALUE: The game contains two stories that follows two main characters.  The two different adventures play very similarly, but you will explore different areas in a different order.  The game is reasonably long and the amount of mileage you get out of depends on if you race through it and stop playing or explore and unlock everything.THE GOOD:+++ Gorgeous graphics and artwork+++ Great music+++ Easy to learn, tough to master gameplay.+++ Tons of new weapons to unlock at every turn of the game.+++ Enjoyable story.+++ Quality 2D gameplay in an industry where it often feels like 2D gameplay is going the way of the dinosaur.THE BAD--- Some areas, especially the villages use very repetitive graphic tiles.  Gorgeous, but repetitive.  A bit more variety would have been nice in these areas.--- The game lacks a good quick travel system.  This game could have really benefited from a Castlevania-style quick teleport mechanic that could eliminate some of backtracking that you have to endure.Overall, this is an amazing game.  When so many games today are trying to wow us with fancy 3D tricks, lighting, and particle effects, it is truly refreshing to see a game set out to impress through pure artistry.  What's even better is if that artistic game plays well, which this game definitely does.  If you enjoy 2D hack-n-slash RPGs such as the Castlevania series, I highly recommend purchasing this title.  Fans of the 2D Metroid games will probably also enjoy this game immensely.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2009"}

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Paslay","summary":"Nintendo always falls just a LITTLE short.","reviewText":"No one will probably even make it to this review, but here it is. Nintendo has, bar none, the most addictive and enjoyable first party and second party titles in the video gaming industry. With the Wii they changed the way we played games and I give them the utmost respect and thanks for that.The problem is two fold:First, the gaming industry isn't ready for this kind of innovation. By that I mean, gaming companies find it easier and more economical to follow the same gaming model rather than taking the trouble to code in full motion control for 1 out of 3 consoles.The second problem is that Nintendo always shoots themselves in the foot by leaving out integral elements of their consoles. The first of which is a lack of hard drive. Part of the primary appeal of the wii is the Virtual Console and Wii Shop Channel. Downloading games takes up memory however, and a 2GB expansion card isn't enough for most. If they can fit a 160GB drive in an iPod, they should be able to fit at least a 20GB drive in a Wii.The second issue is opting not to include a chipset with the same graphical capabilities of their competitors. So not only is the control scheme more difficult to code, but developers have to make a second version of the game with lower poly counts, smaller texture maps, and dumbed down physics engines. These together make 90% of the developers completely overlook the console because they can still generate significant revenue developing for the other two consoles.This also forces consumers to have to buy the 360, the PS3, or both so they can have access to the games available for everything but the Wii. The Wii had the potential to be the greatest system of this generation, but a couple bad decisions left it a little short.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2008"}

Until I got the game and discovered you need to open an account with EA before it will give you access to just about everything this game has to offer.  I could, but I don't want to open an EA account.  No one wants to open an EA account.  This has been a major roadblock to liking this game.But hey I can still play career mode.  Let's do that.  Now this game is developed by Criterion Games.  They developed the awesome Burnout 3: Takedown and Burnout Revenge.  I've seen more than a few critics compare this game (favorably and unfavorably) to Burnout.  As a Burnout fan I can say this game IS NOT LIKE BURNOUT.  There will be no wrecking of other racers here.  In fact this game will punish you for touching anything.  If you so much as rub another car you'll slow down and they'll speed off like you weren't even there.  Boosting is controlled in very short bursts so this game never achieves the sense of speed I've come to expect from other Criterion racers and every track so far has been painfully dull.The police are a little better because sometimes you get to ram outlaw cars, but it's never as satisfying as it is in Burnout and the police career mode is still full of boring tracks and penalties for reckless driving.Also this game only seems to be in a wide screen format and the text is very small.  There actually doesn't seem to be much of anything in the way of options for this game.To top it all off the Dual Shock controller is a joke here.

It also has a built in blue ray player which is going to be the new standard of the future, another strong factor is you can access upgrades which make your ps3 better little by little( the new ps store, the better picture for the blueray movies and more)I must note the fact though it does not come with a HDMI cable, but you can buy one at  amazon for a cheap price NOTE that in the stores they cost about 70 or 30 bucks. Also the 40 GB version does not include ps2 games compatibility. The controller is the same model as the other ones except for the trigger like buttons in L2 and R2,(which is fine by me since I love that design) the controller also includes motion sensing technology which is cool but few games know how to use it, it also uses blue tooth technology.

{"product_name":"PlayStation 3 40GB System","reviewerName":"G. Ware","summary":"Very impressed by a current Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii owner","reviewText":"I have both the Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii. I never thought I would buy a PS 3 but after hanging out at the stores to long during the Holiday shopping I ended up buying one. I must say, so far I'm very impressed. Its easy to see why Sony was charging a lot for this when it first came out, this thing is loaded and the fit/finish seems top notch. Compared to the Xbox 360 the PS3 seems very well thought out. The Xbox some days seems like something I built in my basement. The Xbox is so loud when you are playing a game. I can't figure out why MS would think anyone would want to watch a movie through their HD-DVD player as you would have to turn the movie sound way up to block out the 360's fans.The PS graphics are very very good, and the blu ray dvd is just an added bonus to a very good game system for the new lower prices. Also, its nice to have the on-line game play be free, compared to the Xbox $50 a year. It's not that the xbox is bad, the PS3 is just more refined.

The game was made before 2003 and it shows. The graphics are great and the AI very realistic. I would give this game 2 stars if it was released in 2005 but for the times it was state of arts. There is no story or plot. You have a choice of different scenic maps to battle on. This describes single player mode since this game will not always be supported online. There are only 2 scenarios: Hostage situation or Bombs. You have a choice to be either a Counter Terrorist Assault team or a stinken terrorist. You start the game with a certain amount of cash and you have only a few seconds to choose your loads using a pin wheel. You then go at it. Kill all your opponents to win the game or accomplish the goal of either foiling the bombing or rescue the hostages. These are the issues I have with the game:*The game has little strategy otherthan picking a point for ambush.*The AIs are dumb. They get in yourline of fire and disobeys orders.They like to throw grenades at the startof a mission for no reason but to hurt you.*Very limit orders list makes for frustration.AI will report enemy spotted but not where.*Weapons are well detailed even to the pointof reloading like real weapons but effectivenessis laughable. How many rounds in the head with aM249 does it takes for the opponent to die??*Grenades are few and ineffective. I can catchthe enemy in a tight group and throw a grenade anddo they die. NOPE! They only lose about 40% Health points.*Flash bangs blind you even when you have your eyes downor your back towards the blast.*The AI can be 6 in away from each other but will empty their magazines trying to hit each other.What a joke.*The terrorist have an unfair advantage and have 2 ways to win.Just killing all the terrorist isn't enough if they already setthe bomb.* Enemy don't make any noises execept while running.* Bomb exploding can hurt or kill you if too close when it goes off. Even when deep inside a building far away from the blast.* The maps are too small. It's easy to guess where the enemy are.* There is a severe slow down in the frame rate when pulling grenades or when too many things are happening on screen.This game is priced cheap but I recommend buying it used. The game can be highly customized with weapon types and cash amounts but as a real game it's lame. It's no fun to get killed early in a game. You then become a spectator watching all the AIs play which could take minutes. There is no 2 player version. The box doesn't tell you this is more an online game than a game that can stand on it's own. There isn't even a high score or stats section other then end game results that's reset after each game series. This can be a great game online but you need XBox Live and you need to find an opponent to play with. For a game it seems very incomplete and mindless.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2005"}

This game is garbage,has all these problems and they are not buying it anymore. The next year I see the same thing. Why do people keep buying this game if they have already made up their mind it is flawed in some way? Now to my review, I cannot understand why EA puts out golf,hockey and soccer games every year and they all seem to get better every year. They find something that works and just add to it in these games. But Madden is the biggest of them all and they find it necessary to keep giving and taking away. Granted this is an improvement over last year's disaster but something is still missing. The biggest problem is why cant they level the AI out based on a player's ability and awareness. No matter what team you play with or against it seems like you are still playing the same one. The schemes don't seem to matter especially on defense. The defensive AI is the same. You have the same chance of burning a lockdown corner as you do a rookie no matter what scheme the team you play has. Ratings play very little part as to how good a team really is. The AI should be based on the players ratings not some one for all AI. If EA can do amazing things with NHL and FIFA every year making them better. Why cant they get it right with Madden and stop giving and taking on it?","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2013"}

In all of these games, the gameplay remains fundamentally unchanged, with the exception of \"Re:Coded\", which was otherwise a disappointment in my book. It seemed that, on the surface, Square Enix was simply jumping on the 3DS bandwagon and shelling out another half-baked entry in order to stall before people tore down their door and demanded Kingdom Hearts III already. Regardless, I decided to give this the benefit of the doubt, and I'm pleased to announce that this is the best game in the series since \"KHII\". In fact, it may arguably be the best entry yet.We join Sora and Riku after the events of II and \"Re:Coded\". Riku is playing for the good guys again, teaming up with Sora to take on the Mark of Mastery exam. This involves them travelling to various worlds in order to find hidden keyholes that will prove their meddle as true Keyblade Masters. The plot is a welcome change of pace from the treacly sentimentality of \"358/2 Days\", the rehashed narrative in \"Birth By Sleep\", and the confused logic and pacing of \"Re:Coded.\" Nomura and all others involve certainly listened to the critics when it came to the story in this entry, and gave us what we wanted: a true follow-up. Much in the vein of \"Chain of Memories\", \"Dream Drop Distance\" expands on world of the game without losing its focus, and never gets lost trying to pander to fans. The result is the most focused game yet, and one whose story is filled with enough emotion and excitement for any gamer to enjoy. That being said, it's best to be familiar with the franchise before tackling this one. Newcomers may feel a little bit lost.My main concern about \"DDD\" was definitely the gameplay, given that it hasn't really changed in several years. All fears have been put to rest now, due to the fact that the dev team definitely took their time with making a fun and balanced experience. The level-based hack-n-slash we're used to is still here, but it's aided by the addition of a new system called \"Flowmotion.\" This is a snazzy way of saying that Sora and Riku now fancy themselves to be masters of parkour. The real surprise here is that Square Enix managed to slide in a new gameplay feature without turning it into a convoluted wreck. Flowmotion works fabulously. Within a few minutes of playing, you'll be grinding off of rails, using enemies as pommel horses, and careening off walls hundreds of feet in the air. Doing this allows you to deliver devastating special moves on enemies. Every enemy encounter, and especially every boss stage, transcends typical button-mashing battles and turns into something more visceral and downright fun than I ever expected from this franchise.The other addition is the \"Drop\" feature. You'll be playing as both Sora and Riku in this game, as they battle through parallel worlds to find the hidden keyholes. This works in a very unique way; you have a time with each character, as they experience different narratives in the same worlds. You have to beat the world with both characters in order to truly beat it and progress the story. This is less cumbersome than it sounds, and is in fact a very interesting way to approach handling both characters. You can also jump to another character early by using the \"Drop\" button on the pause menu. This can be handy if you get to a good stopping point in one character's progression. Getting to experience both characters' unique perspectives is a welcome change in pace for the series.Another worth mentioning, if only for a few sentences, is the addition of Spirit companions. Much like the world-specific partners of previous games, these animals fight side-by-side with you and can be teamed up with for a special attack. However, it works in a similar fashion to the \"Shin Megami Tensei\", where you collect certain components of the monsters, then combine them in order to create them. Depending on how many components you have, you can alter the strength and abilities of the monsters. You can have three with you at any given time, and I highly recommend you do so. These partners are very helpful, and fun to customize and level up. The interface for leveling them is very similar to a virtual pet simulator by way of \"Final Fantasy X\"'s level system. It's not too complicated, but not overly simplistic. Just the right balance of strategy and fun make this a worthwhile component to an already great game.Graphically, this is the best-looking game in the series, without a doubt. Having played several 3DS titles, I can firmly say this is the prettiest one yet, and clearly demonstrative of what we can expect from Square Enix in the near future. Environments pop to life with dazzling use of textures and shadows, and everything blazes forward with no drop in the frame rate. From Notre Dame to The Grid, these are beautiful renderings of iconic settings, some of which have never been visited in the franchise before. The only negative is, unfortunately, the uneven use of 3D. Frame rate has a noticeable drop when the feature is used in some areas, yet flows smoothly in others. While the effects are nice and all, I would recommend only using it for cutscenes. The game actually stands very strong on its own graphical merits, and the effects steal the thunder a little bit.Haley Joel Osment (remember him?) turns in another show-stealing performance as Sora, enough to make one wonder why he hasn't just decided to become a full-time voice actor already. The rest of the cast is predictably great, as is the music. The soundtrack once again spans a variety of styles, implementing the techno and trip-hop found in \"The World Ends With You\" when its characters are on-screen. There's nothing more to say, really, given that people already know Square Enix excels in this department.Here we are, seven years after \"Kingdom Hearts II\" left us speechless, and we're finally given the sequel we've wanted for so long. According to series creator Nomura, \"Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance\" is a taste of the gameplay we can expect from the third entry. If this is truly the case, then I say bring it on. This is the best entry in the \"Kingdom Hearts\" series so far, and a surefire candidate for Handheld Game of the Year. If you've been holding out because of Square Enix's incessant milking of the franchise, this is the one you've been waiting for.Ironic. In creating the best game of this stellar series, the developers have created perhaps the best 3DS title yet.Story: 9Gameplay: 10Graphics: 9Sound: 10Overall: 9.5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-02-2012"}

However, I had not played any of the series prior to picking the Saga collection up.SPOILERS FOLLOWThe first two God of War games were released for the Sony Playstation 2, but never once during my times of PS2 gaming did I ever play GOW.  It just wasn't my thing.  I am normally into first-person shooters and third-person action games like Resident Evil 4, Grand Theft Auto, etc.  You get the idea.  But, upon picking up the Saga collection for my PS3, I decided to give it a chance.  What an experience.Each of Kratos' adventures takes him to the vast reaches of Greek Mythology, during which he encounters many monsters, enemies, allies, Titans, and Greek Gods, who either aid him or stand in his way.  The battles are relentless, epic, and are downright brutal.  The soundtrack - be it the musical score or the ambient sounds that add to the already phenomenal atmosphere - is nothing short of amazing.  The graphical upgrades applied to the first two God of War games for this release (they were originally released on the PS2, after all) is still rather good, though the graphical excellence of God of War III is nothing short of breathtaking.From start to finish, all aspects of the game - story, control, graphics, sound, fun factor, and replay value, are second to none.  The adventure grabs you from the moment you pick up the controller, and holds your attention for hours upon hours.  To say this series is not one of the best ever in gaming would be downright outrageous.For fans of action and adventure, the God of War Saga is a must-own that will have you enthralled from start to finish with this epic tale of betrayal, revenge, and eventual redemption.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMAT","description":"GoldenEye 007has been a huge success for Rareware, and it's easy to see why. More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"Eric Jacobs \"ESJBond007\"","summary":"THE GREATEST  GAME OF ALL TIME!!!","reviewText":"GoldenEye 007 was simply the greatest game ever made.

At this point, it was more of the same for the Blue Bomber as the concept of defeating robot after robot was starting to wear out its novelty but it was still worth a look to see what Robots were featured and what the story would be this time around.The city is under attack. Robots go on a rampage while Dr. Light ended up being kidnapped by Proto Man. Dr. Cossack warns Mega Man and he soon takes off to get Dr. Light, only to see that Proto Man was set up from the get go and Dr. Wily ultimately emerges to challenge Mega Man: go to his castle and fight him in order to save Dr. Light. Just like the previous four games, you pick a Robot Master's stage, explore it and defeat the Robot Master to acquire his special weapon. Then, repeat the process until all eight Robot Masters are defeated. Go through Proto Man's impostor's castle and finally, play through Dr. Wily's castle to save Dr. Light. In addition to collecting the special weapons, you picked up health and weapons capsules as well as 1ups. Rush returns to help you out, your Mega Buster from Mega Man 4 returns but is more powerful now. And for the first time, you meet Beat, a robotic bird that saved you whenever you fell into a pit. The game gave you a password in case you want to stop and continue your game later.The PROS: It's a Mega Man game so it plays and sounds good. New Robot Masters meant new stage layouts and enemies so the ideas were still fresh. The story is also decent and sheds more light on Proto Man, Mega Man's brother and it was nice to see Dr. Cossack from part four make an appearance. The Mega Buster was more powerful now and Beat proved to be useful so it was an excellent new addition.The CONS: Unfortunately, this was where fans started to see Capcom run out of ideas. Most of the themes here were used in previous games (Star Man, Crystal Man, Wave Man, Gyro Man and Stone Man's stages in particular.) Also, the difficulty level took a slight dive as it was easy compared to other games in the series.It was still a good game to play through back then and Capcom just gave what Mega Man fans wanted: another excuse to run through another Mega Man game. This one is hard to track down brand new so either you settle for a used copy, pick up Mega Man Anniversary Collection for the PS2 and Gamecube or download this title for the Wii through the Virtual Console service for a mere $5 (500 points.)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2011"}

The weakest one of the NES bunch, however, is Mega Man 5. Now, don't get me wrong. Mega Man 5 is still a very great game. But compared to all the other Mega Mans on the same console, this one just wasn't worth it for most fans. I lost hope when I heard that this just wasn't good enough. Fortunately for me, I loved it as much as the rest.While the music doesn't sound too lively, the series' signature graphics and basic gameplay still shine through greatly. Unfortunately, the gameplay has been hampered by the fact that most of the bosses' powers are terrible. The Power Stone misses everything, the Charge Kick rarely does anything, Star Man's stars are worthless in most cases, and the list would go on. Whatever you do, just stick with your regular power. Even Rush isn't so great here.Although you do have to face those flaws, that still doesn't mean the overall game is bad. The level design is still just as creative as in the other games, and there's still a good challenge in the game. Speaking of challenge, that is kinda lowered down, too. You get a bigger chance of getting extra lives and health restorers. That way, both newbies and long-time Mega Man fans can enjoy the game. I also like how you have to collect M-E-G-A-M-A-N-V letters for a little something extra. It reminds me of how you must collect Chaos Emeralds in the Sonic games for secret endings.All the flaws that I mentioned may be major to some fans, but for me, those are minor complaints.Simply put: Mega Man 5 is still an awesome game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2011"}
