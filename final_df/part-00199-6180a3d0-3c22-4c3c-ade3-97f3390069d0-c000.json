Valenti \"FireMarioGalaxy64\"","summary":"Incredibly Overrated, the Worst Mario Kart","reviewText":"Mario Kart DS has got to be the most overrated game on the DS. It feels like it keeps the classic Mario Kart gameplay, but very downgraded. Most of the tracks you race on (about 90%) are very boring and uninspired. These are probably the worst tracks I've ever seen on Mario Kart. The items aren't that great either, which makes the overall gameplay suck. The graphics really stink, too, they're very blocky, even for 3D DS graphics, but that's not a real problem (I shouldn't make a big deal over graphics). My biggest complaint about this game is its replay value. When I first got Mario Kart DS, I was bored after playing it for about 40 minutes. It's the only Mario Kart I didn't want to play for at least a week. Also, all the extra things in the game (mini-games, or whatever you'd call them) are less entertaining than the already lousy gameplay. Mario Kart DS overall is terrible, but I recommend playing any other Mario Kart game besides this one that you can get your hands on. Every other Mario Kart besides Mario Kart DS is worth buying. I would rate Mario Kart DS only 35 out of 100 points, due to its poor-quality gameplay, replay value, and graphics.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2009"}
{"product_name":"B003O6HAS2","description":"","reviewerName":"Khanh Phan","summary":"Must own for Move owners!","reviewText":"This is hands-down the absolute best game I have played for the Move.  I know this because I not once had to fiddle with the controls or calibration while I played it.  It really does work well and makes you feel like a Sorcerer.  This is the game that makes the best use of the Move's capabilities as it was built specifically for the device.  Mending stairways and mixing potions worked really well.  The graphics are good, not great, but the world is very colorful and pops off the screen.  I also really enjoyed the story, as it is one that people of all ages will like.  The music is very good too, as it displays elements of Celtic themes.My only complaint is the slight lack of polish.  A level select feature and new game+ mode would have been nice to assist in getting trophies.  And it could have been a bit longer, but I myself do not mind short experiences as long as they are fun and immersive, as Sorcery is.I wouldn't quite say that this game by itself is worth buying the Move for, but you definitely should buy the device for this and other great games like Medieval Moves and Sports Champions.  If you already own the Move, this is an absolute must buy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0043QSR5C","description":"","reviewerName":"Gamblor","summary":"In Short - Buy It","reviewText":"You begin with one of four armor types (classes), and are able to unlock another after a mission is complete (so, 5 missions in and you'll have them all).Instead of leveling a character, you level your armor. I have my Battle Armor leveled to Rank 6 (with 8 being the max). It takes more XP to go from 5-6 than it does to go from 1-5. Fortunately, the harder difficulties give exponentially more XP.There are 3 chapters, each containing 5 missions. They will take you around 15-25 minutes each. There is a surprising amount of variety in the missions - search for missing soldiers, blow up giant anthills, find a downed aircraft, etc.The minimap shows your character's position, your 2 allies' positions (either friends or bots - after you beat the game once, you have the option of playing without bots), health drops, waypoints, and weapon drops (minibosses and bosses drop randomized weapons).The loot is very enticing. In addition to leveling your armor (which provides you with more HP, class-specific abilities, etc.), there are around 200 weapons to purchase (ranked 1-8), and 107 weapons that are randomly dropped from bosses. After a playthrough on Normal difficulty, I had 22 of the 107. And unlike the recent Dungeon Siege III, the difference in loot (weapons) is massive and noticeable. A single upgrade to a weapon might double the damage, increase the turn speed, decrease reload times, and feature zoom as well. It's a great system.One of the final bosses dropped a weapon called the \"Air Tortoise.\" It fires 1 slow rocket and takes 10 seconds to reload. However, that rocket does 9,999 damage. Good stuff.You're looking at 5-6 hours for the initial playthrough, and 50-70 minimum to level up all classes and get the best drops (and finish on Inferno!).Pros:- Lots of incentives to grind levels and gear, and it does not get old quickly.- 3-player campaign co-op that scales difficulty and 6-player Survival mode (although your class is locked to Trooper for Survival).- Decent mission variety.- Ridiculously huge bosses. Like, square-mile big.- Easy on Normal and hard as hell on Inferno. Something for everyone.- Mechs, Turrets, Tanks- Only 40 bucks!Cons:- All missions take place in the same city, and while there is some difference as to the districts they take place in, it's still a whole lot of \"same\" looking streets and buildings.- The graphics aren't great at all, but it's a budget title, there's a ton of stuff crawling and blowing up all over the place, and the framerate is very smooth (I'd rather have that, in all honesty).- The first half of too many missions basically tasks you with killing 300-400 ants until the good stuff gets started (again, not that bad considering they'll drop a ton of health to get you ready for the bigger bugs).- While the bosses are huge and awesome (and aesthetically different), they all have the same weakness. After you kill the first boss, you know how to kill them all, and I'll bet that you could guess even before you play the game, haha.Anyways, I'd recommend this game to pretty much anyone, but especially people who enjoy...Too HumanStarship TroopersLeft 4 DeadMassive destruction and explosions galore","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2011"}

This will not even be as nearly praised as MGS2.  This is baisicly a port of MGS2.  I was expecting another great port like Max Payne, but got Resident Evil's directors cut.  Anyone with a PS2 and has MGS2, and thought that substance was the reason to buy an Xbox, belive me you rather wait till it comes out for the PS2, unless that'll be a letdown as well.  If you have both systems with MGS2, I'd rather wait for Splinter Cell, DOA Xtreeme Volyball or Halo 2 than buy this if I were u.

I rented ( never buy first ) and played it all weekend, basically you have to figure out how to kill everyone on the screen without getting caught.  How you get there is up to you.  If you can creep up on an unaware thug you hold down a button and wait, the amount of time you wait determines what horrible fate awaits the thug in question.

Yes, even the graphics are actually better than the N64 version. It runs smoother and there's more detail. E.g. compare the original Mario to this one... this one looks like the same Mario from the New Super Mario Bros. Even Bowser is vastly improved. The new characters add strategy to the way you play and collecting all 150 stars is a group effort between them.

{"product_name":"B000B2YR74","reviewerName":"Ryan H.","summary":"Awesome game, but loses a little in translation","reviewText":"Half-Life 2 was one of the greatest PC games ever to be released.  It was one of the many reasons why I wanted to have a lot of money to shell out onto an awesome gaming computer.  But then Valve announced it would be released on the Xbox, so I waited a little longer.  Was it worth the wait?  Well, I like the fact that I can now play it, but man, I think maybe I should get a better computer to play the PC version.Half-Life is a game that really doesn't sit down and tell you a story, most of it you have to find for yourself.  Example, when the first game came out, you basically had no idea what was really going on other than the fact that an expiriment went bad and now creatures from Xen are traveling to Earth.  To better learn the story, you had to find clues that were, for the most part, hidden from the game.  No cutscenes are given to you because you're in control for most of the game.Anyway, you start off where Gordon Freeman (no not the actor Morgan Freeman) was sent into a portal and told to wait.  Well apparently you've been sleeping for some time now and when you awaken, you enter City 17 where humanity is run by the Combine.  You meet up with people from the first game then it kicks into high gear.Gameplay is some of the best I've ever seen.  When shooting gets old, they add some new twist, giving you a boat to drive or a car.  The other neat feature is the Havok engine, which uses the force of gravity.  You'd be amazed at how much you can manipulate your environment, in fact a lot of puzzles require you to do so.  You even get a gravity beam to use on other objects.  I really love this concept.  The other thing is that you have team mates that really think for themselves.  Which also brings me to the enemies, they are much smarter and will group up if they can't bring you down alone.So where does the Xbox version fall, if I like it so much?  Well, if you look closely at the character models in this version compared to the PC, you'll see a bigger difference, they're not as blocky.  Also the loading times are a pain, I understand that this is a big game, but I really hate how it constantly has to stop and load.

I want it to make you buy it.The Advance Wars series (3 games in all so far) was a turn based strategy game in which you have to either blow up the enemy or capture the enemy HQ.  You get money by having buildings(You can capture more to get more money) and you can build from bases,airports,and ports.  In the first game you only had the regular power(enhances stats and whatnot for a turn), power and a super power for the second, but since there are two CO's in one place at a time for this game; you can do a tag power where you can attack with both Commanding Officers in the same turn.  You can do new tag battles with more Commanding Officers, more units, and a new Black Hole plan to stop.  There are a bunch of new maps introduced to the game with all the old ones.  The same design room(Make your own maps here) with some new features.There are more game modes such as survival and combat.  The multi-player includes all of these modes.  The campaign allows you to choose which Commanding Officers you want to use in most missions.  A new History thing which keeps track of basically everything you do.  You gain experience points after you win a battle, these points can be used for upgrades such as increasing a units attack or defense.  A new DS battle where you have two fronts to battle on.  You can send units from the bottom screen up to the top and if you win the top screen you can tag battle against the one remaining person.Now the different views:Already played previous Advance Wars games view:This is a great game but, I've seen this before.  Sure the new units are cool but they don't seem to make the game any better.  It seems to make it more annoying.  I've already played through a lot of these maps, the only point of versus is to check out the new maps.  Campaign gets boring 3/4 of the way through. Blowing up the different buildings was introduced in the second game, now it's just annoying.  A lot of the DS battles(Two screen battles) are more annoying than fun.  The new CO's are great though.  So is the real-time game Combat and the challenging survival.  These modes seem to make up for flaws.The Single-card multi-player is only Combat(Even though this is a great mode).  Even though it has some bad points, it's an awesome game.New to Advance Wars series view:Awesome turn based strategy game.  I can't stop playing.  The Campaign mode is awesome and challenging.  Versus is great fun and practice to challenge the other CO's.  War Room is a good way to get money fast and easy.  I love how you can upgrade your CO.  A large array of units where you have to master the tactics of each one.  Survival is a fun way to challenge my skills.  There are so many maps and combat is a great way to get away from the turn based theme.  Overall a great game.Back to the review.  This is a great game but like I said, it has flaws.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2005"}

But I got a say that man has Dice screwed up on the launch of Battlefield 4 in a big way. And as the real bummer here because it's such a good game when it works and I'm speaking from 30+ hours spent on the PS3 version of the game. But with the crashing and the matchmaking and everything that's been wrong with this next generation release it really is a sad day because I'm sure it turned a few away from an otherwise truly amazing game.If you haven't you need to try Battlefield 4 because if you love military first-person shooters this one will blow your mind. And I speak as somebody who the first time I saw a tank level of building that the enemy was in I said out loud \"oh wow that is awesome\" and it really was. And the sound effects are another thing that is constantly make me feel like I'm on a battlefield they are something special I've never experienced in another first-person shooter.And this game has gotten a lot of bad reviews because of the launch and because of things that Dice has screwed up and some of it is definitely justified. Basically this game was rushed out the door so that it could be Call of Duty Ghosts to store shelves. And that's why you have so many features that seem half finished or many features that are gone entirely. But here is to hoping that they fix these problems and this truly amazing game can shine.One last thing that I think is a real problem for me personally as a disabled gamer there is zero button remapping and only four or five button presets available. And the worst thing about the PS4 version of the game is that they moved the fire buttons from the top R1 and aim down sight on L1 to the triggers on the PS4 with no way to switch them back. And a bummer for me is that as a disabled gamer I play with my face it so much more difficult for me to reach R2 with my upper lip than R1 but I'll do a video on YouTube complaining to Dice but it's still just a stupid oversight.But here's the hoping that future iterations of this awesome series will forgo many of the tactical errors committed by the developers with this release. And also if you're reading this in the future sometime after the new year and hopefully they have patched this game and address the stability issues that I think it's totally worth the purchase just to see what the PS4 can really do.Thanks for reading!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

The only two possibilities from Logitech were the G9x and the G500. I decided to go with the latter since it includes all the advanced features of G9x, while retaining the perfect G5 shape.Honestly, I haven't noticed any difference in precision between this one and the G5, since both are extremely accurate. The G500 however, includes some features not found on the G5:- internal memory (for 1 profile, think)- dual mode scroll wheel (smooth and notched. Smooth mode is low friction rotation but useless for gaming.)- 2 extra buttons (2 extra buttons over the red G5, and 1 extra button over the blue G5)- full macro support (I don't know why this feature wasn't on the G5...)- higher DPI (5700 dpi, but I keep my max at 2000.)It feels exactly like the G5 when holding, and that's its strongest point IMO. The wheel is a little worse, as it's too sensitive (ie, sometimes you end up scrolling four \"notches\" when you only want to scroll three) but not so much that it makes me want to go back to the G5. I'll get used to it I guess. Otherwise, I absolutely love it. If you are a G5 user and need to upgrade, then the G500 is what you are looking for.Update: After using it for many weeks now, I now love the sensitive wheel. I guess my finger was used to the tight G5 wheel, but I got used to this new one in no time. Absolutely loving this mouse so far.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2010"}

Our family became \"hooked\" on Animal Crossing Wild World....with even my husband getting a copy and using my daughter's old pink DS to play with us. So we were BEYOND excited to see the teaser trailers for Animal Crossing New Leaf for the 3DS.This game is fantastic!! From the very start....you are the mayor of the new town. You decide which building projects will be undertaken and where they will be placed (park benches, fountains, bridges, etc). Only one can be done at a time, so perfecting your town can take a gloriously long time ;) There are many new additions of clothing, including shoes and socks!!!! If they add a purse store, I will truly be in heaven! Nook's kids have taken over the family furniture business....and Nook himself now works in home construction. You can now custom order the doors, mailboxes, hedges, exteriors, etc. of your home.And now....my absolute FAVORITE part....the island. Remember the cabbie who drove you to your town in Wild World. As he has now been replaced by a train in New Leaf,  his new job is to ferry you to the island in his little motor boat. And along the way, he sings to you one of his many little songs....some of which are quite funny! You can choose to go to the island alone, or you can join other players from North America or around the world. Once there, you can hang out and fish from the beach, go diving in your little scuba suit, catch bugs, etc. You can also choose to go on one of the various tours only offered at the island. The tours are actually mini games that test your skills and earn you coins that can only be used at the island gift shop. You can play these games alone, or bring one of the friends you meet through the multiplayer option.We are only a month into it and having a great time. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a nice family game with lots to do. My son is 8 and he is just glued to this. He gets so excited and can't wait to tell me if there has been something new added to the town that day. Definitely get this game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00006LEMX","description":"Looking for a new obsession to keep you up nights? Let me introduce you to Hotsuma, the main character inShinobi, the much anticipated new action-adventure game from Sega. Fans of the original 2-D game have been waiting seven years for the next installment, and won't be disappointed by this energetic 3-D game for PS2.The premise hasn't changed much--kill bad guys, kill more bad guys, kill a boss, move on to the next level. You, Hotsuma, are the leader of the Oboro clan. As your clansmen are destroyed, you set out to avenge their deaths by slashing hellspawn and enemy ninjas to death with your powerful sword, Akujiki. As you move through game levels, Akujiki comes alive with power, absorbing the souls of those you kill--and turning against you if you don't keep him well fed. The basic moves--run, jump, slash--are easy to learn, but with each level you must master difficult combos to defeat trickier enemies. Moving quickly and attacking instinctively is essential to killing fast and furiously--each kill gives your sword more power, while each moment of hesitation makes your weapon impatient for blood.Shinobi, at heart, is a souped-up arcade game with awesome graphics. The anime-style cutscenes woven around the slice-and-dice sequences provide an interesting story, but one that doesn't relate very directly with your job on the streets of postapocalyptic Tokyo. Your moves are cool though--spinning in midair to collect coins that will unlock secret levels, killing three ninjas with a flash of Akujiki, zipping around so fast that a shadow of your ghost remains. It's easy to get caught up in the exhilarating energy of the game. Serious gamers will enjoy confronting bosses, who may take several frustrating tries to kill. But when you finally defeat them, you will feel the power of centuries of samurai.--Maile BohlmannPros:Fantastic graphicsExcellent scripting and voicingFairly easy controls and maneuvers at outsetExciting fighting sequences with intense gameplayCons:Killing early bosses can be unusually difficultLong sequences with no save pointsStoryline frames fighting sequences, rather than interacting with them","reviewerName":"Robb Boutros","summary":"Shinobi's BACK?!?!? Well almost......","reviewText":"Shinobi was one of those games that just about everyone poured countless quarters into during the late 80's and early 90's. So one would think that it would be a natural to resurrect for the Playstation 2, right? Well not quite. Sega has offered up a new Shinobi for the 21st century. Unfortunatley, Shinobi's come back hasn't made it all the way back to it's former glory.I'd have to say that when I gave this game 3 stars I was being a bit generous. There are things I do like about it but, if I could I'd actually give it two and a half stars. This game suffers from a number of problems.First the good. The main character of Hotsuma is very easy to control. Once you learn the in's and out's of his movements, running along walls becomes almost second nature. Hotsuma is also one ninja with serious style. The red scarf, though serving no purpose, is probably one of the nicest flourishes since Lara Croft's pony tail in Tomb Raider II. The CG cutscenes are also nicely done.Unfortunatley that's where the positives end. This games main downfall comes from it's gameplay. The action is highly repititive. I understand the idea, to bring an arcade style version of Shinobi to the PS2. But unfortunately the good people at Sega failed to give the game any depth. There's little variety in gameplay. You spend most of the game running through generic looking environments that pass for a post apocalyptic Tokyo, hacking and slashing your way past non-descript badguys. The word &quot;Shinobi&quot; in Japanese means &quot;Stealth&quot;. In truth stealth has absolutley nothing to do with this game. To be fair I wasn't really expecting another version of Tenchu, but I would have liked to experience something different than your run of the mill arcade slasher. Add the fact that there are no checkpoints and if you get killed, you have to start at the begining of the level can make the game very frustrating. The game's music isn't anything particularly unique and captivating either. The games camera can be a bit tricky at times also, but you can always re-center it by pressing L1.Shinobi was one of those games that you feel could have and should have given you alot more. Maybe on the PS1 this would have been a great game, but on the PS2 you feel that it could have been better. With any luck Sega will regroup and give us a better game for Hotsuma the next go around. But for those who might want a better ninja/stealth based game, you might want to check out Tenchu and Tenchu 2 for the PS1. At least until Tenchu 3 or Splinter Cell makes it's way to the Playstation 2.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2002"}

You play as Alice, a young girl with some truly nightmarish dreams, who enters Wonderland every time she dozes off (which is often), but the Wonderland she returns to is not quite how she remembers it. The world she knew has grown twisted, and its inhabitants deformed. At your disposal is a trusty blood-soaked kitchen knife (mentioned earlier), a pepper shaker acting as a machine gun, and a few other tools I won't spoil to help dispatch foes. Combat is generally pretty solid except for a somewhat awkward lock-on camera. Platforming is the other piece of the \"Madness\" pie. You won't just be jumping, but double and triple jumping, with the ability to glide in between each jump. Levels are scattered with secrets and collectables. The game does lack a bit of polish and feels rough around the edges. Some of the areas (snow, underwater) aren't as interesting as others. What I like are the little touches, like when Alice dodges and her entire body becomes a swarm of beautiful blue butterflies. I like that teeth are what you collect and use to level up weapons.

The gameplay, graphics, and sound borrow from the classic Sonic games on the  Genesis and are successfully translated to the Game Boy Advance. The game's  single-player modes are relatively short 2-D platform rounds--each run takes two  to three hours--but replay value is added through the game's various characters.  Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy each have different abilities that make getting  through the game a unique experience.The real star here is the game's link capabilities. The Chao Garden allows you  to raise your little critters and upload them to the GameCube via thelink cableandSonic Adventure 2:  Battle. Having one cartridge lets up to four GBA players compete in one  minigame. Gamers can play two additional minigames if each player owns a  cartridge. Although the single-player game is quite good, the link options give  the title tremendous value.The only notable problem stems from the series itself: There are still entirely  too many cheap deaths resulting from the title's high-speed gameplay. You'll  find yourself zipping along a level only to be hit by an obstacle you had little  chance of seeing, let alone avoiding. Ultimately, the only way to get past these  hazards is to memorize where they are.

Sme\"","summary":"Best first person shooter of 2007, and still good today.","reviewText":"COD 4 pretty much revolutionized both the \"Call of Duty\" franchise and online multiplayer gaming. The graphics were superb, and it finally broke the mode of most FPS games being either World War Two retreads or Sci-Fi.  I'll break my review into two parts for the single player and multi-player:Single player is what I enjoyed most, it's epic in scale and long enough to be satisfying.  The enemy AI is reasonably balanced and the missions have considerable variety.  I like how rather than play one character you instead played characters of different nationalities and armies, and yes, the bad guy does set off a nuke.  I didn't find the plot as profound as some people claimed, but it was better than most movies.Multi-player I loved and hated.  I loved it for the fast pace, well balanced weapons, and the challenging maps. The perks that you could add and rearrange were useful and interesting, and all told I ran through the level ranks twice. The first time took me barely eight weeks, the second was more like six months as my interest was tapering off.  I thought it was cool the ultimate weapon was an MP-44, and even today it's good to log in and play a few rounds.I hated it because of some of the people administering servers and how they wanted to have the games played.  Namely it was custom rules and demands, such as not using Martyrdom or Last Stand perks, or not using rockets.  These things were part of the game, not some cheat.  Don't like something because you think it makes the game too hard for you then maybe you should try something else, but OK, your server your rules.I hope at some point developers make games so servers can truly have custom settings and if someone wants it to be knife fight only or sniper only or pistols only then people logging in are locked into that type of game play.  It would save a lot of attitude and grief.As it is I ran into too many tough guys behind a microphone who would change rules on a whim or police players fanatically, FOA (Friends of Admins) who would always mysteriously do well, and so on.  The COD 4 universe is big enough that just leaving for another server was best, but it was still a pain to run into a bad server and get kicked off because the admin that evening decided he didn't like your perks while the server rules said they were okay, and so on.However, the tendency in newer games seems to be towards a blanket uniformity of game play where the server is picked for you, and all these people who've set up comfort zones where they can always do well have been wailing and gnashing their teeth, and I just chuckle at them.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"Dave","summary":"A Fairly Fun Dissapointment","reviewText":"I really enjoyed D1 and D2, as most people did to make them the landmark games they were. D3 is certainly inspired by these two games, but aside from similar proper noun names, and the general gameplay there is no relation. D3 has gone in a different direction art-wise, and though I preferred the more \"realistic\" look of the first two, I can say that there are truly some amazing views, and you have to respect the creativity and dedication that went into making this game's graphics. -Mostly a personal opinion, though given my initial hesitance, I would say most people could enjoy it moderately.Music and sound effects are great, it adds a lot to the experience.Monsters are misplaced transfers from the first two - mostly the same creatures, moved into different environments. There are some new surprises and the skills and abilities that they have are fairly interesting. The only challenge comes from monsters being totally over powered - there's no tactics. While the isometric view is at times pretty and in the vein of Diablo series, it's not particularly easy to work with World of Warcraft raid mechanics.If you've raided in world of warcraft, you've beat the bosses in Diablo 3. They're good fights, but I played WoW long enough to tell you where each of the boss abilities comes from - nothing new here.Character abilities first seem totally uncustomizeable. At about nightmare difficulty, lvl 30-40 you start to think that there's actually a lot of customization that you're going to get. The skill and rune combinations are massive. Unfortunately, most of them are prohibitive to play, it takes forever to change them and the UI - responded to ad nausea during the beta, is made for a young child. Not the adult, mature rated game with lots of gore and a little nudity.Overall, you'll probably enjoy it for the first play through if you liked the other Diablo games. If you just appreciate it as an \"inspired by\" as opposed to a sequel. But it get's old fast, even if you start playing after Activision Blizzard manages to get their login and game play servers working. Until then, expect to lag out of a \"single player\" game. Expect to lose achievements and character records, and expect to die a lot from lag. They'll either fix it (I hope and imagine) or after people have beat the game, and no longer want to sell items for a million gold two days after release (the economy is going down fast in this game... way too many resources, no gold sinks, use and sell rares, recover every gem you've ever made...)If you have the money to spare, and want to support a once brilliant company that has been bought out and is all about the money now, go ahead. You'll probably have a decent time. But there are way better games, with much more to offer, for less than this that you should really turn your attention to.-Update-Just wanted to add, that with the first hot fix, Blizzard is changing character skills and abilities, but not the in-game tooltips. There are no fixes for server lag, disconnects, and deaths due to lagging out.They are causing anyone who was used to playing a class, alone or with other people in strictly co-op (no PvP yet!!) to have to adjust to modified skills and abilities. The tinkering of an always on, always patched game become apparent.If you didn't dislike a lot about this game already, the unavoidable re-balancing, modifications of characters, and the lack of any sort of in-game update to ability descriptions should definitely put you off. Especially since there's no PvP, there's no real world money involved yet (RMAH)... What happened at Blizzard??","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2012"}

This game however really fell short of my expectations after playing the first two games.Game-play is extremely repetitive and feels meaningless. I know the other games repeated themselves also but playing through them was still fun somehow it's not nearly as fun playing through this game.Another thing that bothers me is blizzard continually comes out with new and better items to make sure they make money on their real world auction house. I cannot image how much money they make creating new items to make all of the current ones obsolete. It is as if Blizzard no longer cares about actual fun and game play they are focused on making money and that's it.To this day the game still has an extremely unbalanced feel to it, i cannot image the difference between my Demon Hunter and Witch Doctor. Some classes are simple to play with and completely unstoppable while others are complicated and are still not a viable option.It is also incredible that the game has been out so long and they still doesn't have pvp.

This combined with an excellent story line and refreshing lack of cuteness while not going over the top with violence and gore make this the overall best game I've played other than maybe one or two of the Tomb Raider series.Like a good book of fiction, I felt like I was actually in the story, not just pressing buttons.I do wish I didn't watch the bonus material, but wont ruin it by saying why.BOTTOM LINE: Especially if you like games that are mentally difficult to figure out, you will love playing God of War--both 1 and 2.  I made the mistake of playing God of War 2 first because I thought the first one might be crappy, but then near the end switched over the God of War 1 so I could have the full experience and know the whole background.  Truth be told God of War 1 is almost as good as this sequel and it would be a mistake to miss it.This is one of those games that drives me to buy the PSP and to upgrade to a Playstation 3 just so I can play my favorites.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2008"}

Those who played the original Condemned when the XBox 360 launched will find themselves in familiar shoes, once again taking the role of the demon haunted Ethan Thomas.  Throughout your mission to uncover the truth behind a supernatural crime wave, you'll come across plenty of shocks, scares, surprises, twists, and even new gameplay mechanics; all of which will really keep you glued to the game.  The frequent surprises and ever twisting storyline are the best things about Condemned 2, but the game's one big flaw is that for an FPS, the gunplay mechanics don't really work out as well as the melee mechanics do.  The guns themselves aren't really anything special, but other weapons to be found are creative enough, and the evidence gathering elements of the game have been much improved this time around.  Condemned 2 looks wonderfully dirty and grimy, with some great production values in terms of sound effects and graphics.  It should also be noted that the violence and mature-themed tones have also been considerably upped as well, only adding to the just freaky atmosphere that Condemned 2 just manages to create.  Multiplayer modes are nothing special in the least though, which is a bit of a disappointment.  Flaws aside however, Condemned 2: Bloodshot is a sequel that outshines the original in nearly every way, and is a more than worthy FPS that deserves your attention.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2008"}

Is this game of the year?  No.  Is this the best Uncharted game yet?  No.  If you haven't played any of the previous Uncharted games is this the definitive one to play?  No.  Uncharted 3 is a love letter to those of us who are Uncharted fans, revealing Drake's past and bringing Drake's story to a great conclusion.Presentation:The guys at Naughty Dog always pull of a believable aesthetic with the Uncharted series.  Weaving together the stories of modern treasure hunters as completely believable characters searching for historical relics in ancient ruins based in a historical fiction.Graphics:Uncharted 3 looks amazing, easily one of the best looking games on the PS3.  The gameplay and the cut-scenes are smoothed together like buttered melted onto some delicious toasted bread.  The silky smooth graphics blend together so well you will find yourself staring the beautiful scenery for a full minute after the cut-scene is over-because you'll never know that the cut-scene is even over.Sound:The sound effects throughout the world of Uncharted are amazing.  The voice acting is superb, the sound effects of swinging lamps, water, gunfire are all done with excellence.  The sound just sounds right, it doesn't stand out it has a perfect sense of impact and environment.Gameplay:Uncharted is a mix of third person shooter and platforming.  You solve puzzles that involve pulling levers, moving boxes, putting gears into the right place.  You have to end up jumping and climbing a lot.  Always running into a band of thugs that seek to end your life and seem to have the resources small countries militia.  If you've played Uncharted 1 or 2, you know what to expect here, as nothing has really changed.  In fact, I would say that the whole series has become old and worn, as nothing really new has been added here that changes up the tried and true Uncharted formula.  It's fun and if you loved the previous Uncharted games, than this is probably not a problem for you, but don't expect a ground-breaking gameplay mechanics or game-of-the-year wow factor. The folks at Naughty Dog have set the standard high with the Uncharted series.Conclusion:Uncharted 3 isn't ground breaking.  But considering how amazing Uncharted 2 was, you can't be upset.  Uncharted 3 is worth playing.  It's amazing.  If this is your first entry into the Uncharted seires, I recommend playing them in order, you'll appreciate them better that way.

While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C.

And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"J.

I am 6'5 and my sons are... well kids...the Kinect simply does not work well with the height difference.5.  My kinect does not recognize different players.  It often is confused if my son trys to play it thinks its me just 3 feet shorter and it places the player is weird positions like on their knees.6.  The games are pretty bad......my video game loving kids never ask to play kinect, they simply play Wii or DS.  To that end there are no games that I enjoy playing. So after 7 or 8 months of ownership we stopped using it after about the first month.Granted I enjoy more adult games like COD, Bioshock, Gears of War, ect.... so I am not really the target audience, but it also does not appeal to my kids.I LOVE my Xbox 360 I think it is an amazing machine but the kinect is very much NOT amazing.Hope this helps!Matt","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2011"}

(Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...","summary":"Sonic's major step into 3D gaming","reviewText":"How complicated must it be for Sega to make a game on a console that's still in development at the same time? And yet, the final game is a smash hit that happens to be pretty top-notch. They've pulled through then, I guess. And now that there's a DX version, it's on several other systems, including Gamecube, Xbox, PC, PS3, etc, so everyone gets an opportunity to see this classic.The game lets you choose to play as 6 different characters (However, you unlock them by playing as Sonic first). We have Sonic (of course), Tails, Amy, Knuckles, E103 Omega, and....Big the Cat...Each of the characters have their own gameplay mechanics, as well as goals and certain levels. Below is the fun factor for each character.Sonic - The levels are actually pretty straightforward. You simply go from start to finish. And boy was it fun.. It's actually pretty close to the Genesis Sonic games, but in 3D. Collect rings, bash robots, you know..The good stuff. Plus, there are some new level-specific gameplay mechanics included, like Twinkle Park's bumper car riding, and Sky Chase's airplane combat! You may as well buy this game just for Sonic alone. After all, as the title character, he has the most levels to go through.Tails - More or less like Sonic's gameplay except he has to race Sonic (later, Eggman, in Speed Highway) in each level. It's not as bad as it may sound, because it only just keeps the pace going, which is great, and don't you think it's kind of exciting to find shortcuts when flying?Knuckles - Rather than going from start to finish, Knuckles has to find 3 Emeralds in each level. So how do you do so? You glide around the place and see if an Emerald is picked up on a radar (REALLY helpful), and they could be hidden in enemies or other places. The only minor (And only MINOR) downside with Knuckles is that there are only about 1 (or 2?) Emeralds throughout the game that could only be found by digging into the ground. I was expecting Knuckles's digging upgrade to be used a bit more specifically for finding Emeralds.Amy - She isn't as fast as the above 3 characters, but she still isn't a bad pick. Although having the same robot chase her throughout levels is a little cringe-inducing, Amy plays pretty well, as she can attack with her massive hammer.E103 Omega - Alright. Who expected a robot to be playable in a Sonic game? I certainly haven't, but I'm glad I am. Omega's gameplay involves massive deals of weaponry, as well as being able to hover later on, and do certain tasks in the levels. In Final Egg, for example, you must destroy Sonic dolls. In Emerald Coast, you catch Froggy. In other levels, you must go destoy other Omega robots! I absolutely love playing as this thing, as much as I love playing as the first 3 characters.Big - Big is a pretty lame downside to this game. He's slow, and you have to go fishing for things. It's as fun as described, and I certainly don't want to go back to playing as him. Sadly, you have to beat the game as all characters if you want to fight the actual last boss, Perfect Chaos, so........That pretty much covers up the characters. As for everything else, the level design is magnificent and lovingly crafted. Plus, the graphics are awesome for the time, and the soundtrack rocks!However, Sonic Adventure DX is not without flaws. There are a few times where the collision gets a little awry, and the cutscenes aren't amazing, too. While the story is nicely done, some bits of dialogue are a bother. Oh, yeah, and there's Big the Cat. Nevertheless, these are, again, minor problems, as the game is so much fun that you'd hardly think about them. Oh yeah, and the unlockable collection of Game Gear games is a great bonus!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2012"}

The NPC may not always come to help you in the right spots, and I was stuck in a few instances where the enemy doesn't show up to advance the level. Sometimes weapons would disappear when dropped or would fall into a spot that prevents you from picking it up.The controls felt cumbersome, like Marcus weighed 800 lb and reacted slowly to your inputs. The running  was frustrating because Marcus would immediately sprint in a direction that may not coincide with where you're facing, and he isn't very maneuverable in this mode.GoW2 had a great storyline, stunning visuals, excellent audio, and decent controls - it certainly was easy to pick up and play. Nothing was too gory or scary, although the language may not be suitable for minors. The one thing that really got to me was Maria. She resembled a woman that was fighting a losing battle against the last stages of cancer, probably one of the scariest and darkest things to endure and observe.Overall: 4/5 stars, they need to make the game a bit more stable and fix up some of the bugs.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2011"}

There are total 16 different endings with 2 major branches and 14 additional permutations branching off those 2 major branches.  Single playthrough will take around 40 hours and you surely want to play at least once more for the major change of the plot development.In the days of eco-case with no manual, online pass, paid to play DLCs and DRM now firmly spreaded to consoles from PC, it is almost insane in the eyes of major game publishers from financial backgrounds, dying to see second-hand market dead and force their wills on the customers, to see a small foreign developers releasing free upgrades and DLCs for their customers and openly speak against the current DRM trend, but here we go again, CDProjekt doing the impossible.Do yourself a favor and go visit world wide web dot gog dotcom and get the DRM-free download version of the new TW2EE with all the bonus contents that includes manual, game guide, soundtrack, map and poster if you have not purchased the game.  It's also a sister company of CDProjekt and all of the retro games available at the site are DRM-free.For the new retailed version published by WB, I haven't been able to confirmed any DRM yet, however, CDProjekt recently reassured that they will not put DRM on any of their games as they have proven time and again.  Then again, I wouldn't be surprised at all if the retailed version comes out with DRM, at least initially because it's WB.The Witcher series is one of my three most favorite CRPG games along with TES series and Gothic Trilogy.  It is CRPG lovers' dream comes true.  If you missed it, go buy it now.

Trolling on Amazon is always appreciated. I'm not a PC or even hard core gamer. I do like to play games and have kids that do as well.I play on a 60\" plasma in my living room and that's what I've based my opinions on. The PS4 looks, aesthetically, terrific. It has a small footprint and if you don't know what it is, it will blend into your home theater set up. For me, huge plus. I have a very small amount of gear, intentionally, and prefer something like that. There is no proper on button or eject button. You just press the area noted in the manual and it works. The controllers are great if not very familiar. The included mic now plugs directly into the controller and can support any headphone jack you would plug into a cell phone. Fantastic touch. No power brick rounds it out. From a non-game view perspective, I use it for Amazon Prime and Netflix. Both have had mediocre results. results. Blu Ray works as it should. I will be glad when he \"TV Remote\" style controller is available for watching movies.The user interface is great. Very intuitive and simple to use. The original cross bar remains with a larger bar beneath with games played and available options, DLC or company help items. Even if you are unfamiliar with the PS3 interface, it will only take minutes to make yourself familiar with it. As the PS4 constantly is updating and loading new data, it is really helpful to see what is going on.From a games standpoint, I purchased four launch titles, Battlefield 4, Call of Duty: Ghost, NBA2k and Need for Speed. All of the games require a sizable amount of the 500GB HDD. Those four range from 25-40 gigs. An expansion is almost a necessity right out of the gate. I'm not overly fond of that. With the exception of Battlefield, the other games worked as advertised. The online functions all run smoothly and appear to work generally bug free. The graphics for this batch are a mixed bag. Battlefield, when it works (game/EA issues, not hardware), looks absolutely stunning and next gen. NBA2K is also pretty spectacular. Need for Speed looks like a fantastic PS3 game, but is not jaw dropping. CoD...well, it looks terrible compared to the others.***UPDATE*** Something the PS4 does of note is constantly update. The PS4 is designed to be left in \"Standby Mode\" so it can download the constant updates and game saves. I have found the my home network frequently gets slowed down by the constant...and I mean daily uploads of save data and downloads of game updates...are happening. Some games, NBA2K being the wist culprit will update several times a day. As of this writing, I had 22 updates in the last 7 days. I played the game twice. I assume this is due to the amount of info on the cloud that is used, but developers are going to need to streamline this as I simply hate having my home network grind to a halt for a game I play for a couple hours a week.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2013"}

Each side has a variety of different weapons and gadgets.  For example: spies have flash grenades to blind mercenaries; mercenaries have mines to lay for spies.  Each team has different vision modes: spies have the thermal and night vision; mercenaries have motion tracker and electromagnetic vision (the later lets mercenaries pick up spies using gadgets).Online play is a lot of fun.  It's probably the most innovative online game on x-box so far.

Roman","summary":"Fun if you've never played a Mario game before.","reviewText":"I grew up with the Mario games. From the first Super Mario Bros. to Mario Sunshine, I usually enjoyed the portly plumber's running and jumping adventures. But with New Super Mario Bros. for DS, something seemed off to me. Don't hate on me because I'm not one of those people that gave it 5 stars just because it's 'old school'. I played through this game twice, wondering if I missed something the first time around, clearing every stage 100%. Then it hit me- this game was made more for the casual gamer that Nintendo's trying to win over more than it is for those looking for a true new installment to the Super Mario Bros. series (like a Mario 4). A lot of the new elements they put in here aren't that new when it comes down to it, and you're probably better off going with the Wii version, which, while practically a director's cut of the DS version, at least has a few new things in it.Story-wise, it's the same Mario: Princess Peach/Toadstool gets kidnapped by Bowser, and it's up to Mario to save the day. This time, Bowser Jr.'s up to no good too, and you'll be dealing with him more than any other enemy boss. You'll run, jump, wall jump, smash and fireball your way through a couple of worlds while collecting coins along the way. If you've never played a Mario game before, I guess this is a good start since it has most of the basic Mario elements. But for anyone hoping for something more, you may be disappointed.I'll get the good out of the way first- the graphics look pretty good, and everything runs smoothly with no slowdown. Some of the levels actually did require me to think about where to go next, like in one of the ghost houses, or at least really look around to find one of the big coins so I could get 100%. The level design is a combination of Super Mario World and Super Mario Bros. 3, the two games that I thought had the best level design of any 2D Mario game. The game's also fairly long, about as long as the two I just mentioned.Unfortunately, New Super Mario Bros. has so many little problems that they drag the score down big time. First, the new giant and mini mushrooms don't really add anything to the gameplay. You can only use the giant mushroom in select world types for it to be of much use, and even then, it just makes clearing the level too easy. When you smash enough enemies and objects, you get extra lives based on how much of the bar you fill at the top of the screen...and this game is VERY generous with the extra lives, so it's not like you'll ever need more. The mini mushroom is a cool concept on paper since it allows you to run on water and jump a little higher, but it's also much easier to die when small, and harder to control jumps. Where they added these two abilities, they took away any flight powers. No raccoon leaves, and no magic capes. You're either on land or walking on clouds or swimming through the whole game. And I can't stress how much slack the game gives you with extra lives. It felt like I couldn't clear a stage without getting at least two 1-up mushrooms or getting enough coins to add to my already large stock. I also didn't care for any of the boss fights. When you fight Bowser, it's a tribute to how you fought him in the original Super Mario Bros., and all the other boss fights were basic 'jump on them or butt stomp for more damage and they're toast' ones. Where some of the levels were challenging, the boss battles were anything but. Finally, what's with the new enemy designs? I'm not against new enemies in a Mario game, but most of the new guys here really don't fit in with the style of the game and were more distracting than anything.There are a lot of different multiplayer games, though a lot of them are pretty short and dumb. The one most people I know play the most is the VS mode where one person is Mario and the other's Luigi, and they try to take eachother's coins. These are a nice addition for younger kids, but I doubt anyone over 15's going to get much out of it.As you can tell, I didn't care much for New Super Mario Bros., but I didn't hate it. I was just extremely disappointed. The game felt very rushed to me, and I didn't hesitate on selling it once I got everything. It certainly isn't worth the price it's going for now, and even with it being a top seller for the DS, it shouldn't be more than twenty bucks at this point. But if you haven't played a Mario game before, and have a regular DS or DS Lite, go with one of the GBA re-releases of the NES and SNES games. You'll get much more for your money.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2010"}

Although the theme of the motley crew uniting to work towards a common cause has been abundant in Japanese storytelling since Hiroshima, in everything from Seven Samurai to Evangelion, Final Fantasy VI is unique in its love for its characters. While some of the characters' personalities are childishly overexaggerated (and accompanied by Wagnerian synth leitmotifs from series composer Nobuo Uematsu), never has eclecticism been made more plainly beautiful. This game is well-liked by children as well as adults, and fans of the game each have their favorite characters, including a renegade faction of fans devoted to the game's villain, a renegade imperial general named Kefka, who dresses like a clown and high-spiritedly spouts nihilist philosophy (think Nietzsche's \"Beyond Good and Evil\") as an excuse for... well, evil. \"You sound like chapters from a self-help booklet.\" he tells the heroes, when they confront him with their individual reasons for wanting to defeat him. And only the most hardened realist will be able to play this game without becoming entranced by its many interlocking stories, however implausible each one may be, and wanting to defeat Kefka him/her self.Have you ever wondered how the cast of Les Miserables would fare in a steampunk world where they were pitted against Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine?

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Edward B.

You&rsquo;ll get a competitive advantage by hearing sound cues that youcan&rsquo;thear with speakers, such as the soft footsteps of an enemy sneaking up behind you, or the loading of a weapon far in the distance, regardless of the direction. By hearing sounds others can&rsquo;t - and by knowing where they&rsquo;re coming from - you&rsquo;ll react faster and take them out before they takeyouout.If you&rsquo;re serious about XBOX 360 gaming, get serious about the sound. Invest in an Ear Force X41 and experience the game the way it was meant to be heard. It will help you to become a better player and you&rsquo;ll have a lot more fun enjoying your XBOX 360.&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround Sound Technology!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Take your gaming to the next level by experiencing how your Xbox 360 was meant to be heard!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Enjoy late night gaming without disturbing others!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround SoundThe Ear Force X41 transmitter uses a 150MPS Digital Signal Processor (DSP) to deliver genuine Dolby Digital sound, Dolby Pro Logic IIx, and Dolby Headphone surround sound processing technologies - the industry-standard formats for encoding multi-channel sound in XBOX 360 games and DVD movies. The X41 uses the latest version of Dolby technology to create realistic game sound in 7.1 channels for improved surround sound accuracy.Dolby Pro Logic IIx and Stereo EnhancerThe X41 transmitter incorporates the latest Dolby Pro Logic IIx decoding system for surround sound realism from Dolby Pro Logic II encoded audio. When used with stereo sources, the Dolby Pro Logic Decoder also enhances the sound by spreading the stereo signal to provide a &ldquo;wider&rdquo; effect. This results in a richer, fuller sound than normal stereo - almost as if it originates from outside of the headphones.2.4GHz Wireless Digital RF TechnologyThe Ear Force X41 transmits game audio to the headset with an uncompressed wireless digital radio frequency (RF) signal to deliver CD-quality sound that rivals professional-grade wired headphones. Best of all, the wireless RF signal does not require &quot;line of sight&quot; to operate. That means you can stand anywhere near your XBOX 360 and hear a clear, noise-free signal.Chat Boost&nbsp;Dynamic Talkback&nbsp;ExpanderIf you&rsquo;ve ever had trouble hearing teammates on XBOX LIVE when the game action heats up, then you know how frustrating it can be when you have to keep adjusting the chat volume. Chat Boost fixes this problem by automatically adjusting the XBOX Live chat level when the game gets louder, so chat from teammates isn't lost in the exciting parts of your game. As the game sound gets louder, Chat Boost turns up the chat volume automatically so you can still hear what everyone is saying.It's a simple solution to an annoying problem, and it all happens automatically - so you don't have to adjust anything!Microphone MonitoringIt's hard to hear yourself speak when a headset is covering your ears. The X41 corrects this annoyance with its microphone monitoring feature. The X41 adds a portion of the microphone signal into the headset signal, so you can hear a portion of your voice along with incoming chat and game audio. Microphone monitoring not only prevents you from talking too loud or accidentally yelling into the mic, it also eliminates that annoying &quot;clogged ears&quot; feeling when talking while the headset is covering your ears.Bass BoostThe X41 headset DSP also lets you turn on a Bass Boost feature that produces deep, rich bass tones by increasing the volume of low frequency sounds - just like turning up the volume on the sub-woofer on your home theater system. Bass Boost improves your gaming experience by kicking-up the sound level of explosions, gun shots and other deep-bass sound effects, making them even more dramatic.Wired Headphone ConnectionThe X41 transmitter includes a headphone output jack with volume control to connect an optional pair of wired headphones in addition to the wireless X41 headset. This jack outputs the same high-quality Dolby Headphone 7.1 surround sound that&rsquo;s being transmitted to the wireless X41 headset, which allows two people to hear the game sound at the same time.Independent Chat/Game VolumesSeparate volume controls let you adjust the game and chat levels individually, so you can easily balance them and never have to worry about missing a cue from your teammates.Advanced Battery Booster CircuitryThe X41 has a &ldquo;battery booster&rdquo; circuit that squeezes every last bit of power from the batteries and assures high quality sound until they&rsquo;re completely dead. This allows a pair of AAA Alkaline batteries to last for as long as 25 straight hours of game play. You can also buy standard rechargeable batteries in place of Alkaline batteries.Powered By USBThe transmitter is powered by a single USB port on your XBOX, or from a nearby PC or laptop. So there is no need to fuss with a separate AC power adapter.","reviewerName":"Shane O.

Some of the scenarios push you in certain directions: make this island a tourist trap, exploit resources from that island, etc. But how you go about reaching the scenario's objectives are totally up to you (there is also a sandbox mode to just play around).Working against you are unruly citizens who want things like healthcare, housing, food, entertainment and religion. Leave these desires uncared for and the peasants will rise against you. Of course you have a lot of tools at your disposal to deal with them (you can meet their demands, or execute striking workers; a strong military can defeat rebels; or you can bluff your way with empty campaign promises). The unwashed masses are not your only internal concern: military, religious, capitalist, and communist factions all demand your attention. There is crime and pollution to contend with as well as infrastructure issues.Additionally world powers (US, EU, Russia, China, and the Middle East) will set goals for you... dismiss them at your peril: if your relationship with foreign powers detriorates far enough, they will invade you.And of course, you wouldn't have a Sim-City style game without the threat natural disasters.  Tornados, earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanoes, drought, oil spills will all get thrown your way.The menus are intuitive and very clear. The controls work well on the xbox 360--I am very pleased to see a well executed strategy game on a console.  Time can be sped up or slowed down (or paused) while making decisions.While you CAN micromanage down the individual citizen (click on one and promote him to minister, or mark him for execution), you'll mostly be dealing with buildings.  Getting your island started is the most difficult part of the game (and the pesky rebels can spoil later in the game if you're not careful), but I would not say Tropico 4 is a hard or complicated game.  It is fun, however.If your console needs a break from first person shooters, or if building a tropical empire appeals to you, Tropico 4 will be a lot of fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2012"}

Characters feel real and life-like, and there's several moments where the voice actors are so good, you can feel the on-screen character entering brown trousers mode.Gameplay has improved 10000% from Assassins creed 1. Remember all those insanely annoying search quests that served no purpose other than to give undervalued achievements? Well, that guy was fired, and hopefully his house was burned down. In its place are a plethora of new search quests, some annoying and some not, but all of which serve as useful game aids, finding cash for a variety of stores, finding other subquests, or trying to rescue your mother from a grief induced fugue. And in the 15th century, they've discovered the map, a wonderful piece of technology that gives you a general idea of where things are, and then mark important locations on these maps to make them valuable commodities. Combat has gone up and down. New techniques and new gear, not to mention gear that you can buy from stores, including new varieties of old standbys makes combat more entertaining, but they didn't add much to the core combat, which boils down to counter and dodge and slash, though several new attacks, namely the double hidden blade takedown, had me giggling for hours.Notoriety is the same way, in that you can lower your visibility to guards by blending into small crowds, bribing heralds to say the charges against you were acquitted, or tearing down wanted posters, but that feels a bit like time travel, when you kill a guard, gain notoriety, round a corner, see your wanted poster, tear it down, lose all your notoriety, and go back to being incognito.There are a handful of nits. Some of the jumps are a pain, given your propensity to jump to the one location where there is no ledge. While more surfaces are climable, sometimes to sole one that will work its the one that looks and acts like background till you hit just the right spot. Some of the game requires DLC or preorder only content, which is about as fair as saying those who bought the regular version got an \"expanded demo.\" While maps are a good improvement, they're too nailed down, and having GPS coordiantes for treasure hunts defeats some of the purpose, and there are no maps for some of the side quests. I know I sound like I'm trying to have my cake and eat it to, but I didn't think a mechanic for \"Go to this general area\" would be impossible to pull off over two games. Improving the hideout is nice, but you can turn it into Trump Tower in less than forty minutes.Overall, this game is fantastic. Entertaining side missions, a main storyline that's an actual story that you can get into, gorgeous scenery, wonderful dialogue. If not for a few points mentioned early that make me pray Ubisofts VP of marketing is torn apart by wild animals, this would've shot all the way up to #3-4 on my all time list.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2009"}

The screen really brings you in, the controls are responsive, and the system is lightning fast. The Vita feels sturdy and well designed. You don't have to do a claw like you did with the PSP. The dual analog sticks take some getting used to, but after a bit you don't even think about it. I have FIFA and Uncharted and both are pretty awesome. FIFA I think is a little better, and is a must to play if you like sports games. The use of the back touch panel is brilliant design. It brings touch gaming to a system with ACTUAL BUTTONS without having your hands blocking the screen constantly. Battery life is good considering I'm getting about 3.5 hours w/ 3G activated. Apparently without 3G on you should get around 5 hours. Putting it to sleep uses almost no battery at all.Pros:5\" OLEDTouch screens are super responsiveFeel of the device - light yet sturdy and refinedLaunch lineup (FIFA and Uncharted are great)Dual analaog sticks - novel conceptCrisp and familiar button layout and feelCons:Not a huge fan of the UICard slots are tinyCan't install purchased card games.

Even a 32gb, (the biggest memory card availible so far) will not be enough memory. The games and downloadable software eats up alot of memory fast. And if you plan on having a large video game and downloadable content library for the system, then multiple memory cards will have to keep bieng purchased for the system. This system is nice, however it costs at least $450 to just get started with useing this system.  If you can afford to pay $ 450 plus more over time Then buy this system, however, in my opinion, even though the systems are nice,  $450 and above for a handheld is unreasonable.

{"product_name":"B0050SWBAE","description":"","reviewerName":"Jack Fox, Badgerlord","summary":"Great game, but not without a few tiny easily pushed aside flaws","reviewText":"I never played Pikmin 1 or 2, only 3. And as of this review I haven't beaten it, I am on day 17.Synopsis:Your crew are stranded on a planet and you have to find fruit in order to save your planet from dieing of starvation. In order to do so you enlist the assistance of the local Plant-Animals called Pikmin and command them in squads to do your bidding. At it's core it's a simple concept but it can get tricky!Controls:The gamepad controls are miserable and painful. I can't recommend them for any logical reason. The only way to aim is by moving your character as well, if you ask me the right joystick should have been aim, the left should have been move. Unfortunately this is not the case, the right stick moves the camera which is OK, but really not needed in a game like this. Instead, I'm recommending the Wii-Mote + nunchuck, it is infinitely better, more accurate, and easier to aim and use properly. The only think you sacrifice is direct control of the camera and as of yet I have never needed that Camera to change it does pretty well on it's own, specially with the new lock-on feature. The gamepad does have some useful functions, it shows the map, pikmin info, help files, etc... and i keep it on a stand on a side table next to where i am playing so I can see it. The map is only semi-useful though. you can scroll around but you can't zoom in or out, you also can't focus it on a specific point. But it will show any stranded pikmin or where the pikmin who are carrying something back to the ship are. Later in the game it will also show you where fruit is so you will be able to collect it all, provided you have the correct pikmin.Graphics:An astonishingly beautiful game. The planet has a life all it's own, the dirt and grass look like dirt and grass, the water moves like water should and everything is just alive. The only thing I felt that fell short was the 3 Characters you play as. They felt... less alive than the environment and I can't quite fully explain why. Part of it is they don't really have emotion or any other facial expressions apart from big open eyes and a shocked face. All in all though Pikmin is complemented amazingly well by the HD upgrade and not once have I seen even a hint of Frame rate loss or lag, even with a screen full of pikmin and enemies.Gameplay:The meat and potatoes of any game. The gameplay has not changed that much from Previous Pikmin games, or at least what i have seen of them. I haven't played Pikmin 1 and 2 so I came fresh into this game with 0 expectations on that front. The game doesn't disappoint. You control 3 crew members, Alph, Brittany, and Charlies (The pun hurts, moving on). And as you explore this new world you gather different types of Pikmin, there are 5 types I believe: Red, Yellow, Blue, Rock, Flying. Each has their own special properties:Red - Immune to Fire and has higher attackBlue - Won't die in waterYellow - Conducts Electrical Currents as well as can be thrown higher than any other pikminRock - Heavy and deal a ton of damage when thrown, can also break glass and crystals when thrownPink - Flying, can move over obstacles. (I think, I don't have pink yet)You can only carry up to 100 Pikmin with you at any time, so you have to chose how much of each type of pikmin to bring with you, do you bring 20 of each? 30 of 2 and 12 or so of the others? or do you bring 100 Rocks! It's up to you, and a lot of the fruit requires a specific amount of certain types of pikmin along with you. For instance you may need 10 yellow Pikmin and 10 Blue pikmin, Yellow to complete a circuit, and blue to go across water. That kinda thing. You also need a certain amount of pikmin to carry an object, fruit requires anywhere between 1 and 20 pikmin (Of any type) to carry back to your ship. When you tell your pikmin to bring it back to the ship they will do so, taking the quickest path there, however they will ignore enemies and if they are attacked and aren't protected they will die so be warned. Once they get back to the ship, unless you told them to bring back grapes (More on that in a second) They will stay at the ship, and as long as they are there they will be safe. This of course is already something Pikmin players are used to so lets go over what is new.You are given about 15 minutes a day in order to do whatever it is you needed on the planets surface. The amount of days you have is limited to how much fruit you bring back, as long as you haev 1 jar of juice left you can move onto the next day. There is a limited number of fruit however so I would Estimate the total number of days at around 100ish. Give or take.First you control 3 different characters this time. They can travel together or separately, splitting your pikmin squad up from 100 to whatever you want to give them. They aren't AI controlled though, you have to tell them what to do. The only thing you can give them is an order to move to a location and they wander off on auto-pilot. They will also ignore enemies and if attacks can lose pikmin. You switch between the three pilots but using the - button. There are also times when you will need to throw other pilots because they are all incapable of walking over a tiny root in their way or up a tiiiny ledge, and yet are perfectly capable of throwing their friends over it. This can actually be a bit annoying as This means they can't be off gathering fruit at another location, and... kind of defeats the purpose, you will have to bring them back to your location or come back on a later day.Speaking of time, once your time in that day runs out that is it. Any pikmin that are not in your squad, or are not near your ship will die. This is inevitable and at the same time not entirely important. You have plenty of pikmin to chose from and some have to be sacrificed either by accident or carelessness. One of the reasons I will lose pikmin besides enemies is because of one of the new features. There will be piles of glass or pot fragments that you need to use to make bridges. you tell your pikmin to gather from it and they will bring it like ants to the bridge, and then instead of staying at the bridge will return to the gather point, which is sometimes far away. I have made the mistake of telling them to gather and then forgetting about them. This goes the same for Grapes, it is the only fruit so far I have seen that they return tot he fruit's spawning point after delivering it tot he ship.So far I have lost over 120 pikmin in 15 days, but by the same token, I also have over 150 of each color stored away. Every enemy you kill including bosses can be brought back to your ship to make more pikmin. The color created is determined by the pikmin carrying the object. Whichever there are more of will be the color made. So if you tell 5 rock and 2 blue to carry something back, Rock pikmin will be created. The color will be displayed on the number above the item as they carry it.The Pikmin AI in general, isn't bad. When they are following you or bringing an item somewhere they will follow a smart path and won't walk into water or something. however when they are called by the whistle to you, they for some reason forget everything intelligent. They will walk through water (Which kills all but blue) to get to you, the will walk against the wall instead of up a ramp etc... it's weird. But once you know they will do that it's easy to plan around it. There are a few other functions you have, the spray you get increases their attack power for a short time, and the dodge whistle allows you and your squad to roll to the left or the right to avoid an attack. I did however roll into water once.... it wasn't pretty.The boss fights are awesome, big things want to kill you and it's fun and challenging to fight them. The normal enemies are also well done, each has their own life and behavior, strengths and weaknesses etc... that you have to find in order to defeat them. A new feature in the game is the ability to lock on to a target, and tell your pikmin to attack it all at once. There is a slight issue with this though as the button for all out attack while locked on is the same for split up, meaning all your pikmin split into colored groups and stand there. Make SURE you are locked on before doing so... I lost a boss fight cause I hit the button by accident and all of my rock pikmin died, and I needed them.Multiplayer:I haven't played them yet but there are other modes apart from story. There is Mission mode which features mini-missions to collect all the items by a certain time. This can be done alone or in co-op mode (split screen only).There is another mode I believe it's called Bingo Bananza or something like that, it's a competitive split screen multiplayer mode to see who can get the most fruit. I imagine they play very similarly to the main game in controls and function though.Summary:All in all I think it's a great game, simple, relaxing, and fun. It is my first Pikmin game and I am not Disappointed.+ Lots of fruit to collect and not always easy to get either+ Collecting Different types of Pikmin is fun+ The Wii-Mote controls are perfect and is IMO the way to go+ Beautiful HD Landscape with no Framerate loss, always a plus in my book+ The time per day may be limiting but at the same time it adds a sense of urgency without being stressful+ Music and sound effects are cute and they work perfectly for a game like this+ Fun and challenging boss fights- Bad Gamepad controls are bad, if you don't have a Wii-Mote you would have to buy one and they aren't cheap sadly.- The 3 Pilots are less alive than the rest of the game- Hardcore gamers will most likely want to stay away from this game- Pikmin are sometimes intelligent, then other times not so much- Why can't the pilots step over a root or climb up a ledge shorter than they are. If they can throw their friends they certainly have the strength for a tiny climbIs it worth 60$? I would say yes, if you like this kind of game. It's about 12 hours long for a story play through, at least 40 hours to 100% the game not including multiplayer anythingIs it worth buying a Wii-U? I say probably not, however my friend is buying a Wii-U for this game so it is to some!I'm sure I missed some things here but, in the end...I give the game 8.5  out of 10. Great game, but not perfect.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2013"}

Therefore, in this review, I'm gonna focus on my own experience and highlights with the game.In this open world sandbox game, it's easy to get pulled into pirating the waters hours after hours in the side quests and random events. There are tons of main story missions to complete. However, more often than not, I've found myself doing more random stuff, and actually enjoy doing so. I recall having the same satisfying feeling when I played Red Dead Redemption.I don't feel actions being repetitive at all. There are a huge variety of things you can do - scaling over rooftops, pirating the open waters, hunting sharks, etc.The control are intuitive and easy to learn, allowing the player to quickly engage in the gameplay, than to fight the controls.Visuals are improved over the previous installments. Score is excellent and immersive. The graphics is great on the PS3 but much better on the PS4 version. Having said that, it doesn't distract me a bit to play on the PS3.I spent over 10 hours on the main missions and another 20 hours on the side missions, and I haven't completed the game yet.It's nice that they included a voucher to upgrade to the PS4 version as a digital download for $10 (expiring end of Jan '04).

That hurt Capcom!!","reviewText":"Devil May Cry 2 was one of the most anticipated games of 2003 for me.  Needless to say, I am dissapointed.  Where the first game was extremely cool and fun, the second is a shadow of it's prequel.  Where to begin:Graphics: While this sequel looks better, the backgrounds are boring and see uninspired compared to the first.  They really make no sense, and seem like they were just looking for some generic looking open areas for you to fight in.Gameplay: Ouch, this really hurt.  Now Dante can run up walls and flip off them Matrix style and dive bomb enemies with both guns first.  Sounds cool.  Looks cool.  But in realty, they are quite useless.  Gone are the cool moves you could perform with your sword, to rack up that style meter. Now, you will be lucky to not use Stinger and fly your enemy across the screen ending your combo.  Dissapointing.  You also get to use Lucia, a second female character on a second disc, but this seems more like an afterthought...her missions are boring.Story: Ok, this is an action game so story shouldn't count right?  Well, in case it does for you, don't bother because there is none, and what is there makes no real sense.  Seriously, this game makes very little sense.Misc:  The game is easy.  Ridiculously easy.  I didn't die once.  I didn't come close to dying once.  I never used a single healing item.  In fact, I never used a SINGLE item in the entire game.  Unbalanced indeed.  You can now basiclly use Ebony and Ivory to shoot everything and never get shot, and now you don't evenm have to hold the R button to draw them.  Good for people who never played games before.  Bad for fans like me.  I played without using the guns, and had the same problem.  Just too easy.The list could go on about how the sum of the parts in DMC2 just don't add up, but I never thought I'd be blasting a Capcom game. Even the menus are boring...in the first, when you switched weapons, there was an animated image of that weapon.  Now there's nothing.  It is fun for a little while, but it's boring compared to the first game. I wanted to like this game, believe me. Pick up the original which is now a Greatest Hits title.

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

In human form, she fights with a staff or a spear, allowing her to fend off multiple attackers while leaping in and out of the fray. In her fiery incarnation, she can hurl bolts of flame at ranged targets, flood areas with heat and fire, or inflict searing wounds that injure her foes over time.KatarinaKatarina is the daughter of a Legion commander and a Lescanzi witch. Her mother's people are nomads and wanderers, skilled in both warfare and magic, Katarina has been trained in their ways. At long range, she fights with ensorcelled bullets and deadly curses. When foes get close, they fare no better, as they come face-to-muzzle with her pistol and her shotgun &ndash; or perhaps the jaws of her faithful black hound. Katarina is mischievous and unpredictable, but she is also devoted to the Legion's cause...ReinhartReinhart descended from a great line of Legion mages, but he spent most of his life in Stonebridge, studying magic at the Collegium. As a scholar of arcane magic, Reinhart bends the forces of creation and destruction to his will. He can channel Dynamic magic through his gauntlet, shocking or stunning his foes. Or he can use Entropic magic to warp time and space, destroying large numbers of enemies from afar. Reinhart is known for his unconventional thinking and innovative magical techniques...and for his eccentricity, too.","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"I want to love this game...","reviewText":"I was a big fan of Square/Enix until the 7th generation of video game consoles came out. They're starting to fall apart for some reason, and it's kind of sad. This game is no exception. Don't get me wrong, it is beautiful: the landscapes, the character models, the dungeons are all fantastically detailed. However, that's where its wonderful qualities fall away.The story is neat, but the game isn't story-driven. There is a lot of dialog to listen to and literature to read through in the game, which would make you think that it's story-driven, but that isn't the case. There's an unusual amount of repetition, and the characters tend to drone on far too long about the current topic hammering in some point you already got a while ago. And a lot of the dialog is delivered with stiff, unfeeling characterization by the voice actors, which leaves the characters themselves unmemorable. This is a shame, since you spend about 10% of the game listening to these robots babble. You can, however, skip through the conversations. While they're meant to spur on the next bit of action, which where the meat of the game actually exists, the game has nailed the definition of the word \"linear\" so you really don't need to pay attention to the rambling to get from the beginning to the end without missing anything. Unfortunately, that just doesn't take that much time.The entire game can be played through in about 10 hours, or ~15 if you have the DLC. At least, that number is what the final save will say, and it's a complete lie which I will get to later. However, it's still an overall small number of hours which is a boon since you have to play through at least 4 times to get all of the achievements. I'm a perfectionist and a completionist, but I hate when games force multiple playthroughs, especially in games like this and Mass Effect where playing through with a different character or class has a neglible effect on the story. Halfway through the second playthrough it. Just. Gets. Boring. Fortunately, you don't have to listen to all of the dialog each time but you can't just skip through a scene. You have to make choices, despite the fact that not a single one of them has any bearing whatsoever on the gameplay itself. Some of the choices will affect the ending you get, but big whoop. You can skip through the speech with the X button to get to the next choice selection screen, reducing your playthrough to about 8.5 hours of mostly travelling and fighting. That would be great if that part - the very meat of the game - didn't suck.Combat is atrocious. The skills are neat, the attacks are well-animated, and the dodge and block mechanics are pretty good for what they are. Most of the game, you're fighting somewhat weak enemies. Two or three here, four or five there. However, every now and then the game will throw a barage of enemies at you that will do this incredibly annoying thing where, even on the easiest setting, they can drain your health bar in about .75s. That's 3/4 of a single second, and it is NOT an exaggeration. Less than one second and you're dead. On easy. Normal? .5s. Hard? .25s. There are enmies at the end of the game who can kill you with a single hit despite a full health bar. This results in a game of dodge and strike that simply isn't fun. The concept of tactics flies right out the window once you get about 20% of the way into the game (less if you're playing on hard, which you have to, of course, to get all the achievements). In a lot of games, blocking is actually useful. Not so much in this one: you need a high 'block' stat on your items in order to actually mitigate any damage your character receives, but nothing with a high block valyes comes in a damage-dealing flavor as well. To boot, the block value aren't really worth it since all of your equipment rarely totals more than 100 points of blocking but enemies dish out >1000 points of damage at a time. So you have to really on high attack values and lots of dodging. You just have to jump around like an idiot and strike whenever you happen to land near an enemy that, for whatever reason, can't attack you. Translated: this game is a glorified button-masher. Combat is little more than boring and repetitve game of hop-around that's useful against normal enemies, but not so much against the bosses.I don't like it when games don't prepare the player for boss battles. It is NOT a pleasant surprise when you whoop your way through a bunch of mid-powered cronies to find out the area boss is 5x more powerful, which happens to be 4x more powerful than you. This games makes that into a joke. Bosses are easily 10x more powerful than the mobs leading up to them, who can already kill you while you blink, and some boss battles (Jeyne Kessinder and the final battle) add unstoppable super-powered moves. Jeyne has a leap-attack that you can't block, can't dodge, and which tracks you, so no matter where you were when she started the move and where you are when it ends, she still hits you and it will always kill you. The final boss has an attack that produces a STREAM of little orbs each one of which can take ~80% of a full health bar WHEN BLOCKING and which also will track you, quickly, no matter how much you dodge. That is to say, unless you are the Supreme Button Commander of the Universe, you WILL die when facing these bosses. You might say that most games mitigate damage-dealing enemies by giving the player decent armor and some high-powered weapons of their own, but I'd answer that this game isn't one of them.Every now and then you'll find a decent weapon or piece of armor that has a handful of good perks, but it's often something that would have been most useful several levels earlier. With the DLC, you at least get to enchant your items at any point in the game, but it's expensive and so not useful until the very, very end when you're about to go up against the final boss and have your final set of equipment. The items they sell to you in the last store will spruce up your attacks for the final fight, but most of them literally have 0 defense. That's right: the game gives you absolutely no defense as you go up against a boss that can already kill you outright with a single shot that WILL connect no matter what you do. The problem is, even if you skip out on the super-powered effects of the items to keep whatever high defense you already have, you're still going to be used a mop because the bosses are just that strong. So in a game where enemies drop stuff constantly, the treasure table is just dull, boring, and ultimately useless. Sure, you'll need the most powerful weapons and armor that you can find if you hope to win the battles, but only because you need to output damage as fast as possible while you're still on your feet. Your defense scores won't matter: the only thing that can save you is your companion(s), who can revive you when you die.Which leads me to the AI itself. This is another game like Mass Effect where you have a little helper following you around that has a great set of skills that you've invested in throughout the game and which they use like the most idiotic piece of trash in the world. In Mass Effect, your party members refuse to unload clips into enmies, jump out of cover despite low health bars and no shields, and use skills incredibly infrequently, which is about as unhelpful as it can get. Or so I thought. In Dungeon Siege III, if your AI-controlled buddy uses a skill during a fight, count yourself lucky. If you get killed and they actually disengage to come over and revive you before getting themselves killed and resulting in a game-over, count yourself super-lucky. If they actually attack more than once every 3 or 4 seconds (whereas the player will be attacking 3 or 4 times PER second) you are the luckiest person to ever play the game. I would say the AI is utterly useless, but it really is the only thing that keeps the game going when you get killed. The problem is that you have to play through a scene several times before the AI will actually manage to disengage the enemy and revive you in an order that allows you to live through it. This means that, despite the fact that your save at the end of the game will say something between 8 and 12 hours, you've probably actually put in upwards of 20. This extra overhead is just in terms of how many times you'll have to play the ridiculously long boss battles where you die several times and have to rely on getting superduperstupid lucky with the idiotic AI reviving you. The number you see at the end of the game is what it would have cost you to play through perfectly without dying once. That, in and of itself, would be worthy of the title \"achievement\".The only other aspect of the game is the multiplayer. Multiplayer, especially with all 4 characters in use, can make the boss fights go just a little better than normal. However, for the most part it really dulls the game. In single player, you have to rely on selling items to generate money that you use at the end of the game to buy better equipment for the main character and maybe your favorite sidekick. Note this: if you do play this game, save your gold and don't ever buy anything until the very, very end of the game, because everything is replaceable and will be replaced quite quickly, which wastes any funds you may have spent. The final store is quite expensive, and you will want to get almost everything in it, which is really hard to do unless you haven't bought a single thing up to then. However, in multiplayer the other players need equipment too, which means you can't sell things willy nilly which results in your funds being spread thin. The good thing is, you can turn multiplayer on at any point, so if you're having a hard time with a boss you can open your game and get some random help. Which is also a negative point: unless you happen to have 3 friends with the exact same life schedule as you who enjoy RPGs, you're not likely to play with anybody you know. You'll have to allow the game to assign random strangers and this always results in your party having some moron who spends most of the time running into a wall instead of being useful. It really sucks that you have to play multiplayer to get certain achievements because it forces you to rely on a group of other people to do the right thing. I don't mind multiplayer, but I prefer it to stand on its own merits rather than get in the way of actually enjoying and completing a game.I would love to love this game. The story is neat, but too short. The combat system is neat, but combat itself sucks. The voice acting is dull and stiff. Multiplayer is bland but sometimes helpful. The only thing great about it is that the art really is gorgeous.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2012"}

Unfortuneately, the rest of the game is a major let-down. It never again reaches the graphic heights of that sequence nor does it have any other ideas which feel as compelling and original.Compared to Kratos' two prior quests, this one feels oddly aimless and uneventful. There are very few moments of surpise and awe like in those games, instead things become rather dull and predictable with kratos hacking his way through a series of generic faux classical environments. The story is a complete mess of inconsistencies, attrocious dialouge, and convoluted plotting. It is mind-boggling that a game of this stature has a script this bad.* spoiler warning ****At the end of the game it is revealed that the power that has driven Kratos all along was \"hope\", and that hope is \"what we fight with when we have nothing else.\" I almost gagged when I heard that. Not only is it the height of banality, but it also completely contradicts everything that has been established about this character.***/spoiler ******So in conclusion this is a graphically impressive but largely uninspired installment in the god of war series.

I still felt constricted in GTA4, but in SR2, you can really do as much or as little as you one.  Linearity is pretty much gone, and I found myself this time around playing a lot more of the respect missions because they were fun, not tedious like many in SR1. The depth of Stillwater is massive, and now you dont just drive around the surface, but navigate miles of caverns, oceans, and the like in your quests.  Having solved it, I am aware that there is still a chunk of the land I havent even seen yet.

The graphics are top notch and the gameplay is really good.  The little details in guns and when you fire the barrel gets red or just the amount of textures in the background.  Every thing in this game just feels a lot bigger.  I was kind of disappointed by only I think two missions took place above ground and the rest was below.  I like the open feeling of the outdoor environments over the not so much open feeling of the underground settings though they are still pretty open.  I did like the way when you fire your weapon it feels more controlled than having shots going everywhere when you aim. I for some reason didn't like that in the 1st game along with blind firing.  Everything graphically is very nicely done and the sound design is great.  I think everyone should play just to see the good job that was done on the environments.  Single player took me about 10 hours I think and I enjoyed just about all of it.  It felt nice to be back in playing Gears of War universe and I think thats why most people like this one.Multiplayer is where this game takes off from co op to horde mode there is something to keep the fans there.  Seemed to me that when they made multiplayer they intended it to be for the core Gears of War gamers who will be there playing long after people have stopped.  Horde mode was far by my favorite as long as you can find people to watch your back.  I do wish it didn't take about 3 to 5 minutes to find a game but thats o.k. though it can be annoying.The games single player did feel more like an expansion pack than a direct sequel to me.  The reason I gave this game four stars is that though it has great features it just wasn't enough to result in me buying it.  I rented it simply b/c I had a choice of games to get with my budget and this game I found just didn't warrant a buy since the games I bought were better in my mind (not to say that it got 4 star b/c of my budget just didn't like it above others).

Also the layout is difficult especially while in the cars.  Shield should always be available in my opinion but there is only one item available a a time so it is very difficult to switch weapons while you are being trounced.  Hence the shield necessity.  You have to switch from shield to a offensive weapon but the shield does not last very long so by the time you switch to an offensive weapon it is almost time to use another shield.  Also the shield count goes down at least 2 at a time when you only press it once.  Sometimes the guns simply do not fire and not because of ammo depletion.  Same problem with melee as it simply does not respond.  It is not my control since it works fine for all other games.  Despite these issues I still finished the game but considered  it too problematic to bother using the codes for more content.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2011"}

Ion Storm was founded by John Romero and Tom Hall, the minds behind Doom.  Doom was, and probably still is,  the most widely known game in the FPS genre.  With its creators breaking off from ID software to form their own company, all eyes were already on Ion Storm from the very beginning.  The company had 2 branches: One in Austin, and one in Dallas.  The Dallas branch of Ion Storm spent years working on the game Daikatana.  Due to the amount of publicity the company and their game were receiving, Daikatana was highly anticipated by many gamers, who were champing at the bit to get their hands on what promised to be the best game ever made.  However, due in part to the excessively long development time (for the day), and the frustratingly wonky AI, Daikatana was finally released to painfully bad reviews all around.  The game ended up selling very poorly, and was directly responsible for the both the closing of the Dallas IS branch, and for the departure of Romero and Hall from the company.Daikatana should have been the death of Ion Storm, and surely would have been if it hadn't been for what was happening in the Austin branch.  About the same time Daikatana was released, Ion Storm Austin completed work on and released a little known game called Deus Ex.  Deus Ex was a mix of FPS and RPG, which played like an interactive \"choose your own adventure\" sci-fi novel. Unlike Daikatana, Deus Ex was released to critical acclaim, and went on to sell very well.  It even won 2000s Game of the Year award.  Deus Ex singlehandedly saved the should-be-ruined Ion Storm from collapse.Fast forward 3 years.  News of Deus Ex 2 comes.  Once again, in what can only be a cruel act of fate, Ion Storm was plagued with  a long development process, as well as the attention and anticipation of gamers everywhere.  You know where this is going, right?  The reviews on this site should deem it unnecessary for me to describe what happened when Invisible War was released.  I'll just say that it was universally panned, and die-hard fans of Deus Ex were, almost without exception, entirely disappointed with the game.  Shortly after DX2 was released, Ion Storm released another highly anticipated game, Thief III.  While not as critically panned as DX2, the game didn't sell very well, and was plagued with many of the same issues that DX2 apparently suffered from.As a result, Eidos, Ion Storm's parent company, decided to close the doors at Ion Storm forever.What should have been a return to greatness ended up being the end for one of the most ambitious and talented game development companies in the world.Personally, I like DX2.  It's a bit smaller than the first game, and the story doesn't seem as inspired, but it's still a couple of steps above your average gaming fare.  There is a lot of freedom to enjoy yourself in this game, and,  like the first game, you can choose what type of person you will be.  You can chose to be a diplomat, a hardcore killer, or anything in between.  The only thing that I don't like about this game is the size of the play areas.  At times, the buildings are so tiny, you can't even move without bumping into something.  Other than that, the game is worthy of the Deus Ex name, in my opinion.  Even if it lacks something that the first game had, it is still worth checking out - ESPECIALLY at this price.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXLQC","description":"","reviewerName":"Tierra12 \"Tierra12\"","summary":"The next phase in the evolution of the Resident Evil series","reviewText":"I am a long time fan of the Resident Evil (RE) game series.  I have been playing this series since  its launch in 1996 on the Playstation.  I own and have played all of the games in the main series:  RE 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Code Veronica and the Remake.  I have also played a number of the side games:  Outbreak , Outbreak File #2, the Umbrella Chronicles, and Operation Raccoon City.  I have been with the RE series for 16 years even when it began to become stale and repetitive beginning with RE3 and majority of the games that followed ( i.e. Outbreak,  Outbreak File #2, 0, and the Remake).  These RE games did nothing to advance the storyline or improve the gameplay and only served to continue the series lack of new ideas and innovations.  All of this changed with the release of RE4 in 2005.RE 4 provided a brilliant new direction for the series.  RE4 finally moved the story forward.  RE4 introduced precision shooting mechanics, improved the game controls, fixed the inventory system, created a better save system, featured some of the most exciting boss battles in the entire series, had smarter enemy/friendly AI, smooth transitions between cut scenes and game play, introduced the over-the shoulder perspective, and blended action and horror seamlessly.RE5 for the most part took the if it ain't broke don't fix it approach this meant that this game kept majority of the elements that were introduced in RE4 and only made one significant change and that was adding the co-op feature.  The problem Capcom faced by incorporating the same game play mechanics that were so revolutionary in 2005 in 2009 was that all of the  things that were innovative in RE4 were no longer fresh especially since a lot of  Westerner game developers were churning out so many games that had surpassed all of the things RE4 introduced and RE5 repeated.Smartly the game developers at Capcom realized that if the RE series was going to survive the massive competition then another evolution had to take place. This brings us to Resident Evil 6 (RE6).  This is the first game in the RE main series that allows characters to do something as basic as being able to walk and shoot, reload and walk, sprint, roll, slide, and perform melee attacks without waiting to be prompted to do so.  This may not sound like much since this is the most basic sort of character movements found in most games, but for the RE series these movements are both revolutionary and a welcome change.RE6 features an improved inventory system when compared to previous installments of the series.  It is now much easier to mix herbs and use healing items than it was in previous RE games.  It's also easier to tell how much ammo you have  which is useful information to have during areas with heavy enemies and boss fights.In order to make RE6 even better the game developers took a look at a bad trend in modern gaming.  This trend they looked at was the short single player campaigns a lot of modern games have since a lot of developers spend most of their time developing the multiplayer campaigns and as a result neglect the single player campaigns.  Resident Evil 6 addressed this horrible trend by featuring 4 campaigns that can be played in single player mode each ranging in length from 7 to 9 hours giving gamers more game for their buck.RE6 made changes most will appreciate regarding the co-op.  In the single player mode your partner has unlimited ammo.  Gamers will not have to fight over healing items either since your co-op partner doesn't need health items; this is a good thing -- now gamers will not have to worry about their AI controlled partner burning through ammo or health items.  Also if  you are injured you can now maneuver (shoot, roll, and crawl) out of harm's way unlike in RE5 where you had to try to slow walk away from enemies until your partner healed you since you couldn't shoot or do much else outside of hoping the enemies wouldn't kill you before your partner healed you.In addition, RE 6 offers a great deal of replay value as well.  Players can play 3 of the 4 campaigns as Leon Kennedy, Chris Redfield, Jake Muller, or their partners (Sherry Birkin, Helena Harper, and Piers Nivans).  Playing as \"the partner\" offers a refreshing way to the play the game since the partners have different things that they'll have to do.  The partners also have different abilities.  These things together offer both a strong and new game play experience.Long time RE fans may be pleased to see the return of Sherry Birkin (the defenseless, 12-year old girl introduced in RE2) especially since so many die-hard RE fans have speculated about her fate for years.  Now she's back as a capable adult DSO agent who is partnered with Albert Wesker's illegitimate son Jake Muller this makes for an intriguing partnership especially since Sherry's father (William) and Jake's father (Wesker) were close friends and rivals who worked for the Umbrella Corporation.  William and Wesker are also some of the series most popular/memorable antagonist so it's nice to see their children working together and leaving making their mark on the series.RE 6 also places the most popular male characters Chris Redfield and Leon Kennedy in the same game which is something most fans have wanted to see happen for years.  Even though the two men have 2 separate campaigns and  don't work together in  a single campaign which is slightly disappointing  their stories are intertwined in a meaningful way.  It is also just a great pleasure to have the 2 as main characters in the same game.In closing I highly recommend RE6 for RE fans, zombie fans, 3rd person shooter fans, and action/adventure game fans.  There's definitely something for every gamer in this group.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2012"}

I have limited space, so the idea of retiring my Playstation 2 without losing games sounded great.After using the Playstation 3 for a little over a year now, the console has been great.  Ive never been able to enjoy a console quite like the Playstation 3.Here are some of the things I like about it:- This console has really become my media center. Ive enjoyed playing back (with the separate remote) a huge portion of my music library, wedding photos, and honeymoon photos, onto this thing. Using either one of the USB ports or one of many card readers to load media onto the Playstation 3 is a breeze.- Im enjoying playing for free online - something I was accustomed to only on my PC, which is seeing age.- The Playstation Network is easy to browse for free game demos and videos.  The majority of my hard drive is full of demos right now.- The bluetooth controller is great and is the same feel-good shape of the PS2 controller.- Being able to play my old library of games was great.  I think the backwards compatibility of the PS2 is what helped sell a lot of those consoles and give the Xbox a run for its money.  To me, Sony is thanking its loyal customers by having this feature.  Unlike, for example, when the Super Nintendo would not play regular Nintendo games. They could have made the cartidges a similar shape and chose not to.I wanted both a Blu-Ray player and a gaming system to play gems like Uncharted: Drake's Fortune.  The price is acceptable because I would have purchased two separate pieces of hardware and probably paid more if the technology was not already included in the PS3. Throw in a game like Metal Gear 4 and this is a solid buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2009"}

You guys can put them in order if youd like, but it's clear as day to me that MW,MW2,and B3 are all superior to any of these games.I'm loving B3 it's a great game, on top of that the graphics are current unlike MW3 crayola box rendition.  Once I learn how to use these vehicles properly in B3 the game is going to be a 10/10.The old MW2 slick menus that they use on MW3 and the sharp looking text make the game look beter than it really is.  I'm clearly in the minority the threads are filled with love, but I expect the current version to be better than the last as a general rule and it isn't here IMO.MW3's SP was fun, an IW rendered SP, the graphics are a 9 in the SP, but with Sledgehammer handling the MP they came out a 7 in my book. Over all I'd give the game as a whole an 8 because of the package; co-op, spec ops, campaign, and a ton of options and game modes.If you only like instant action kill or die on small maps, then yea I get it MW is your thing, otherwise I really think you should try B3 it's light years better than ther B3 Alpha that they released to the public a few months ago, it's a complete polished game now.Honestly MW3 reminds me more of Uncharted 3 MP than it does any previous MW game. It's about gunplay they say, but what they are really saying is it's going to be tighter, smaller and faster than ever before, drink some coffee and spray and prey cuz you have little time to use tactics.I can sit there and invest my time with MW3 and have hours of fun and even more hours of frustration because of what MW3 is, but I'd rather have a blast in B3 where it's more about the game, and the objectives, and using teamwork, and having your entire buildout to your disposal playing in an adult arean.  I won't miss MW3's singers, rappers, distorted music, and families yelling at each other in the background as their child plays, and the entire community not worrying about objectives. Those things I won't miss.Treyarchs \"B\" games I get, they are the \"B\" team, but when IW/Sledge group, the A team, puts out a \"B\" game, Houston, we have a problem.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2011"}

But it isn't without it's flaws, it's certainly a good looking game but certain areas look really clunking as if someone was coloring with crayons. The track variations are really cool, I love the fact that you can hire a driver to earn money for you so all you have to do is set up the game let him drive and while you watch some Tv. Every time you level up you receive a fresh new car. The upgrading/tuning system is very good and it can change the sound of the engine. The soundtrack to the game is one of the best I have heard for a racing game. I hate that in split-screen/arcade play you only have a select number of cars to choose from, although you can add more cars by playing single player and add them to your favorites. The game can have some frame rate issues, though aside from load screens that's really the only technical issue.Overall I recommend this game it has a good amount of flaws but its a game to where the more amount of time you put into it the much more enjoyable it gets.But again Sony is taking this game offline soon so there's that.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2014"}

But I do have major issues with its ergonomics. For almost 20 years now, ever since the introduction of the first Dualshock, dual analog controllers have more or less stuck to that basic design. Specifically, I'm referring to the right analog stick being *below* the four face buttons. Even the Wii Classic Controller stuck to the established design philosophy. This is the first controller I've seen in all these years that does the reverse, puts the buttons below the stick. Reaching down for the buttons instead of up causes a bizarre sensation for me... there are moments where it almost feels like I'm playing video games for the first time. And it's not just that the buttons are not where I expect them, it also feels like buttons were placed too far from the stick. I feel like I'm having to reach much further than necessary for the B and Y buttons. I usually have no problem adapting to a new controller, but this one is driving me up the wall.I also dislike that the triggers aren't proper triggers. They have no \"play\" when you squeeze them. They just softly click the same as the other buttons.I wanted to use a \"regular\" controller to play games like AC3, Bayonetta 2, etc. because I thought it would feel more comfortable than the Gamepad. But this actually feels less comfortable.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2014"}

In the heat of the attack, Fayt is separated from his family and Sophia, and he begins an emotional quest into the unknown to find his loved ones. Along his journey, he gets caught up in the war of an uncharted planet, but in the end, he learns the terrible untold secret about the world and himself.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"A shining star in a sea of lackluster RPG's","reviewText":"Most of the RPG's lately aren't exactly great. While you do have certain games that are great, you get average ones that are ok for awhile then they just get old. I'm one of the few that actually didn't like the new Shadow Hearts(check many game sites, they praise it to death), Star Ocean was a lot funner and more interesting.Fayt and his childhood friend are vacationing on a planet called Hyda IV, a beautiful resort planet. He spends all his time playing battle simulators rather than on a beautiful beach with a young girl in a bikini but okay. The planet is under attack by a race called the Vendeeni and they escape but he's separated from his parents and Sophia. He finally ends up on Elicoor II, a Renaissance Era-like planet that has 2 warring nations: Airyglyph and Aquaria. Fayt and some friends become involved in the war and finds out more than he wanted.The graphics to me are more colorful than Shadow Hearts II but not as sharp as FFX. It reminds me of Xenosaga in it's look. The characters(especially the women) look kind of the same with their bug eyes. The FMV's are great to look at though.The music is so-so. Some have great Celtic type music or folk while others are these horrible rock/metal things. In dungeons, rather than eerie music or calm music, you have these awful...things. The voice acting is about 2/3rd's good. There's always some overacting or bad timing, while some voices like Clair, Albel or Maria fit while others like Farleen do not.The gameplay is where it really shines though. Battles are in real-time rather than turned based like Kingdom Hearts but easier to see and you hit 2 buttons for light or hard hits while being able to do special moves. If you want to switch characters, just one press of a button switches to another party member while the one you had goes on Autopilot and the computer controls it. Sometimes I noticed that Fayt just stood there if I switched characters though. One nice change is going to a menu stops the battle so you could get a potion(they're berries actually) while in Kingdom Hearts you had to do it all in the fight which gave the opponent opportunity to hit you.The Item Creation system(like the Synthesis in Final Fantasy VIII or in Star Ocean 2) is so complicated chances are you won't bother with it. Yet this is where you get all the best weapons. Go figure. The dungeons here are HUGE. Chances are you've cleared 2-3 entire floors yet you've only gotten 30% of the map done(you start with a small portion of the map visible but moving around allows you to see more of it with a percentage meter at the bottom telling you how much of it is visible). While this makes the game challenging, it's also hard to go back and re-stock on items if you're running out.Despite the creation system, challenge and voice acting/music, it's an incredibly interesting game that is easy to get into.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2004"}

Nevertheless, during Sega's payoff era for the Genesis, it really did break so much ground, it was the highlight of their video game systems. Unfortunately, Sega was never able to capatalize after the Genesis. That is unfortunate that Sega now only makes video games for other systems. As for their mascot, Sonic The Hedgehog, he still lives on with so many systems now highlighting the blue speed demon is just amazing. Since 1991, Sonic The Hedgehog has become as popular as other legendary mascots including Mario, and Zelda. But the games Sonic was featured in, even brought more challenge than anywhere else.The Sonic Mega Collection Plus, is a collection of over a dozen video games, unlockable and classic from the Genesis era, and the Sega handheld Game Gear era. The collection includes so many great classics including Sonic 1, 2, and 3, as well as other successors like Sonic 3D Blast. The collection goes further by including Sonic's Game Gear games like Sonic Chaos, Sonic Blast, and the mad dash racing game, Sonic Drift 2. The games have been remastered beautifully, but can be very difficult during some gamers, especially for anybody who hasn't expereinced the Genesis era. The game collection does fair very well, especially after the triumph, of the original Sonic Mega Collection for the Nintendo's Gamecube.Sonic Mega Collection Plus is a great video game compilation for the Playstation 2. If you have the Gamecube, and bought the Sonic Mega Collection for the Gamecube, than it really isn't worth the money, unless you consider the Game Gear games here.

Der","summary":"I love this game!","reviewText":"This game is awesome! I played it all the way through so many times. There are 4 difficult setting for story mode: Easy, Normal, Veteran, and Professional. The story is great. Some people might not like it because it doesn't relate too much to the older RE story lines, but I liked it. I like how this is the first RE game to give you an CO-OP option and you and a friend can play the story mode together.I like the controls for this game. It uses 3rd person view over the shoulder action. The button lay out is similar to RE 4 and if you played that you be right at home with this game.The graphics are amazing! Everything looks so real and detailed. The sound is great too. The sound isn't based on scary sense this game is more action pack now, but I like it because everything is supposed to be a faster peace and you need the audio clues to play well.What I like most about this game is the mini game, Mercenaries, after you beat the game. In mercenaries you play a survive horror match, where the goal is to kill as many people as possible with the limited time you get. You can play solo matches o team up with a friend and play together. At the beginning of each match, you start off with 3 minutes and you can find more time capsules and break them for more time to be added. There are 150 enemies limit on each map. (But, it is pretty hard to kill all 150 enemies. Especially on solo mode.)If you kill all the 150 enemies and still have time left on the clock then that time will be added to your score. There are 8 maps in total. You have to earn each map with a high letter grade to move on to the next map. Also, if you get a high level grade you earn more characters to use in the game. To me, this mini game is more fun than the actually story mode. lolThere has been a great additional DLC that came out after called RE Reunion.

The introduction of superpowers is a welcome addition to the genre this side of INFAMOUS and [PROTOTYPE], and makes the world of the Saints Row series that much more over-the-top. Basically, I haven't had this much fun since SAINTS ROW THE THIRD, so going forward with this review, know that I really liked this game and would most definitely recommend it to fans of the series and superhero games in general.But! In a lot of ways, SRIV doesn't do a whole lot to push the series forward, which disappoints me to say. When people responded so positively to the sailing sections of ASSASSIN'S CREED III, Ubisoft built an entire game around that aspect. Conversely, when people responded so positively to the superpower aspects of SR THE THIRD's DLC pack, Volition didn't necessarily build an entire game around that aspect as much as they rebuilt SR THE THIRD. New story, new abilities, new customization, but we're still pretty much in the same old Steelport, which means a lot of the old criticisms still remain.Firstly, Steelport itself. Looking back at SAINTS ROW 2, Stilwater was one of the finest open-world cities I've even had the pleasure of playing through. The city felt alive, with public transit systems, unique interior locations to explore, distinctive districts, gang territories. I loved Stilwater more than Liberty City, and would compare it favorably to San Andreas. Steelport, by contrast, feels very homogeneous. Every place looks like everywhere else, and a lot of the character Stilwater had is just missing. There are train tracks, but the trains don't run. There's an airport, but the planes don't move. There are rivers, but no water traffic. In SRIV, you don't even have your cribs anymore.Being a holdover from the last game, Steelport wasn't originally built with superpowers in mind. There have been some alterations here and there, but by and large the city itself inhibits a lot of the freeflow movement the game is trying to encourage. I can't tell you how many times I tried wall-running, only to get blocked by an overhang, or a fire escape, or other little architectural values. Once you level up your super jump, things aren't as much of a problem, but Steelport still isn't on the same level as either of the worlds from the aforementioned INFAMOUS or [PROTOTYPE], where there's very little to get in your way.Customization is still largely unchanged from the last game, which may once again disappoint fans of SAINTS ROW 2. In my mind, it's a shame we can't see the same level of detail from SR2, but the new system is still enjoyable. The unfortunate thing is that it seems like not enough effort went into creating new clothing/character customization options. With a few exceptions, everything that was available in SRTT is still here, but it seems as though only a percentage of new options were added. For me, the customization element of the series has always been a highlight. It's what set it apart from GTA and other sandbox games of that type. The lack of improvement or additions in that area is more than a little disappointing, as is the startling amount of items that were set aside to be sold as DLC add-ons.The story. This is where I'm the most conflicted, because it's every bit as entertaining as what we experienced in SRTT, albeit with a noticeably shorter running time. The humor is still there, so are most of the old characters, and the series' new commitment to going as over-the-top as possible is still in full swing. My conflict with the story, besides its diminished length, is that not a whole lot happens. The first couple hours are an explosion of exciting set pieces, fun and unique missions, and character interactions. After that, everything tones down significantly, including the whole President of the United States angle, which peters out fairly early. There are fewer and fewer cutscenes, which are replaced in favor of voice-over videos that set up the mission and let you have at it.It also doesn't help that the crew is separated for most of the game, so interaction is sparse.In its mandate to parody the Mass Effect series, which goes over well most of the time, you're expected to go out on loyalty missions to bond with your crew. Some of these are well done, with extreme props to the side-scroller/beat-'em-up mission that had me absolutely cracking up. Outside of a few exceptions, SRIV spends a lot of its story trying to recapture the magic of SRTT. Pretty much everything from the last game comes around again, and even some of the standout set pieces from SRIV itself are reused every now and then to the point where you get the sense that you're doing the same few things over and over again. Even the characters themselves make a few jokes about how, \"Hey, this looks familiar\" or \"How come all the quests start from the same bar?\" It's odd when even the developers are acknowledging repetition.Another one of my big criticisms from SRTT was how Volition folded many of the game's activities into the story as if they were main quests. I didn't like it then and I really don't like it now. Going forward, I hope Volition keeps the game's activities out of the story and, if anything, keeps them restricted to sidequests if they absolutely have to tie them in somehow. All they do is serve to water down the story.And this last point might be digging a little deeper than it needs to, but part of my conflict with the story was how it sort of parodies its own storyline. I don't know about other fans, but the characters and stories these games have created are a big reason why I'll probably always come back to Saints Row. It was a little off-putting at times to see a lot of these old story moments get minimized or parodied in insane ways to the point where Volition is almost making fun of the player for caring in the first place. I might just be getting a little too sentimental, but some moments in SR2 absolutely shocked me, and the series from SRTT to SRIV seems to be actively working against its players getting too invested in its characters. (I could mention a few overly hasty off-screen deaths as evidence of this.)I started out by saying I really enjoyed the game, and I'll end by reiterating that. If you enjoyed SAINTS ROW THE THIRD, then SAINTS ROW IV will very likely be just as enjoyable. If I had to make a few guesses, I'd say THQ going under really put a financial squeeze on Volition's budget, which would more than explain bringing Steelport back for one more run. It doesn't quite feel like an expansion pack for SAINTS ROW THE THIRD, since I have about 30 hours into the game and have had a ton of fun throughout... but it *almost* feels like an expansion pack.That is to say, aside from some gameplay additions and the new story, there isn't a whole lot that has changed. It doesn't feel like the leap that we saw from SAINTS ROW to SR2, or even from SR2 to SRTT. It walks some kind of middle ground between innovation and stagnation that makes the experience a roller-coaster of fulfilled and dashed expectations. I'm really, *really* not sure what kind of shape SAINTS ROW 5 will take at this point, but I'm hoping that Volition actually gets back to basics in some ways. Keep the over-the-top style, but put the focus back where it belongs. There's a reason we wanted Gat back, and it's not because of his brief appearance in SAINTS ROW THE THIRD. Volition did something very right in SR2, and I hope they remember what that something was.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2014"}

I haven't beaten the game yet, because it is of course a very long game, but from what I've seen so far it has lovable and funny characters and a plot that makes you want to keep playing even after you've sat in front of it for five or more hours.It has almost all of the same features from the first two games like the Item World and adds a new feature with clubs that your characters can join to share bonuses with other club members. The biggest change in combat is that your characters can combine abilities to form new stronger moves. The best part about it though is that the two characters attacking the same target both get experience for the kill which helps a lot for leveling characters up.

Young","summary":"Tomb Raider is....","reviewText":"A great Action/Adventure game, the past Tomb Raider games have been anywhere from lackluster to so so. I must say that I love this game. Lara and her Endurance crew survivors: Sam, Roth, Alex, Jonah, Reyes, Whitman and Grim. The game started out a bit slow but after the first few chapters, it rapidly picks up. I would say it picked up for me during the &#34;Just Keep Moving&#34; chapter 4. I have to admit that during this chapter, I was literally scared out of my skin, when I was fighting a pair of wolves and one just jumped up at the TV screen and scared the living day lights out of me...whoa. I realized then that there is a strategy to beating these huge beasts that are very aggressive, quick dodging, jumping up in the air and getting enough space between you and them to shoot them with your bow and arrow. Anyway, the rest of the wildlife is mostly harmless and I almost felt terrible about killing them, especially the deer...not so much for the fat boars, then you have the rat, rabbits and chickens walking around aimlessly....kind of cute.During the chapter &#34;Mountain Rendezvous&#34; is where the game gets exciting because that's were you will encounter the Solarii Archers and Sapper- people that have lived on the island and they DO NOT like outsiders. This chapter introduces the player to how the game will generally play. There are elements of stealth and combat. The game really progresses well, I have not found any one part to be stressful or difficult. Eventually you will acquire  new skills, equipment and weapon, then you will be able to upgrade your weapon inventory by looting animal and enemies (Solarii) that you kill.I have not completed the game all of the way, but I have completed about 55 percent. I have not encountered the Oni Warriors, Borris theTank or the Oni Stalker, but I'm sure they present quite a challenge. I cannot stress it enough,but this game is awesome, it is fun and satisfying. I have not finished the game but I do wish it was a little bit longer, I think some other reviews stated 10-14 hours campaign. I think this game will have a high replay value because you can fast travel to locations that you have already played to pick up collectibles: relics, documents, GPS caches, treasure maps and Tombs. The Tombs are pretty cool, they are some sort of puzzle and then you figure it out and get points to acquire weapon upgrades and XP. After I finish the Campaign, I plan to go back &#34;fast travel&#34; and pick some of the items I missed.My final thoughts are:Gameplay- 9.5/10Replay Value-8/10Visuals-10/10Sound-10/10Graphics-10/10Controls-9.5/10Fun Factor 9.5/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00008DHNL","reviewerName":"C. Conard \"ExtremeAvalanche\"","summary":"I am so excited!","reviewText":"True Crime is dubbed as being the next GTA III. That's a pretty big bet, considering how good of a game and how sought after Grand Theft Auto III was a couple of years back. However, I believe that True Crime may be able to live up to what it says it can. First off, True Crime Streets of L.A. is being developed by Activision, a videogaming heavyweighr. Activision has the potential to make this game a hit. I just question how willing they are to make it good. So far, it looks to me like they are doing a fine job. At E3, the booth for True Crime was a hotspot for gamers, and the game was very impressive for all who saw it. The graphics were better than the GTA games, probably at least on par with the great graphics in The Getaway. True Crime featured 240 square miles of re-created L.A. territory, and the city looked great. The game just had the atmosphere of L.A. There was Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and even ghetto paradise within the game. There were hot rides in hot areas of the city, and old Buicks in the not-so-nice parts as well. (I prefer the ghetto life!) The people were good too. There were gangstas, ho's, businessman, snobs, everything that you would actually see in real-life L.A. Landmarks were recognizable, from the skyscrapers to the Mann's Chinese Theater. The sound was just flatout AWESOME as well. Cars were realistic, pedestrians chatted, music pumped in the background. And as a bonus, there will be over 50 beats from real life west coast rappers like Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre. I am psyched about that!! I am a huge rap fan! The sound to me seems just as good or possibly better than the awesome sound effects in GTA Vice City. You play as a cop, Nick Kang, who can either be good cop, or bad cop, whichever road you wish to put him on in the game. And the game will tilt that way too. Be a baddie, and you'll be swarmed by vigilantes and even your fellow police. Be a good guy, and the game may be a little easier or a little harder, depending on your view. So far, True Crime looks awesome. It could give the GTA series a run for its money. Roll out the red carpet this fall.

You guys are so wrong and to picky in my honest opinion. If the game was perfect you would still complain. You can state your opinion but be acurate about it. For example: You say this reminds you of a XBox port.I say it has one of the most inucutive interfaces I have ever seen. It's accually very effective than all that D&D; or Guild Wars junk. They made the interface to be easy to use for newbe's and vets alike. It's great! Trust me I know all about confusion or a clutered interface, just try X3 Reunion and you'll find out.Anyway, the AI is great also. With 1,000 + characters running around on the island your bound to have the a bug somewhere. The guy who said they are not that great is wrong. Why? Name one game where the NPC's have daily schedules and chose when to sleep, eat, dance, etc..? Gothic 2 yes, I have it but they still follow a schedule daily meaning if you see them in the morning in the court yard they will usually be there the next day unless they get killed or something.The game is just to large to give an acurate review on. I have only played about ten hours or so and I feel it may take me a year to finish or explore the whole entire game? Depending on how much I play. HL2, when it came out was it but after plying this game HL2 is so traditional meaning linear story line on rails and now the graphics are not state of the art after seeing the land in Oblivion. RPG's are taking a new step in the right direction with an simple but effective interface, life-like graphics, AI that make thier own choices on what to do and where to go and of course a endless, massive, openended world and story line.This game will go down in history as the RPG and game that changed it all, sorry HL2 your day is over now!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2006"}

Space aliens help you respect your roots.The game is incredibly dark, gruesome and mature. The lead character swears constantly, and you see numerous images of children, old people and other random humans being slain in nasty ways. This makes it not a game for kiddies.Still, for adults, there are a lot of interesting aspects to the game. For starters, the alien spaceship that you end up in is \"alive\". There are metal parts, but there are also many organic parts to it. The weapons you pick up are usually alive. The \"gun\" has little moving tentacles on it. Another weapon is a multi-legged creature where you rip off acid-filled bits and fling at enemies.There's also many physics-challenging areas. There are metallic floors a la Ratchet and Clank so you end up upside down and sideways. There are spheres with gravity so you walk all the way around them. There are teleportation portals to zap you from area to area.I did like the intriguing mix of graphics - it gave its own \"flavor\" to this genre. The weapons, especially, really intrigued me. The sound in general is full of screams, squishes and cries for help, to help you feel that you were racing against time to rescue people. There wasn't an unnatural \"throbbing soundtrack\" most of the time, although it did come in in certain scenes to help add some mood.In keeping with the Cherokee theme, they do include elements from Cherokee mythology including spirit guides, special abilities and puzzles to solve. You could consider this a gimmick that could have easily been explained in many other ways, but still, I like the fact that they tried. After all, there are probably 80-quadrillion games out there involving Japanese or Chinese myths, but I could probably count those involving Native Americans on one hand.This game doesn't shatter any new boundaries, but it was fun to play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2006"}

The overal gameplay is really good and there is definitely some cross-over on the story missions mainly with what takes place at the Museum. You know what I'm talking about if you have played the original GTA4 story with Niko Bellic. Rockstar did a great job of allowing you to play that 1 mission from every characters point of view so you get a feel how they escaped the museum. I thought that was a nice touch !!I didn't care for Lost & The Damned (LAD) as much as The Ballad of Gay Tony (TBOGT). In LAD its motorcycles and many of the missions involve riding a bike. I hated the original GTA4's &#34;mechanics&#34; with the bike and it was SO EASY to get dislodged. I would never want to ride one. In LAD it is grealy improved and the motorcycles handle ALOT better !! The story is a little &#34;so-so&#34; and I never tired the multiplayer so I cannot commnet on that. On the other hand TBOGT is pure over-the-top fun that is a throw back to San Andreas .... the cars are souped up, the weapons do more damage and they bring back base-jumping !! If you haven't done base-jumping in a video game this a good place to start. The storyline is excellent and the multiplayer is better than the original GTA4 in my opinion. Side missions like the Gang Wars are really fun, if you make the purchase I suggest play the storyline until those side missions become available .... Luis's buddys &#34;A&#34; & &#34;H&#34; really tease him during conversations when they are enroute to get their stash !! The humor might be offensive to some due to the nature of the story about Gay Tony, but I laughed many times at their comments !!

{"product_name":"B00006M3R6","description":"Metroid Fusionis a side-scrolling action game that's more in line with the series' NES origin than its GameCube contemporary, the first-person action gameMetroid Prime. In this one, players take the bounty hunter Samus on an extermination mission through a research facility to kill X parasites--nasty creatures that absorb and assimilate the powers of their host. After she survived an X attack through the use of a vaccine made with X parasite DNA, she can now absorb the parasites to regain health and obtain special powers, like the morph ball, space jump, and wave beam. The problem is that the parasites are quickly making their way through the research lab's many dangerous projects and subsuming their abilities.As a special bonus to GameCube owners,Metroid PrimeandMetroid Fusioncan each unlock special features in the other game via the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance cable.

By completingMetroid Prime, you can unlock Samus's fusion suit for use inMetroid Prime.","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"Super Metroid's kid brother","reviewText":"Metroid Fusion is a really good game.  At first I wasn't blown away since the storyline is really lacking and barely interesting enough to make an impression for the most part, but the feeling of being secluded in a trap-filled, enemy lurking planet -a reason I STRONGLY believe the original Metroid is such a classic in fact- is kept fully intact and perhaps succeeds moreso than every other Metroid game released after Metroid II: Return of Samus.  Yes that's right- as awesome and highly praised as Super Metroid is, the truth of the matter is that it lacks the feeling of being stuck in a gigantic planet (since the game seems sort of small to me).  Unfortunately the Metroid Prime series is equally as guilty (an exception would be the dark world portions of Echoes).The only reason I'm knocking a point is due to the abundance of similarities to Super Metroid.  Most of the same enemies from that game make a return here.  However the boss fights are completely different, though more simplistic to figure out and less fun to defeat as a result (a problem the original Metroid has as well, might I add).  Basically the boss fights do have a strategy, but most of the time all you have to do is walk into the fight shooting missiles or charged shots and that's enough to finish the battle.I could also complain that Metroid Prime has sort of spoiled gamers into thinking each and every Metroid game should be 10 hours long, however I won't dare forget my childhood- I grew up with hour long NES games and 2 or 3 hour long Super NES games.  The length feels right at home to me.The music is really creepy and appropriate in the icy and water portions, and melodic and very Metroid-like in the navigation room areas.  Animations are slightly choppier overall compared to the endless gushing framerate of Super Metroid.  Again, these are minor issues.  The fact that many of Metroid Fusion's missile expansions and energy tanks are cleverly hidden more than any other Metroid game is probably the games biggest strength.  I mean several of these items are *really* well hidden.  You'll need a map or well-written walkthrough in order to find them all.Overall, a fantastic Metroid game.  Don't spend more than 20 bucks for it however.  These 100-200 dollar brand new purchases I'm seeing at the moment are a total scam.  Don't fall for them.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2012"}

First you'll have to screw it onto your Gamecube and then you'll need to pop in the disc into the cube and a GBA game into the player and you're ready to go.The player has 20 frames to choose from and you can have it in a standard view or not, either way it doesn't matter or change a difference in the look of the game.  You can also adjust some of the picture settings from Normal, to soft to sharp. You can also change the controls on the Gamecube controller to better suit you but otherwise they still corespond to the same buttons.Even the GBA Player has its backdrops.  For one, it brings out the worst in some of the game graphics.  Some things look a little blurry when faced on the big screen. The GBA already has a pixle problem with some games and the TV only makes it worse sometimes.  The game also appear a lot brighter on the GBA player but I'm sure no one will lose sleep over that.Then there's the Gamecube controller, which takes a long time to get used to.  While the buttons correspond it takes a moment to adjust to things like X and Y being the select button. From the GBA your used to select being right next to the start button on the left side.  The A and B button placement could take a moment as well since the A button on the GCN controller is bigger than the B button.  Luckily, Nintendo has found the solution to this.  If you have a GBA link cable you can just as easily plug it into your Gameboy Player and use your GBA as a controller.Overall the GBA player is great hardware because it works the way its supposed to with little to no problems at all.

Rhodes","summary":"A Good Follow Up to Wii Sports","reviewText":"When the Wii launched it came with a game called Wii Sports. Wii Sports was actually a pretty fun game that showed people just what the Wii could do. The game itself was an okay game, but managed to be a good game to bring out during parties. Bowling, Tennis and Golf in particular were some fun games to play. A few months later Wii Play came out and it wasn't exactly the follow up people thought of when they thought of Wii Sports. Well, now we have Wii Sports Resort, and this time it does feel like a follow up to Wii Sports. If you liked Wii Sports, there's no guarantee you'll like this one.Wii Sports Resort uses mostly the Wii Motion Sensor Plus to do its work. It comes with a Wii Motion Sensor Plus if you don't already have one. There are more games here, with two of them coming directly from Wii Sports (Bowling and Golf) and having new motion sensor plus stuff thrown in there for good measure.So what is there to do with Wii Sports Resort? Well, there are quite a few new games, some of which are fun, others may not be as satisfactory. As you might expect, your mileage may vary. There are games like Frisbee, where you can practice your throwing and accuracy and even play a type of frisbee golf. This is one of the nice things about Wii Sports Resort, that there are a few other games located within the games themselves.Wii Motion Plus can be a little sensitive, however. With games like Frisbee and Golf, it can be really sensitive. The waggle of the Wii Remote in the first game was quite sensitive. Bowling, however, has been noticeably enhanced by Wii Motion Plus.But you're still getting games where wagging might be enough to win. Swordplay comes to mind, as sometimes winning is as simple as just wagging the remote constantly. Yet, for what it's worth, you're getting a good package of games. The water sports games are among the best in the lot. Some don't actually require Wii Motion Plus, and they can see you doing some really weird things from time to time. Wake boarding is easily the greatest addition here. It's the most fun and open of all the game. There's also basketball which is a little fun to play, and probably makes some of the best use of Wii Motion Plus.There's also archery which is simple to learn and actually quite fun, despite that it doesn't have you moving around as much as the other games might. So while it isn't quite as active it is still a lot of fun.That's not to say there are no games that are no fun. Cycling is not very much fun at all. Everything is worth checking out at least once in Wii Sports Resort, but cycling may be something you won't find yourself coming back to time and time again. You'll pedal using the Wii Remote and Nunchuck, but it feels more like a chore than anything.On the other hand, at least you're getting a good set of games. Even though they're relatively short. If there was any major problem with Wii Sports Resort, it would be the same problem Nintendo faces with almost all of their multiplayer games. It's fun to play with other people, but it's a drag by yourself. And while there's multiplayer here, it's also quite sad that much of it is on a \"take turns\" basis. Most people can't all play at the same time on most of the games. It's a great social tool, at least, but it still stands that by yourself Wii Sports Resort just isn't going to be all that much fun to play at all.The graphics look exactly the same as before. Wii Sports wasn't exactly a looker to begin with, and here it's not really different. It's pretty plain and basic looking. There was almost no improvement. You get to see different environments, but aside from all that, it's still the same basic graphics. But at least you'll have fun.In the end, Wii Sports Resort can be a fun game... provided you're playing with friends. Most of the new games are a lot of fun to play and it maintains the simplicity of the first Wii Sports, which is very nice. So anyone can pick up and play and get involved. It's not much for presentation, but at least it's fun and that's all that matters.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2009"}

I much prefer it to games like WWE 12 and perhaps WWE 13  as well in some ways.Anyway, here's my review-Graphics-The really impressive aspect about this game is the graphics. They're really good. The presentation is also really good. The wrestlers themselves are smooth looking, the game runs at 60 frames per second, and normally with most PS2 games I often complain about jaggedness, this game barely has any other than around some wrestlers hair textures. This game really shows off what the PS2's capable of.Also, I notice that while most of the WWE games have a regular blocky crowd with flat texturing, the crowd in this game is actually very animated and they do things such as dances, taunts, move around and so forth.This game is easily comparable to Gamecube's Day of Reckoning series, but it looks a lot better with some exceptions.While the graphics are excellent, I had a few gripes such as the fact certain wrestlers aren't accurate in size. For example, &#34;A-Train&#34; (Now known as Tensai) is a big wrestler, but he doesn't have enough weight nor is his face detailed enough for my liking. Tensai's head is supposed to be big and his body shape's a mix between thick and fat, his body shape in the game looks thick looking but a little too muscular for my liking. He also should be slightly taller being that he's a huge wrestler. Also, wrestlers like Booker T could've used a little more while other wrestlers looked fine. I was particularly impressed with how good the Dudley Boys looked.The in game menu features either smackdown or Raw divas gyrating on the screen in full size. They look very accurate and life like but also very smooth. It's just really impressive to see the PS2 pull this off.Impressive.Sound-One thing I wasn't too crazy about in this game would've been the commentary and the Day of Reckoning borrowed soundtrack featured. I'm just not crazy about these songs being that I heard them so many times. Still, that doesn't make the soundtrack bad. The wrestlers themes are accurate and commentary is scarce. I'd of personally preferred more commentary; but that's not the case. During the season mode, you get voice overs, and while some sound alright, there are quite a few that sounded dull. Lilian Garcia also does the announcing during a wrestler coming out but for some reason she sounds a little too loud or as if her announcing is on top of everything.Nothing major but could've been better.Gameplay-I really enjoy the pace of this game. For one, the action is fast and fluid while being realistic and chock full of moves. The graphics really add to the moves you pull off. For one, a chairshot looks and sounds brutal. A slam looks like it really has that extra impact. Some wrestlers will slam the holy hell out of another wrestler and it looks like it hurts alot.Some of the gameplay mechanics in this game are really good such as during the beginning of a match you can shove your opponent, lock up for a test of strength or talk smack amongst other things, you also get a Dirty, Clean and Neutral style of gameplay and depending on what you do during the course of a match is what will potentially earn you a reward.For example, if you're a &#34;Dirty&#34; wrestler, removing a turnbuckle pad or hiding behind a referee, using weapons or choking and pulling off illegal moves will give you momentum or grant you a &#34;dirty finisher&#34;. I'm not sure what happens with clean or neutral.Some gamers were somehow disappointed with this roster, but I happened to like this roster and you can always create wrestlers. The roster features- Booker T, A Train (Lord Tensai), Scotty 2 Hotty, Rob Van Dam, Shawn Michael, Triple H, The Dudley Boys, Animal and Hawk (LOD), Roddy Piper, Undertaker, Kurt Angle, Mark Jindrak, Batista, Ric Flair, Bret Hart, Molly Holly, Victoria (TNA's Tara), Sable, Torrie Wilson, Trish Stratus, Stacy Keibler, Shelton Benjamin, Kane, The Big Show, John Cena, JBL, Randy Orton, Rey Mysterio, Christian, Charlie Haas, Eddie Guerrero, Chavo Guerrero, Chris Benoit, Rhyno, Matt Hardy, Rico, Chuck Palumbo, Rico, Tajiri, Andre the Giant, Paul Heyman, and some others including Masked Kane, Legend Undertaker etc.The CAW is pretty good and reminiscent of Gamecube's DAY OF RECKONING only perhaps a little less in my opinion.The game modes are standard with the main attraction being Elimination Chamber or 3 Stages of Hell. You also have Single, Tag Team (tornado, elimination), Bra and Panties, Royal Rumble, Battle Royal, Triple Threat, Fatal 4 way, Ladder Match, TLC, Steel Cage etc.This was the only disappointing aspect of the game would be the selection of matches, but it's more than sufficient and the gameplay more than makes up for it. This game also featured weight detection which I loved. For example, Shawn Michaels or Tajiri cannot pick up the Undertaker unless arm dragging or perhaps suplexing if even that, instead they will pull off different moves or struggle to try and pick them up while failing to do so. If a lightweight wrestler hits a heavyweight such as Undertaker at times Taker would just shrug off and &#34;no sell&#34; the hits. (In fact, this can even happen with two heavyweights)The grapple system can be a little weird being that grapple is also the irish whip button. The control is a mixed bag and greatly reminds me of SDSYM's control. (Smackdown- Shut your Mouth)Bottom line, if you're looking for a good wrestling game that features great gameplay and lots of reversals that have impact, brutal moves, good graphics and sound, then look no further. This game doesn't really compare to SVR2006, but it's not too far behind and it's one of my favorites.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2013"}

I found the single player dull, and very very short (about 4 hours if you have it on normal and take your time, 3 if you put it on easy and zip right through).  The local Multi-player is also pretty dull.  I would assume that the system link would be alright if you could get 4 XBoxes with a total of 5-8 people in a game, otherwise it's very boring.If you have XBox Live though, it is an entirely different story.  Mech Assault is by far the BEST Live enabled game so far.  It experiences generally low amounts of lag, and is amazingly fun to play.As always, there are some people who are out to ruin the game for everyone else by taking advantage of certain aspects of the game, such as the ability to shoot someone half way across the level with the most powerful weapon in the game, but you quickly learn how to avoid such people, especially with the use of your Friends list.The Friends list allows you to easily find... well... friends!  You can add and delte people as time goes on so that you don't wind up with too many people with bad attitudes playing in your games.All in all, MA is one of the best games I have played in a very long time, and I've played a lot of games in my time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2003"}
{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"j-rob-82","summary":"Good So Far, Very Enjoyable New Console and Hopefully A Good Future","reviewText":"As I progress in playing the Wii U I will update my review so it might lose stars or not.  So I just picked mine up a few hours ago since I had it on preorder from Best Buy.  Don't get me wrong I kinda went through the motions of cancelling my preorder since I had no intention of really getting the console, but just in cast I did decide to preorder.  Its odd a lot of people I tell I have a Wii U most people don't know what it is.  They ask if its a add on to the Wii.  I have noticed that the reviews on Amazon aren't really flooding in like most popular items do.Now a little back story and explanation of myself.  I will justify my purchase to you the consumers.  All these comments are to help you become engrossed and in love with my review.  Is it gonna be worth that $350 clams I payed or in my case over five hundred for everything such as games and controllers.  If I have learned anything when it comes from consoles I have started opting for the accidental protection plans or whatever its called I just put on my bill.  All that considering I have been through 3 PS3's and 3 360's.Personally I am still happy with my Wii and so are my kids.  I have always had a soft spot for Nintendo since I grew up in the 80's.  Though lately I do feel they have become almost Disney in appearance but the substance is a bunch of business men in suits.  Of course their is nothing wrong with that but as I have gotten older the magic has disappeared.  I no longer think Shigeru Miyamoto is a fantasy character created by Nintendo.  In my thirties now with my own kids I started thinking about the games that would probably come like Zelda, Mario, Mario Kart, Kirby and all those games Nintendo is known for and it really helped influence me.  I remember being small and opening those Nintendo packages starting with NES World Class Track Meet bundle.  Of course I had an Atari and Sega but always had a Nintendo for better or ill sometimes.  Playing Nintendo kind of takes me back to when games were just games and made you wanna smash the controller but it was all in fun and innocence.First off I think this is not that big of a leap from what I have seen and in my mind its probably a four year or so life cycle maybe less.  I think the HD should of been in the Wii but that's o.k. since I enjoyed it with my kids in SD.  I am not some childish fanboy by the way I play PC, 360, PS3, Solar Eclipses and Eggo Waffles so I enjoy it all and love the experience each bring.  My kids though are who will love this the most since they kept the Wii going and from collecting dust.  I have read some reviews on here and I roll my eyes like a teenage girl with two sentence reviews or the obvious people.  As far as me by myself I don't think I would buy it this quick if I didn't have kids.  My kids didn't ask for it but that goes to my Nintendo side of always owning a Nintendo something console.  I think people my age understand that spot in their hearts for Nintendo.  I am gonna review this objectionable as I can since I don't really hate Nintendo but I am not their biggest fan.So to the system itself the aethetics on it are pleasing to the eye though its just a big black rectangle and about the same size as the Wii but a little wider.  Personally its not that great looking but the game pad is the real draw and I think it looks fantastic.  It does fit weird in my hands but nonetheless its a eye pleaser.  That's just my eye and good god (no offense) it has so many finger prints on it right now and I have only had it for a couple of hours.  Everything about this black model just collects it like it was at a petting zoo.  Set up is a cinch and I had it all connected in about five minutes or less.  Syncing was no problem at all either and it recognized the handset almost immediately so as far as I can tell its been smooth.  It does come with HDMI which is great instead of me getting home with component or s video cables and becoming Hulk like in anger.  I did notice the controller is pretty light and does feel somewhat like it could withstand a drop.  That is probably the one thing that worries me is my kids having it on their laps and forgetting its there than having it hit the floor as they stand up.  For some reason it reminded me of a lighter version of a Sega Game Gear though as far as size.  I might be remembering wrong though.  Time will tell if it will be a hindrance or a welcome addition to gameplay.  It does have the sensation of having something new and special to play with.  That really didn't sound right but it does.As far as memory I don't think I need as much as whats in this system but its welcome.  I have a 8gb 360 from awhile back and only recently filled that up.  Since I don't have a good internet connection all those extras don't matter much to me such as the apps like Netflix and the such.  Considering my others do that I don't really feel that I need it anyways.  I do enjoy playing older games though so I am interested what is gonna be offered on here.  50 bucks wasn't much for the upgrade to the bigger system so that also swayed me a little plus it came with a game.  If you plan on quite a bit such as streaming or downloading a bunch of stuff opt for this model.  I think a lot of people will be happy with the 8.Now this is the rub and this will show me who actually read my review with all the unhelpful votes and all the comments saying \"wait you reviewed it without playing it\".  Most these helpful and unhelpful numbers are irrelevant to the review since its obvious most people don't read them completely.  Oh and console wars cause console erections so they all come out of the wood work with their input.  Anyways as I said this will be a progression probably over a week for me to get a good review so I wanted to get it started while it was fresh on my mind.  Because reviews tend to get buried here on Amazon.  Right now it is updating that behemoth update and I hope this is the big one.  I don't have a hard line internet connection and am using a tethered VZ Wireless Droid Razr Maxx with 4g.  Its been going about two hours and is almost half way there.  I have read about peoples power cutting off mid or so through and bricking the console so my hopes are that won't happen.  My internet did cut out and it started back where it left off no problems and no starting over.  You can skip the update but eventually if you are connected to the internet you might as well do it.  I could of waited for the update to finish to write my review but I wanna make sure everything is up and running when I finish this long winded, horrendously drawn out, absolutely unnecessary, brain numbing review, big and stuff, kaboom.Though I know most people have not read this far since as of now it says 2 of 9 found it helpful and no one stopped to criticize.  I think people need to stop just look at stars and actually taste the substance.  Dip your finger in and give it a taste since no ones looking at this dinner party.  Don't be afraid to peek at the writing it aint gonna get you. Reviews are usually personal unless its those ridiculous fake ones from fanboys or the non.  Don't worry my review isn't gonna come back and get you in your dreams.  Anyways if you have questions or anything you want me to look into for you I will have no problem doing it so just let me know.So after my update is now finished I finally got to play the new Mario Wii U but of course after a update and I can tell it will be a family favorite.  The graphics really shine on this and its great to see Mario in HD and my kids are fighting with each other.  Nintendo you've done it again not only to bring families together but rip them apart.  I am enjoying using the handheld (honestly I have no clue what its called, maybe a tablet) as being the god hand in games like Mario.  We have yet to try Nintendo Land which is the game it came with.  We just couldn't resist Mario.One thing I noticed that the release titles I have pretty much played besides a couple already on other systems.  The first party games are usually what I think of the most when I think of Nintendo.  That's also a failing for me since I game on other systems, what third party support is gonna be here for me and why pick it over other systems.  Honestly other than family enjoyment I don't think I would own this console.  When my kids go to sleep odds are I will be burning up my other consoles playing more adult games.  Hopefully there will be many in the future of this console.  Another thing I did notice was they didn't go with any achievements which I find disappointing but freeing in a way.  I like them since it gives you something to earn for playing and getting points for no reason except to show off.As far as speed I noticed there were long load times such as when you are loading a game or changing menus on the Wii menu.  If you are use to blazing fast speeds from a iPad or a PC you may be in for some disappointment.  Its really not that noticeable but if you are into specs you will notice.  When you have to change menus there is also a pause for a few seconds.  My old Wiimotes synced with no problems at all and I haven't read the instruction manual yet so starting is relatively easy.  So far I am sticking to five stars with the console as is since I have yet to have a big problem and it really is fun.Next I will go into detail of my transferring my old Wii data to this U.  It is quite simple to do and it just involves a few steps of swapping your SD card back and forth and getting the transfer utility from the Wii Store.  Honestly its easy and all you have to do is consult your user manual or the internet since its got a wealth of info.  Really some of these reviews on here also have details.  I am disappointed that though I have money in my wallet I can't use it for my Wii U purchases.  I think its because I no longer have my subscription id or whatever its called for my Wii.  I tried to remember it all and the only offer they have is to find your password after you put in your user i.d. which I have no clue what it is.  So no usage of my Wii profile on the U just yet but hopefully I'll figure it out.The Nintendo Land game that's included is an absolute joy for the kids to play.  Usually I am holding the gamepad in my hand and my kids are the ones using the controllers.  There are around six muliplayer mini games and six or so single.  As far as enjoyment for me it really came from my kids playing the Mario hide and seek type game or the Luigis Mansion.  The game itself I probably would only rent but since it came with the console it shows off some potential for the gamepad.  I do recommend playing it since it does show off what opportunities come from playing with family.  These mini games will no doubt keep children entertained for hours on end I think.  Nice addition to come with the black console.I will update this review as I progress and the Wii U  grows on me.  I am wondering how multiplayer, third party, voice communication and other console norms will progress on this system.  Third party was very weak on the Wii which worries me.Though I am gonna go ahead and write my concluding sentence and it will sound like this that in conclusion the Wii U is a very enjoyable console and like its predecessor it will bring hours of fun.  Hopefully there will a larger following of the hardcore gaming crowd.  The price point is hefty but consoles don't really come out often so its up to the individual to decide whether this system will serve its purpose with them.  Put away that purchase of 350 dollars in shrimp and get this if you are convinced that its the next best thing to Skynet.  Personally its very intuitive to look at and use which leaves me to wonder what the future will hold for this system.  You can have confidence in buying this if you are into the first party games since Nintendo will in time unleash those.If your family was all about the Wii than there's really nothing wrong with this purchase.  If you are a hardcore elite gamer or whatever you call yourselves you may not find much here currently.  So wait if you want to see how the future pans out or get it now and start enjoying it for Christmas.  As for me the three stars is what I stick by for now and will change as the console progresses.  I don't really see how you can write a one time definitive review at the start of a console anyways.  Believe me five stars for fun but to me the console will have to be seen to whether or not its future shines bright for the almighty five stars overall.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2012"}

You got werewolves on steroids and ninjas wielding sub machine guns and a story that does it's best not to make one lick of sense.

I'm serious, there are more quality boss fights here than in five games. A giant electrified fish, a molten hot armadillo, a winged demon, and a huge multi armed werewolf named Volf are just a few of these encounters and every single one will get your blood pumping.Ninja Gaiden 2 is the reason that I still play video games.

'Far Cry 3' is a breath of fresh air in today's shooter market: an FPS focused on delivering a memorable single-player experience with an open-world to explore and an RPG-like sense of player progression. It's a terrific game and probably the best I've played all year.The story of 'Far Cry 3' puts you in the role of Jason Brody, an over-privileged yuppie who, along with his two brothers and group of friends has been captured by pirates on the tropical islands of Rook. After escaping, Jason is rescued by the native Rakyats who teach him how to survive the island and save his friends. The story is cliche to a point and Jason and his friends aren't exactly the most likeable video game characters. But it's in how 'Far Cry 3' progresses, pushing Jason through crazy scenarios and watching him change from timid rich-kid to full-blooded killer that makes the narrative so compelling. That the voice-acting is so uncomfortably believable (especially Michael Mando's performance as lead-pirate Vaas) just makes the experience all the more memorable.The gameplay in 'Far Cry 3' is fairly straight-forward FPS fare with a few unique additions. Jason's not a fighter at first and a lot of his abilities are unlocked by earning experience points through combat and completing mission-objectives. Along with leveling up there's a crafting system that allows you to make weapon holsters (to hold more guns and items) by hunting down specific plants and animals. Mix in Radio towers that unlock weapons, strongholds to take over (for money and XP) and you have a sense of player-progression sorely missing in a lot of today's FPS games.While the writing and gameplay is tops it's really the open-world 'Far Cry 3' presents that makes you want to keep playing. Missions play out in a fairly linear manner, asking you to get from point A to point B (and kill, burn, recover intel etc) but Rook Island is filled with all kinds of unique locations for you to explore and activities to take part in. That you can get attacked randomly by animals as well as other humans just adds to the game's unpredictable nature and makes the world feel like a living, breathing place. I've spent more time just driving around 'Far Cry 3' and taking in the sights than actually playing through the story!Everything in 'Far Cry 3' seems to fall into place but it does have a few rough areas. There's a lot of impressive sounds in the game but so much of it seems muffled, especially with character voices. Even with my Turtle Beach X12 Headset character's voices seem drowned out making subtitles an almost necessity (which runs the risk of losing player-immersion). The controls can also be imprecise when trying to skin animals, pick-up weapons and loot bodies for items; You use the same button for all of these actions and it can take several tries before finding the right button-prompt.Calling 'Far Cry 3' the best video game of 2012 is not easy praise, especially stacked against the likes of 'Halo 4', 'Borderlands 2' and 'Black Ops 2'. Obviously it's not perfect and could've taken some time to smooth out the imprecise controls and muffled sounds. But when it comes to quality, exploration and player-progression no other game I played this year comes close to matching the experience in 'Far Cry 3'. A must-play, especially for single-player FPS fans!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000GEDN5E","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"Raving for Rayman","reviewText":"Look up the word \"frivolous\" and you'll see that one of its definitions is \"a lack of seriousness.\" I don't think there's another word that better describes Michael Ansel and Ubisoft Montpellier's Rayman Raving Rabbids. Raving Rabbids is the most ridiculous and hilarious game I've ever played in my life. Essentially a collection of 70 mini-games, Rayman Raving Rabbids isn't a platformer of the Rayman norm, but it's still worth checking out for all of its own reasons.Rayman Raving Rabbids begins with a quick introduction to Rayman's situation; he's on a picnic with some Globox buddies and suddenly a pack of Rabbids appear and abduct Rayman and his friends. Rayman is then thrust into an arena and forced every day to entertain the Rabbids by taking part in mini-games. Every day Rayman is awarded a plunger for his efforts, and eventually he figures out that these plungers will help him escape his imprisonment and the Rabbids.The storyline is hilarious in this game, but everything is. The Rabbids are a ridiculous bunch; they're not the least bit intelligent and their sole purpose seems to be running around like lemmings, causing problems for themselves and beating the crap out of each other with clubs and frying pans. Most of the minis have you going against them in some way; and though some of the minis are similar, they're all a lot of fun for the most part.I'll go into detail about a few of the repeating minis, but I won't ruin some of the surprises for you. That would take away a lot from the entertainment value found here. My favorites seemed to be the deeper minis, minis that I could honestly enjoy if they were transformed into fully-featured games. The first one is the on-rails shooter. In each of these minis, which usually last a few minutes each, you're armed with a plunger-shooting gun (brings back memories of the awful South Park video game). You shoot Rabbids with this gun, and some of them are tricky; you'll even run into Rabbids wearing Sam Fisher's fancy headgear.Another great one is the three-lap warthog race. You'll hold on for dear life as you race around different levels on the back of a warthog, and you can whip the warthog to pick up speed and get ahead of the pack. Despite the lack of power-ups, the races are a lot of fun. My favorite mini, and possibly the most common, is the rhythm-based disco mini. You'll stand in the middle of a stage while Rabbids swarm from the left and the right, and as they line up in rhythm on a circular spot on the ground, you flick the nunchuck or Wii remote to hit the beat. I can really only name a few minis I didn't enjoy, and surprisingly enough one of them was the cow-toss mini. All of the rest of them are fun to play and the Wii remote and nunchuck control them smoothly.Rayman Raving Rabbids is as creative with its visuals as it is with its gameplay. It's got the funniest and most absurd art direction I've ever seen in a game. The Rabbids are a disgusting bunch of creatures, with mouths so vile that pigs would seem cleaner. The interesting Rayman world isn't opened up as much as I'd have liked it to be, leaving you with only your cell and the arena to explore, but that's an argument that pertains more to the game being a collection of minis rather than a platformer. The sound effects are well-delivered, and the music is a treat-I especially enjoyed hearing some of the songs in the rhythm games, like \"Pump It,\" and \"La Bamba.\"Rayman Raving Rabbids is a mixed bag in terms of replay value. While the 70 minis are fun to play, and can be enjoyed multiple times, I would have liked to see Ubisoft create some sort of incentive to play them over and over and over until they're perfected. Bronze, silver, and gold medals are a great example of something that could have been put in place to secure a few more hours of replay. Still, multiplayer and some of the better minis will keep you playing long after you've completed the game.A word of caution before playing this game; Rayman Raving Rabbids will wear and tear on your arm muscles much like a prolonged Dance Dance Revolution session will give you the sweaty cardiovascular workout of a lifetime. I highly advise that gamers playing this game on the Nintendo Wii use the Wii remote's wrist strap, and secure it tightly. Also, the overlooked warning of taking a break during gaming sessions is something I highly recommend against. I played this game for several hours straight and paid dearly in the form of sore arms and wrists for hours. I don't care if you're the most muscular hunk out there, you're going to be in pain if you can't put this game down for a few minutes.Rayman Raving Rabbids, out of all of the Nintendo Wii launch titles, is the funniest and most obscure. Though the thrills won't last forever, the laughs will. Every time one of those Rabbids lets out a scream, I still laugh. I'd love to see Ubisoft flesh out these little guys, and I'd be completely happy with a full-featured shooter, warthog racer, or rhythm-based game starring them. Rayman Raving Rabbids should have a spot in your Wii collection with Legend of Zelda and some of the other great Wii launch titles.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2006"}

Rose \"Blu Aficionado\"","summary":"Gorgeous, Inside & Out!!!","reviewText":"I have to start this review by saying I own an Xbox 360 Elite, and just sold my 40gb PS3.  I heard about the PS3 slim and thought I'd give it a try.  I play alot of Xbox, and will admit I'm on my 3rd, thanks to the RRoD.  I didn't play my 40gb PS3 very often, until Little Big Plant came out...that's the game that got me hooked on PS3.After selling my 40gb model, I decided to run out and grab a PS3 slim. I was literally in awe when the sales associate handed me the new thin, light box. I rushed home, and unpacked the box, this thing is seriously small.  It weighs close to nothing when compared to the classic design.I must say this thing is a piece of art!  The design is amazing, I was never a fan of the shiny black PS3, it collected fingerprints and showed every spec of dust.  The matte black on this unit paired with the mirrored disc front bevel is gorgeous.  I must also add the new \"push\" buttons are much more functional and the white back lit buttons are extremely slick looking.Now onto the internal functionality.  The PS3 has always been a solid built machine, and this model is no different, despite the new thinner, lighter form factor this thing is still solid.  I turned it on and set up the wireless connection, which is a great feature, considering I have this installed in my bedroom.  I put in a Blu Ray and sat back, just as I suspected, gorgeous picture on my 46\" Sony Bravia.  I never thought my 40gb unit was loud, sometimes the initial disc start up buzzed a bit but nothing to take away from your viewing enjoyment.  This one is completely dead silent.I must say this model is a 100% improvement over the previous design...until I turned on Bravia Sync.  My TV instantly recognized the connection, labeled my HDMI 1 input as \"PlayStation 3\" and added a favorite icon labeled PS3.  I think this is one of my favorite features hands down!  My TV remote now fully controls my PS3 and TV, and even automatically turns on my PS3 when I select its input, or turns on the TV when I press the power button on the PS3.To wrap this up, I must say this is an excellent product, I've always been a Sony fan, and have owned nothing but Sony TVs, Audio Receivers, etc.  I have a good feeling with this new design and 100 dollar price drop Sony made a good choice...but, it wont stop me from enjoying Xbox too.  Both of the consoles bring so much to the table...you're cheating yourself if you don't take time to enjoy the features and fun of both systems.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2009"}
{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Cravens \"Loves a good story\"","summary":"Great End to a Great Trilogy","reviewText":"BioWare has outdone themselves yet again and have developed a climactic and satisfying finale to one of the best video game series ever created. Even on its own Mass Effect 3 stands as a legendary, AAA title. Let's examine several categories: Gameplay, Story, Sound, and the Ending.GAMEPLAY:The game feels the same as previous titles when walking around with Shepard, yet it feel smoother. BioWare has managed to make the game feel like ME without making gamers feel like there's been no improvement, yet the improvements blend in so well that the mechanics don't feel foreign, either. Combat has been drastically improved, IMO. It feels less busy than it did in ME2 and more tactical, but the added customization options give combat a fresh edge to keep players coming back.STORY:Mass Effect 3's plot is extremely strong. The writing is the best in the series, and the repeated theme of sacrifice serves to make the overall story emotionally gripping. Many of the cutscenes on different missions are so epic; some of the character interactions are so powerful. There are more than a handful of unforgettable sequences here, and with such a diversity of characters and dialogue, it's almost guaranteed that any gamer who picks up this game will see something they find memorable during their ME3 experience.SOUND:I got my hands on the Final Fantasy series years ago as a kid, so video game music has always been an important factor in helping a game be above the competition. With that said, Clint Mansell has composed beautiful songs that fit the ME universe with haunting perfection. Some tunes will make you reflect, some will make you be ready to grab your assault rifle and join Shepard on the front lines, and others still will make you tear up deep inside. I've got the soundtrack on my iPod. I listen to it quite often during the week.ENDING:Let me first say I loved the ending, and especially so now with the free Extended Cut DLC. Without giving anything away (though hopefully you haven't been spoiled by other reviews), I feel the ending forces gamers to really sit down and think about the implications of their ending. This makes it both more unforgettable and more mature than most endings in any art medium such as movies, books, etc. I think the reason so many gamers complain about the ending is because they'd rather have an ending spoon-fed to them than have themselves think through things. That's just my opinion. I also felt all my choices along the way mattered. I remember the choices I made since ME1, and they were given proper treatment in my book. All the important sub-plots came to fitting conclusions throughout ME3 without feeling rushed. Does this mean every single question I have about the ending was answered? No, but I have to admit the Extended Cut really answered most of the things I pondered about. Ultimately, the ending was not cliche in the least, which is something I and many other gamers really value.Here's the bottom line: You're shooting yourself in the foot by not buying this game. It's one you'll want on your shelf for years to come. It's the finale to a level of storytelling that is unprecedented in any entertainment industry. Even if you are left unsatisfied with the ending, the journey all the way there is one heck of a ride you'll always remember.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2012"}
{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Craig Moller","summary":"What happened?!","reviewText":"The Mass Effect trilogy, like many, is something I hold dear and have come to cherish over the last five years. In my opinion, both Mass Effects along with the first Bioshock and Red Dead Redemption are among the best games of this generation! The choices and characters were so well written and believable and engaging with them made you care for them. Though with Mass Effect 3 I feel like, many betrayed by Bioware.All the hours I poured into this game, the decisions I made all felt pointless at the end of the game. So many questions left unanswered and unfinished I wanted Reaper carnage bliss and an ending where Shepard gets the alien/girl of his/her dreams and leads the galaxy through the aftermath and recovery of the Reapers or something like this where every sacrific and decision paid off (yes, I like happy endings). The relationships I formed and my love interests, what happened to them? Many of my favourite characters didn't actually return as squad mates they just basically had cameo roles and many died and nothing could be done about it! Though I'm extremely happy that Ashley was back and I could continue my relationship with her (yay) along with improved cover and shooting mechanics as well as improved weapon customisation than the previous games which impressed me.I really hope that Bioware responds to all this negative feedback from loyal fans. Maybe they should release a re-edited ending in a patch or in a future DLC release. Please! Don't let this defining trilogy end on a note like this!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00BGAA29M","description":"","reviewerName":"Courtney L. Osborn","summary":"The New Crash Bandicoot","reviewText":"Intro:Knack is a platform beat &#8216;em up video game developed by Japan Studio that was released worldwide at the launch of the PlayStation 4.  It was developed in cooperation with Mark Cerny, the lead architect of the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita.  He is also known for his work on Crash Bandicoot, Jak and Daxter, Spyro the Dragon, and Ratchet and Clank.When it was revealed on February 20th at the PlayStation Meeting, I was more than skeptical about this new &#8220;launch platformer&#8221; title.  I played all of the other games that Cerny was a part of and I loved them all, but the platform genre seems to be dwindling down to being almost irrelevant now; at least on home consoles.  I have grown out of the platforming phase in my gaming career, so I completely expected to dislike this game.  On top of that, when the embargo on the reviews for PlayStation 4 games ended, Knack was receiving universal mediocre scores (Knack is the 2nd lowest PS4 score on Metacritic).  All of this set me up to go into this game ready for it to be the worst launch title.Story:The world of Knack is an interesting one.  In it the goblins that have inhabited the caves of the world have started to wage war on mankind.  Somehow these primitive creatures that have long used only bow and arrows and clubs to battle, have started wielding tanks, guns, robots, and much more superior technology than should have been possible.  The war starts to go in the favor of the goblins for a while until a human doctor discovers what he hopes can be the savior of mankind.This savior is called Knack, the protagonist and the character you will be playing as.  Knack is a small creature made up of relics from a long lost civilization that have been bound together and given a consciousness by the doctor.  Knack has the power to absorb other relics and materials in order to become extremely large.  So the doctor, his assistant, and Knack set out to save the world from the goblins.Remembering how simple storylines use to be in the early platform games made me really skeptical about how well they could pull it off in a game today.  I was completely surprised to find out that this story was not only good, but it was actually quite charming and excellent at times.  It was for the most part predictable because we have all probably seen hundreds of movies and beat several games as well, but that doesn&#8217;t take away the fact that Cerny and Japan Studio were able to deliver a unique world with a fascinating story.Presentation:Knack&#8217;s art style is very similar to a Pixar film.  It was cartoony and childish looking for the most part.  When everyone hears next gen they imagine everything will be &#8220;super-realistic&#8221; graphically but this is not always the case.  Some developers choose to go for an artistic visual style and Knack was one of them.  This was almost refreshing to see as that last two games I had played were very realistic - Assassin&#8217;s Creed IV: Black Flag and Killzone: Shadow Fall.  The voice acting in Knack was superb as it featured excellent voice actors such as Travis Willingham, Laura Bailey, and Matthew Mercer.Gameplay:Knack really shines in its addictive vintage beat &#8216;em up platforming gameplay.  The mechanics of this gameplay are quite simple.  You are able to freely run around the screen and can jump on to different platforms to move up and down.  In order to fight enemies you can either punch them by clicking one button or you can jump and then click the attack button to perform a flying attack.  It is very similar to Crash Bandicoot back on the PlayStation 1.  You also are able to absorb &#8220;sun stones&#8221; which give you magical power to use any one of three moves: the ability to turn into a tornado and attack everyone at once, the ability to shoot a powerful shot at multiple enemies in front of you, or the ability to pound the ground and create a tremor that destroys all surrounding enemies.  This combination of attacks combined with Knacks ability to absorb relics and grow extremely large makes Knack incredibly addicting.There are also several hidden rooms throughout the game that hold special gems and parts to make upgrades for Knack.  The upgrades include things like a radar to help you find these rooms and a combo counter that will upgrade your attack power after hitting an enemy 8 consecutive times without being hit back.  After collecting a certain amount of each of the gems you are awarded with a special form of Knack that you can replay levels with later.  Each special form has a different ability, such as stronger defense.  These upgrades and collectibles will make you want to replay the game in order to find everything and see what they all do.My only complaint is that the game is frustratingly difficult.  This will not be a complaint for most of you I am sure, but I am really bad at hard games.  Even on easy mode there were a few sections of the game that were crazy difficult for me.  But for those of you who like a challenge (a la Demon Souls), you will love the challenge Knack provides.  Sometimes after getting through a tough part you might die and the last checkpoint was back so far you have to go through the entire tough part again.  This can lead to repetitively going through the same 3-4 minutes of a level if you struggle with a certain part.The Verdict: 8.5 out of 10Knack surprised me in every way possible.  It went from being my least anticipated PlayStation 4 game to being the most fun I have had playing a game on it so far.  Now don&#8217;t get me wrong, it is not the best game on PlayStation 4, but it is the most fun to play.  I had so much fun during the 10 hour story that I have since gone back and played a few levels just for fun to try and find more collectables.  I felt like a kid playing Crash Bandicoot again.  Maybe it was the fact that I had such low expectations going into the game that it ended up being such a refreshing wonderful experience?  I often find myself thinking that the enjoyment you feel from a game comes from how well you expect it to be starting off.  This almost assuredly proved to be the case here.  I really hope that Knack sells well enough to get a sequel because I would love to see the direction that Cerny and Japan Studio take it.  If you are going into this game, don&#8217;t expect it to be a game changer or anything like that, just expect it to be an overall fun and charming game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00004SVYE","description":"Sequel to the popular Legend of Zelda game, by Nintendo, for the original NES console.","reviewerName":"Joe Sherry","summary":"very difficult, but a great game","reviewText":"Zelda II: The Adventures of Link is the direct sequel to one of my favorite games of all time - The Legend of Zelda.  Zelda II expands on the story, having a grown up Link fighting to save the princess (who has been cursed into sleep) and Link is also trying to stop the forces of evil from reviving Gannon (the bad guy from the first Zelda game).While the first Zelda game was a straight adventure game, Zelda II mixes in RPG elements in how you search the towns, talk to people and try to discover what to do and where to go next.  When you are in the overworld, you control link from the top down and this is very similar to an RPG.  As you walk, you get into random battles (which are partially avoidable) and the action is now side-scrolling.  You can fight with your sword and cast magic.  Throughout the game Link levels up as he gains experience and can earn more magic points, health, or strength.This is one of the more difficult Zelda games and it was only until I replayed the game a couple years ago that I was finally able to make my way through the final dungeon to defeat the game (I could never find my way to the last boss).  Even with the advanced difficulty, this is a stellar game and fully lives up (or helps to set up) the Zelda dynasty and is part of the reason why this is such a well respected and beloved video game franchise.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2003"}
{"product_name":"B0022TNO7I","description":"","reviewerName":"paper tiger \"Adriel August\"","summary":"Beautiful. Violent. Poetic. Dark. Max Payne 3","reviewText":"I must say I am impressed and a little surprised with what they have done with Max Payne. I have been building this game up in my head for the past few years since I first caught wind of it and I must say it has met and beat my expectations. The game is very well put together. There is intense action, a lot of violence, and a carefully woven story that is peppered with flashbacks and poetic cut scenes. The single player campaign is roughly 10 hours long and the trophies are split up between single player and multiplayer, though there are a few more single player trophies. Fans of the original games will enjoy this very much. I have a feeling that newcomers may gravitate more toward the multiplayer side of the game, while us old timers play Max Payne for the gripping story and the depressed main characters drunken inner monologue.The full installation size is 5.5 gigs, there was a 25mb update on release day and a 59mb update on 5-21-12 which may have corrected some of the below issues gamers have been having. You DO NOT need to be connected to the internet for Max Payne 3 to save your game, as others have claimed you do. I unhooked my network and played for an hour, quit, restarted and it went right to where I left off. You also will earn trophies, but you need the internet to sync them to the PSN. Some players have noted that there are audio interruptions throughout the game, I have noticed this as well, however they are very minimal and random throughout the game which does not hinder the game playing experience. My only issue was that the voice did not match the characters lips moving in a short cut scene, again, a very mild issue which may have been corrected with the most recent update as I have not had any issues since.Pros+ Beautiful natural feeling graphics. Fairly well detailed and smooth running. It has a unique style that is very entertaining.+ There is a very nicely woven storyline that really holds your interest throughout.+ The A.I. is very good in my opinion giving us smart challenging enemies.+ Music is classic Max Payne, but with a modern twist. Sound is very clear and strong. Voice acting is top notch and funny at times.+ Bullet time is very well crafted. 360 shooting while on the ground is a nice touch. Shooting from cover is also well achieved.+ Multiplayer does grow on you after more plays. It is fast, simple and smooth.Cons- Multiplayer is not as great as I was hoping. It is a bit clunky and only mildly entertaining. Bullet time is fun, however easily becomes a mess with many players. I would not recommend this game simply for multiplayer.- Control in single player and multiplayer takes a little while to get used to. It is good, however it needs to grow on you. Sort of reminds me of the Alan Wake controls and the aiming system reminds me of Red Dead Redemption.- I found that the game does get slightly repetitive after a while, however with the regular scenery change and story jumping it is very minimal.- Bullet time can sometimes actually hinder your game play. If an enemy shoots you and you are near death, you are forced into a locked bullet time, which is cool, but if you need to reload or an object is in your way you will die and you have no control. Very frustrating.- There a few weird clipping issues. Sometimes when you shoot an enemy they will just stand there frozen, and eventually fall.One little pet peeve of mine in games is when they take the control away from the player, well due to all the loading cut scenes they do take the control away quite often and have varying length cut scenes. It does get annoying after a while and for the most part you cannot skip the cut scenes as it is loading the next section. However I rather sit through a cut scene than a empty loading screen.As a huge Max Payne series fan, I was a little insulted by them adding multiplayer, though it is mildly fun and entertaining and like any multiplayer game it greatly depends on who you are playing with. Other reviews are saying this third installment in the Max Payne series has drifted from its roots. I agree and disagree. It has been almost 10 years since Max Payne 2 came out and the game needed a facelift. It is still Max Payne, however they have gone above and beyond to make this a new gaming experience yet still hold on to the classic aspects we look for. Max is old, I felt as bad for him as I did for Bruce Willis in Die Hard 4. He still has it though! Max's sad poetic dialogue, painkillers, and bullet time are all here. The game is very violent and intense, mostly seen in bullet time slow-mo kills showing the bullets flying through your enemies like a grapefruit.The game is very smooth and stable and I have had no issues with glitching or lagging. At one point a multiplayer game did freeze up (the game, not the system) on me and it restarted within 30 seconds and took me back to the multiplayer menu.Over-all I am very happy with Max Payne 3. It has lived up to my expectations and the hype. However keep in mind it is a single player game, with a less than perfect multiplayer game latched onto the single player for survival. The style is great; it is like a Heavy Rain and L.A. Noire and a Tony Scott (especially Man on Fire) film all in one. It is highly entertaining and the dialogue is fun and holds your interest throughout the game play. The loading times are hidden in the cut scenes, so there are many long cut scenes and they do seem to interrupt often, so if you are looking for a shoot um' up style game you'll get it with MP3, however you'll have to sit through the cut scenes first.Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2012"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E67A","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason","summary":"Resistance 3 is a great FPS even if this is your first entry into the Resistance Series...","reviewText":"I am not one for horror movies, scary movies, FPS shooters that feature zombies in game after game (I'm looking at you Call of Duty) or that sort of thing, so after I got my PS3 I never found myself that compelled to pick up either Resistance FoM or Resistance 2.  However, reading the previews and watching the trailers for Resistance 3, I found myself very much interested.  Having played a great amount of Resistance 3 single and multiplayer I can report that I am very glad I picked this one up.GraphicsThis game is not as beautiful or graphically amazing as Killzone 3.  However it does look quite good.  The textures, the lighting especially make this game look incredible.  From an artistic standpoint, this game looks just simply incredible.  The guns look detailed, the textures are deep, the character models are quite good but the environments are what will capture your attention the most.Presentation:Because the environments are so beautiful and captivating, the game does a phenomenal job putting you into a role as one of the last survivors on earth.  You can really buy into the idea that you're at the end of a war that has gone terrible.  The music, the graphics, the sound effects all effectively present what happens.Gameplay:Most notable about this game is that it gives a shout-out to older FPS games by allowing you to hold more than 2 weapons, in fact you can hold as many as you like on your weapon wheel.  You also must gather health packs to revive.  It reminds me of the first FPS I played which was Star Wars: Dark Forces.  This is a good thing.  I hate having to drop weapons on the ground to pick up a new one, the simple weapon wheel system (like Assassins Creed) works well.  It is a pleasure to switch weapons to make the tactics you need available to get the upper hand.  A shotgun is an excellent weapon when you're being surrounded by zombie alien hordes, but a sniper rifle is most effective at distance.  The bulls-eye allows you to hone in on enemies even when they're moving and you're firing elsewhere, which is helpful for grasshopper aliens.  The augment (shooting through walls) gun is effective particularly to find out where enemies are hiding.Sound:The music and sound effects are sensational and help add to the atmosphere and feeling of the entire game.  The music is well composed and sometimes the silence is more dramatic and intense than the music itself.Multiplayer:The multiplayer is quite buggy particularly here within the first week, but considering the beta and two giant updates to R3, I wonder why it is so full of errors.  Much like any other modern FPS, multiplayer supports a leveling up system as well as a class system.  As you level up you may create your own class and you can choose your own combination of guns, power-ups, grenades and so forth.  Any upgrades your purchase for one class is available to all other classes (unlike KZ3) which is good.  Besides the glitches in multiplayer, the game feels a little off balanced because certain players with upgraded guns & power-ups particularly in combination really over-run other players at lower levels.  However, I find this to be a similar problem to various FPS multiplayer leveling up systems.  It simply takes so long to accumulate the points to purchase new abilities, guns, powers, and so forth.Overall, this FPS is a phenomenal addition to your PS3 game collection especially if you enjoy First Person Shooters.  The single player is dark, gritty and creepy and the multiplayer despite its flaws is a fun sensational experience.UPDATE:The more hours I put into the campaign and multiplayer the more I have come to appreciate the art design of the game.  While perhaps R3 doesn't do anything that other FPS haven't done before, it does them well, it does them with a great post-apocalyptic style and great level design.  One complaint I have is that there are a few levels where the game encourages you to be stealthy, but the game doesn't always give you the tools to do so. It does a good job trying to creep you out with aliens in abandoned-post alien-end of the world as we know it places all across America.  Its' story is grim and though you don't know the main characters you care about what happens to them.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2011"}

For that reason alone, it gets four stars from me. I love games like this, because you can spend countless hours exploring and getting lost in the virtual world. And the world of Skyrim is BIG! It probably takes over 100 hours to play through all of the quests and explore every map location. All the while, you are becoming more powerful, through the leveling and skill increase system, acquiring better arms, armor and spells.If you are into power leveling, each skill has a way to level it up very rapidly, or you can just do so naturally, by playing the game.I love the skills which allow you to make your own weapons, armor, enchantments, potions, etc. It is possible to craft godly items, like a bow which hits for over 1000 damage (on a sneak attack), a two handed hammer, which hits for over 450, armor that has incredibly powerful enchantments on it, like water breathing, faster mana regeneration, extra hit points, disease immunity, etc.This game outclasses all the previous Elder Scrolls games in every conceivable way, which makes it much more fun and addictive. Random events, such as dragons attacking you while you are shopping in the middle of a town, occur all of the time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00D96BJSO","description":"","reviewerName":"Jen \"Geek Girl\"","summary":"Great purchase","reviewText":"There aren't currently any other high end offerings for Xbox One headsets, but don't let that be the sole reason you purchase this set. I and my son have been taking turns using it almost daily for about a month now and it's holding up very nicely. I've always been a fan of Turtle Beach and this one lives up the high quality I have come to expect from them.A little bit about it, it includes everything you need to get started: Headset, removeable mic, 3.5mm chat adaptor and cable, 3.5mm phone cable, and directions. It was pretty straight forward set up. We were back in the game within a few minutes. The headset feels very solid and durable in my hands yet it's fairly lightweight given it's size. After wearing it for a few hours in a row, I didn't notice any discomfort at all which I often find comes with bulkier headsets of this type. The memory foam padding is really nice and adds extra comfort here. I've had other sets without it and my ears tend to feel mashed and bruised after a while. Not so with this one!The sound is also amazing. I can't tell you how much of a game changer it is going from playing on your standard built in TV speakers to these. It was like being wrapped in luscious sound, encompassing me from all directions. Simply beautiful. Music suddenly becomes more moving, ambient noises become more alive, everything is just 100x better with this headset. Mic quality is fantastic, too. With my old Xbox 360 headset, I would very frequently get &#34;What?&#34; or &#34;Huh?&#34; I have a soft voice and with the wrong mic, I can be nearly impossible to hear, but I was able to talk naturally without feeling like I was shouting and still be heard clearly by my teammates. Huge plus there for me.All the controls are very easily accessible and removing the mic when not in multiplayer or on a skype call is fantastic. I can't tell you how many times I've nearly broken the boom off my PC headset due to forgetting that I had pushed it all the way back only to toss the headset down on top of it. Can't believe it hasn't snapped off yet. It's even harder to believe no one else has done this before, at least not from what I've seen. An awesome feature for sure. I also love that I can use this for multiple purposes. Now I'm not crazy about the idea of jogging or biking around town with this headset on, but for around the house it's very nice, especially when watching movies on my iPad while trying not to wake anyone up.Overall I think it's well worth the price. The only feature I didn't absolutely love was the customized plates. Not that it's a terrible idea, I'm sure some people love it. But it's just not my thing. For what it's worth, the changing of the plates is very simple and offers a nice variety. If you're looking for amazing sound and supreme comfort for your Xbox One, look no further.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2014"}

Nicholson","summary":"Overall game package....Better than I'd hoped ... maybe even a 'Game of the Year' contender in this group","reviewText":"Some comments on the 3 new components of this 5 game package.Episode 2...a worthy sequel to Episode 1...In fact, qualities good enough (IMO) to think that it might have contended for single player, Game of the Year*, (however, its shorter overall length would probably preclude this honor.)This game was all that I'd hoped for; it has some great battles, an extended car driving component, an interesting new weapon (towards the end), a compelling story line, a hint of humor and a touching, emotional ending.In addition, it has smooth flowing graphics, well sync'd voice and lip movement and a few interesting puzzles. Also, the way the other characters (i.e. Alyx, Dr. Vance etc.) watch you and turn their  bodies to adjust to your position (Freeman) is remarkable; very realistic.My only small complaint would be that the first quarter of the game was a little drawn out and repetitious; however this is only a minor concern in an otherwise incredible PC game.Easily 5 Stars...more if I could.*****Portal...quirky and different but fun!A rather unique, single player puzzle game that involves going in and out of  doors; doors you make with (what else), your portal gun. However, this task is not quite as easy as it sounds; to accomplish your goals you must use strategies of lateral thinking, timing and momentum to get through all 19 different levels. Of course the challenges become more complicated as you progress and to win the game (and escape), you must defeat the increasingly neurotic test-facility robotess in the finale. Great fun!This spacial concepts took a little time to get use to, but once the basics were mastered this was an interesting and fun exercise in abstract thinking and puzzle solving.  4  Stars.*****Team Fortress 2...non-stop actionAn excellent addition to the original TF. The gameplay could best be described as multiplayer chaos, with everyone running around like mad trying to survive. It is, however, great fun.  5 Stars.Conclusion:Great value for the money; 1 new game, 2 new sequels, plus a couple of old games thrown in (games that, for anyone who likes this genre, has already played long ago). Overall package...5+ Stars.*other nominees for single player 'Game of the Year' might be 'Bioshock' and \"Call of Duty 4', with 'Timeshift' and 'STALKER-Chernobyl'  close runner ups and 'Crysis' in a more distant grouping.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00019AZC8","description":"Mega Man Compilation disc, put together in celebration of Mega Man's 15th birthday. Paying tribute to Mega Man creator Keiji Inafune, Capcom's Mega Man Anniversary Collection anthology set will collect Mega Man 1 through 8 in a single package in addition to two arcade titles never before released in the U.S., Mega Man: The Power Battle and Mega Man: The Power Fighters. In addition to an updated soundtrack, fans of the blue hero will also find a cache of unlockable bonus features that include 30 minutes of anime (PlayStation 2 version), producer interviews (GameCube version) and a history of the series.","reviewerName":"R.A. McKenzie","summary":"One of the Better Compilations","reviewText":"NOTE - I have not played much of the PS2 version of \"Mega Man Anniversary Collection\", but I have noticed the controller is much easier to use than the GameCube's.  If you're interested in this title, the technical aspects of both versions should be identical.REVIEWJust how much fun is it to play that old-school, side-scrolling, blue bomber anyway?  These games have not lost their touch at all.  Both gamers who suffer from incurable nostalgia (like me) and those of the next-gen consoles (like most of today's generation) can enjoy this compilation.The basic premise for this series is that as Mega Man, you will complete from 4-to-8 stages (depending on the game), each with plenty of side-scrolling shooting your way through robot enemies and jumping exercises, and each ending with a Boss battle.  You must choose wisely, though, because although you can finish them in any order, certain bosses' weapons have a distinct advantage over another.  After defeating these foes, Dr. Wily awaits Mega Man at his castle, which will require every weapon you've just gained to progress.  It is this freedom-of-choice that gives the \"Mega Man\" franchise such a proud place in gaming history.What Capcom did right with this series is not incorporate too many new features that weren't already in the games.  For example, you won't be able to Slide until the 3rd game, nor will you charge up your Mega Buster until the 4th game.  These games are properly ported form their original versions.Sure, there are a few touches here and there.  There isn't as much framerate slowdown as before, a useless map is now added to the PAUSE Menu, and the timeline references (\"20XX\") match today's timeline (\"2004\").  The best addition is a SAVE feature, that allows you to avoid those annoying Passwords, and just jump right where you left off.  You'll lose you acquired Lives and E-Tanks, but the level-and-weapon status remains intact.Many consider the first 3 games to be the classic titles.The first \"Mega Man\" is still the hardest of them all.  The enemies are unrelenting, and I've read that there used to be a Boss glitch that Capcom removed, forcing you to use your skills even more.  Although basic in concept, the challenge is very unforgiving in some levels.  This game is hard.\"Mega Man 2\" is my favorite of them all, because the music is catchy as hell, plus the bosses and levels are expertly designed.  For those who've played this game before, the fourth Dr. Wily boss is still a pain-in-the-ass though.\"Mega Man 3\" is by far the longest in the series, as you'll battle 8 original bosses, then the 8 from \"Mega Man 2\", then tackle Dr. Wily's 6 stages of combat.  This entry is also a little tough, because you're gonna have to be extra-smart to make it through this one.Most fans consider the next three games (\"Mega Man\" 4,5,6) to be the money-making sequels.  Back in the day, I would agree, but since the price of this disc is less than these 3 titles combined at original price, I won't complain.  Also, they're so much fun that how can you resist the technical improvements.The 4th game is when the powers and upgrades become more plentiful.  Eight more levels await, and this time there are actually 2 castles to shoot your way through.  This one holds a special place in my heart, as it was the first one I ever beat.\"Mega Man 5\" and \"Mega Man 6\" share many similiarities.  Both games start off with 8 robot bosses, then reveal the supposed enemy's castle of 4 stages, only to expose that Dr. Wily was behind it all, and give us a few more stages to battle through.  The stories are a joke, but who's reading anyway.  But neither of these games are bad at all, and proudly earn their spots in the classic NES sextilogy.\"Mega Man 7\" was the SNES game that reinvigorated the franchise for many fans.  Better graphics and sound quality, not to mention some unique bosses, gave this series some more life.  To be honest, I think this game runs a little slower than my taste, as the NES games are much more faster-paced.  Still, a worthy entry,The 8th game was released on the PS-one, and to be honest, I haven't beaten it yet because the stages are truly mind-boggling in puzzles and challenging with their platforming sections.  I'm having a great time with it, though, and eagerly await the concluding obstacles...There are even two bonus fighting games that aren't too bad.  They're both themed after the 8 previous games, and allow Mega Man, his brother Proto Man, and newfound ally Bass, to face off in classic Capcom 2D fighting.  Think \"Street Fighter\" with \"Mega Man\" weapons.Included on this disc are some bogus extra features that I could do without, but that's not why you buy collections like this.  \"Mega Man Anniversary Collection\" is all about the evolution of gaming.  The action of these titles was deceptively simple, and I have no problem recommending this disc to anybody.  My minor quibble with this game is that the GameCube controller's D-Pad is too damn small, but that's a problem I can overlook.  I'm recommending people buy this collection of titles because they are all about gaming.  You won't find \"Metal Gear Solid\"-like complicated stories, or \"Final Fantasy\"-like levelling up, or \"Resident Evil\"-like puzzles.  All of those are great titles, but \"Mega Man\" is much simpler.  All you need are two hands, keen eyes, and a hunger to execute these commands...\"Run---Jump---Shoot\".  Can you do that?  Good, now stop reading my review and buy this already!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2005"}

GOW3 is the reason why I bought a slim when my original 360 red ringed over a year ago.  So it pains me to say that the campaign in 3 is rather a letdown.  Gears 1 burst on the scene with such in-your-face testosterone action and innovation that it set the standard for 3rd person cover based combat.  It introduced weapons like the lancer and hammer of dawn that will live on in gaming history.  Gears 2 refined the gameplay of its predecessor and added a sense of scale to the war--it did what a sequel should--improved on an existing formula, but lacked in freshness.  Now we are at Gears 3, the end of a trilogy, and it feels as such.  Gameplay is a little more improved, but all innovation has been sucked out of the franchise.  They've added new weapons but the lancer and hammer of dawn are still the showcase pieces.  New enemies seem downright out of place in this game.  They've lowered the testosterone level in this game by adding sentimental moments, which I feel is a mistake.  The story is the weakest part of the game--very shallow with the majority of the game being fetch quests for fuel and equipment.  Graphics are very good as you would expect, but feels too much like their last release \"Bulletstorm\", which left a bad taste in my mouth.  It seems that they've dumbed down the series with each iteration, so play this on the most difficult setting.With all this said, it is still a good game because you know what you're getting.  You also get 4 player campaign co-op which is great for the co-op players amongst us.  Of course you also have a huge multiplayer community featuring Horde 2.0, which was my only reason for going online in Gears 2.  All in all, this is the game that I'll be returning to for the next few months so it was a great purchase for me.  If you don't game online and only want to see how the story ends, just rent it or watch it on youtube.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2011"}

I am thrilled that the combination of the two is spectacularly fun.The Lego game makers have definitely perfected the gameplay over their various iterations. The coin-gathering fun is there. The cut scenes can be laugh-out-loud funny. There are puzzles and battles, quiet moments and gorgeous scenery.It is just so satisfying to go wandering all over the Shire, watching the hobbits dance at the party, and exploring the ins and outs of hobbit holes. Then there's the beauty of Rivendell, with Elrond and all his elvish friends. Sure, the game gets darker as it goes, and it can be fairly tedious following Gollum along through the grimy swamp. But all in all there is a lot to enjoy here.I really have to give special kudos to the team that develops the cut-scenes. Sure, they had the real movie dialogue to work with, which is a treat. But the detail they give to the little Lego expressions is priceless. There's quite a deft touch here with the humor. While kids will enjoy the game, the adults will adore some of the jokes.This is one of those games that I'll be playing long into the night, knowing I should go to sleep, but then I want to get through just one more level. And then the next thing I know the sun is peeking up over the horizon. It sucks you in. Luckily the save system is fairly good. Certainly not perfect, but far better than many other games I've played. When it's important, you can usually get saved fairly quickly.The game is great for all ages. The Lego games in general are well deserving of praise in that area. A young child can play along as one character, and an adult can \"jump in\" at any time to help out with a puzzle. Then the adult can drop out again, allowing the kid to progress on his own. Not of course that the adult has to leave if they don't want to :). I know many adults (including me) who are quite addicted to these games.Are there any downsides? I suppose you could say that there's no politically important statements being made about nuclear war or the state of minorities in the modern world. But for simple, relaxing fun, with a heavy dose of the Lord of the Rings fantasy, I definitely recommend this game.Rating 10/10I purchased this game with my own funds in order to write this review (and enjoy it!) :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2013"}

The story takes place several years after the original Neverwinter Nights, and reintroduces popular characters and NPCs in a new storyline with new challenges.","reviewerName":"Brian Martin","summary":"Don't Listen to the Whiners","reviewText":"Let me start off by saying I am a big fan of D&D; and have played the original NWN. If you've perused online reviews and the official forums you'll find a lot of mixed reactions to NWN2. Unfortunately a lot of the criticisms aren't unfounded, but if you read some of these reviews it seems like people just complain just to complain. Yes the game has some flaws but bottom line,the game is fun. Nearly all of the flaws  the game has can be fixed with a patch. Granted some of the things should have been there to begin with, but even so the game provides hours of fun, and at the end of the day that's really all that matters.I bought the collector's edition of the game and I'm either spoiled by the CE of the Guild War's series, or maybe it just takes more to impress me than 2 cheap rings and a crappy cloth map. For 20 extra bucks that's what you get, and a manual-esque \"art book\" with a few scans and character designs. That's it. A much better version of the CE was released in Europe and Australia which included the Original NWN, a D&D; miniature, and a soundtrack cd. A much much better CE than what we got here. Guild Wars gives you a soundtrack cd, a poster, a hardcover artbook, and a nice sturdy, nicely designed box to keep it in. It's nothing earth shattering but it actually speaks more about the total NWN2 experience than you'd think.Obsidian had a HUGE task with NWN2. I peruse the forums every now and then and some of those guys are die hard enthusiasts. They'll complain about every little tiny detail from cloaks not flowing right to this spell wouldn't do this in D&D.; Granted, there's no way they could please everyone with this, but a lot of the complaining was defintly warranted.For instance, I have a relatively powerful PC. It's not bleeding edge but like everyone else has said, if you can run Oblivion you should be able to run NWN2. Sadly while I don't have the horrible performance some people report, it's nowhere near the buttery silkiness that I get with guild wars, which NWN2 very much resembles. It's really quite baffling at what the problem is when the graphics are nothing special. They're light years ahead of NWN1's tiled , ugly look, but if I can run Oblivion at high settings I should not in any way have problems running NWN2. It's like in a lot of aspects the game could have used a few more weeks of polishing. I know they wanted to get it out before xmas, but with such a huge title, a large, vocal community who will call them on it, and the greatness that was the first game, it's crazy how they didn't polish this thing till it gleamed. From the crappy CE to lagging graphics you can see how some nerdy fans (me included) are so vocal about it.What get's NWn2 off the hook is two things. The gameplay and the huge possibilities it has with expansion. The game ships with a toolset (which i never use) that lets any D&D; fan create stories and adventures till their hearts content. For sure a lot of hobbyist silliness is created, but there have been quite a few gems from the NWN1 era that rival some professionally created games in terms of scope and fun. You can download professionally created amateur modules many places, and the original NWN featured several official modules created by Bioware. So the game will surely have a very long lifespan. And that;s great considering the engaging battles and RPG gameplay.Battles are very tactical now as you have the ability to take 4 companions with you at any given time. Many different people will come and go in your party and all of them have different personality and classes. If you've played Knights of the Old Republic the party interaction is similar to that. Your character is still a silent mute, which is unfortunate. I'd like atleast once for RPG's like this to give your character personality. Let you pick a voice style when you create your character and have them actually talk and react. That's another thing, characters talk and act much better than NWN1, but they still only have so many animations that they cycle through. Sometimes you're party will get jostled, and you'll be having a conversation with an important character only to have one of your party members staring off in the complete opposite direction. Sometimes even when a NPC is directly addressing them. It seems nitpicky but it really jars you out of the experience. Another thing is any city you go to , it doesn't matter what time of day it is, the exact same citizens will be in the exact same places for days and days on end. In the City of Neverwinter there's these 3 people who sit in the same spot by a tree and never move. If i remember correctly in the original NWN the npc's had cycles. If it was night, the city would be empty and if it was day they'd actually go about their business. Little things like that take you out of the RPG element.Even despite these flaws though, Ive played the game for hours on end and really enjoy it. It took what was great about the first game and put some polish on it, upgraded it and made it shine. Battles are fun, spell effects are great, managing your characters is easy, leveling up is easy to do, and just so many things make this game fun to play despite it's flaws. Most of the issues that the game has can surely be patched up. Obsidian seems like they're in it for the long haul and are behind the game 100%. If you read the forums the devs are responsive to criticism and attentive to game issues, which there are plenty of.If you're looking for a good RPG for a xmas gift, then this is a great game to give. Even with it's flaws you can get this up and running easier than Oblivion. Oblivion has some steep system requirements and isn't for casual gamers. NWN2 is more accessible and a lot more tactical. If you're a fan of D&D; or RPG's then you will surely love Neverwinter Nights 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00019HNNM","description":"The close of a trilogy is a touchy thing. Miramax's slasher pic Scream 3 highlighted the role of each part: Chapter one sets the rules. Chapter two bends the rules. And chapter three throws them all out the window in favor of taking the story full circle.Which brings us to the third part of the Onimusha trilogy, subtly titled Demon Siege. In the first of many switches from the franchise's usual MO, there are three playable characters &#8211; Jean Reno's Jaques, the first Onimusha's Samanosuke, and Parisian military woman Michelle. Each offers wildly different play mechanics, and this coupled with the game's time warp storyline (more on that later) offers needed variety to a survival horror franchise that was never really know for its fear factor.Each character will upgrade their weapons and skills through the course of the game (much less so for Michelle, as she's playable for far less of the game than the other two) in the usual fashion&nbsp;&#8211; collecting souls. Without a combo-laden combat system, Demon Siege relies heavily on timing and strategy to master each of the three warriors. This mechanic is very reminiscent of Enter the Matrix for two reasons: minimal button presses result in onscreen action that looks very, very cool. Two, the timing of action is far more crucial than combos. The difference is that Demon Siege is just a much better game &#8211; the enemies offer more variety, the control is more precise, and the elemental weaponry is extremely varied.While some action hardcores will likely fault the game for its simple control scheme, most will appreciate it for the satisfaction it brings to the screen. Kicking a demon away so you have better range with the Ball and Chain of Doom (my name for it, not the game's) is quite cool, after all. Just keep in mind that plot and combat play equal roles in the Onimusha universe, and each are doled out fairly.On the story side of things, Demon Siege has that dual time period hook. How well is the idea executed? Well, Paris really looks like Paris; and without being able to experience feudal Japan firsthand, all I can say is that it looks beautiful in the game. The plot unfolds at a lightning pace and requires players to use one character (in one time period) to do something, which has an effect on the other character (in the other time period). Switching frequently, the game's pace is so well crafted that there are few places that seem to be a pause &#8211; you'll always want to do that next thing.What I really like about this game is that I always felt like I was getting a new weapon, going to a new area, or fighting a new boss (most of which are ferociously tough, by the way). There was no drag for me. That, and kicking Genma butt made me look badass. Personally, I wouldn't want anything else for my favorite samurai/horror sendoff.Concept:Craft a compelling, edge-of-your seat action game to conclude the Onimusha seriesGraphics:3D backgrounds don't mean that players have camera control, but it does mean that everything looks really greaSound:The score alternates between totally inspired and super cheesy &#8211; but it does fit the gamePlayability:Timing is the key to success and I rarely felt robbed, so it did what it was supposed toEntertainment:Demon Siege is one of the most cinematic games to date, and I soaked up every second gratefullyReplay:HighRated:9 out of 10Editor:Lisa MasonIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:The final chapter of the Onimusha trilogy radiates excitement and is the very definition of epic. The opening CG cinematic is so detailed and explosive that I wouldn't be surprised if George Lucas started handing out pink slips to the ILM crew. I know this clip is only a few minutes in length, but it is worth the price of admission alone. Further justifying that you absolutely need to add this title to your library, the gameplay is equally exquisite and is brimming with non-stop intensity. The methods with which you dispose of your assailants remain simplistic and true to the series. Plus, the battles are much larger in scope, the pacing of levels is relentless, and the visuals that you breathe in are all the more majestic. This truly is game development at its finest. While I would have liked to see more interaction in the environments, and depth in the combat, I really couldn't ask for a better conclusion to one of the PlayStation 2's finest series.Rated:9.25 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Squee!! \"The world is very dark\"","summary":"Hahaha Ninja Gaiden","reviewText":"This game is a stupid, mindless beat-em-up.

I just finished beating the game, and it was actually my favorite Role Playing Game...ever. It was that enjoyable. You're laughing through most of the cut scenes. There are some very memorable characters in this game. If you don't know Fawful, you need to check this game out. He has the best lines in the gameOne of the reasons I think I liked this game was because it's a great rpg with a mario twist. In normal rpg's you can't do anything to help dodge attacks. When fighting your enemys, you can either jump or use a hammer to counter attack, or dodge the hit.There are some puzzles in this game. The Majority of them are easy. You need to pay attention when talking to people, because as they will sometimes give you hints by coloring the text either Green or Red. This helps you know where to be and what to do. If you do get lost, eventually a little shop will open up, allowing you to purchase the info to know where next to go.The boss battles are great. This is where you use your Bros. Power attacks the most. This is were both brothers help one another pull off a powerful attack. You need to push the right button on the right time for the attack to be most effective.I finished the game at about 23 hours total. It's not a short game. Sometimes you with you could just be done with it (collecting pieces of a \"bean star\" takes some exploring), but after the final boss battle, it feels great and was worth your time.

{"product_name":"B002BRZ6UE","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"An excellent first person shooter that gives you choices","reviewText":"The majority of the buzz around Crysis 2 has been around the game as a technological achievement, and it absolutely is.  It is one of the best looking games I've played on my PS3.  Manhattan in the aftermath of a devastating alien attack gave the developers a very interesting landscape to work with and they delivered in spades.  The set pieces are huge, the environments gorgeous and detailed, and the lighting is some of the best I've ever seen.  Not only visually, but the games audio is incredible as well.  The sounds of your gunshots echoing down the abandoned, skyscraper-flanked streets of the city feel visceral, noises come at you from every corner, and the explosions rumble deep and clear.However, what impressed me about Crysis 2 even more than its incredible audio and visual delights was the way the absolutely superb single player campaign was designed.  While the game is linear, each battlefield is designed in a very \"open\" fashion (for lack of a better word), almost like a series of sandbox/open world missions.  You are given many options when determining how you want to accomplish your objective, both by the way the area is laid out, and by the tools that your Nanosuit provides you to assess and overcome the situation.  Do you want to sneak by the enemies in stealth mode, or use stealth to get in for the close, hit and run kill?  Do you want to flank?  Go in with guns blazing?  Attack from above?  Use the turret on the other side of the battlefield?  This is where Crysis 2 truly stands out from the rest of the pack.  This is a unique concept for console first person shooters, and I hope that other developers take note of what Crytek did here, as it makes the game much more interesting and gives it a greater replay value.Unfortunately, an element of the excellent single player campaign is also the sole weak spot of the game, and that is enemy AI.  While overall I would not hesitate to recommend the game to everyone, as the AI is not a big enough problem to warrant otherwise, there are times in the game where the AI is just baffling, particularly when you are fighting the human enemies in the game.  They will behave unnaturally after getting shot, will run in place against a wall, or quickly forget about you after you put a good dent into their health.  For a game that is so technically brilliant and polished in pretty much every other area that you can count, it's stunning to me that these AI issues are present.  Again, the whole game isn't like this and these occurrences are not extremely frequent, but it happened enough where I felt I had to deduct a star from my review.In addition to the robust, lengthy single player campaign, Crysis 2 also has a very enjoyable online multiplayer mode that has been taking up more and more of my time lately.  For those of you that have played any of the new school Call of Duty games, that is the closest comparison I can make.  It is a more fast-paced, run & gun-type of competitive multiplayer that relies more on quick reflexes and individual skill than on team strategy.  It has a similar leveling system where the more you play (and the better you do), the more XP you get which allow you to upgrade yourself and your weapons in various ways.  How it differs from Call of Duty is that all players get a Nanosuit, which gives them the cloaking and enhanced armor abilities to bring into the combat.  The nature of the Nanosuit, with allows players to jump higher and launch diving attacks from above, has led to the creation of a fantastic set of maps that incorporate much more verticality than the COD maps and make for some really chaotic and enjoyable multiplayer battles.  While I don't think that Crysis 2's multiplayer will become the go-to multiplayer of choice and give the COD franchise a run for its money, it's still a very good time that is different from the other stuff out there.All in all, Crysis 2 is an excellent game that is only slightly marred only by some faults in the single player AI.  The single player campaign is one of the best in any FPS this generation, and the multiplayer is deep and extremely fun.  Well worth the purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002BRZ6UE","description":"","reviewerName":"ObiWanShinobi","summary":"Surprisingly Solid Shooter","reviewText":"If you've played a FPS in the last few years - then what Crysis 2 has to offer should not be mind blowing. Machine Guns, alien swarms, sniper rifles, grenades, headshots, shotguns, etc. Shoot a red barrel and it'll explode...yeah, it's all there. Personally, I would describe myself as quite \"over\" the FPS genre as a whole. However, that being said Crysis 2 manages to do all the typical FPS shooter mechanics extremely well... and throws in a couple of unique (although still not exactly not mind-blowing) little tweaks which is what makes this a really great game, and subsequently worth your time and money.First off the single player campaign is both lengthy and well paced. The story (I have not played the original) is solid for the archetypical \"Stop The Alien Scourge\" type of deal. Coupled with really tight controls and a good swatch of weapons - it makes for a rewarding experience. The whole differentiator for the Crysis series is the suit that you are in control of. You can enter two modes which change the way you face each challenge. Being able to go \"Stealth\" (vis 'a vis the Predator effect) means that you can approach enemies unseen. Upgrades to your suit eventually allow you to perform more stealth kills and even walk through crowds of enemies unseen.The second mode is an Armored mode. This basically allows you to go whole hog for a time and survive for a couple of hits longer then you normally would in a firefight. Doesn't make you invincible but it gives you a definite edge in both taking hits and dealing them out as well.You can also run and jump which is considered \"Power\" mode, but honestly it's just another thing to drain your energy so that you can't zip around and be super armored at the same time.Combining these two modes with a variety of customizable weapons, suit up-grades and tactical approaches provides a really interesting and robust way to tackle each encounter. You can literally approach the same scenario differently each time. I found the AI in this game both challenging and interesting at the same time. Enemies actually react to getting shot, hide well and as frustrating as a stealth kill that doesn't go unseen (although you think it should be) is - it's good that game doesn't mess around. There will be times when the AI just stands there or runs around sporadically but pound-4-pound it's more of an aberration than an annoying norm.  And as someone who is generally kind of over this kind of game in particular that's high praise.If you're a fan of the FPS genre then this should definitely be something you play. If you've never played a Crysis game and are burnt out on the FPS shooter genre (like myself) - this is still a great way to pass a Sunday afternoon. The graphics are indeed great, the gameplay is really tight and overall it's a really fun game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2012"}

As if that game wasn't popular enough, the last strategy game they made was the legendary Starcraft.  Well, Blizzard didn't disappoint, with Warcraft 3 being one of the best in the recent batch of real-time strategy games.Unlike Starcraft, Warcraft 3 is much more focused on battle tactics and unit control (\"micro\") rather than base and unit production management.  The introduction of the heroes is a unique twist on RTS gameplay, with the result that Warcraft 3 doesn't really play like any other strategy game on the market.The single-player campaign is incredibly well designed, and the hero mechanic is uniquely suited for this purpose.  Blizzard starts to add tremendous variety to the missions in the expansion pack, with the result that the campaign, though lengthy, never gets monotonous.  The art design and graphics are beautiful and vibrant, while keeping system requirements at a reasonable level (unlike many RTSes currently on the market).The longevity of this product really lies in the multi-player, though.  The automated matchmaking system on battle.net does a great job of matching you with players of similar skill, but there are also a tremendous number of custom made maps developed by players using the Warcraft 3 map editor (\"Defense of the Ancients\", or \"DotA\", being the most popular one).

As you fight your way out of the prison of the damned, even as you are engaged in frenetic combat, the entire room you are in is being twisted and turned by giant hands. Often, I wished I could slow down the action enough to enjoy what the designers had wrought.And finally, there's the wonder at the mythical beasts conjured out of some artist's imagination - manticores, medusas, Cerebrus, etc. will keep you engaged as you try to get to your objective.Overall, I wished I could slow down the action so that I could enjoy the spectacle that this game provides.A few downsides:1/ This game is a gorgeous skin draped over the absolutely thinnest veneer of a story. I'm about a third of the way through the game, and I don't really know much more than when I started. The funny thing is that I don't really care. This game is that good.2/ The camera can be annoying at times. Not being able to change your perspective means you're locked into seeing the world as the game thinks you should. Which is a shame with such awesome backgrounds and sets.3/ The puzzles are silly and the solutions are sillier. The camera will fly over to the solution so there's not much left to your imagination, and some solutions leave you scratching your head especially as they involved trial and error rather than any specific skill that I could discern.4/ The game is also very generous in the power ups you will receive - chests are liberally scattered throughout the landscape, making combat more of a slug fest, requiring nothing more strategic than wading in blades a-swinging.However, in the end none of this matters. This is not a game that has you thinking or making weighty decisions. Instead, it is like being inside a movie as you romp through a fantasy lanscape taking out anything that moves, in spectacular fashion.This is eye candy at its best, and it works!Happy Gaming!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2013"}

This GTA style game features the gang attacks, carjacking and other mature fun that can be played for months.Let me first make it clear that this was never intended to be a game for kids. There is a TON of hard core swearing, and it is pretty much constant. Even walking the streets gets you baragged with swearing. Your missions involve driving prostitutes around and listening to them \"at work\", helping drug dealers make their rounds, bashing up gang members in very violent ways, and so on. This is very clearly aimed towards a mature market, the kind that loves to watch The Sopranos and Scarface.That being said, Saint's Row provides extremely fun escapist fantasy for those who enjoy those worlds. The graphics quality is extremely impressive. You get day-night cycles, and the sunset with the twinkling stars is gorgeous. Each area of your city has its own personality. You can really enjoy walking along the chinatown waterfront in the early morning. The cars have fun touches like spinning wheel add-ons.Many things that were annoying about the Grand Theft Auto series are fixed here. I like the aiming system much better, I like how it saves and how it handles death in missions. Most of the minigames are quite fun and ramp up in difficulty at a reasonable rate. For example you can - right from the start - do a ton of \"Insurance Fraud\" missions and get just about as much money as you could possibly want, and respect as well.Even the basic character customization is impressive. You can be caucasian, African-American, hispanic, or asian - with a lot of details on each type. Yes, you can only be a guy. Someday they'll let girls into these games, in a way other than a prostitute! The hair, tattoo, body piercings, clothing, etc. choices are pretty impressive.The voice acting is stellar. You get David Carradine, Keith David, Michael Clarke Duncan, Tia Carrere, and much more. It really helps you to get involved in the storyline.  The story is sometimes predictable, but heck, this is a gang story. Of course you know that your gang will gain power while you defeat the others. It wouldn't be much of a game if your gang was destroyed quickly :)There are of course a few things they could have done better. There aren't motorcycles. There are a few strange glitches - like when you're hit by a car sometimes and fly up, it teleports you to a train station. The game has frozen once or twice but it seems to be after full-day gaming marathons, so it could easily be the XBox having a temporary meltdown. The cars don't seem to be affected much by damage.In general, this is amazingly fun to play, the world is simply fun to \"be in\" with its graphics and details, and there are always new things to do.Highly, highly recommended for a mature gamer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2006"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E6NE","description":"","reviewerName":"The_Scrutiny","summary":"Wow. Just. Wow. (Unbiased, Spoiler-Free Review!)","reviewText":"4.5/5 OverallAs stated, my review will be spoiler-free. and I won't let the acclaimed ending sway my opinion. I will review this game on its own and will NOT compare it to the first Bioshock.Story: 5/5Simply put, Infinite's story is incredible. IGN said that the the middle feels padded to add game length. False. Everything you do is meaningful. There wasn't anything too far-fetched in my opinion. Elizabeth is such an interesting character, and so is Booker since you don't know too much about him. Some parts of the story were just so gripping, I didn't notice the hours that flew by. Then there's the ending. I won't spoil it, of course, but your perspective of the whole game upon a replay will change. My advice to you: don't ever try to predict what happens (not that you'd succeed anyways) and don't look too far into the Voxophone messages. You'll only hurt your head. Just enjoy what Irrational put out for you.Combat: 5/5Story aside, Infinite also succeeds highly on the combat front. There's endless possibilities when it comes to facing opponents.1.) Your guns. Which will you use against standard foes? Which for Handymen or Motorized Patriots? The weapons themselves are nice and varied, ranging from the standard Pistol and Machine gun, to detonating Hail Fires and volcano-blasting Heat Guns. You can only carry 2 at at time, which some might despise, but I think it adds more of a strategic element, as you'll have to really think which weapons are best.2.) Your vigors. There are 8 total and each has its own good use in combat. It's always satisfying to use them, and each has 2 functions, usually a fire function and trap function. Some negatives: a few vigors will be largely neglected later on when enemies become many, and their secondary functions are usually useless in hectic firefights.3.) Tears. Elizabeth can bring in objects from other worlds to aid in fights. These range from walls for cover to hooks for higher ground to your own ally turret. There's strategy to be had here because you can only have one extra-dimensional object at any time. Bringing in another replaces the former, so you'll be deciding which is best on the go.4.) Environment. Sometimes, just shy of the entrance is a nice weapon you can use that you won't see unless you explore just a little bit. Then there are environmental hazards (puddles, oil slicks, railings barring you all from falling off). A keen eye often translates to an easier time in combat.5.) Skylines. This is the biggest feature in Infinite. Skylines are a blast to use; they're a means of escape from gunfire and a means of offense to use on ground enemies, especially when performing a nice Skyline Strike. Not to mention they're a quick way to get around. Believe me, they don't get old.Setting: 5/5Perfect. Columbia is so gorgeous to wander around in, you'll want to explore. There are dystopian themes abound in Infinite that really breathe personality into the game (e.g. racism, poverty, oppression, civil uprising). The environments include amusement parks, store districts, historical exhibits, you name it!Objectives: 3/5And sadly, here is where the game falters. There are indeed things to do outside of your main objective. These include finding keys to locked chests and deciphering codes to access hidden rooms. Unfortunately, the rewards are predictable: Gear, Infusions, and/or Voxophones. While the Infusions are always nice to get (they upgrade your health/shield/salt capacity), the Gear are always let-downs. These pieces of equipment that offer buffs flat-out suck. There's no motivation to change your gear loadout because the buffs just aren't that interesting. And combat is already sophisticated enough that some people might not bother with gear (I know I didn't). The plus side is that although the game is linear, there are often branching paths that you'll want to explore for more Infusions, Voxophones to add background story, and money for upgrading guns and vigors.Overall:This game is worth every penny. Never before have I been so compelled to get a game at full price when I saw the outstanding critic reviews. Let me tell you, they're not too off from the truth. Do yourself a favor and buy Infinite ASAP. Its brilliantly written story, imaginative setting, and engaging combat make it one of the best games of the generation-this is coming from someone who owns TONS of games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2013"}

Armed with lethal double chainblades, Kratos must carve through mythology's darkest creatures - including Medusa, Cyclops, the Hydra and more, while solving intricate puzzles in breathtaking environments. Driven by pure revenge, nothing can stop Kratos from achieving absolution.","reviewerName":"Jeff Johnson \"Jeff Johnson\"","summary":"Incredible action game with a perfect blend of combat and clever puzzles","reviewText":"Oh God or War, what can I say that hasn't already been said. This is probably one of the best games of its console generation. This is a bloody, mature beat-em up that is disguised as an adventure game. There are really clever puzzles mixed in, a great story, fluid and fun combat, and even upgradable attacks.First let's start with the story. Set in ancient Greece in a world full of Greek mythology, you play as Kratos, a great general that sold his soul to win a battle and as the pawn of the god Aries, Kratos inadvertently kills his wife and child. Because of this, Kratos is a pawn to Aries no more and the entire game is your quest to slay the giant god of war Aries. The story is told in excellently stylized cut scenes that give you little bits of information about what's happening and how you came to get to where you are. The story alone is very solid and logical.Now let's talk about the gameplay, which is amazing, fun, fluid and diverse. Like I mentioned, this is a beat-em up, so you can actually spam one button... but because of the fantastic enemy diversity you need to change your tactics to defeat each enemy. To top that off, when some of the larger enemies are weak, you can execute specific death finishing moves to them that require you to push certain buttons quickly or swirl one of the control sticks. They are a true test of your skill. On top of your standard weapon comes four magic spells that you need to find throughout the game. A Poseidon's rage that will damage everything around you, a Medusa's gaze that will turn enemies to stone, a Zeus's lightning volt that allows you to throw lightning at distant enemies and the last one I won't spoil. Then on top of that you can execute a temporary powerup to help you mow down enemies. The left analog stick controls you and the right analog stick allows you to dodge or move quickly in a brief burst of speed with a roll. There are two attack buttons a jump button (that turns into a double jump), a block, a shoulder charge, a magic button and the D-pad selects the spell. These are just the combat options. Then there are swimming controls that you obtain a few hours into the game, and even fighting and swinging mechanics for when you're hanging from ropes. This game has a lot of depth.The enemies are diverse and you might kill a million foes on your way to meet Aries, but you will never be bored from it. Everything from standard soldiers to Minotaur, Cyclopes, archers, Gorgons (Medusas), hydras, skeletons and so on. Everything is different and looks awesome. There are different attack patterns and ways you need to deal with them. The bosses are gigantic, you really feel good when you've tackled one of them, simply because boss battles are epic and might take you ten minutes to take one down without dying. Ten minutes of action and not hiding, in fact this game has no emphasis on hiding or stealth. You are Kratos and you are up to the challenge of anything. That's something the game really achieves, you feel powerful, without feeling overpowered.Between the fighting, there are clever puzzles. Excellent puzzles that keep you playing even if some of them are daunting. The game always has something to break up the fighting that you will enjoy completing. The puzzles are sometimes relaxing, no pressure puzzles to timed, death puzzles. Not everything is wildly heart pumping, some things are sedate and the music will even change to reflect that.Next comes the sound design. The sound is awesome and the music is incredible for keeping the pace of the game and getting your blood pumping. The music sounds empowering to you as a player. Any orchestra would love to play this music and it becomes engraved in your head as one of the best themes in history, not just gaming history.Last are the graphics, which stand out as a selling point. Everything is beautiful from standard enemies to wide vistas. Plus, to top that off, there are contrasting visuals, such as you a man standing inside of this gigantic fortress that has no end... that is ontop of a giant's back crawling in a desert. There is a certain awe that you will feel when you run through a city that in the horizon has a giant Aries fighting an entire army in the background. Your jaw will drop in amazement at some things you will see.In conclusion, this is an awesome game that every action fan should play through to the end. There are also some awesome unlockables and reasons to play again and again. There are different things to find, other nooks to explore. God or War is an amazing game that is a true epic classic. Kudos to everyone who made it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2012"}

The game then rewinds to a time period three weeks earlier.  Kratos is aboard a ship that is attacked by the Hydra.  Later Kratos is sent on a grand journey to save the city of Athens from Ares who is attacking the city and reigning destruction upon it.  Kratos' mission takes him through Athens, into the desert, and down to Hades.  Kratos takes on harpies, gorgons, cyclopes, minotaurs, centaurs, undead warriors, wraiths, Cerberus dogs, and satyrs.  In order to defeat Ares, he has to find Pandora's box (ironic isn't it that the box that brought all terrible things into the world is the one item that can be used to defeat a god). It's an engaging story.The graphics are of excellent quality.  The scenery is both majestic and savage.  The fighting is violent and graphic as  Kratos rips creatures in half, tears off their heads, or savagely beats beings to death.  Blood splatters all over and the sound of breaking bones is common.The game play combines elements from role-playing, fighting games, platform games, and puzzle games.  The game can originally be played one of three different modes: Mortal (Easy), Hero (Average), and Spartan (Hard).  I played the game in Hero mode and other than two or three instances didn't have much difficulty during the fighting sequences.  I found the most challenging elements of the game to be the puzzle solving sequences.After beating the game, a series of extras are unlocked including God (Super-Hard) mode.  Defeat the game in Spartan mode and more extras are unlocked.  The extras that are unlocked regardless of the level played include some deleted scenes, a documentary about the creation of the game, a cut-scene telling about Kratos' younger brother who grew up to hate Kratos, all the in-game movies, character graveyard, a challenge of the gods mini-game of ten challenges, and a few others.  This was the first time I've ever played a video game that included more extras and special features than most DVDs.The game only takes about 8-10 hours to beat and with the different levels, makes it user friendly for any skill level.  The game is quite violent and also includes a few scenes with woman baring their breasts so it's not a game for younger children.  However, overall GOD OF WAR is a great video game.

{"product_name":"B0058SHO5I","description":"","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"Even old New York was once New Amsterdam...","reviewText":"As soon as your game's name mentions being for kids in the title, that's usually a red flag as far as quality's concerned. Most developers churn out a kid's game without having much of an understanding of what it takes to make a good kid's game. And for a 'grown up' system like the Xbox 360, it's rare to get one that isn't a platformer or movie-based game. It's even more rare when it turns out to be one that uses the Kinect, and is a music game of sorts. Just Dance Kids 2 is one of those games that I sighed at when it arrived in my mailbox, but shocked me at how much time UBI Soft put into making it a great package. But here's a quick warning for parents thinking about getting this title- this game is more for kids ages 4-7. Kids older than that will probably be ready for the regular dance games, but as usual, it depends on the person playing it. There are a lot of songs on here that anyone past the 2nd grade will probably roll their eyes at once they see them. That aside, if you have a young child, Just Dance Kids 2 is worth a shot.Just Dance Kids 2 has a fairly good selection of songs, and I was glad to see two tracks from Yo Gabba Gabba! and the infamous Gummy Bear song listed. Even the 'classics' are pretty good, though I don't know if any youngsters will know any of them in this day and age. Unless you're showing them Tiny Toon Adventures dvds or you're a big They Might Be Giants fan, there's not much of a chance that they'll know Istanbul. The game itself plays like your typical dance game, and grading is a little generous compared to something like say, Everybody Dance. If my old tubby self from the early 90s were to play this game now, I'd probably be getting above average scores and feeling like a Disco Stu[d].  Of all the features included with Just Dance Kids 2, the one that surprised me was the tracker that shows how long your child has been playing, which song they've played the most, and about how many calories have been burned. You know what else is cool? They even included a 'Pose & Shake' mode that has your child pretending to play instruments in the song. It might not seem like much, but the fact that they threw it in here is nice. Finally it has to be said that the kids dancing in the game are full of energy and look genuinely happy to be doing all of the dances. Even the little dude dressed up as Gru for the Despicable Me track looked into it, despite portraying a bad guy.There's not much negative to say about Just Dance Kids 2. It's a cheap game, so you won't feel like you've been ripped off, the gameplay is simple to get into, and it has a lot of great features. I just feel that the covers of the songs on here could've had a bit more energy in them (was it that hard to get the rights to the original songs?), and it would've been even better if the songs would've been played out in full rather than shortened versions. But with everything else the game gets right, I won't nitpick too much. Just Dance Kids 2 is one of the better games for young kids at the moment, and would be ideal for parties and holiday get-togethers.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2012"}

This is my first one. I was not disappointed and I hope they release the series on one of the newer consoles.Story: Set after DMC1 but before DMC2, you are Nero heading rapidly towards an opera house wanting to see your loves (Kyrie) performance. After her performance, the high priest Sanctus begins a sermon only to be interrupted by Dante who slays him and some of the guards. You fight Dante for a short time and after he reveals that the Holy Knights are actually demons. Afterward, you are sent to investigate and learn the true nature of Knights and Dante's intentions.Gameplay: This is an action, hack 'n' slash game. You control Nero and later on Dante, fighting through missions to advance the plot. Some missions require some puzzles to solve to advance. The fighting is amazing with Nero and his Demonic arm. He has tons of combo moves to use. The fighting is given a grade based on number of combos and damage taken. You can receive a D (Deadly), a C (Carnage), a B (Brutal), an A (Atomic), an S (Smokin'), an SS (Smokin' Style) or an SSS (Smokin' Sick Style). After each mission, you are given a grade. You take on hordes of demons and some killer bosses. You have a special move called the Devil Trigger that makes you more powerful for a short time, and adding a slow health regeneration. You collect currency from enemies in the form of Proud Souls (used to buy new abilities) or Red Orbs (used to buy items). Nero's weapon called the Red Queen sword, has a special exceed gauge that charges up and allows for powerful attacks. As Dante, you have several melee weapons that you acquire after defeating bosses. You have 4 styles to use; Trickster, Royal Guard, Sword Master, and gunslinger, each grant him different abilities.Conclusion: the graphics are very nice and the controls are easy to use. The cut scenes are beautifully done (and Trish looks very nice in them). Worth picking up even if you haven't played any of the series yet. Very fun game and the replay value is high.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2011"}

After the events of the original game, Raccoon City has been overrun by zombies and heroine Jill Valentine must make her last escape.This game is still a solid experience after half a decade.

Another thing I've always liked about RE3 is how it allows you to really explore the ruins of Raccoon city, something only hinted at in Resident Evil 2. The main story here isn't quite as strong as other installments in the series, but its still gripping enough to pull you in.

The tension would grow, making every turn feel scary, every room was full of surprises, and the concept of \"survival\" was the main backbone of the gameplay.  In many situations, the games would make you actually avoid confrontations, due to the lack of healing items and the lack of ammo.  This would greatly contribute to the overall \"horror\" of the games, making you feel as if you were truly fighting for your life.With the launch of Resident Evil 4, the horror elements were almost completely gone.  Replacing \"survival\" tactics with an over-the-shoulder gun mechanism, very similar to that of Gears of War.  The enemy was never hidden, always in clear sight to be shot at, and the game always provided ammo, a gameplay mechanic that shooters use.  Replacing the traditional \"zombie\" enemy with a more human looking variety, the game lost almost all of its tension and fear inducing gameplay.  Instead, Resident Evil 4 became an action game, and when compared to already highly regarded franchises within the action/shooter genre, Resident Evil 4 was mediocre in comparison.Resident Evil 5 plays exactly like its last generation brethren.  The horror elements have been toned down even further, now allowing the supposedly \"zombie\" enemies to use firearms and maneuver vehicles, once again trying to establish the game as a decent shooter/action game.  At no point in the game did I experience any high level of tension and I never feared an unexpected enemy onslaught, since neither of these things exist in Resident Evil 5.The game is still quite good, but it just isn't \"Resident Evil\".  The story follows Chris Redfield and Sheva Alomar in Kijuju, Africa.  With the addition of another character, the player must monitor Sheva's health at all times, or be greeted by the \"game over\" screen, resulting in repeated attempts at the same mission.  The inventory system has been downgraded from all of the previous games, now only truly allowing the player to substitute items between chapters.  Chris was assigned to assist Sheva in the process of stopping a man from selling bio weapons to others on the black market.  As they progress further into the local villages, they realize that the civilians who appear normal, have been turned into \"monsters\" after being force fed parasites.  The game features over the top moments, including the confrontation with Wesker which really feels more like it belongs in \"The Matrix\" rather than Resident Evil.If you can overlook the lack of horror and survival elements, than Resident Evil 5 is a decent third person shooter.  However, it still doesn't hold up very well when compared to other games within the genre such as Uncharted, Gears of War, Dead Space, and Mass Effect.  Personally, Gears of War is my favorite franchise of all time, but Resident Evil 5 fails to accomplish the same level of intensity that Gears of War provides.  Resident Evil 5 seems to be confused about its identity; wanting to be both an action game and a horror game, yet not providing enough horror to be classified as a horror game, and not being as in depth as other action games, RE5 gets lost in the shuffle.  If you're looking for a great action game, you can't go wrong with any of the previously mentioned titles.  If you're looking for a horror game, stick to games like: Dead Space, F.E.A.R., Condemned, Silent Hill, and possibly Bioshock.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2010"}

Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would.

But then it's like when you look at a movie star on an HDTV, and you see its appalling horrors that lie within it. To start off the controls suck greatly. For example; when turning a corner you will notice how you can't seem to keep your vehicle on the road, and it constantly slips and swerves like you're driving in snow. Another problem; the absence of a sense of speed. When I was driving I never felt the sense of speed that should be in racers. Instead, it felt like I was maybe only going about 40mph or less. Problem #3; the lack of interesting tracks to race on. When going through the various tracks I never felt compelled to look at the environments around me solely for the fact that they were so boring. Problem #4; crappy career mode. Never, in my years of playing various racers did I ever go through a career mode that was so dull and made me feel so unwanting to complete it one day. Problem #5; crappy multiplayer. Wow, what a horribly dull and unexciting way to challenge a friend to a race! Here's how it went; we raced around the boring tracks, swerved like we were driving in snow, and we were totally bored.

{"product_name":"B00007LVJD","reviewerName":"maninblue \"maninblue\"","summary":"Frustratingly bad AI, but all else is fair and good","reviewText":"This game frustrates me.  Games are not supposed to do that.  I like a challenge but I have noticed that the poor intelligence of the individual units, combined with the horribly clunky interface makes for a frustratingly frantic click-fest. The units will make poor decisions on when they attack the enemy for example; you might order your fleet of tanks to move to a location, but when they get attacked, the tanks will usually ignore them and wait for you to tell them what to do.  In long games with many tasks to handle at once, this gets annoying, and you will end up losing whole armies because your units wont fight back on their own, instead they sit their idle.  In some cases, your supply gatherers will be under fire, but instead of retreating, they continue their routes and ultimately explode.  The worst thing is that the game wont warn you when your units are attacked or taking damage, only your buildings. You only know that you are attacked when you lose a unit.  By that time you are toast anyway.  You have to keep an eye on an impossibly small area map that will give you one small red radar \"blip\" when you are attacked.  If you fail to see that, you fail to come out without casualties.  Giving commands to units is like pulling teeth.  You cannot have units patrol an area like you can in the Starcraft or Warcraft games.  You can only have units guard and area, in which case they will simply sit idle and take fire, only returning fire when the enemy is within range.  This is laughable.  Setting waypoints for units is also clunky.One more thing really irritated me.  My buddy had a stealth unit in my base setting demolition charges on my buildings.  One by one they exploded, but I had no idea that my base was being destroyed because I was too busy micromanaging my dopey units somewhere else.  I didn&#65533;t even know what was going on until I tried to select my jets, but they were not selecting. That&#65533;s when I looked over to the airbase to see why and realized that my base was 80% ashes and debris.  There were no warnings or anything.  It&#65533;s that lack of game polish that is making me sell this game.  Otherwise the graphics, sound, and overall funfactor are all good.  It&#65533;s fun to play on the LAN, but still frustrating.  I know my way around this game well and still yell at the screen, telling my stupid units to move.  It is this fact that takes away from the strategic element and turns this game into a finger aching click-fest.  Whoever can build the most units in a given time will win, hands down.  I enjoy anything from Blizzard much more. If this game simply used Blizzards RTS interface, it would really shine, but since your options are limited and so is the intelligence of your units, you are out of luck and expect to be screaming at your monitor more that once.Three and a half stars is accurate","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2003"}

The game starts, I move around, kill the enemy, move around, level complete.  What the hell?  That is what I thought the first day I played.  As soon as I start getting into the game, it&#8217;s over.  I understand there are things that must be done, but I&#8217;ve not a clue what they are.  The game seems to just sits you in a location and gives you a task.  They do not do a very good job of letting you know why your doing it or, as I said, even what your doing.  I almost feel like I am watching a video of other people playing.  It just never feels like a game.  Perhaps it&#8217;s just me.I guess that is all I will say about the game.

Games that encouraged you to run mindlessly around, shooting other people, didn't seem to have much value. That was until I played CounterStrike, though.I've always been a HUGE fan of strategy. Games that encouraged you to think, to plan ahead and to execute the plan as a team, really thrilled me. When I saw my first games of Counterstrike, it was like watching Band of Brothers on HBO. One unit worked together to the left, while another coordinated on the right. Each followed the plan closely to capture the flag. Yes, you knocked out the enemy. But it was in the persuit of a goal, to achieve an objective.It was AMAZINGLY fun!Some people might object that it's bloody, that it promotes people killing people. If you're going to worry about games that have winners and losers, then any game of tag, or dodge-ball or 'cowboys and indians' is going to fall victim. Here, people who are shot respawn so they can regroup with their team. The victory goes to the smartest team with the best plan - the team that works well together and defends each other. I don't know of a better objective for a game.Best of all, being a net game, this can easily be played as a family. Your uncle in Texas, your aunt in Mississippi, and your cousin in California can join into the game, all playing vital roles regardless of their location, age, sex, color, or anything else.I highly recommend this as a game for anyone over 12, and I'd encourage you to get a few copies to give to other friends and family members.

{"product_name":"B0002BJQDY","description":"Guild Warstakes the best elements of today's massively multiplayer online games and combines them with a new mission-based design that eliminates the tedium of those games. You can meet new friends in towns or outposts, form a party, and then go tackle a quest together. Your party always has its own unique copy of the quest map, so camping, kill-stealing, and long lines to complete quests are all things of the past. Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder.You don't have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don't have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you've previously unlocked. You'll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn't allow bad decisions to ruin a character. And you'll never meet new players only to discover that you can't play with them or compete against them because their characters are on a different server than yours; in Guild Wars, all characters live in one seamless world.Built for CompetitionAfter learning the game and building up your first character, you may choose to test your skills in head-to-head competition or guild warfare. The game is designed to reward player skill and teamwork, not time spent playing, so you won't need to spend hundreds of hours leveling up your character to compete.The game includes integrated support for guilds, with guild banners and halls, chat rooms and forums. Guilds can challenge other guilds to battle, compete for control of key parts of the world, and be ranked on a worldwide ladder.Unique Streaming TechnologyArenaNet's unique streaming technology forever eliminates the concept of patching a game. You don't have to wait a month for the next big patch to experience new content. Instead, the game constantly and intelligently streams new content to your computer in the background while you play. The world can change continually. This allows us to build a much more dynamic game world than any that has existed before.","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"If you are looking at this, why haven't you bought it already?","reviewText":"Do you hate online RPGs because you have to pay money? do you want a good looking game with a solid gameplay system? Look no further.You may be trying to compare this to World of Warcraft, but they aren't really compareable. Guild Wars defines a genre somewhere between multi and single player, and has no known clones.There are two modes in the game, PvP and Cooperative. In my opinion PvP is better, yet cooperative is also very fun with a good story.There are six characters to choose from (eight if you have factions, ten if you have nightfall). Each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. For example, the elementalist has the most mana of any class, his spells are also the most powerfull. Yet, the elementalist has a low health capacity and bad armor. The warrior, on the other hand, has next to no mana, yet he does not need it for his abilities, he also has the best weapons and armor.The game is very balanced, and easy to dive into, it also seems to satisfy the wants of both the casual and hardcore gammer. A casual gammer can dive into Guild Wars for fifteen minutes at a time and still have fun in PvP. The hardcore gammer will play throught the cooperative mode and then find alot of fun in PvP.The graphics are great, clean, beautiful, and fast. The sound is equally as good.

A-","reviewText":"(Taken from gamespot, under the name darksongbird)Difficulty:Just RightTime Spent:10 to 20 HoursThe Bottom Line:\"All it's cracked up to be\"This game is excellent. It's got 8 characters: Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Princess Peach, Wario, Princess Daisy, Toad (my favorite) and WaLuigi. I still think Birdo would have been an awesome unlockable character but ultimately you get to unlock bonus items that don't even matter in the slightest (and can be viewed in the gallery later).The levels are all pretty different and are as follows:1. Wiggler's Garden2. Toadette's Music Room3. DK's Stone Statue4. Kamek's Library5. Bowser's Pinball MachineThe bosses are:1. Pirahna Plant (catch bombs and wait until they light, and then throw them back into his mouth)2. Hammer Bro (follow his musical patterns, repeat them and return his musical notes before they hit you)3. Dry Bones (push buttons to make magic hit Dry Bones)4. Kamek the sorcerer (fly past books and bookcases, get to his lair and spout ink at him until he gets fuming mad. Something happens after he gets mad, but I forget. Maybe ink does beat him ultimately. I don't recall.)5. Boswer (hit the golden block of each of his various forms, while avoiding being smashed and spat fire at. Can be very testing so don't give up!)The graphics are good, and the screens right before the boss battles are excellent and only prove what the DS can do graphically. Really, it reminds me of Super Mario Galaxy, but not as graphically impressive when looking at those shots. I also like the art of the characters when tallying up the coins after each mini game. I play close attention to details so I appreciated that too.The music is plain Mario Party affair BUT when you enter world 4, Kamek's Library then you get a taste of greatness. Not only was this level the most fun to play, as well as the boss battle the most entertaining but the music was very fitting and perfect. I could listen to it for a long time.I have yet to play with others but you can also play with up to three people, locally, using just one game card (provided they all have DSes of course).The controls are pretty good for this game, although I still don't understand the game where you carve out shapes. I can't carve out one single shape and I trace rather well. I lost that game multiple times, even practicing more than once beforehand.Some of my all-time favorites are Star Catcher, Soccer Survival and the one where you have to blow out candles before you step on them. I also love the one where you blow on the mic to freeze your enemies in the snowman. That one is E-A-S-Y. Overall, I'm quite pleased with the game and find that it's even better than Mario Party 2 which was probably the peak of the series.However, it's not without it's faults. Correct me if I'm wrong, but there are Mario Party points that you earn after you complete a successful board game (whether you come out winning or losing) tallying up your coins, stars, turns and so on. It unlocks a lot of things like random items that have NO USE. Are they for decorating or something? Feel free to comment if you know what they're for. But so far I've gotten pointless items for a mindless collection.Like after I beat the fiend in Toadette's board, The Hammer Bros., I got Toadette's stool. HOW am I going to use that? Even if I could decorate the board with it, wouldn't that be extremely pointless unless you were like 5-9 in age? There are no unlock-able characters or levels and after you beat the 5 levels in the game, I'm sure there's nothing left (besides Triangle Twisters). There are 8 characters in the game which isn't a bad amount but there could have been more (as well as more boards).Unlocking Birdo or various other Mario characters would have evened out the score (especially for the bad guys). Birdo would have been cool. And unlocking maybe two more levels would have been perfect.That's that. I think I touched on every main part I wanted to.But those are minor complaints.Here's how I rate the game:Characters: B+ (see complaints above)Graphics: B- (good but doesn't push boundries like Super Mario RPG or Golden Sun probably did upon release)Sound: C+ (A- for Kamek's Library)Game-play & Fun: A- (Mic games are the best)Replay Value: B- (there's always playing mini-games or a board game or two with your friends).Overall: A-","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2009"}

The first thing you notice is you have to \"log On\" to even play a single player game. You're placed into what looks like a lobby to select your game and options even if all you want is to play a single player game. After looking thru the options I was able to find a single player option but it still appeared as if I was in a \"lobby\" instead of on my own system playing against my computer.  In the pass, you had to select a multi-player menu to get to the online mode. This was the first real turn off for me. Also I noted that the way the game is set up places all the in game options under that \"lobby\" type set up. (Another turn off for me.) So the whole set up seems to be done to get players to \"play online\". I feel the having to log on to play a single player game is a major departure form the ability to select a single play game and not be in placed into a online gaming set up. I like the Steam experience better even if you still must enter a activation code to play. At least there, once you do, you don't have to log into the game itself each time you just have to be logged into Steam.  All the options such as normal, easy or hard are placed under the single player game while still being in what looks like a game lobby to me. The game play screen looks different too and it was a bit hard for me to figure out what to do. I just didn't like the appearance of always being in a \"game lobby\". This alters the game play experience for me. I don't normally play multi-player games as I really don't enjoy these type of games and like playing against the CPU. So this whole set up really bothered me and I just didn't like it. If you like multi-player games, you may like this one, but it's not my cup of tea.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2014"}

I'm surprised that the game looks good, feels good, and has some shocking moments with an actual interesting story. This is something you wouldn't expect from a military shooter set in Dubai, but it's here to prove you wrong. The game has you following a team of three through Dubai trying to track down a man named Konrad who has led the 33rd battalion to go rogue. The story doesn't really ever make a lot of sense, but the shocking moments throughout are entertaining and memorable.The game has a lot of real world weapons to shoot and they feel good, but not as good as other shooters you have grown to love. Some weapons have some sort of alternate mode like burst fire, laser sight, grenade launcher, or a scope, but other than that the weapons are standard affair. The game tries to use environment as a weapon, but doesn't really pull through. You can shoot glass out glass that has a bunch of trapped sand behind it to bury enemies, but there's only a few spots in the whole to do this. There are some epic set pieces throughout the game like hanging onto a gas truck while firing a grenade launcher, using a mini-gun in a helicopter, and a few moral choice points in the game.These moral choices are pretty disturbing like seeing two men hanging from a freeway sign. You have to choose one or the other to survive. Another section has you firing white phosphorous down on soldiers, but you end up killing tons of civilians in the process. The cut scenes that lead up to, and after these moments are pretty shocking and gruesome. This is something I would not expect from a military shooter, and I hope others follow suit. In between these moments is just monotonous shooting and boring brown deserts to look at which really bring the great moments down. The characters are at least interesting as their mental state deteriorates as the game progresses and you start to feel for them which is also rare in military shooters full of cookie cutter one-man-armies.I constantly wanted more of those shocking moments, but they were far and few between. It was just bad guy after bad guy and they all look the same after a while. You can wander around and pick up intelligence items, but how many of us are tired of doing this in shooters? The cover system at least works pretty well and is similar to Gears of War, but not as fluid. Then there's the multiplayer that is standard affair and won't keep you coming back for very long.Overall, Spec Ops has some shocking story moments that give you choice and question your moral standards. In between these moments are monotonous shooting segments through boring and brown environments. Even the sand elements are not put to good use and are almost forgotten half-way through the game. This is a fun weekend rental, but don't expect any miracles.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2012"}

Risk Everything. Trust No One.","reviewerName":"Colin Brown \"Colin Brown Microsoft MVP\"","summary":"Buggy, annoying and frustrating at times but keeps pulling you back in for more.","reviewText":"EA's Need for Speed series was great when it first came out years ago then took a major nosedive. The quality wasn't there, the gameplay wasn't there and it just seemed that EA was just trying to ride on the name.Need for Speed Rivals is the latest in the series and one of the few games available for the &#34;next gen&#34; consoles, so I thought I'd give it a try.The first thing you need to know about this game is that it is online only. You will need an xbox live gold membership to play this game.  Why EA chose to go this route I have no idea.  For a single player game you should have the choice of playing locally or online, not just online only.  And this leads to a major frustration (more on that later).In this one you can choose to play either as a racer, a cop or both (to complete the game you need to do both).  You can switch &#34;careers&#34; at any time.  With each race you get 3 choices which defines what kind of races you are about to take part in, be it time trials, going head to head against other online or computer controlled players, getting a take-down (wrecking a racer) within a certain amount time, drifting for a certain amount of yards etc. etc.  The choices are fairly varied and add dimensions to the game.With each level you get added &#34;tech&#34; that you can purchase for your car, like shock waves that push other cars out of your way, turbos if you are playing as a racer etc.  Also with each level you unlock a new car.  Check the stats of the cars you have just unlocked as they are not always better cars.  There is a fairly wide array of cars that you can choose from when you get to later levels.  Also depending on the choice of gameplay you have elected to play for that level, different cars get unlocked.Be prepared to get annoyed and frustrated.  There are some fairly major bugs in the game.  First off as I touched on earlier, this game is online only.  You will on occasion find yourself racing along, trying to get your goals for the level, or just trying to rack up points, being chased by cops and trying to escape them when suddenly you get a message saying that you have been disconnected and transferring game.  It's fairly good at putting you back at the exact point that you left but you have just went from motoring along at 200mph to a dead standstill, at which point the cops ram into you and you are busted, losing all your hard fought in game credits.This is another really annoying feature.  If you are playing as a racer, when you get busted you lose all of your credits and get taken back to your garage.  I can understand that there needs to be some kind of penalty (maybe lose half your credits or 25% of your credits) but to lose all of them is really annoying, especially when you've been playing for about 30 minutes to build up your credits, run into one of the games bugs and get busted through no fault of your own, losing everything.When racing along (this has happened multiple times in both cops and racer modes) suddenly the in-game map pops up even though you haven't pressed the button to make it appear.  When the map pops up, the game continues in the background but you lose all control of the car, you are controlling the cursor in the map, so you very frequently crash which can lead to you losing all your hard fought for credit.Another major bug is when you are racing along, suddenly the camera starts panning around your car in a 360 degree shot.  When travelling at 200mph it is almost impossible to drive when you are looking head on at your car and can't see the road ahead of you.  This again will lead to crashes and the potential of losing all your in-game credits.There are some other bugs in the game but I won't go into them all.Even with the bugs in the game however there is something that just pulls you back in and makes you want to complete your tasks or get your credits so that you can buy the next car, or tech.  Yes the game can be extremely annoying at times but you just want to complete it so EA have hit on a formula that works and Need for Speed goes back to its good old days again.The map that you drive around isn't huge but isn't small either.  The last event that you compete in is a race around the outskirts of the complete playing area.  Travelling at an average of around 180-200mph it still takes you 20 minutes to complete this race.Need for Speed Rivals is a very annoying and frustrating game at times but the gameplay (when it works) is good enough to keep pulling you back in for more.  So if you have a gold membership for Xbox then I would recommend it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2013"}

In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

It was a successor to the previous Dooms and with a major upgrade, especially in the graphics. Needless to say, I couldn't wait to play it. I was, however, sorely disappointed.Pros1. Probably the best graphics in a videogame ever.2. Some pretty cool environmennts.3. Can scare the hell out of you.4. Easy to pick up and play. True to the original.Cons1. Very, VERY dark. 3/4 of the game is frustratingly dark. Sometimes  it adds a cool scare effect, but most of the times its just plain frustrating. Not being able to hold a gun and use a light at the same time is just unforgiveable (unless you use a mod).2. Story seems like an afterthought and just messes with the gameplay.3. Weapons aren't that great and aren't that fun to use. No secondary fire in this type of FPS is also inexcusable.4. Can become fairly monotonous.5. Very little interactivity. Hardly anything can be interacted with unless its part of the mission, yet there is so much stuff that looks as though you should be able to interact with it.6. Online multiplayer is only 4 players, which is absolutely ridiculous for a first person shooter on PC. Also, its very susceptible to lag.7. Most monsters die the same way and become very predictable.As you can see there are many things wrong with this game, and very little right. I would definitely not recommend it unless you really would like to see the fantastic graphics providing you have a very high end system. The game is not entirely bad however, it is OK to play, its just that considering the immense hype and compared to current first person shooters it lacks in way too many areas.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00503E8S2","description":"","reviewerName":"Joshua Eyre \"LinePlaneVolume\"","summary":"The franchise is slipping","reviewText":"I played the first Call of Duty on a friend's PC way back and had fond memories of my short experience with it. Next, was COD2 for the 360 and I loved it. The game was challenging when played on Veteran, but always seemed reasonable. It had a good story, and just felt tight. I didn't really get into multiplayer at this point.Next, Call of Duty 3 was a let-down. It was buggy and just felt like it was missing something. After a little research, I discovered that it was developed by a back-up studio and I really started to appreciate how good the original developer, Infinity Ward, was at their craft.So, I was super-excited about Call of Duty 4, and it didn't disappoint. The graphics were excellent, the story was epic, and I even got into the excellent, revolutionary, multiplayer. Infinity Ward did it again! It was, for me, my top action shooter ever.Now that I knew what to expect from Treyarch, the second developer, I didn't really have high hopes for World at War and wasn't surprised to find that, at least the single player, was pretty dull... Dull enough that I have yet to finish it. I was bored enought with WW2 shooters at that point to not even really delve into multiplayer. Thinking back, it may have also been a result of Treyarch locking players out who hadn't purchased extra content. I may be wrong, but I remember not being able to easily get into a game at a certain point. So, more hate on Treyarch from me.I was, again, ready for the next Infinity Ward iteration, Modern Warfare 2. I got it, and it felt a little less magical. The campaign story was bombastic and incoherent and, at the end, I didn't really feel satisfied. The multiplayer, while fun, and addictive, felt like I was at a disadvantage... Dieing when I was safely under cover, only to see a completely different version on the opponent's kill-cam... me, out in the open, peppered with bullets. It could have been lag, but I was on a good connection, so maybe it was the way they changed how the games were hosted? I got a bit frustrated with it, but played a lot, enjoyed the maps, and mostly had fun.Treyarch! Again I took a gamble and got Treyarch's next version, Black Ops. Surprisingly enough, although the campaign was so-so, the multiplayer was a lot of fun. The dieing under cover issue seemed to be less prevalent, the maps were well designed, and I spent a good deal of time enjoying multiplayer.Dun-dun-dun... Modern Warfare 3! Over the prior year plus, the original Infinity Ward team had been dramatically destroyed from within, by Activision's management team. Many of the Infinty Ward team jumped ship to follow some of the top guys to a new independent studio. It was a cause for concern, but I thought, maybe, enough of the old team were left to carry on the quality expectations that Infinity Ward had engendered, for the most part, excepting the hiccups in Modern Warfare 2. So, it was with slight trepidation, I opened my copy of Modern Warfare 3, popped it in, and jumped into multiplayer.Within a very short amount of time, well almost immediately, I gathered that the maps lacked any sort of character that many of the old maps had. Not only did they all feel very similar, but they had been designed full of openings so that you, at an incredibly annoying rate, get shot in the back. The old maps tended to be designed so you could run around, watch your corners, and be wary of the several flanking spots. Now, nearly every 10 feet, there's a spot where someone can pop out of a hole from nearly 6 places at once, meaning, if you choose to run around, you will get shot in the back. And, Call of Duty is nothing, if not a run and gun game. So what happens when a run and gun game has maps that make it hard to run and gun?I read that these maps were designed to discourage camping, but you almost have to stay in one place to have a chance of not dieing in constant cross-fires. And, I would assume that these small maps, full of holes, would not be very ideal for snipers, which is fine with me, because I never snipe. But, good god, if these maps are not chock full of snipers running around, laying waste at close range, by simply tapping on the aim button and instantly pulling the trigger. But, sniping involves careful positioning, long range, and time, right? Apparently, not in Modern Warfare 3. The designers consciously allow players to have the game aim for them (auto aiming, aka quick-scoping), which sort of feels like cheating, and certainly removes any of the skill of actually aiming, and pulling the trigger, on the mark. When you run into a room, sporting an assault rifle, put 3+ bullets in an opponent's chest, and he still is able to pull the aim trigger, fire, and one shot kill you, without actually aiming, just doesn't make a lot of sense, and is slightly more frustrating than what you might call fun. Add to the fact that you can also shoot someone several times while they bull-rush through the hail of direct, knock even a fantasy video game guy off his feet, hits, and stab you to death in 1 slash... yeah, not fun either. Still dieing, with magical fly around corner bullets, when at least a second under cover, too? Yup. Still on a connection where that probably shouldn't be an issue? Yup.So, terrible maps full of constantly getting shot in the back goodness, mechanics that reward non-skill, and legacy connection/lag issues that I'm sure could be fixed with dedicated servers, makes for... lots of Un-fun. COD4, Modern Warfare 2, and Black Ops had great maps that were lots of fun. Why such a huge step back? At this stage, this game is not even worthy of an $8 map pack add-on to one of the old games. It has some new modes, perks, and killstreak rewards, but it's not worth it without the well designed maps, and a slew of regressive mechanics.Lest I forget the single player campain, and spec ops; The campaign, to about the half-way point, feels just as dumb and incoherent as Modern Warfare 2. It's chock-full of giant explosions, and no longer shocking deaths of your playable characters. Half the time, it feels like you're just watching. I'll finish it at some point, but I always used to play the story first. As the games have gone on, and the stories have gotten more re-hashy, poorly written, and cliche, I've cared less about enjoying that singular experience. But as both sides, single and multiplayer, devolve into a mess, what's left? Spec Ops, and the attached Survival Mode, are a nice distration, but these are bonus features. They can't even begin to carry the game.When compared to the vast selection of games that are available, Modern Warfare 3 is not a bad game. It's polished, it's loud, and it has a lot of content. Tons of people will buy it, and continue to buy it for iterations to come, but as of this version, at least from the smoking shell that was Infinity Ward's greatness, I'm probably done. It's just not fun anymore and has lost its inspiration. Respawn, the new version of Infinity Ward, is working on a new title with, apparent, creative freedom. I'll look forward to that. I'll continue to have Dice's style of multiplayer ( Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3 ) grow on me, which Modern Warfare 3 has heartily encouraged. And, I'll lament the now lost risk taking that Infinity Ward pushed through with Call of Duty 4, but I fear Activision's corporate interests have sunk that boat. And, to top it all off, what's with all of the glowing critical reviews of a game professional critics should recognize for its iterative failings? I think that's a rhetorical question referencing the prior sentence.I don't always think a 5 star scale is quite specific enough, so I'll go to 10 and give Modern Warfare a 6 out of 10. For reference...COD4 = 10MW2 = 8.5MW3 = 6","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002BS47TE","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Hideo Kojima Hits The Sweet Spot","reviewText":"\"Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker\" may very well be the best handheld video game I've played in my life. After tenstraight hours of complete immersion in Hideo Kojima's world of sci-fi political espionage, there is nothing thatcan convince me any other game on a handheld system has presented such an epic scope, heart-wrenching story andtight gameplay as the latest entry in the venerable \"Metal Gear\" franchise.Taking place a decade after \"MGS 3: Snake Eater\", \"Peace Walker\" finds Snake, aka \"Big Boss\", a shell of his formerself. Sure, he's still strong, deadly and ruthless, but he's an emotional trainwreck after being forced to killthe woman whom he loved and was trained by. Ten years still can't wipe away the pain he feels, and even distractinghimself with the private mercenary organization he's founded can't make him forget. But one fateful day, a mysteriousman and young girl come forth with a mission that involves restoring peace to Cuba. Snake initially refuses, butwhen the man presents an audio tape which suggests that the woman he thought dead to still be living, he rushes headlonginto the mission, unaware of the consequences which await him. On the surface, it may seem like a simple \"stop thebad guys from nuking the world\" type of plot, but fans of the series will realize that it's much more; this game isa spiritual journey for our tortured protagonist, filled with twists and turns every step of the way.The gameplay has gotten an overhaul from previous PSP entries of MGS, and I have to admit: it's really for the better.Close-quarters combat (CQC) has been streamlined and assigned to one button, making it incredibly easy to dispatchwhole mobs of foes with nothing more than your fists and a quick trigger finger. Also more simple this time aroundis the gunplay; no longer do you have to stand in an awkward position to get off a good shot on your enemies. Kojimatook the fast-paced gun battles of \"MGS 4: Guns of the Patriots\" and put them onto the PSP with no complicationswhatsoever, and without anything being lost in the process.Speaking of \"MGS 4\", the very thing I liked about that entry in the series is prevalent in this one as well: options.You don't HAVE to stealthily dispatch hostiles; you can walk in with guns a'blazing, and easily get through eachsection, and vice versa. There is no wrong way to play \"Peace Walker\", in the sense that how it's played iscompletely dependent on your own playing style. I prefer the \"sneak in undetected\" approach, but my friend operatesby the \"might makes right\" strategy. We both get through each level with our respective plans, albeit with somecomplications exclusive to those plans (sneaking around often involves hiding in awkward places that you caneasily get trapped in if detected; taking the forceful approach can often leave room for unseen enemies to sneak up frombehind and take you out without any warning.) But that's the beauty of this game, really: learning from your mistakes,taking what you've learned and then applying it to the next level. Very few games have rules that are as broadly-definedas these.Another key strategy that will differ from player to player is the vast recruitment system. Much less convoluted thanthe previous PSP entries, getting soldiers on your side is as simple as knocking them out, then strapping aballoon harness (yes, a balloon harness) on them to be sent straight to your Mother Base, which is incidentally aprototype for the pivotal Outer Heaven base seen later in the series. The soldiers can then be assigned to theirrespective units, such as Combat or R&D;, or even Mess Hall. As the game progresses, the more soldiers you have,the more weapons and resources you'll gain. You can even play side-missions with your recruits to unlock moreweapons to aid Snake in the main story missions. Catching and training new blood adds an addictive \"Pokemon\"-likeaspect to \"Peace Walker\", one which I found myself spending a vast amount of time with.Now, on to minor matters (sort of): graphics and sound. And folks, these are just two more of this game's good points.How the developers got a game this beautiful and rich in detail to fit onto a UMD, I'll never know. I won't questiontheir magic, though, because I'm just too blown away to even consider doing anything of the sort. The qualityand effort bleeds from each micro-pixel, putting other PSP graphics darlings such as \"God of War: Chains ofOlympus\" to shame. Not a single time did I feel the game was constricted because of the PSP's graphical limitations.Kojima Productions has created the single most immersing world ever rendered on a handheld.The music is great (as per usual for the series), and the voice acting, featuring the likes of Steve Blum and TaraStrong, is absolutely phenomenal (again, as per usual for the series). Sound effects are also great, complimentingthe graphics to form the aforementioned immersing world. After playing this game for a few hours, it's hardto go outside and not think of the game. It's that mind-altering.In the end, there is no reason any PSP owner shouldn't own this, unless of course you haven't played any previousentries in the series. In that case, go back and play \"MGS 3: Snake Eater\" before playing. But for veterans of theseries, buy this without delay. As a longtime fan, I can firmly say this may be one of the franchise's high points,easily topping \"Snake Eater\", which was previously my favorite entry until this came along. It's also thelargest in terms of content and replay value. All subsequent entries will be greatly affected by \"Peace Walker\", andthus you owe it to yourself to play it.Then again, I won't be surprised if all PSP games are greatly affected by \"Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker.\" It remindsme of how good the PSP can be, to be sure, but more importantly: it reminds me of just how good a video game cantruly be.Story: A+ (Jaw-dropping, tearjerking, and pulsepounding; there's never a dull moment.)Gameplay: A+ (As tight as the series has ever been; nothing is lost on the PSP.)Graphics: A+ (The very best the system has to offer.)Sound: A+ (Great music, great voice acting... Just great in general.)Overall: A+ (One of the rare examples of a perfect game; Easily the best I've played all year.)NOTE: I apologize for not being able to review the multiplayer; my friend lives in another state,and this game only supports local Ad-Hoc play. I have no other PSP-owning friends (they all haveDS's, which I have one of as well), and thus can't give a review on the multiplayer. Again,I apologize.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2010"}

Specifically, the Super Mario Advance games have been a huge hit. Super Mario Advance 2 brings over two games to the Game Boy Advance. The first, Mario Brothers, is so simple that it's basically a mini-game. The real draw here is Super Mario World, one of the most popular Mario games ever -- and for good reason.Super Mario World is not exactly ground breaking. It uses the same formula and plot from Super Mario Brothers and Super Mario Brothers 3. However, it is an immense adventure, which lots of hidden levels and plenty to explore even after you've defeated Bowser. It also introduces some new moves to the Mario brothers, such as a spinning jump that can break bricks from above. Moreover, it introduces one of the more enduring characters of the Mario franchise, Yoshi. The one thing I think it's really missing is the variety of suits and powers that came with Super Mario brothers 3. Super Mario World only has three power-ups: the super mushroom, the fire flower, and the cape, which allows limited flight and works similar to the raccoon leaf of the previous game.If you've played a Mario game before, it all seems very familiar, but is also a ton of fun. The Mario franchise is one of those special games that doesn't need to break a lot of new ground -- it just needs to keep doing what it's been doing. For those new to the franchise, Super Mario World is a good introduction. While Mario has worked well in 3D games, his roots are with the 2D side-scroller, and Super Mario World helps demonstrate why those games are still fun even today.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2008"}

I went in without expectations (I picked it up for $10) and was satisfied in the end.  The story and voice acting are very well done and I liked the direction they went with it.  As opposed to many games that put you on the wrong side of the law, Mafia 2's story has a sense of realism to it.  Don't expect to do 10 missions and have more money than you could possibly spend in-game.  Money in Mafia 2 is earned the hard way, and every time you think you're getting somewhere in life (or the game, rather) things start to go awry.  I enjoyed the fighting (hand to hand and with firearms).  It's really satisfying when you canoe some dude's head in this one.  As a period piece, the game also does a good job, from the cars, to the radio programming, and even the liberal use of racial slurs.  A lot of time went into making the game \"feel\" authentic, and it shows.  Overall I would recommend fans of open world games a la GTA to give this one a try.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2012"}

Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.'

Yes, it's short (I played on Normal mode and beat it in around 6 hours), but it's always a blast to play. At first, the controls seem a little off (boosting around is controlled by one button, but entering slow-mo takes the left stick movement plus two buttons), and the first boss way too difficult, but one you get the hang of things you'll be blowing up enemy 'bots in style. These range from the usual \"gunt\" types to giant tanks and mechs as big as Omega Supreme from TransFormers, along with new bizarre creations sprinkled in here and there to keep things lively. There are some \"cheap\" things you can do to win (using a rocket launcher against almost any enemy/boss makes things a ton easier), and you'll end up using only a few weapons, but your tactics will change depending on the situation, and the story throws some interesting surprises in later in the game to keep you interested.

It seemed to become a cumalitive effect and eventually would have caused another crash in the console market.  That is until Nintendo took a fierce and wonderful chance.  By creating a console that did not provide hi-def graphics or digital sound or for the most part on-line gaming.  It almost sounds like I am talking about last gen gaming.  Except I am talking about the best gaming console on the market right now.  The Nintendo Wii has brought fun back into gaming.  Whether you are playing with just yourself or 3 friends the Wii is the most innovative gaming device anywhere.  I have had more fun than I have had in many years playing these games.  I am the proud owner of six games.  Even with that said there are still a few more quality titles I have yet to invest in.  Sometimes it's not so easy to get used to using body movement to control a character on screen.  Some games are actually a little difficult to get used to.  Blame that on many, many years of traditional gaming.  Although now I am having a lot of fun and am not afraid to admit it.  I was die hard Sony fan over the past several years.  I am now a proud Nintendo owner.  They have done what others don't.  It may be what is needed to shake up the gaming industry that has become very stale and unimaginative the past decade.  If gaming is going to reach the mainstream it must take bold steps and chances like we see with the Wii.  Not everyone wants cutting edge graphics and sound.

I think this always skews my review a bit, but there are few games in this world worth $60 in my opinion.  However, Assassin's Creed is like no games in the world, and was very much worth my $29. :-)Graphically, its outstanding.  Rendered textures and lighting are some of the best and most realistic I've seen on a 360 game.  It got buggy in a few spots, but on a good LCD TV with HDMI inputs, you'll be impressed.  The sound, from the music to the AI \"chatter\" is brilliant, and adds a real cinematic feel to the experience.  I'm gonna sound like a fan-boy here, but having Kristen Bell's voice as a character sweetens the deal. Gameplay is solid, and easy to pick up, and its a helluva lot of fun to climb the highest church tower in Acre and leap off.Cons are few. The gameplay gets repetitive if you play ALL the sub-missions, and I absolutely hate unrealistic, craptastic gopher missions like the \"get all the flags within 3 minutes\" ones.  Also, a lot of the fights do get a little lengthy, and your button mashing hand will get its workout until you figure out what combos to hit and get your timing down pat, at which point you will take on 20 enemies with a Shaolin-like flow.I loved the storyline, and no other game I've ever seen crosses the historical lines like this one.  I think its one of the most imaginative and creative stories in a game, ever.It gets 4 stars from me because now that I'm done, I'm probably never going to play it again.  It was a great experience, there just no payoff to going back to it.  Like a great summer blockbuster movie, once you have gotten the thrills and chills, it never has the same effect, and I would guess this game would be the same way.Dont let that stop you though - especially now that the price has dropped AGAIN, you've got no excuse but to add this to you collection.  It WILL occupy many, many nights of your life.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-02-2008"}

So I figured, why not get the game and also get the GoW 3 Beta as well?  Surprise surprise, turns out this game is one hell of a fun ride!As someone else mentioned, this game is essentially Gears of War meets FPS.  The graphics are phenomenal and the Unreal Engine still kicks butt.  It literally feels like a faster, looser, and even more violent version of Gears from a 1st person vantage point.  I gotta say, I really got into this game the second I started playing it.The story is pretty disposable - which is totally fine because I didn't really care about the plot because all I was thinking about was how to do as many different skill-based kills as I could with the awesomely fun arsenal of weapons that I had.  Even something as simple as using the whip was hilariously fun.  It's awesome when you can just do all sorts of different combo kills - even the simple ones such as whipping a person into the air, shooting them, then whipping them back again so you can kick the body back away and shoot a few more rounds for posterity comes off as insane and fun.  I also like how there is a very detailed list of kill types that you need to hit if you want to add bonus skill points.I started out playing only a little bit, but suddenly I found that several hours had passed by.  That's how this game works.  It just sucks you in because of the easy to pick up controls, solid gameplay, and addictive kill kill kill action that really never gets old.  Definitely worth picking up!ADD: I forgot to note the multiplayer aspect.  I had a decent time with it, as it reminds me of the horde gametype in GoW.  Had a blast playing with 3 other players to wipe out tons of NPCs, though in this case, it's the STYLE kills that really matter.  In the later rounds, it gets hard to level up unless you and your teammates meet the skill challenge kill.  Teamwork for killing is important, which is a nice twist from the usual point shoot kill move on aspects of some FPS games.

I was never a \"fanboy\" of the 360, but I had owned an original Xbox (no issues for me!) and then bought an Xbox 360 (RROD on the first one - replaced free). I have noticed now that I am buying new games on the PS3 platform instead of the 360. I am now thinking that since most games come out on both systems, I can get rid of my 360 and save some space and make few hundred dollars as well. So, I have found the Playstation3 makes me happy as both a movie buff and a gamer, and I can't ask for much more than, so if you are looking for a bluray player, the PS3 is a great buy, and if you are looking for a gaming system, the PS3 is a great buy. I think that about sums it up :-)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2008"}

There is not even any of the cool weaponry from the single player missions.  There is also another thing while there have been mods made of the existing maps no one has sat down and bothered to write new maps (at least none that I have ever seen).  This is true for both allied assault and spearhead.  So over all the game feels flat and the only trick to being good in the multiplayer is to know where all the hiding places are.

StoryTheGod of Warfranchise tells the tragic and violent story of the warrior Kratos and his dealings with the gods. The ancient world would eventually both praise and damn the infamous ?Ghost of Sparta? as the mortal who slayed a god, but long before his battle with Ares, Kratos sought absolution from his past sins by pledging himself as a champion to the gods. These brutal crusades in the name of Olympus became legendary, but would have far-reaching consequences. InChains of OlympusKratos is pushed to the edge as he is ordered by the gods to journey to the very depths of the underworld after the world plunges into darkness. There he must face the most feared creatures of Greek mythology and is forced to choose between his own personal redemption and saving the ancient world from certain destruction. It is a choice that will shake the immortals from their perches on Mt.

I'll start with the bad so you can know what you'll be dealing with.(1: Load Times)(2: Difficulty)(3: Online)(4: Scenario Campaign)(5: Customization)(6: The Final Verdict)***BAD***(1): **Load Times**  *Overall: Not bad*While they aren't disastrously long, they do have the \"how long have I been waiting?\" effect...atleast for me.Since I figured out that I could Install this game to the Hard-drive [HDD] (The option to install the game is located inthe Options, in the Tekken main menu) it has SLIGHTLY decreased the load times...slightly, meaning that the effect willbecome unnoticeable once you get used to it.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(2): **Difficulty**  *Overall: Horrible*It's not that the Difficulty settings are horrible, it's just that they are so absurd to the point of non-existence.This game has 5 difficulty settings: Easy, Normal, Hard, Very Hard, Ultra Hard.The deal breaker for me is this, it seems like Difficulty doesn't mean a thing, it's what character you're fighting against.(Example)I was trying to get the trophy for getting a 10-in-a-row in Survival Mode on Normal.I died by round 3, *Note, this isn't because I \"Can't play, or I suck\"*So I then changed to Easy difficulty, because Normal in Survival was a tad bit too hard, and what do you know?On Easy, Survival, the enemies block 70% of your attacks, and if you don't kill them fast enough, they'll unleash 10-hit comboslike they didn't know better...and that's on round 1!This, to me, is just plain sad...You might be thinking that I suck, can't even get to 10 onsurvival, that's just not the case. Maybe you'll beat 7 rounds, then all of a sudden Bob comes up and completelyobliterates you with his 10-hit combo, block streak, and low-attack obsession. It's so frustrating that I was thisclose to never playing the game again. The only characters that kills me/depletes a lot of HP are Zafina, Bob, and occasionallyLing Xiaoyu.The difficulty in the rest of the game, however, is at the most part 'decent'. The final boss, Azazel (In arcade mode) willhave you throwing the controller and messing up your Kill/Death ratio in an instant.To put is simply, he's a big dragon, he's very strong, and he isn't affected at all when he blocks (meaning he can attack youwhenever he wants, even while blocking).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(3): **Online**  *Overall: Laggy*A lot of people say that the Playstation Network Patch (applied once you turn on Tekken 6 with an internet connection active)makes the online play less-laggy. While this may be true, there are a great majority of people using Mobile Broadband, as I am.I don't know why, but it seems like all fighting games' servers are user created, meaning the lag will depend entirely on thepersons connection you're connected to. When it should be you create a server that's hosted by, say Namco, and it will onlydepend on your own connection.This all boils down to 2 things:(1 The person you're connected to doesn't have a connection good enough for 2 people,and (2 Most likely the person you'll be playing is in another continent, meaning that's additional lag with the distance.Either way, it's still laggy at the end of the day.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(4): **Scenario Campaign Mode**  *Overall: Six out of Ten*Scenario Campaign Mode is, for the most part, fun. There are a few things that are annoying though.The big disappointment with this game, is that it revolves around Scenario Campaign Mode.Which means the only good way to get money is to do this mode, otherwise get around 2 or 3,000ga battle in Ghost Battle (Arcade w/ Ranking, similar to the main Arcade mode in Tekken 5)Now the bad thing about Scenario Campaign mode, besides that Tekken 6 revolves around it,...well that pretty muchis the bad thing. Since Tekken 6 revolves around Scenario Campaign Mode, you'd think that this mode would be a beast(good).Wrong, this mode has a very bad targeting system, and your fighting primarily counts on this, you are able to use the samecombos as in a regular arcade battle, even though you'll most likely be using the same combination of moves over and over.You press R1 (Or was it L1? I've forgotten whilst writing this review!) to change targets, but it only targets who's closestto you, this is a very bad thing if you're trying to kill to a certain enemy.Weather its getting kicked from the back, or shoved into the water and killed in the front, you'll be frustrated until you getvery used to this.Movement is horrible in this mode, it's almost 8-Directional.(Left, Right, Up, Down, Top-left, Bottom-left, Bottom-right, top-right)When you get close enough to an enemy you start your battle stance, and while you're in this stance your movement is reducedto slow steps, since you automatically target the enemy.The only way to break this Battle Stance is to run far enough from the target...there is no button to start free-running again,only until that fight is over or you make distance.You have an AI (bot) partner, Alisa, with you the whole while that fights with you...but I find her sometimes-useless, becausewhen you get a certain distance from her in battle, she'll tend to start dying quicker.Her costume depends on what you're wearing (If you're wearing costume #1, then her costume will be #1), so you can alsocustomize her outfit as, say, Costume #1, and she'll be wearing that as long as you have #1 on as well.The mode has pre-rendered cutscenes of Lars and Alisa, which means the story and cutscenes are of them, no matter what characteryou're playing with.This mode is single-player, and online-co op only. I've never played online-co op. The camera is angled from back to forward,meaning no matter which way you go, the camera will be angled straight-ahead, not behind your back)Besides that, Scenario Campaign is fun, although this is one of the few games I've skipped a few movie scenes...they just areboring and no action whatsoever, just Lars and Alisa looking at everything, and then more and more boring dialogue.Only times I don't skip is when I see some of my favorite characters in them.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------***GOOD***(5): **Customization**  *Overall: Great*Customization in this Tekken has been pushed to new heights. It is no longer just lame sword-on-your-back, outfit color-changer.Now, on top of outfit color-changing and lame swords-on-your-back, you can now completely change his or her outfit, andaccessories. From Hat and Glasses, Jackets & Jeans, to Shirts & Skirts,and more! Even Aura's(I haven't bought these yet...$7 million+.)You can also buy Hair Bases, which are slick-backed hairstyles that can be customized with extra hair!Example: You can buy Ponytail High Base, and now go to the Hair Back section and buy Pony Tails for the back of your hair!They also have really long Pony Tails / free-flowing hair.This is just a great customization, its just a shame that you have to play Scenario Campaign mode to get enough money,unless you want to grind hardcore in Arcade mode, but honestly, that's just not an option, these customizations range from100,000g to 3,000,000g (100k to 3mil).Enemies in Campaign Mode also drop Treasure Chests sometimes that, when walked on, opens up and gives you a customization item,the armor in Scenario Campaign also gives bonuses (20% chance to freeze enemy on hit / Attacks deal 20% more damage).This customization makes me want to replay Scenario Campaign for enough money to buy other items for other people.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(6): **The Final Verdict**  *Overall: 4*I'm sure you're probably wondering why I give it a 4, with so many BAD things, and only one GOOD thing.Well that's because of The Final Verdict, which is great. I give it a 4 and not 5, because of all of the BAD things, but theGOOD far overcomes the BAD.Customization isn't the only good thing in this game of course, Scenario Campaign is great, just have to get over, and used tothe bad things, which isn't necessarily hard.The Arcade Mode is great, just like the rest of the Tekken's. My review was basically on Customization and Scenario Campaign,seeing as how they are both newer/new.Some say this isn't a button masher/sit-down & play game, but it is for the most part.On here you can actually do a 3-hit combo and look good, whereas on Soul Calibur IV, those 3-hit combos just looka little lame, and make you seem like you don't know any moves.*NOTES* To unlock movie scenes, you have to go to the Arena in Scenario Campaign mode. It's unlocked after a few places arebeaten in Scenario Campaign.The Arena is the true Arcade Mode in this Tekken, it has 4 or 5 battles, 5th battle is Azazel, 4th battle is a bonus stage,it comes sometimes, and sometimes it doesn't.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bottom line: (1: I rented it. (2: I liked it. (3: I got mad and hated it. (4. I finally took a detailed looked at the Customization.and (5: I want to buy it.If this review hasn't helped you, then I don't know what will.My favorite characters in order: Miguel(1), Lili(2), Dragunov (3)PSN: WittyKitty1","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2010"}

Broken down into five distinct open-world gameplay areas, linked on the game map, cumulatively these areas comprise a massive area, much larger than anything ever seen in previousMidnight Clubreleases and possibly larger than any existing racer to date. Within these areas, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Hollywood, Mulholland Drive and Downtown LA, players are free to engage in mission play driving them to attain and customize a wide range of authentic world-class street racing vehicles, or to simply explore the city, taking on all comers in a variety of race types as they wish. Regardless, along the way they will experience not only the visual realism of the iconic boulevards, freeways, and landmarks made famous in TV and movies, but also the realism of the living breathing LA urban experience. Here traffic backs up then clears as people go to and leave work for the day, weather systems come and go and day turns to night, then back again. All the while the race goes on. It's all part of the living, breathing LA. It's all part of theMidnight Club.The CarsMidnight Club: Los Angeleswill feature an astounding selection of vehicles in the Muscle Car, Exotics, Tuners, Motorcycle and Luxury car categories.

The hottest licensed cars and bikes in the world are at your disposal - kit them out, supe them up, and personalize them down to the last detail to make them all your own. Visitthe Club'sin-game garages located in Hollywood and Santa Monica and let your imagination run wild - tweaking and fine tuning through the following three different types of vehicle modifications:Performance &amp; Handling- To become a street legend, you're going to have to tune your vehicle for maximum performance. The garage offers three levels of upgrades for virtually every component on your vehicle, but it's up to you to craft the winning combination that will give you the edge on the competition.Exterior- For the Midnight Club, stunting is a habit and its clandestine Los Angeles garages have all the toys needed to ensure heads turn in this jaded town. From making sure your car is dripping in candy paint, to adding unique body kits and jaw dropping extras, the garage offers practically limitless possibilities to personalize your vehicle with aftermarket accessories and customizable options.Interior- Don't embarrass yourself by pulling up with an outrageously kitted-up car that has a 'me-too' factory interior. Not a good look! You're going to be spending a lot of time behind the wheel, so renovate and make yourself feel comfortable.Beware or Befriend the Local CompetitionThe street racing scene ofMidnight Clubis tough, but tight, meaning that everyone that you meet in expansiveLos Angelescould just as easily be an ally as an enemy. One thing is for certain though, they are all willing to throw down at the drop of a hat. Just a few of the faces you'll encounter out on the streets are:Karol, Age 45- A veteran of Moscow's underground street racing circuit, Karol moved to LA in the 1990's after the collapse of the Soviet Union. If you're looking for cars, he's your man. He owns two successful garages and claims to be able to get hold of any vehicle, no questions asked. He also sees himself as a philosopher and will bend your ear if you left him. He mostly races around Hollywood and the Beaches and his rides include a 1975 Datsun 280Z, 1969 Boss Mustang 302, 2006 Dodge Challenger and a 1971 Lamborghini Miura SV.Annie, Age 31- Annie has a rep as one of the fiercest drivers in the city. She detests posers and wannabes, is intelligent and sharp-tongued and pulls no punches when it comes to cutting the competition down to size. She has been spotted in everything from a 1983 VW Golf GTI, 2006 Pontiac Solstice, 2008 Chrysler 300C SRT-8, 2008 Audi RS4 and a 2004 Ford Shelby Cobra Concept and can usually be found hanging out near Pink's Hotdog Stand in Hollywood along with her crew.Rockstar Games Social Club: Join the CommunityBeing a Rockstar gameMidnight Club: Los Angelescomes with a huge commitment to the gaming community.

Why you ask? It's way too hard. Most of the time, even starting out at the beginning, it's almost impossible to place first. If you wipe out in a race with a few minutes remains or even more you might as well forget about any chance of getting first. The A.I. is ridiculously unfair!Now, I know what a lot of people are going to say: You're just a big sissy and need to stick to the less challenging kiddie games. Not True! I've beaten just about every game I've ever played all the way from Gears Of War to Metroid over the past 20 years of video gaming. No matter how much of a video game master you think you are this game will test your patience and your will power at not throwing the controller into the tv. I love a challenging game that is fair. I grew up in the 80's back when Nintendo had games that offered a real challenge, but were fair and I thrived on those. Anybody remember Battletoads? Now that was a challenging and frustrating game, but you could make progress with memorization. This game you can't do that.You probably wonder how you make any progess in the game, such as unlock cars and such, with it being this difficult. Well, you're rewarded even if you place last, if only a little, which in my opinion dulls the experience. It's not fun to keep finishing in a low place or last most of the time and constantly be rewarded minutely. Eventually, you build up enough credits to unlock cool stuff that is unfun to use because it's difficult.I've played it approximately 6 hours since renting it at 8 a.m. this morning and I'm already ready to return it. Sure it's got killer graphics. The cars look awesome and there is a big selection to choose from. Some of the cars are super fast(the high end ones), probably the fastest I've seen in a racer before. The city is very large and very well detailed. If you're familiar with L.A. you will see places you recognize. Think Grand Theft Auto 4 and you'll have an idea as to scale and detail of Midnight Club:L.A. The music tracks are good, but not quite as good as past Midnight Club titles.However, you can take all of these positives and throw them together and it still doesn't make it a fun game because it's way too challenging, to the point of being frustrating. Actually challenging isn't the right word, really. How about broken gameplay. The cars handle fine, the physics are down pat, cornering is great with most cars, but those you race against will be very unfair and negate all the positives. You may like games this frustratingly difficult; I do not! Give it a rent and you may agree with me or you may love it. I'd bet that you won't though. A game can't be fun if for 19th time you're trying to get in 1st place only to realize that on that 19th time you've only managed to get 5th.I know this review sounds really critical, and it is. It's not a terrible game, but its also far from a great game. If you can get around the difficulty then you'll think this is the best racer ever. Just know what you're getting into before you go there. This game is difficult for me to score because there are a lot of really good things about it. Unfortunately, the one major fault: unfair challenge really detracts the score. I give it 3.0 stars or a 6 out of 10.As a side note: I've always wondered why some games aren't reviewed until the game is official released by Amazon, even though the game has been officially released nationwide and is available practically everywhere. Hint: You don't have to buy from amazon to review one of their products. They have this game shipping Oct. 23rd, but yet it's readily available at my local Wal-Mart, video stores etc. Go figure!?","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00APBF8A6","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Richardson","summary":"Great port brings RPG classic to the West at last","reviewText":"Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers was a Sega Saturn RPG that never saw a release in the West, even though it saw ports to subsequent consoles in Japan, such as Sony's PSX. It's a loosely related sequel to another Sega Saturn video game that also never saw release in the West. Finally, however, Atlus was able to bring Soul Hackers to the West to join other titles in the Nintendo 3DS' increasingly incredible library of games.This game is awesome in a number of ways. The mix of occult elements with noirish cyberpunk futurism makes for a very unique backdrop for the interesting story, which involves a group of young hackers unwittingly getting involved in a vast, demonic conspiracy. The gameplay is very old-school, with first-person navigation in dungeons, turn-based battles, and of course the things that make a SMT games unique: demon negotiation, summoning, and fusion. It is entertaining to engage in the frequently oddball conversations with different types of demons, who sport a variety of personality types. Props to Atlus U.S.A. for their awesome English translation of the script.Graphically, the game is dated (this IS a port of a Sega Saturn game released in 1997), but enough fresh paint has been applied to this title to make it look decent enough. The audio is a real treat, with some stunning music and quite impressive English voice-acting for most of the game's dialogue. I would recommend wearing earbuds or headphones while playing this, though, especially if you're playing this on an XL, which tends to have quieter speakers. The audio in this game really deserves to be savored.The 3D effect is subtle. It's not terribly noticeable, but it does add some depth to the dungeons and, of course, makes the dialogue boxes and character portraits pop. Still, I would recommend playing with the 3D off if you're not next to a charger, as the extra battery power is probably worth more than whatever value is added by playing in full 3D.Although some grinding is necessary in this game, it is more important to form active strategies for boss fights. SMT games tend to reward intelligent strategizing, and this one is no different. I was surprised by how approachable the game was, considering its age, and how well it explained its various mechanics. Some new additions to this game for the 3DS re-release include being able to hack your COMP (demon-summoning device) to make the game easier and an interesting mode which allows you to utilize streetpass and play coins to buy demons.I would also like to quickly mention the pre-order bonus, whixh is a nice cardboard box that looks identical to the actual game case and a music CD with seven remastered tracks on it. Would it be worth paying extra money for this? Probably not. As it stands, the free bonus material does give the physical version of the game a slight edge over the digital release if it is still being offered. It is fairly standard swag for an Atlus release.Overall, this game would be a stand-out release for the 3DS in any other year, but this year it is merely yet another excellent reason to own a 3DS. Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2013"}

It truly gives the feeling that you are playing a moving instead of a video game.  Your decisions will alter the outcome of the game and often they can lead to your demise.  The graphics of the game are excellent.  The controls are simple to use but there's a tutorial to train you on the basic moves if needed.  The storyline is original and engrossing, the voice work is about as good as you'll find in any game.  This is more of a RPG than a standard action game.  You won't get into battles head on, but rather you will play a series of \"simon says\" sequences that you can pass or fail depending on your dexterity.  There is a flaw with this type of combat system in that the guide shows up on the screen and you are so focused on trying to master the moves that you miss what is actually going on in the game.You'll play as different characters, the lead, a presumed murderer and the cops that are tracking you down.  This adds interest to the game as you will diligently try to escape the cops one minute and the next you are desperately looking for clues to try to catch the character that you just played.  Throughout the game,  you'll have to make decisions: conversation topics, actions, etc.  For the most part, each decision alters the game outcome so you have to think about what could happen in the long run but you will only have a limited amount of time to do so.  The game plays like a movie and unlike most games, the cut scenes are not transitions into the next chapter but are actually the game itself.  Indigo Prophecy is a bit short, however there is significant replay value as making different decisions can completely change the outcome of the game.  It is obvious that there was a great deal of time and thought put into the development of this game and it clearly shows.  This is one of the most original, clever games created for any platform.  Give this one a try.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2005"}

Lerch","summary":"Great Gaming Keyboard","reviewText":"Having received this keyboard a few weeks ago, I decided to hold off on writing a review until I was able to properly test and burn it in.My previous keyboard was the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000, which I loved (and actually, still do). This gaming keyboard was a bit of a challenge to get back into the \"non-ergonomic\" keyboard style.The keyboard is a high quality build. It doesn't have a cheap feel to it (I don't think any Microsoft keyboard has ever felt cheap; those that have worked with cheap keyboards know the how one feels).Some of the gaming features include the red back lit buttons with adjustable brightness, you can swap the number pad from the left to the right side of the keyboard and keyboard macros.First, the back light option is really nice. For those who like to play in the dark and don't necessarily know where every key on the keyboard is, this is a great feature. Being able to adjust the brightness from fully on to fully off is great for when you want to play with the lights on, as you don't need the back light option then. Of course, this says nothing of the stereo type that all gamers are dwellers of the darkness, but for those that fit the stereo type, the option is there.Next up is the swappable number pad. If you're a lefty or a righty who would prefer using the number pad on the left, you just pop the num pad off the one side and swap it to the other. Don't use the num pad? Pop it off and have yourself a shorter keyboard to play with. It's really a great option.Third is the support for keyboard macros and the \"cruise control.\" Macros allow you to program a bunch of button presses all down to a single button press. You have 6 physical buttons on the left side of the keyboard to control macros; each capable of 2 macros each with the press of the toggle switch. You can also set the num pad to act as macros as well, adding 17 more macro keys to the mix. You won't likely need more than that, and of course, you may find it easy to forget which macro key on which bank does what, but at least the options are there. Programming macros is rather easy as well. Press the Macro Record button, press the S-button you want the macro assigned, press all the keys you want in the macro, then press macro record again and you are done.The cruise control is also extremely useful for \"on the fly\" macro style support. With cruise control you press the cruise control button, press up to 4 additional keys and the keyboard continues to press these buttons \"forever\" (or until you decide to end cruise control). Only useful for gaming, but a great option for those that do play.You also have a nob to control volume, which is better than buttons found on some keyboards (such as my beloved Natural 4000 keyboard).A caveat is the lack of tilting feet on the underside of the keyboard. This keyboard is built to lay flat out. I'm not a fan of the flat keyboard.What would make this a 5 star product for me would be the gaming functionality with the ergonomics of the Natural 4000. One I'm sure others would surely love would also be a wireless option. For those that have their PCs connected to their big screen TVs, wireless would be a wonderful option.In the end, I'm extremely pleased with the keyboard, despite the caveats. The only problem... I still prefer the ergonomic keyboard and will only be breaking this out for gaming sessions.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2009"}

So I decided to give this one a shot. Here is what I thought.PROS.BEAUTIFUL GRAPHICS: This game undoubtedly is the best looking Wii game (next to Super Mario Galaxy 2 I guess). While wii games are not rendered graphically top notch in general, this game changes that trend. Played it on my 1080p HDTV with component cable and the game looks gorgeous. Cutscenes in the game look no different than average PS3/360 games. While in game pictures has rough edges, they still look amazing.MARVELOUS 3rd PERSON GAMEPLAY: Metroid PRIME games has been great as shooter, so I was curious how Team Ninja develop this intp 3rd person action games. To my surprise they have done a great job. While game is still a shooter for most part, it has plenty of other cool 3rd person action such as dodging and physical combat by Samus. All of these actions work great to best of my knowledge.In addition to that you are given plenty of other moves through gadgets which will be described below.DEVASTATING WEAPONS AND INGENIOUS GADGETS: Just like previous metroid games you will have access for different beams and gadgets. As for beams your beam will automatically get upgraded as you progress in the game (no choosing between beam like prime series). And of course you will have also have missiles, chargeshot, supermissles, morphbomb and ALMIGHTY powerbomb.In addition to these weapons you will have access to cool gadgets such as morph ball ability, grapple beam, charged running and jumping, spacejump, screwattack . So plenty to look forward to in this department. Oh did I mention just like previous game, there are plenty of HIDDEN UPGRADES.VARIETY OF ENEMIES AND BOSSES: Just like previous metroid gams, this one has plenty of enemies and bosses. Where things get interesting is how you can defeat them. Of course you will have to use all of the weapons and gadgets creatively to defeat these enemies effectively while making use of dodge ability. Now once you wear enemy down you can deal devastating blow to them with finishing move provided (thanks to TEAM NINJA). This is where game gets very CINEMATIC. I HAVE JUST LOVED defeating different enemies with these moves. ESPECIALLY BOSSES. Don't want to spoil it, but METROID FANS be ready for some surprises in terms of bosses ( YOU ARE GOING TO SEE SOME FAMILIAR FACES :)DECENT STORY AND GREAT CUTSCENES: Really can't tell you much without spoiling, but as mentioned above, cutscenes look gorgeous whether they depicting fights or sentimental story about the main character Samus Aran. First game where Samus talk. Voice acting is not bad either.PICTURE AND VIDEO GALARY: Finishing game will allow you access to picture and video galary which allow you to see pics and cutscene videos from the game. This is something I loved as you don't have to play the whole game all over again just because you want to see some cutscene. BEST PART IS the cutscenes will also include in game footage. So say you are watching cutscene for a boss fight, it will have cutscene + footage of boss fight game play. JUST AWESOME.ADDITIONAL GAMEPLAY FOR COMPLETIONISTS: You won't be able to collect 100% of the items before you beat final story boss. ONLY after you beat final story boss, you will be able to collect 100% of the items and FIGHT ANOTHER BIG..... (Sorry don't want to spoil).CONS:ANNOYING JUMPS: Some jumps are annoying to complete just like previous game (especially to get some items).CAN GET STUCK:  Campaign is not straightforward. There are parts where you can get stuck if you don't think outside of the box (more description below). In other words you will be confused where to go and what to do.FIRST PERSON/THIRD PERSON THROUGH WII MOTE: This was my BIGGEST PROBLEM. If you want to get into first person to 3rd person you have to rotate wii mote 90 horizontally and if you want to replenish your missiles and some of your health you have to rotate wii mote vertically 90. This work great for most part, but at times can give you SERIOUS PROBLEMS. Wii motion sensor is good, but not as good to sense these movement 100% of the time, PLUS YOU AS A USER CAN ALSO MAKE MISTAKE. So your character won't behave exactly how you want to. Honestly if they had just made use of nunchuck things would have been better. There are also some areas (especially for many hidden items) where if you don't look through first person you will never figure out the location of new path (whether it is for story or for the item).CONCLUSION:Contrary to the cons I described, the game is GREAT. It looks great and plays great. After you are done with the main story, GO AFTER THE SIDE STORY. After you are done with side story and 100% collection, play on the hard mode or WATCH AWESOME VIDEOS. A MUST BUY FOR METROID FANS.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2010"}

When I played 3, I noticed something just wasn't right without even paying attention to the fact that it was made by Treyarch as opposed to Infinity Ward.  Well, all of their games have the same lackluster polish when compared to Infinity Ward equivalent.  The pace of multiplayer is much faster, yes.  But the maps are generic, the action inconsistent, single player storyline not as good, graphics and sound not as good, etc. etc.I gave up my $20 credit when I cancelled my preorder from reach to apply it.  Then I cancelled my order.  They brought the credit back, I ordered.  I didn't get my game on release date.  All that drama.  For this.  Where MW is a 10 in my book, MW2 is a 9.5.

Call of Duty 4 is - scratch that - WAS - my absolute favorite game of all time.  I enjoyed the pace and the strategy.  Modern Warfare 2, however, aimed to up the ante, and it did it at the expense of COD4's core gameplay.  It became all about the killstreaks, and the easiest way to score killstreaks was to camp and spam RPGs and M203s.  It was chaotic and random.  That's not to say MW2 was a bad game, but it wasn't what a lot of us were hoping for in the sequel to Call of Duty 4.Black Ops builds on COD4's pace.
