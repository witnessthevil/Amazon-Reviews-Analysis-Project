The multi level stages are cool as are the death traps, (especially when you're so into a battle you forget there's one behind you). I haven't tried the online feature yet which is supposed to be the best addition to the game. Lots of blood and guts as you'd expect from any MK game. Most of the fatalities are pretty creative (thankfully no really lame ones like Quan Chi's old neck stretch in DA).I still think they could have done away with the krypt, or put more intersting stuff in it, photos & sketches don't cut it. Perhaps some of that memory could have been used for animated endings. Konquest mode has been GREATLY improved though once you're done not much reason to play again. Puzzle kombat is cool side game. I don't know how to play chess so can't comment on Chess Kombat but it looks like it would be at least interesting.I've read a lot of reviews compaining about the fight engine. Most said Tekken and Virtua Fighter have better ones. Tekken is ok but please...that fight engine is really slow by comparison, ditto for VF (though it's been a while since I've played VF). With MK press one button and your opponent has blood pouting from his/her face, who could ask for more. Bottom line, MK fans will like this one. The improvements over DA are welcome. Multiple fatalities, returning characters, suicides, death traps....argh, argh, argh.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2004"}

Noire is a new type of game.  Yes it might look a lot like GTA or even RDR, but its hardly similar.  The shooting mechanics are slow and clunky, the car chases a bit too arcady for my taste, but where this game shines isn't in those areas.From searching the crime scene for obscure clues, to narrowing down persons of interest, L.A. Noire is spot on.  Deciding if a suspect is lying, or being truthful can be difficult to say the least.  Its hardly WHAT the person says, but rather HOW they say it.  And those ques can be so so so small that watching their every twitch can be the key to picking the correct response.The new facial animation is what makes this possible.  The actors did a great job with this.  I can imagine how hard it was to balance this game.  It has to be hard, but not too hard to tell a lie from a truth.Anyways, if you are looking for smooth fluid gameplay, or a strong multiplayer component, don't pick up Noire.  If you are looking for an interesting new take on exactly WHAT a video game is, or prefer deep indepth conspiracies, or even just like playing the side of the law L.A.

What do I get for doing that? Unreasonable, gut reactions from huge fans of the game in comments and ratings. When someone doesn't like a game and you do, grow up and deal with it. I can understand commenting on a negative review for a very popular game that you like, there's obviously reasons that certain games get very high ratings, including this one. I myself have commented on low reviews for incredible games. However, these are generally reviews that don't give an intelligent reasonable reason for the low review... like a brief review that simply says \"this game sucks, don't buy it\" and not much more, or a complaint about the shipping, things that don't have to do with the game, etc. These reviews bring the rating down for no reason. But when a low review states its reasons (I also qualified many of the comments I made with things like \"I'm biased\" towards such and such, and \"there's obviously a reason for the large following\"), like I said, grow up and deal with it... especially when the other low reviews give similar reasons for disliking the game.... ORIGINAL REVIEW:Absolutely the MOST overrated and over anticipated RPG for the DS ever. Horrible battle system, simply ridiculous, I think, even for action based battle. I'm biased because I prefer turn play, but also play tactics and action battle RPGs, and still feel the gameplay is HORRIBLE. I also thought the buttons as item upgrades was at first confusing and then once I understood it I found it plain silly, not innovative. Too much unnecessary dialogue, the worst battle system ever, as though the developers quit halfway through creating something that could have been innovative - I hate to use this phrase in any review, but this game deserves it, in my eyes - it plain sucks. Shame on Square Enix... and I cannot understand the large following the game does have, so the game must have its merits. I cannot see any. This game, to me, is not innovative, it is a huge flop.My advice is to play this game first before buying if you can, because like I said, it is obvious that a lot of people like it, but also obvious that there is also a group, like me, who were disappointed, re. other 1 and 2 star reviews.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2011"}

Cady \"Ben\"","summary":"A Brilliant Swansong","reviewText":"Let me preface this by saying I will be reviewing the game itself, not the package (I don't care about the golden wii remote plus, as I bought a black one specifically to play this game and I bought this edition to hold on to for my Zelda collection).Story:This game has a brilliantly simple story in which the main character must save the world from demise (much like Zelda in general) with the conveyance of emotions being more important than the plot itself.  Surely there has been a strong link between Zelda and Link in this entry (they are childhood friends and it is quite endearing).  It evolves a bit into what clearly is an origin story and sets up the framework for the series in general.  The characters are memorable and very heart warming.Graphics:The Graphics are wonderfully simple and the effects are interesting, the water color art style is unique to say the least, even if the resolution takes some getting used to.  The tone is perfectly set through the art style, as the sense of adventure and novelty in general are conveyed perfectly.  This would have to be one of the benchmarks of the series in terms of graphics conveying part of the story.Music:The music is perfectly orchestraed with memorable tunes that are infectous, much like the rest of the series.  The instrument the player uses is decidedly weak (a harp?) but finding the last song is a fairly fun adventure.  In general, the music is a high point of the game.Gameplay (to include controls):The controls are EXTREMELY accurate when the remote is calibrated properly, sometimes this can be asserted as a weak point of the entry, as the game tracks a lot of movements that the player makes.  This isn't a problem with the interface or game, but the player, I found this to be the highlight of the game.  The controls set the precedent for the input method of motion controls.  For me, this game has single handedly justified the existence of motion controls.  The combat is genuinely satisfying and very visceral.  One cannot help but feel the sense of actually connecting with their on screen avatar while parlaying throughout the various nooks and crannies of this wonderful experience. The map is also fairly small, if VERY dense and packed with activities (I personally thought this would be a detractor, but it's actually quite nice).  Another minor quibble I had was with some of the fetch quests (involving Goddess tears) that seemed to interrupt the general pace of the game, which at most points is quite phenomenal.Overall:Overall, this game is great but not without flaws.  Aside from the lame instrument (a relatively minor gripe), the slightly smaller map (albeit one filled to the brim with content) and the slightly repetetive fetch quests, this game is a SERIOUS gem.Pros:-Graphics-Controls-Interesting CharactersCons:-Slightly smallish map-Sometimes it can be annoying to recalibrate the controller-The pacing is a bit interrupted by fetch quests9.5/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2012"}

Use the brand new Glyph attack system which has more than 100 different combinations to battle Dracula and his minions throughout 20 explorable areas. Take part in side quests and collect items to power up your character in the next great Castlevania game produced by Koji Igarashi.","reviewerName":"J. Shafer","summary":"Not as good as previous entries","reviewText":"Order of Ecclesia starts off with our young heroine Shanoa about to complete the glpyh Dominous and become its vessel.  Since the Belmont clan has mysteriously vanished, Dominous is supposed to take the place of the vampire killer whip and kill dracula, should he ever rise again.  Before Shanoa completes the ritual, her brother Albus busts in with a fit of rage, intterupts everything and takes off with the 3 stolen peices of Dominous.  Shanoa then loses all of her memory, is forced to retrain and is sent off to deal with Albus.The story, as expected of a Castlevania game, isnt that great.  All your doing is chasing after Albus to find out why he did everything and near the end youll get a couple of somewhat obvious plot twists due to lack of main characters (3 to be exact).The characters werent really interesting either.  Due to a plot device, Shanoa is robbed of not only her memory, but all of her emotions as well which gives her the personality of a brick, making it hard for us to connect with anything.  The other 2 characters werent all that interesting either, mostly because we hardly ever see them.  We'll have a breif conversation with Albus a few times and thats it while we have a even breifer conversations with the other character Barlowe who we see maybe twice.  Theres also the group of villagers that you can talk too but they all act almost the same way.If your familiar with other titles in the series, than the gameplay shouldnt be different to you at all.  However the new Glyph system, while well done, wasnt very original.  All it did was mix the soul system from Aria and Dawn of Sorrow games, and the weapon grinding from Portrait of Ruin.  Instead of automatically absording something like in AoS or DoS, you have to manually absorb it and for it to be effective, you have you constantly use it for it to be acctually good.  The weapon variety is also very limited compared to the other 2 DS Castlevanias as well.  Youve got your standard weapon/spell, and then youve got a stronger version of it, thats pretty much it.  I also found the stadard weapon glpyhs to be fairly pointless other than a union attack because the spells were just overall stronger compared to them, namely fire and light types.The one thing that probably ruined it the most was the difficulty curve.  Sometimes you would come across monsters who were complete pushovers while others could be pounded at for well over a few minutes and still be standing.  You took rediculous amounts of damage from everything, did hardly any in return and healing items (and most armor) were way over-priced which could range anywhere from 500-30 grand.  Bosses were also too hard as well.  While some where easy, most where just completely cheap in everyway.  Almost all of their attacks are powerful to the point where you would either die in a couple hits or do so much that it might as well have been a 1-shot kill.  Later bosses even have attacks which are completely unavoidable, thus making you having to finish any fight in a fast time or you would die.  While they did insane amounts of damage, they also had incredibly high defenses, which also made the battle an endurance test because they could take forever to die, even if you used the attack type that they were weak too.In conclusion, while the game was still a good experience, the difficulty sometimes ruined the experience because there is a fine line between being fun and having a difficulty that ruins it.  If your a veteran or famailiar with the series, its alteast worth checking out.  If your new, its a skip because its definately not for the casual gamer and I would reccomend either Dawn of Sorrow or Portrait of Ruin because they are both equally good and by far better than this entry.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2009"}

Romano \"Avid Gamer\"","summary":"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a Fun Game","reviewText":"I am rating the single player portion of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 only.  I really love this game.  The single player campaign is a lot of fun to play.  I love playing the \"Special-Ops\" Mode too.After I played the single player campaign, I notice that some of the missions are based after movies.  The most obvious movie was a movie called \"Red Dawn\".  When the Russians invade the United States in the first mission of Act 2, that mission is called \"Wolverines\".  Well the name of the resistance fighters in the movie \"Red Dawn\" who fight the invading Russians are called \"Wolverines\".  The other movie that comes to mind is the movie called \"The War of the Worlds\" by Steven Spielberg.  There is part in the game where an American plane crashes into a nice suburban home in a United States neighborhood.  That exactly what happens in the movie \"The War of the Worlds\".  You can see that movies influenced the game developers on how to make this game.  I have to admit that the single player campaign is not very long, but it is a lot of fun to play.I am really impressed with the AI in this game.  I have played every mission in this game and the enemy AI terrorists and soldiers always react differently every time I played the mission again.  Even the AI dogs you fight against always react differently.  One thing I liked too was how any vehicle in the game will catch on fire and then blow up like a real vehicle. It is neat to see the hoods on vehicles fly up in the air and see the tires either blow up or roll down the street and the glass shatter from the vehicle windows.Their are so many different weapons to use in the game that it is fun just to try different weapons to use.  The weapons sound really good.The graphics are really good in this game.  I like looking at my surroundings just to look at different things.  In the mission called \"Cliffhanger\", the weather conditions changed from normal snow conditions to blizzard like conditions where you can't even see in front of you.  That is impressive.I would have to say the following four video games are so far the top video games to come out this year: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Killzone 2, Batman Arkham Asylum, and Uncharted 2 Among Thieves. One of these games will probably be voted for the \"Game of the Year\" award. These are all great games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2009"}

One's certainly looking for you.\"  Alice is unwittingly thrown back against nightmarish enemies with her trusty Vorpal Blade (\"keen and swift,\" the Cheshire Cat purrs), a Pepper Grinder, and a couple of other surprises for you to discover.  Her enemies are beautifully rendered and the soundtrack lends an urgent, ominous tone to the entire affair.  In addition, Alice's stumbling into the \"Drink Me\" fountain allows her to shrink at will, allowing her to see things that the \"big Alice\" can't see and allow her to crawl through keyholes, some cleverly disguised behind rocks.  And, throughout, shrinking will allow her to see the occasional crude drawing scrawled in a light neon purple warning her of challenges and suggestions of paths to follow.  There are other upgrades, to be sure, including weapons (similar to the God of War scheme except that you're using teeth, not red orbs).The gameplay is fun throughout and although hack-and-slash might help you with the first couple of nemeses that you encounter, you will eventually find others that will force you to adopt different tactics.  Unlike Dante's Inferno, this game will require a little bit more strategy on your part and the secrets are very well-hidden.  If there is anything that I feel detracts from the gameplay, it's the occasional area where you feel that you can explore a certain direction (say under a shallow tree root?), but you can't go that direction and no amount of shrinking will allow you to do so either.  That's too bad, because the \"force field\" walls are quite archaic in this era of game design and some graphical work could have been employed to suggest that a certain area is simply not traversable.That con aside, the game is a visual feast.  I occasionally would stop just so that I could rotate the camera slowly and drink in the sights.  The artwork is quite imaginative and is a stark contrast to the parts where Alice wanders around a somewhat lifeless London.  Now, I have read reviews that there are some occasional bland textures.  Call it what you will, but I attribute it to the fragmented mind of Alice herself; there is too much in this game that looks so good as to fault the programmers for areas (especially London) where it's seemingly lifeless and devoid of rich textures.  I simply don't buy it.  I won't spoil the artwork for you any further, but the level design and incorporation of everyday items as means for travel or building materials does make me utter the occasional \"wow.\"Now, as for story, don't expect any mind-blowing Hollywood movie here.  The point of the journey is the nightmare and the art.  With that in mind, the game succeeds quite admirably.5 stars, McGee, for blowing my mind away again!If that's not enough, the current release also includes a voucher to download the original Alice (just over 940 MB) for the PS3.  If you didn't catch the game the first time around, now's your chance to get it again without resorting to the insane prices people are charging for used PC copies.Alice is not for the faint of heart to be sure.  The Mature rating is quite well-deserved, although I believe that the cover would do well-enough to dissuade any parent who would ever think that this is a whimsical take on the Alice story worthy of an 8-year old.PS - just as an historical footnote, there are many who keep on stating how much this game is like God of War, Dante's Inferno, etc.  The original Alice predates God of War by about 5 years.  It's easier to compare this game to those, however, because they are considerably fresher in everyone's mind.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2011"}

I was caught up in a few great games (Dead Space 3 and others) so I didn't end up pre-ordering this game (boy did I luck out).  I did head to the internet though right after Colonial Marines was released as I was curious what everyone was thinking.  The reviews were almost laughably bad.  I was thinking that maybe people were judging it a little harsh because of their disappointment and that maybe, just maybe, it wasn't quite that bad.  I did see a few people give it higher (mediocre) reviews.  Well, I had an Amazon gift card and was done playing the other games and the price had already dipped down to about half of what it was when it was first released.  Like everyone said, the graphics are dated, the gameplay stinks, the atmosphere is barely there, the AI sucks, and the difficulty is all over the place.  I did read though that they had made it more difficult (maybe too much so) in order to try and make up for the shoddy AI.  Well, that didn't work.

Sleeping Dogs isn't really an original game, but it's so expertly crafted and fun, that this doesn't matter.Taking inspiration from the classic crime film \"Infernal Affairs\", Sleeping Dogs tells the story of Wei Shen, a cop from San Francisco who returns home to Hong Kong in order to infiltrate the ancient Chinese crime organization known as the Triads. As Wei gets deeper and deeper into the seductive world of Hong Kong crime, he starts to tread the line between cop and criminal, and it is this tension that forms the core of the Sleeping Dogs. Wei's story is gripping from beginning to end, filled with excellent supporting characters, shocking violence, and twists that will always keep you on edge. Open world games have come a long way this generation when it comes to telling stories, and Sleeping Dogs continues this evolution in the best way possible, weaving a tale that will pull you in hook, line and sinker.The main reason you want to play Sleeping Dogs, though, is for its fantastic gameplay mechanics which, along with Far Cry 3, are the best to be found in an open world game this generation. Every gameplay element in Sleeping Dogs is tight and refined. The hand-to-hand combat is exciting and deep, allowing you to use your fists, feet, weapons like knives and bats, and your environment, which leads to some true Hong Kong action film-esque fight scenes. The firefights, which thankfully are spaced out and never dominate the the action, are fantastic, featuring a tight cover system, meaty weapons, and even a bit of Max Payne-ish slowdown effects for precision aiming. A special mention goes to the vehicles of Sleeping Dogs, which handle incredibly well and never feel like they're fighting against the player, instead making travel by vehicle and the occasional races something to look forward to. The game is wonderfully paced, so that it never feels like you're doing too much of anything.Sleeping Dogs isn't perfect. The solid game mechanics are a blessing due to the fact that Sleeping Dogs doesn't really bring a whole lot of originally to the table. Also, the city of Hong Kong that you play in isn't the most appealing setting to be found in an open world game. It looks great and is quite vast, but it never feels quite as full of life as something you'd find in a Rockstar game, and lacks the intrigue of so many other recent sandbox games. But despite this, Sleeping Dogs is still a winner. The tight gameplay and strong narrative makes this a game that you'll have a hard time putting down.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants.

With Star Wars - Knights of the Old Republic, you get a complex RPG that sets you back a few thousand years before the Star Wars world we know and love.First, gameplay. This is sort of like Baldur's Gate / Morrowind where you wander through the worlds, have various options when talking with people, have a variety of main quests, side quests, minigames and more.Based on the Star Wars role playing game, your character gains experience, builds skills and even becomes more &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; as you go - all based on your actions in the game. There are relatively simple customizations of your character - male or female, soldier - scout - scoundrel. I love RPGs and found this a good mix of character development with not-overly-difficult complexity for those new to RPGs.The graphics were reasonably good - not as nice as the Splinter Cell games have spoiled me for, but different planets each have their own look and feel, lights glow, smoke fills up corridors. The music of course was great, all the authentic sounds, music and background ambiance that you've come to expect.Morrowind set an extremely high bar for 'wide open gameplay' and this doesn't quite come up to that level. There is definitely a main path to play, and despite varying your 'good' or 'evil' level, a lot of the gameplay is the same. Still, it is so involving, complex and varied that this is still a game that can be replayed and enjoyed!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2003"}

{"product_name":"B001HWB68K","reviewerName":"Mr. Ben \"ctsamurai\"","summary":"I bought it...","reviewText":"I was extremely skeptical of the release of this game.  I really didn't understand what ODST meant in the realm of Halo and what, if anything, would make this worth plunking down $60.  If you have been idle on Halo 3 and haven't bought the map packs, you get a pretty good amount out of this game.  The new campaign is a real change of pace from Halo 3, some of that is good, some of it is bad.  Mombassa is a very cool 'night-ops' setting to wander in and fight the Covenant.  The new soundtrack is amazing.  You get some new weapons, the new silenced pistol (my personal fave) and a new scoped SMG (a replacement for the battle rifle which is sadly absent).  There is also a new grenade type that sets things on fire, which is pretty cool. Replacing the motion detector is what is called the VISR, which is used as an enhanced night vision.There really isn't that much else differentiating an ODST from the Spartan you are used to playing in Halo 3.  The only other difference is that you can't dual wield small arms like the Brute Spiker or plasma pistols.  I have not yet beaten the game, but I can already tell that the story is lacking.  The campaign missions are actually pretty fun, even if you don't particularly care about who or why you're fighting or what part your mission may play in the overall plot.Outside of the new campaign, you get a new multiplayer mode, Firefight (called \"survival\" in Left 4 Dead and \"Horde\" in Gears of War 2) where you defend a position against wave after wave of Covenant.  I've only played it through once as a single player and realized the potential that that has if you can get your friends to join you.  Only downside is that there is no matchmaking feature for Firefight, so you'll have to party up with friends rather than waiting for Bungie to group you up.On the second disc, you get all the multiplayer maps up to this point (that is, up to \"mythic\") so if you have ignored the dlc that Bungie has released, you will be instantly up-to-date.  The multiplayer is still \"spartan only\"- so those ODST differences are basically limited to the campaign and Firefight.In all, this was a good buy for me, especially since the store I went to threw in GOW2 for $10.  It got me back into the groove of playing Halo, got me up-to-date on all the new maps and that is enough for me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2009"}

Reviewing this in 2012, the game does feel dated, since it cannot be compared to the high-res blockbusters of current times. This game was also released on last generation consoles PS2 and the original XBox.Graphics look somewhat pixelated especially on a HD TV but it is still passable. Sound is not up to par to today's games, but it does the job. Gameplay is old-fashioned COD.

Buy it because it bridges the gap to later Call of Duty titles. You can see the progression and improvements as you play through the series in chronological order.

I'm a SP guy and rarely venture in to multiplayer.The original idea for this game, to focus on Tier One special operative soldiers in Afghanistan taking on Al Qaeda is a good one, as is the idea of taking control of U.S. Army Rangers in Afghanistan. Unfortunately the developers forgot to include a compelling story along the way and bounce the gamer between not just two, but three, different characters.The single player game starts out set in 2002 with the gamer in control of a DEVGRU \"operator\" code named Neptune. You an the rest of your team are sent to find an informant and retrieve valuable intelligence. You're then tasked to complete several other objectives important in the early days of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. Unfortunately the game failed to make me actually care about what happened. You're never really told anything about who Neptune or the other two characters you're playing as really are. Also disappointingly there's no intel items to collect throughout the game that contribute to a larger narrative.Somewhat on the plus side I only experienced one level breaking bug and that was corrected simply by re-loading the level. That's frustrating but at least it wasn't game breaking. Also on the plus side the graphics in this game are pretty good. I think the developers captured Afghanistan quite well. I also thought the weapons were well done and the controls were standard fare, they didn't try to get cute and create something new out of the standard button layout all FPS fans are used to.On the minus side there are far too many places in this game where you have to be in just the right spot for the rest of the level to load. In one level I took out 50-100 AI soldiers before realizing they were just going to keep respawning because I wasn't in the exact right spot for the rest of the level to load.If you're looking for a good time just shooting bad guys without concern for the story whenever your internet connection is down and you can't play multiplayer this game is for you.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00030GS80","description":"There's always been a certain magic to Zelda games. The classic formula should have gotten old by now, but it hasn't. Perhaps it's because we all identify on some level with this shy, unlikely hero. Maybe the games remind us of our own childhood. Or perhaps these titles are consistently of such high quality that we can't help but love them. Regardless, The Minish Cap succeeds in all these ways &#x96; simultaneously embracing its links to the past while offering numerous innovations that keep gameplay fresh, exciting, and a true joy to&#xA0;play.The greatest of these novel concepts is the ability to transform from normal size down to the diminutive form of the Minish, a race of tiny people living right under the noses of the humans. This opens up entirely new realms of gameplay, as puzzles and even combat must be accomplished in different ways. When miniaturized, the smallest puddle becomes a deep lake, and the most mundane creatures become monstrous foes.There's a new item called the Gust Jar that allows you to suck up obstacles and enemies before blowing them back out in a burst of air. It's one of the cooler new power-up items I've encountered in any of the Zelda games, and adds yet another level of complexity to how you play. Another new ability allows Link to double himself, creating a ghostly after-image that mirrors his moves for a brief time. As you might imagine, this results in some clever and unique brainteasers that are a nod to the recent Four Swords games. In all these ways, the game challenges you to think in multiple dimensions and carefully remember details on your journey. A large cast of characters fleshes out the land of Hyrule, and monsters both large and small await your blade. To further connect you to the world's people, you will now collect items called Kinstones &#x96; broken halves of coin-like objects that can be fused with the Kinstones that other characters in the world have collected. By doing so, you'll open up portals, treasure chests, and secret doors all over the map. It's an addictive side quest that serves as a worthy compliment to the main adventure.One of my few complaints is that while the puzzles in the game are uniformly challenging, some of the combat is easier than I might have liked, especially against the bosses, who were often one-trick ponies requiring minimal skill. Even so, the fights are satisfying in their simplicity, and you have access to all the familiar weapons and techniques, including the boomerang, spin attack, and bow. The old and new features combine to make a game that feels both true to the Zelda heritage while offering an entirely unique experience.But more than any of this, the game charms you with its stalwart hero. This silent little boy with ruffled, messy hair is faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. Through him, the game establishes a hero whose pure heart and will are carrying him forward. All the elements of The Minish Cap (even its presence on the GBA) contribute to the idea of a tiny force for good that strives to triumph against a huge evil. It's a classic adventure that more than lives up to the legacy of a classic series.Concept:The time-honored Zelda tale retold in yet another new formGraphics:Mixing the familiar images of previous Zelda games with humorous and detailed new character designs results in an impressive success for the GBASound:Some of the most memorable and recognizable tunes in gaming sound great even on those little GBA speakersPlayability:Responsive and flexible with a nearly perfect learning curve that moves from simple to challengingEntertainment:Like many of its predecessors &#x96; a true classicReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerIssue:February 20052nd Opinion:There's a bird sitting on my head, I'm no larger than a toenail clipping, and I've been stuck on the same puzzle for the last three hours. Long story short, I'm having the time of my life. For any of you who played the remarkable Super Nintendo title A Link to the Past, The Minish Cap will bring a tear to your eye. This is classic Zelda gameplay in all its glory. The journey is a tad easy for my liking (boss fights are a breeze), but I can't get enough of the creative puzzles and new gadgets. Shrinking in height to a two-pixel speck is not only hilarious, it's one of the most compelling concepts that the series has offered up in a long time. Minigames are also in great abundance, and you can collect over 130 different figurines that shed some light on the characters in the world (which also happens to be one of my favorite aspects of Wind Waker). From its stunning visuals to its gameplay finesse, The Minish Cap is another harrowing Hyrule adventure that you'll remember for a lifetime.Rated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"That's 4 for 4 Nintendo","reviewText":"For some reason, of my 2 favorite game series, Zelda has managed to not release a single bad game, even average(for the record, I'm not including the atrocious CD-I releases). The other being Final Fantasy, and there's a couple I don't care for. I liked VIII but IX wasn't that great. Zelda has seen 4 releases since Game Boy Color, Link's Awakening, Oracle of Ages/Seasons, Link to the Past and now Minish Cap, and all have been outstanding.Story: While attending the Picori Festival with Zelda, Link finds himself in the middle of a battle for Hyrule has Vaati wins a swordsman tournament and unleashes creatures, and petrifies Zelda. Apparently, he's looking for an ancient power that would make him really powerful. Nothing new but it's still fun to watch.Graphics: Utilizing the look of most Zelda overhead graphics combined with the sprites and character designs of Wind Waker, this is quite a beautiful game. It's on Gameboy of course so it doesn't have a \"ooh, aah\" look of say Halo 2 or Metroid Prime but it still looks great.Gameplay: Most Zelda games revolve around what's essentially a gameplay \"gimmick\", there's a theme around it. Link to the Past was the light/dark world theme, Oracle of Ages/Seasons was being able to change seasons or go back in time, Ocarina had a time travelling aspect, Majora's Mask had the masks and Wind Waker had the sailing. A hat Link wears is the titular Minish Cap, a green bird-looking hat that allows Link to shrink down to the size of your thumb. He's not even bigger than a leaf. And the puzzles revolve around this.Minish Cap has some new additions. First is 2 new items: the Gust Jar which is essentially a vaccum cleaner to suck in enemies and shoot them back out or to clear hurtful terrain. And the Mole Mitts, which are basically cooler versions of the classic Shovel, only he can claw through special walls as well as dig in the ground. And you get your classic Bow and Arrow, the Boomerang, Pegasus Shoes, Roc's Cape like in the Oracle games.There's also 2 new features: Kinstone Fusion and Figurines. Kinstone Fusion is kind of like the Cinderella glass shoe in a way. Basically throughout Hyrule, there's these pieces of what look like a coin only it's broken in half and somewhere in Hyrule there's someone(or in a couple cases, something) that has the other half. Connect with them and it opens a secret, either containing money, a piece of heart, or another kinstone piece which will lead to a better item or an upgrade like your wallet or bomb bag.Figurines is kind of like Super Smash Bros Melee. Someone in Hyrule Town has a slot machine and the machine uses mysterious shells, found throughout Hyrule, you can bet up to 3 and try your luck at finding a figurine, with 130 to be found, 6 at the end. Figurines aren't really that exciting, but Kinstone Fusion is quite addicting as you're constantly looking around for that next person to fuse with.One complaint that people have, although personally is a godsend, is people think The Minish Cap is a bit too easy. And really, it kind of is. But after having your ass handed to you in a game then putting it away cause it frustrates you to much, it's not to have a game that while you don't blow through in a day, does offer a challenge now and then. For instance, the final boss while not being super hard, is kind of frustrating due to the fact you face him 3 times, each one with several phases. And in a weird way, fairies, the most heavily prized when entering a dungeon only replenishes 4 measly hearts, instead of 10 or 7, but just 4. Bah.You can blow through the game really quickly(I beat the game in 3 days), but you'll have quite a lot of fun with it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2005"}

The magic spells wernt anywhere near as many as the original fable.  I was expecting much much more from this game.  Character customization isnt all that original.  Yes you change as you grow to look more and more demonic or more holy but its only really sudal changes.  The addition of family and children is a nice new thing but its subpar.

{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"bayou_hannibal \"bayou_hannibal\"","summary":"The best RPG since Baldurs Gate 2","reviewText":"You don't have to be a Star Wars fan to appreciate what a great RPG this is, but it can't hurt.  Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is the best RPG that I have played at least since Baldurs Gate 2, and it is the best Star Wars experience since the first trilogy.  There is just so much to see, and so much to experience.  Then, when you are finished, you can go back and do it all over again as an evil character instead of a good one.On a high end video card, the game is beautiful to look at.  The level of detail in the graphics is astonishing.  The on-screen appearance of your character and your companions changes depending upon what you equip them with, and your physical appearance actually changes depending upon how good or evil you behave.  The environments are immersive and realistic, and also varied.  You fight on grass-covered plains, beautiful beaches, desert, and even a bit underwater.  The grass and the trees sway in the breeze and sand kicks up when you run across the beach.  Combat is equally impressive to watch.  Lightsaber battles are reminiscent of the big one at the end of &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;.  You watch characters thrust, parry, feint, kick, and slice with their lightsabers.  And then there's the force powers - oh the force powers.  They are fun to use, and dazzling to look at.Every NPC line in the game is voice-acted.  Every single last one.  And it's all high-quality material.  I can't state how great this part is.  It's like getting to play through a 40-hour epic movie.  Some dialog trees are huge and go on for minutes at a time.  Your NPC companions are fun to click on just to see if they have anything interesting to say, and they usually do.  They are deeply developed, unique, and have interesting stories to tell.  One of them, a homicidal droid, provides a lot of comic relief.  Another is brutal  mercenary who tells interesting war stories.  Chances are, you will want to take different party members with you on different quests just to see what they have to say.  Lots of NPC's have their own side plots, which are woven into the game.The storyline itself is not that great, but it's the way that the story is told that is so great.  The themes of Good vs. Evil and Light vs. Dark are shown to you over and over again.  These concepts are not explained to you.  Instead, you experience them for yourself.  You get to witness or perform good deeds, as well as atrocities.  If you are playing a good character, then by the end of the game you will have developed genuine feelings of distaste for The Sith and their Dark Lord, Malak.  If you are playing as an evil character, than you will have an opportunity to commit some truly heinous acts against helpless civilians, or your friends.  All of this gives you a true sense of role-playing that is unparalleled since Planescape: Torment.The role-playing system isn't as robust as D&amp;D, but there is still a lot to it.  There are hundreds of goodies like armor, weapons, and accessories that you can equip your character and companions with.  Chances are, you'll play a certain way one time, and then want to try some different setups the next time that you play.  You can change the color of your lightsaber, and change the crystals in it to upgrade its properties.  You can wield just one lightsaber, a double-ended staff sabre, or one in each hand.  You can also choose between brute force or finesse, but brute force seems to be an easier path.  As you progress through the game, there is a true feeling of power progression.  You can feel yourself changing from a lowly soldier to a godlike Jedi who at the end of the game slices through hordes of powerful enemies like a hot knife through butter.  That feeling of progression is what makes great RPG's like this so addictive.It's simple.  This is the best RPG since Baldurs Gate 2 (another Bioware title).  If you like Star Wars, or if you have liked any of Bioware's other role-playing games, then you must give this game a try.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2004"}

Or something.","reviewText":"As much as the Wii brought a true revolution to home gaming with motion controls and the minimalist Wii Remote, sometimes you just really really need to go back to a traditional controller to the get most out of certain games. The Classic controller was made with that intention. And it was one of the only good ways to play most fighting games, and many Virtual Console games specially anything that wasn't a NES game.The Classic Controller Pro fills that void pretty well. It has everything that it needs: left and right shoulder/trigger buttons, a left and right control stick, 4 face buttons, the + pad and the start (+) select (-) and wii Home button. These are more than enough to enjoy SNES, Nintendo 64 games and Wii games that demand a more traditional approach. (most fighting games really)As the original classic controller, the Controller Pro's wire connects to your Wii remote, as that is where it draws its power from and I'm pretty sure most commands are sent through the remote anyway. It's an awkward setup, but I suppose it saves you from investing on another battery pack and  from re-syncin controllers back and forth.The Classic Controller Pro in theory is not a bad controller, but it does have awkward things going on for it. It is very lightweight, and coming from generations where controllers have had some weight to them then it feels just weird to hold. Even the Wii Remote is heavier thanks to the battery pack you would place on it.The dangling controller is no biggie to be honest, but it might weird some people off.There's also another thing that I don't feel comfortable with, and I'm still not sure if it is a software or hardware issue: Controlling N64 games with the classic controller feels rather off... try playing games like Mario Kart 64, or games that depended on the N64's \"C Buttons\" which are now mapped to your right stick... it will never feel as natural as you remember. Nintendo should have allowed remapping buttons and adjust sensitivity of the stick to improve this experience a little. I'm sure that the technology used now is different from what we had back then, but this still feels like something that Nintendo could adjust if they wanted to. It doesn't mean games are unplayable, mind you. It just means you have to adapt to something a bit different.With that said, this is still a must own for Wii/Wii U owners to get the most out of Wii fighters, SNES classics and other games that demand such traditional type of layout.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-02-2013"}

In this one-player racing game you will need to find shortcuts, elude hazards and snag power-ups if you want to beat your savvy competition. Keep an eye out for sand, land mines, magnets and other trouble spots, but always be ready to get a boost from a speed or jump plate.

The character selection includes 3 new guys who are NOT all that wonderful, a couple of guys from Tekken 2, and the rest are all fresh from Tekken 3.  Everyone got a few new moves (most of which are pretty cool) and new outfits, but I would say that is not enough to warrant a purchase.  Story mode livens things up with drawn story scenes and CG scenes for each character.  Tekken Force mode is simply annoying, nothing more.  Beat the $h!t out of a bunch of mindless fools who come running at you... beat up some more guys, and so on and so on.  The new sidestepping, wall obstacles, positions changins stuff is also rather irritating; the computer knows how to do this far too well  and when it uses it, the match is all but lost.

{"product_name":"B000IMYKQ0","description":"The Wii Nunchuk controller is a secondary controller that adds even more innovation to the next generation of gaming, and does it all with less physical movement.Used in conjunction with the standard Wii remote, certain games need the Nunchuk controller for additional control options. Contoured perfectly to fit a player's hand,The Wii Nunchuk (left) connects directly to the Wii remote.View larger.the Nunchuk controller builds on the simplicity of the Wii Remote controller. The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance. Just be careful not to knock out your significant other, or bruise the dog, severely, while using one, or two Nunchuk controllers.","reviewerName":"Ray-Review","summary":"Nothing Bad, a good controller.....","reviewText":"The Wii Nunchuck Controller is an attachment to the Main Wii Controller which is sold seperatly.

Finkel \"Jack of Trades\"","summary":"The fun doesn't last","reviewText":"Bookworm is a straightfoward DS game.  All you have to do is select a letter on the screen and form a word by tapping a letter adjacent to the last.  You earn points based on the length of the word, bonuses denoted by the color of the letter's tile, etc.  What sets Bookworm apart from other word finding games is that occasionally (or in one mode constantly) a letter's tile will catch on fire.  A tile on fire will burn through tile's below it and if it burns through the bottom of the screen, it will \"set the library on fire\" and end your game.While this sounds fun at first, it quickly wears out.  Playing in the main mode, my first game took about half an hour and while it was a half hour of fun, I have had to force myself back to playing the game since.  The concept just tires too quickly.  One feature that gives the game a little life is the collection of 20 secret books.  Each secret book contains a dozen or so secret words with a common theme ranging from pets to emotions.  Once you form a word in a secret book, you'll be able to see all the rest of the words in the book.  Form all the words in a book and you get extra points.The presentation of the game is charming overall.  The controls work well and the music is okay.  However, nothing can make up for a flawed game design.  The main mode ramps up the challenge way too slowly.  The main mode needs more structure and variety.  It needs clearly defined and seperated levels, rather than merely a summary of points scored and a picture of a new room filling with books.  There is little feeling of advancement or reward for playing a lengthy and high-scoring game.  It seems that the 'action' game mode tries to address the turtle's pace erring of the main mode, but ends up being even less fun.Despite my loss of interest in Bookworm, I recognize that many will find the game appealing for a longer period of time.  While the occasional casual game, like peggle, manages to get me temporarily hooked, I'm mostly immune to the feverous addiction to spider solitaire, freecell, etc. that seem to plague most casual game fanatics.  I can see this is the type of casual word game that could easily hook the right type of person.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2010"}

With that being said, I had always been tempted to get a controller for my laptop but thinking I would not get much use out it I never did.Well, when this was offered to me I did not hesitate and got it. The controller does include a mini disc with instructions and drivers in case you want to do a manual install, the package however said that all you needed to do was connect it and it would be ready to be used. In my case it took a few minutes for my Windows XP not recognizing the device, which I thought was weird; before attempting a manual install using the CD included, I unplugged the controller and plugged it one more time, this time Windows XP immediately recognized it and installed it (weird huh? I mention it in case someone else goes through the same thing) Also if using this on XP you want to make sure the switch on the back of the controller is set to 'D' for Direct Input mode.The controller is like a mixture of an Xbox and PS controller, which is good if you have played either console, the controls will come naturally when using it and feels very comfortable. Please note this is not a wireless controller (not sure why you would need wireless to play in a computer but a friend of mine did make that observation when he saw it)So far the games and emulators I have played recognize the controller without any additional setup involved, depending on the game you play you can modify the controller settings as well.I am not sure how did I make it to play using the keyboard all these years.

There weren't any parts I didn't like until the last level where I felt like I was just playing some average shooter instead of a Call of Duty game, mostly because the fighting was reduced to running through corridors shooting from the hip pretty much at all times and throwing grenades when enemies got too blocked up. I guess I could have slowed down and played it more precisely, but the run and gun was what was working and anyway in the first half of this there was a time limit to get to a certain location. But this didn't really detract from the game as a whole anyway.The graphics are great, and especially shine on the level where you have to sneak around Cherynobyl in a camo suit. This level also had some of the most heartstopping moments in the game, and without any massive explosions or anything like that.A few more hours on the game wouldn't have worked with the story very well, but that should have been changed just a bit because as is the game is quite short.

Also, on the few parts that had no alarms, you could easily go around popping everyone with headshots without breaking a sweat.

If an enemy spots a downed comrade, unconscious or dead, an alarm is automatically raised, and all the other enemies reinforce themselves with flak jackets and bulletproof helmets.

Like many game franchises, there's enough familiarity and basic gameplay that anyone can pick up but in the end you want to feel like \"that was one of the best Marios ever\". In that regard, New Super Mario Bros is enjoyable in a way but it's also a bit too familiar and certain things are kind of all over the place.Story: Oh, do I have to say this? Okay fine, here goes: Princess got kidnapped and Mario has to go save her and in order to do so he has to keep travelling to different worlds to get there. I mean, Mario plots have never been about this so if you're thinking something even remotely in-depth as far as Mario is concerned like its Paper series, check your head.Graphics: This is where the game shines. While it's still 2D graphics, they're pretty attractive, well-animated and incredibly colorful. The overworld graphics resemble the board game look of Mario Party which gives it a better immersive quality rather than a yellow circle(Super Mario World) or a black square(Mario 3).Sound/Music: Surprisingly it's kind of forgettable. The music fits the world but it feels somewhat detached as if playing the game makes you tune out what you're hearing. Despite the fact that it's fine in the game,I call this a \"stereo\" game: I just put on a cd rather than listen to the game itself.Gameplay: Same as always: jump button, special button such as getting a flower you can shoot fireballs. The one problem is that the special button also acts as a sort of \"run\" but strangely Mario just feels sluggish which I've never had a problem with in a Mario game. There were times that I died simply because Mario didn't run fast enough to leap a ledge or simply he would just...slip off. I named it \"Butterfingers syndrome\" when I was young.The main selling point I guess is that Mario can nab a Large Mushroom and he essentially becomes \"Mariozilla\" where he just rampages through the level with a meter showing his escalading destruction. It's a neat idea but it either doesn't last long enough or it's just something that's not as fundamental to the gameplay. Think back to when Leafs and Feathers brought about new level exits and secrets but here it's just fun in a \"destroy! destroy!\" kinda way.Is it challenging for the young ones? It can be. Couple stages bugged me but whether that was my bad abilities(doubt it) or the game itself(maybe) but it's still one of the better DS games you can find but it's probably not its best.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S.

It seems to go too fast, but what a time I had with it, I'll always want to play more... the music is incredible.What's wrong with the game: the kitten had no reason to be in the game, it adds nothing to the story and has no payoff. The Shenmue.com site is down, so you can't trade pinball prizes or do anything of much fun... Also, if the kitten adds nothing, the stores add very little, you can't go into homes and most restaurants/buildings are purely for looks, and I never had to buy move scrolls, there were very few big fights until the end, you can ask a billion people the same question and they might all answer 'I dunno' in different ways, which is a waste of space and adds nothing to the mystery. The second disc could have put you in a new area or something but it didn't... the game is satisfying, but they chose to make it fall short of what it could have been.

I have never felt a game attack my cerebrum and all four lobes at once before like this game did.2.  This story is extremely deep, and you must accept the fact your looking at 3 months on this game.3.  Their is so many boss fights that I didn't feel the need to play RPG for a year after this game.  I don't know if thats good or bad.Cons1.  My only gripe about this game was some of the character designs looked stupid, but I overlooked because it's a different culture who might view our fashion sense as stupid as wellOverall this is a solid game with a lot to offer, and more.  This game surpassed FF Vii and FF X, and I am not counting FF X-ii as game because it was not an FF game it was idea to take money from gamers and rehash a bunch of bull.  I have only played this once because there is too much to do, and I don't got the time to revisit old games when I haven't even played new ones.  Everything you expect from a classic FF title with OMEGA included :D.  10/10..Game on my fellow Gamers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2011"}

Hughes","summary":"Totally underrated game","reviewText":"I love strategy games like Advance Wars, so I picked this up due to reviews saying it was similar. However I *almost* sold it after the first few hours playing, but THEN, it gets really good.Essentially the first few levels are really easy and boring. But once the \"Command Powers\" become available, and you realize you can call in airstrikes or have Banshee silently take out (one hit kill) have the enemies, it gets very interesting.I also really like how the story progresses during the level making the objectives constantly changing.If you like Advance Wars, give this game a chance, you should like it.UPDATE: Finally beat the game.  Some levels are beyond hard,  which is good and bad.  Good in that the game was never too easy,  bad in that the surprises (ton of new enemies appear suddenly) are crazy frustrating and meant you sort of had to memorize the \"steps\" to beat the level.What this game does right: it is intense and you really need strategy,  I mean a solid approach or you will surely loseWhat this game does wrong: limiting grenades,  i.e. Just let me hold more than 3 if I find them,  that is realistic.  Also Banshee's knife should always be a one hit kill on people and the command power flags would be disabled after certain events,  that shouldn't be.Overall still a great big for turn based strategy games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2013"}

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"michael","summary":"great halo game","reviewText":"halo 2 is a great game dont listen to the bad reviews i am a halo fan i own every halo game ever made and halo 2 is one of the best this game should have gotten 5 stars not 4 click the yes button if i helped","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2011"}

Who can forget fine games like Final Fantasy VI, Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy XII?Of course no one can forget Final Fantasy VII. This is largely because Square-Enix won't let us forget it. We have games like \"Before Crisis\" and Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus, and of course the incredibly well-done movie Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children (Limited Edition Collector's Set) (go find my review of it and vote it helpful! Please? I'll be your friend! ^_^ ). Now into this fray of Final Fantasy fantasticness, we have \"Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII\".Now, I never played \"Before Crisis\" (though neither did anyone else), and I haven't played \"Dirge of Cerberus\" either, so I can't compare this to those.What I can do is say that this is one hellishly good game! The graphics are amazing. The music reminds one of the music from the original game without directly copying it (except for in a few places). The plot, at least so far, is compelling and interesting. Further the game really opens up the world we were introduced to way back in 1997.The game isn't perfect. I still haven't found away to remove the annoying subtitles, and I do have to join in the complaints about how all you really have to do to win is press \"X\" a lot. Plus having the DMW screen pop up every few moments gets old. I'm also really sick of \"Active Combat mode activated\" message you get when you go into, well, active combat mode.That said, this is, without a doubt, one of the finest games on the PSP, joined in competition only by God of War Chains of Olympus (which I also enjoyed). It's probably one of the best RPGs I've ever played.Overall, if you like good action, great graphics, nice music and a plot you can chew your way through, then buy this game!

I think it's BETTER this way then it was in PoP 1. The dark and gory atmosphere better suits the story then the light hearted storybook style as the first. I also don't understand why everyone hated the music! I thought the music was great and was some superb heavy metal and really got the mood going. This one has everything great about the first plus more. More weapons, more abilities, more puzzles, longer campaign, unlockables, it's put together so well. There are more bad things in this then the first though but for some reason it doesn't detract from this game being so great. The enemies in this game can take FOREVER to kill unless you have a more powerful weapon and due to this can lead to constant frustration and many deaths.The levels in this game are constantly recycled where you'll do an area in the present the do it again in the past then LATER go through that area again. The level design, even though better and more intricate then that first, can make you lost very easily with no sense of direction.

The tale is brought to life by an all-star voice cast. Fans will revisit this beloved story and come to care for a new troupe of characters in KINGDOM HEARTS II.","reviewerName":"Feelah the tigress","summary":"An Excellent Sequel!","reviewText":"After getting the first Kingdom Hearts and being absolutely hooked, I jumped for joy when I heard that there'd be a sequel.  So I ran out and bought it when it released.  I must say that it's somewhat rare for a sequel to live up to the standard of the original, but Kingdom Hearts II doesn't disappoint!Graphics (score 10/10): The graphics here are very similar to the original Kingdom Hearts, and as such, they are just as good.  The art style is still somewhat rounded and cartoony, but everything still looks great.  No complaints at all.Music (score 10/10): The music is just as good as it was in the original Kingdom Hearts expect there's an even more awesome intro. song added into this game.  Just like the original Kingdom Hearts, each individual world has theme music based on the songs from the Disney movie that its portraying.  So, whether or not you enjoy the soundtrack is based a lot on whether you like Disney music.  At least there are no sing-along songs.  Lastly, the voice acting is excellent.Characters (score 9/10): Kingdom Hearts II starts off with a different protagonist (Roxas) who looks suspiciously similar to Sora (I'm not going to spoil it for you by telling you why).  Roxas seems a bit more intelligent than Sora, and you get very attached to him.  Unfortunately, you wind up back with Sora later (or perhaps the way they handled this is fortunate, because it really gives the story some emotional punch later).  Of course, various Disney characters and Final Fantasy characters makes cameo appearances.  What's really interesting, however, are the new villains.  These are the various members of an organization called \"Organization XIII\".  I find them a lot more interesting and sympathetic than Ansem (from Kingdom Hearts I) was.  I only wish that they had been given a bit more development.  You really don't learn much about them in this game before Sora gives them the axe.  This problem is alleviated in the spin-off game \"Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days\" (check out my review on that if you're interested).  In fact, if you play KH: 358/2 Days before playing Kingdom Hearts II, the deaths of these villains suddenly feel even more heart-wrenching.  I like RPGs that make me feel something for the characters, so this is quite awesome.Story (score 10/10): Be careful where you're walking or you might fall into a plot-hole.  Seriously, they added in some elements here that create some plot-holes for the original game.  The story is so entertaining though that I don't really care!  The biggest change to the story here is the introduction of a new threat to Sora and friends in the form of the \"Nobodies\", which are beings that sometimes come into existence whenever a person loses their heart and turns into a heartless.  What's all this talk about \"hearts\" and \"heartless\"?  Well, if you haven't played the first game you really shouldn't start with this one.  You will be confused.  Anyway, I'm not going to give anything away, but suffice it to say that the story if very good.Battle System (score 9/10): The battle system is very similar to the first game.  It's an action RPG so expect to be jamming on the X button and smacking things with a giant key shaped like a sword.  Or is it a sword shaped like a key?  Anyway, the biggest change here is the addition of the \"Drive Gauge\" which once filled allows you to enter an awesome mode where you have increased stats and can dual-wield keyblades.  It's quite fun.  You're team members (Donal and Goofy) are still A.I. controlled.  The game developers attempted to fix their terrible A.I. by giving an option to choose their behavior a little bit their a menu option (such as having them attack the target Sora attacks).  They are still kind of bad and shouldn't be relied upon by the player.  You can handle things quite nicely on your own, so this isn't a huge issue.Gameplay (score 10/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  I don't remember the camera going wonky on me much, so I'm pleased about that.  The rest of the controls and menus feel solid, so no complaints there.  As an added bonus, this game feels somehow easier than the first game, and since I dislike grinding, that's a big plus in my book.  I really have no complaints at all, so that's it for this section!Overall (score 10/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  Well, this game is just as good as the original; maybe even better!  If you played and enjoyed the first Kingdom Hearts, definitely go out and buy this one.  You might even want to pick up \"Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days\".  Just don't get Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories (just trust me on this - it has a tedious card-based battle system and it doesn't really add much to the plot).  One last word of warning: if you are interested in the Kingdom Hearts series and never played any before, don't start with this one - go get the original because the story will probably confuse you otherwise.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2010"}

This game gives the illusion of choice, but after playing the game to platinum i can officially say there are really only a few choices that can be made and most  end in exactly the same way.  I'm a huge heavy Rain fan, and this game fails in every way that made that game special.  There are moments just like in Heavy Rain that are really moving, but the lack of permanent death, and how the story is told out of order forcing any one choice from having any meaningful impact on the scenes that follow it.  One of the things that i loved about heavy Rain was to see how my combination of choices influenced the following scenes.  This game, has none of that mystery or excitement in a second play through, because each scene is predetermined.  On the over all story, parts were nice, mostly the first half for me, and the last few scene before the end, but the middle was nothing more then filler.GamePlay: The game play has been streamlined since Heavy Rain and mostly for the better.  But the choices of how to go about a fight scene have been completely removed and your left with one choice, win or fail.  if your fail Aiden will step in and simple save you... it a little to simplified.  I miss being able to choose if i want to hit the bad guy with the lamp or kick him.That said i loved playing as Aiden.  He can do basically three things, one: piss off the characters around him by messing with the surroundings.  Two: Kill people for Jodie.  Three: Solve really basic puzzles, like open the cookie jar.  But messing with people is fun, and when he's let loose the game shines, sadly the result is always the same story wise.Replay: this has little to do with my over all score but should be noted for anyone thinking about trophy hunting this game.  None of the dialogs can be skipped, expect to watch the same thing, over and over again.  you can do chapter select, but it starts from the beginning of that chapter, and a few chapters take an hour to complete...  I watched the Full second season of American Horror Story on my second play through.  But on a positive note or if you want to call it that, you can leave go to the bathroom, or make some dinner and the scene will carry on, Jodie just keep talking, even if i didn't choice an answer.  But I must stress because the variety of the game is heavily lacking, replay never seems to change the results of the gameplay.Over all the graphics are really nice, and it makes me excited to see what they'll be able to do on the PS4 for their next game.  The story, is actually nice for the first play through mostly, but don't expect the story to change enough on the second play through to be interesting.  I paid $25 on black friday and it was worth it, but if i paid full price I'd been disappointed.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2013"}

Sigh, just thinking about this game gets my blood boiling.  I can't for the life of me understand why some people are giving this 5 stars.  Well, first off, just let me say that I am female.  It should be glaringly obvious that this game is targeted towards a female audience (or so Square-Enix may believe).  Unfortuneately, I was sickened by this game.  Well, let's start with something good.Graphics (10/10): Not bad at all.  I'm not too picky about graphics and I can honestly say that these are pretty good.  Bright, shiny, nice for a PS2 game.Music (4/10): Honestly, this is a matter of opinion, but I didn't like the mix of jazz, techno and pop that made up this soundtrack.  The final fantasy series is known for its beautiful classical-style music, and this game is a huge departure from that.  The airship music made me want to turn off the sound and put a previous game's soundtrack into my cd player.  The only song I really liked was \"A Thousand Words\".Characters (0/10): This section may even deserve a negative rating.  It's like Square-Enix decided to make a game just for the women out there-except they chose the top 10% of the female populous that were the most stupid, shallow, and air-headed people they could find for advice on what to put in this game.  This game gives real women a bad image.  Yuna, a mature, intelligent character I love from FF10, has been kidnapped and replaced with a body double who has the intellect of a card-board box covered in glitter.  I mourned the loss of the real Yuna.  FF10 Yuna grappled with such deep and complex issues as self-sacrifice and questioning her faith, FF10-2 Yuna likes playing dress-up and uses words like \"dissasteriffic\".  Honestly, the other two characters are no better; they are just as shallow and stupid.  I was actually excited about the all-female cast, I was expecting the intelligence-level of the female characters from FF10--not to be found here.Story (1/10): Wow.  This story is vapid. It starts out promisingly enough-Yuna views a sphere of someone who looks like Tidus, and sets out to find out if the impossible task of ressurecting him can be accomplished. The rest of the story falls apart from there. The vast majority of this \"story\" is made up of mini-games and side-quests.  Now, I like sidquests and mini-games as much as the next person, but there's a reason they have the words \"side\" and \"mini\" in them.  They are supposed to take a back-burner to the main story.  In this game, it's the other way around: the main game is composed of one dull, uninteresting sidequest/mini-game after another, while the main storyline takes forever to emerge/develop.  By the time the main story finally got around to being focused on, I no longer cared.Battle System (6/10): I had no real qualms with the actual battle mechanic. The system is a variation of turn based that is rather fast -- battles move quickly and your characters move around the field, helping you break out of the \"let's all line up and attack\" feel of previous games (which I actually didn't mind at all).  I must say that the Dress-sphere system itself is actually a rehashed version of the Job system from FFV.  Except in FFV it felt serious and mature-here it feels like you're playing Barbie dress-up.  Also, unlike FFV, you usually need to switch outfits in mid-battle, which slows battle down in an irritating fashion.  Another complaint that brings down the score in this section is the irritating phrases of your characters in battle.  Just listening to Rikku sqeal out another irritating inane phrase makes me cringe.Gameplay (0/10): If the rest of my review isn't enough for you, here's the final nail in the coffin. I was excited when I heard this game would be non-linear.  I thought it would be like Chrono Cross, where there was a story that you moved through, but certain key decisions (i.e. choose to rescue a character vs. not doing so) made along the way would affect future plot points.  Not so here, it is a mission based system with almost no direction.  The only real effect skipping half the inane crap does is to keep you from getting the perfect ending.  Things as small and pointless as forgetting to talk to one random NPC in chapter 2 could make you miss 1/2 a point which would prevent you from getting that perfect ending.  The effect of this is that you must follow a guide to the nearest letter, thus ruining any feeling of \"non-linearity\".  Oh, and all those \"fun\" sidequests you'll be doing aren't fun at all.Overall score (1/10)- *NOTE that this is not an average, it's my subjective feel of what this game deserves.  As for whether you should rent or buy this, I suggest neither.  In fact, if you're a fan of the original FF10, I suggest you forget this game ever happened.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2008"}

McKinney","summary":"A great game for beginners or experienced gamers","reviewText":"Let me start by saying this game took me almost twice the amount of time as the on-line walkthrough I was using. But the great thing is that you can do that. It's very forgiving and give you plenty of opportunities to allow extended game play should you be a bit slower at solving the puzzles and defeating enemies. This game is mainly about strategy and puzzle-solving, which is why I like it so much. The combat isn't too difficult, thought the boss fights can be a challenge, especially the last one. I just wish that Nintendo had stuck with the $49.99 pricing for its games--$60 seems a bit much, especially since the game is relatively short (short for some, anyway--as I mentioned, it took me quite a while to get through it). Nintendo needs more big-name releases like this. I have been really frustrated with the Wii U. After the initial launch game release, there has been a drought of games. Perhaps Nintendo should have held off on releasing the Wii U until it was sure of an adequate amount of games. But nevertheless, this is definitely a game worth making a Wii U purchase if you don't have one yet.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2013"}

As a stock game, it is incredible. Build little people, build them a house, and watch them live their lives (or ruin those lives through malicious tampering). The problem is that very few people will buy this game cold- chances are you will buy it because you have Sims 2 and loved it. And it IS a step up from Sims 2- but if you've had Sims 2 all this time you probably have the expansions and stuff packs, in which case you may be frustrated. Right out of the box there is no downtown like in Nightlife, no pets like in Pets, and overall fewer items to buy and clothes to wear. That's to be expected- If Sims 3 had all the features of Sims 2 AND its expansions, how would you sell expansions for Sims 3? And rest assured, there are expansions to 3 to let you have all these things, and more. Still, I couldn't help but feel like I was playing a less complete game.That said, Sims 3 boasts a host of new features that basically smoke the stock version of the previous game:-Lots no longer exist in a vacuum. You can move the camera to a new lot and POW, now you're seeing that lot in full detail, with its inhabitants doing their thing. In fact your whole town is running on its own, quietly ticking away like a David Lynchian suburban drama full of mimes.-Free will is fun again! In sims 1 and 2 free will basically was just a \"make your sims ruin everything and die\" button. Now Free will allows them to pursue much more interesting, unique behavior. This is because...-Personalities are way better. Beyond ambition, you can now set your sims whole hosts of features and flaws to make them well-rounded people- or hideous monomaniacs. These attributes will influence each other. for instance a romantic sim will enjoy forming relationships and sharing special time with loved ones, but an EVIL romantic sim will thrive on adultery and the ruination of others' relationships.-More customization. You can customize your sims in greater detail, and tweak the materials that go into their clothes and possessions using a robust design lab. Ladies of the 21st century will be pleased to learn that female sims are no longer stuck with Barbie-like proportions- there is now a bust slider ranging from a b-cup all the way to... Well, like they were in Sims 2. Fat sims also look like actual fat people instead of thin people with pot bellies, and musculature and fitness are different things. A skin tone slider lets you faithfully replicate any shade. The end result is a more diverse sim neighborhood with more believable inhabitants. Unless you WANT everyone to be studs and supermodels. It's up to you. Model detail is upped overall but keeps 2's art style- think of how characters look in 2's box art.-Real pretty. This is a game for the casual crowd, but if you have a gaming PC you will see benefits.Of course there are also some flaws:-Loading time is a BEAST, even on a machine that totally exceeds the requirements in all areas. There is also lag when customizing your sims' appearances in the character creator.-The tutorial is invasive and horrible and you will hate it.-The UI has a lot of click-through and submenus- I think this is so you can operate it better with a keyboard if you are playing on a laptop. I get that this is to make it friendly to the casual crowd, but the UI is not as good as in 2.-As cool as the always-running neighborhood is, it does open the possibility of something undesirable happening to one of your families while you are playing another. Most significantly, they can just decide to move away. I assume this returns them to the family bin stats in tact though.Overall? If you don't have another sims game yet, or are still playing 1, absolutely buy 3. But if you sank tons of cash into 2 and got all the addons, keep in mind you will be moving to a less robust experience- albeit one with many technical improvements.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2012"}

Garrelts","summary":"5-STARS - GoW3 is a Must Own Title","reviewText":"As of this writing there are 358 reviews for God of War 3, so you could say that I'm a bit late to the party. Regardless having just finished playing through the game twice - once on 'Spartan' (normal) difficulty and once on 'Titan' (hard) difficulty I feel that I'm better prepared to write a review on God of War 3.God of War 3 picks up immediately where GoW 2 left off. So that's to say that the games are each direct sequels of one another. If you somehow missed out on either God of War 1 or 2 I highly recommend you pick up a copy of 'The God of War Collection' for the PS3. It's the HD remastering of the PS2 originals complete with all the bonus features, 720p - 60fps graphics and trophies packed on a single Blu-ray disc.In GoW 3 Kratos is finally at full-scale war with Olympus. No more messing around with battles against minions - this time Kratos is after the very gods of Olympus themselves. The game picks up with Kratos and the Titans ascending Olympus and immediately throws the player into an epic battle against the god Poseidon. This is where GoW 3 will really shine - massive, multi-part boss battles on a scale never really seen before in video games. If you're a fan of the previous games then you already have some sense of how far the series can take things - GoW 3 shatters that barrier and moves battles to new highs. The battle against Poseidon will leave you with your mouth open in awe. I don't want to get into too many more details about the story. I'll leave the spoilers out, but suffice to say that the story is satisfying and brings closure. The boss battles along the way are each unique and constantly offer something new and challenging.The much lauded graphical power of the PS3 really shines in this game. You can tell Sony Santa Monica truly has a firm mastery of the hardware in the same way that developer Naughty Dog (Uncharted series) has. The graphics will not disappoint all but the most biased. Playing this game on my 65\" Panasonic plasma was a visual tour de force. My wife stopped on several occasions and even remarked at how incredible the game looked and she's not exactly a gamer.The gameplay is exactly like the previous GoW games - best described as an action adventure, hack n' slash. I've heard the complaints about the game being a button masher and I would recommend anyone who is \"bored pressing buttons\" to try a higher difficulty setting. There is definitely more strategy in terms of the correct weapon choice and combo to use against particular enemies and combination's of different enemy types. Speaking of weapons Kratos has access to far more than just the Blades of Athena (Blades of Exile), but again I don't want to spoil anything. There are 4 main weapon types each with their own devastating combos.While the game does not offer any online mode to speak of there is plenty of replay value in the form of different difficulty settings, trophies to collect, challenges also return and are as fun (and frustrating) as ever! Also making a comeback are collectibles in-game that unlock special abilities and costumes for use on later playthru's. GoW3 also features a unique and cool new feature, the Combat Arena. In this mode you can customize a fight selecting the difficulty the enemy types and the amount of enemies to fight. It's just a neat way of fighting your favorite or least favorite enemies. You can even enable cheats so you can punish those pesky Satyr's into submission when you get frustrated playing the game on 'Titan' difficulty.Definitely a game I would recommend to just about anyone. As a side note, if you're a parent DO NOT buy this game for a child. It's extremely violent, full of gore and explicit scenes and features parts with female nudity. Other than that, play away and I hope everyone enjoys this game as much as I did!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2010"}

The graphics are well done, the music is very good, and even the combat is improved compared to Oblivion.  The leveling system is also enhanced and less restricting.  In Oblivion you had to basically read the strategy guide if you wanted to level your character correctly.  This time it all feels more natural, and you can add perks to the skills trees you are interested in.The world of Skyrim is beautiful and even the dungeons this time around are quite varied.  Frankly while I loved Oblivion, I do think Skyrim improved most aspects. Fighting and killing dragons is more exciting than closing Oblivion gates.  The music and voice acting deserve mention as well.  Many more voice actors participated in this game and it definitely helps you become more immersed into the world.  However, all the guards do sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger which is funny and somewhat annoying.  Jeremy Soule did a wonderful job with the music.  From the soothing tunes as you walk the world, to the hectic sounds as you fight an epic battle with a dragon.So having read all this you may wonder why I give this game such a low score.  Sometime after the 15 to 20 hour mark I started getting some minor slowdown especially in the bigger city of Whiterun.  Not a major deal at this point.  Unfortunately as time progressed the game became choppy whether I was inside a city or walking the world.  Sometimes the game would slow down to basically a crawl especially in a major battle with a dragon for example.  Resetting the game  would help for awhile but usually within 20 to 30 minutes I was having problems again.In a game this size I expect some glitches and bugs.  I usually have a few save files in case a quest has a glitch and I can't complete it or I end up stuck in the environment for some reason.  While annoying it is usually not game breaking.  The game slowing down to a crawl or freezing however definitely is.I certainly hope Bethesda can find a way to fix this. For those considering buying this game I would advise waiting or buying it for the xbox or pc.  Although those versions have issues as well they appear to be less severe than the ps3.  If the issues are resolved I will happily update my review.  When the game was running smoothly this was definitely one of my favorites in my 25 years of playing video games.Unfortunately I bought the collectors edition from a retail store. I fully expected the large Dragon I got with it to just sit around and collect dust. The fact that my copy of Skyrim is currently doing the same is definitely frustrating.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2011"}

Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords delivers a brand new type of game that pushes the puzzle genre to a previously unseen level.","reviewerName":"Tso Haven Hei Wan \"Havenough Dupont Randall-B...","summary":"Good concept with extremely annoying and frustrating execution","reviewText":"I love puzzle games and I love my rpgs. So when I first read about this game and all the raving reviews, I immediately went out and got a copy for myself.The game started off pretty cool but then what came along was just frustration beyond words could describe it.Ok, the mechanism and gameplay are basically throwing in a story to a Bejewelled type of puzzle game. So you match same colour marbles and blah together. Match 3 will make them disappear and 4 or 5 together give you an extra turn. Colour marbles are mana (so to fit in the fantasy rpg theme), skulls are attack, stars are experience and coins are em...coins. Since it is an rpg, of course you need to throw in a bit of level up - especially when you have stars as experience points on the grid. Through level up you can improve your abilities a la Baulder's Gate style and also learn new spells and attack. Sounds cool eh? It is indeed. The concepts are quite cool and full of flexibility. You can even learn your enemies' spells by capturing them and research them - all done through Bejewelled puzzles. You can even train your mounts and avoid attacks when they are levelled up. Mounts give you an upper hand in certain abilities and an extra spell / attack to execute on the battle field (usually you only have 6).Everything looks quite unique a package but then the fun factor was completely destroyed by the cheating game design. The thing is the game was programmed in a way that it is almost certain that your enemies have the upper hand. Since once you destroyed certain grid with your matching, new stones or items will appear on the grid, 99.9999999% of the time the new items work to your enemies' advantage. There were so many occasions that you only have one move on the whole grid that's possible, but when you destroyed that part, the enemy suddenly has an advantageous grid that give them 10 moves in a row. There were occasions that I had a lot more HP left but suddenly because of that the enemies just annihilate you in a flash. It is so frustrating that you just want to drain your DS into the toilet.Also as mentioned you can learn your enemies' spells by capturing them. So you did all that and learnt the spell. It turns out that you need to use a lot more mana points to cast those spells as compared to your enemies. So the enemies can cast deadly spell again and again but for you, once you did it once you have to wait for another century before you can do so again. And almost certainly that once you built up the reserve for spells, the enemies will suddenly use up all moves in the current grid and drain all your mana because there are no possible moves left. You will need a good reserve of explosive words in your language to deal with such frustration.Further to train mounts you have to defeat enemies within turn time limits. However as they level up, the time became so short in each turn that you don't even have time to look at the grid itself and it is already the enemy's turn. So after certain levels, basically there is no more levelling up. And you are stuck with what you have. And sometimes the mount spell that you got requires so many mana points that it is basically useless and being there to just fill up the screen space.Storywise it is really not much of story telling but the same old fantasy style with all the creatures you can think of in mythologies. Seriously I felt more refreshing with the small side story I unlocked in Zoo Keeper than the story Puzzle Quest tried to tell.The problem is with all those frustrations you still wanted to play because you got so annoyed that you just want to try again and again to kill them.If you are up for some frustrations and swearing with a good cause, definitely get this game and you can feel very fulfilled with yourself.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2008"}

Raillard","summary":"Fun, but numbingly frustrating","reviewText":"For the first few hours this game is a BLAST.  The concept here is a good old fashioned car chase, with you controlling cops or speeders.  The game physics are very forgiving, making this an easy game for beginners to enjoy.  This, however, is where the game also fails.  Because it forgives so much (no need to steer, guardrails will bounce you back on track; no need to worry, you will magically catch up if you fall too far behind, you never flip, you accelerate about the same whether you are on sand or road, etc), it also never rewards you for driving well.  You can race flawlessly for x number of laps, only to have some cheesy accident/cop/tree/competitor come out of nowhere to steal your victory in complete CPU cheeseball fashion.  This game offers a wealth of cool licensed cars (Ferrari, Porsche, Lambo, etc), but since the driving/physics model is so unrealistic, they all pretty much drive the same (ie: brakes stink, cars oversteer like nobody's business) and make the game's career mode ultimately unrewarding.The graphics are good, and the sense of speed is nice.  The sounds are great and lead to the ambience, the control is arcadey (a plus or minus, depending on your POV) and the replay value is decent.  It's a fun game, but don't look for too much depth or realism here (get GT3 instead).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2002"}

But that's where the comparison ends.Dark Sector for me was very fun, but the game didn't start out that way,it grew on me ,then I found myself having a strong desire to replay it again on the hardest setting after I intially beat the game. At first I didn't like the game but I stuck with it and really thought it's a very good game.Some of the boss battles at first will leave you scratching your head as what to do,but once I figured out there weak spots ,it was easy as gravy.I actually like not being 'held by the hand' so to speak ,having the game give me hints on killing a boss.For the most part you gotta figure it out without 'glowing parts' as hints on the bosses body, with exception the last boss.I actually loved my second playthrough on the hardest setting ,it was pure gamer bliss.One thing I highly,highly recommend is getting used to the 'Glaive' ,it will be by far your fav weapon in the game.You unlock the Glaive's various abilities as you progress into the game.I didn't find the Glaive hard to control at all,and it's really the hilight of the game.Overall a very satisfying enjoyable game, with epic boss battles,and decent Gears Of War like scenery,Dark Sector is a solid game.If you so choose you can use primarily use ballistic weapons ,all of which are upgradeable at various black markets you'll find in the sewers.I like the fact that you can duel wield ,have a Gliave in one hand and a micro-machine gun in the other. I found myself using assault rifles for distance enemies ,because the Glaive does have limited range.Think of the Glaive as a boomerang on steroids ,only it has very sharp blades.

Allen","summary":"Most awesome and emotional game I played","reviewText":"The Walking Dead is a rare gem for me. For one, there are only two games to date that really got me emotionally invested in the characters. The first being Final Fantasy 10, with the story of Yuna and Tidus, the other is the Walking Dead video game. The game is rare in the sense that its major selling point is the story, not the gameplay itself. The casting of Walking Dead is memorable. You play as Lee a man who was on the way to prison and along the way got free because of the zombie Apocalypse. During the first few minutes after being free, Lee comes across a little girl by the name of Clementine and the two quickly clicked together. The game centers around Lee and Clementine but each significant character you meet is expanded and played out across five episodes.The big selling point of the game as I said is the story. The story is probably one of the most thought out stories I ever seen in a game. Choices you made at the start can have drastic effects later in the game and episodes are connected. Your choices also can determine who lives or dies. And even more so characters may be on your side when tough decisions are going to be made depending on little things you done with them earlier. It's difficult to give specific examples without spoiling major plot points.Otherwise the game is mostly a point and click style adventure. There are \"bubbles\" on important objects and you hover a cursor over it and do an action on it. Even when you are under attack or fighting, the game has \"bubbles\" that you hover over and click to do whatever it is that is needed. Now sometimes quick timing is required otherwise another action may take place. For example, you're running to jump on the other side of the building and you have literally a few seconds to hover over someone's hand and click it for you to make it across. Other times might be that you are running in a group and a quick comment that can change the story might appear for literally a few seconds. You have to constantly pay attention. What I'm trying to say is that precision is not really necessary in this game other than having the ability to quickly pick up on things at a moment's notice.One thing I liked about the game is that there are many surprises. There are a few times in the game where I literally say, \"Whoa\" out loud like in shock. The game is that awesome. Each episode is about two hours and you get a total of five episodes. My knowledge is that the disc version and dlc versions are exactly the same. With that in mind, if you already own the 5 episodes as a DLC then you might just get by with that unless you want to get the disc to contain the episodes. As you play each episode, there are some key decisions being made. You know that you made an important decision when in the upper left corner pops up a notice that something happened. For example, you might say something negative, and someone in the group might take notice to that. In other circumstances, if you saved certain characters, they might know something about you that you might not want to share with someone.In all the game is about the people, not the zombies. When you play the game, most of the drama comes from people and each group member plays into that as you try to live and make things right.Each episode is a bit different in what it focuses on but overall there is a singular goal that everyone is working towards. At the start, you might get confused as to who to trust and who not to trust. Or you might try to gain everyone's trust. There are pros and cons to every thing you do in this game. And some of the saddest things occurs when you least expect it.Overall I say get this game. As a zombie fan myself, I had to get it but on the flip side it's one of the best games I have ever played. At the end of Episode 5 I was in shock and never had I been so emotionally invested into a digital character. Lee for all I know will go down as one of my greatest hero in any game. The sad thing though is that this game is broken up into seasons. This is season 1 and apparently there are plans for season 2. I don't really know what to make of that other than to say that I can't wait to see what folds out. It's hard to say this game is complete as the Walking Dead is generally a continuously moving and evolving story. From the comic books, this game is one of the closest and you meet I would say a few characters from the comic books in this game though you don't meet Rick and the rest. Who knows what might happen in Season 2.Get the game. For 29.99 this isn't that bad. You get about eight to ten hours of gameplay with each episode being 2 hours. You can replay countless times too knowing when key decisions are made and to see what will happen throughout the game. Once you know the whole story, you might want to replay just to see how it would fold out the other way.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2012"}

As for the game itself, it is fantastic. It's a great bit of a throwback to the old PC point and click games of the past and features one of the absolute greatest stories i've ever experienced in gaming.

Since we were all about seven-years-old at the time, we didn't last very long into the night and I ended up puking. But I do remember the wonder in all of our faces when we fired up that game and we were greeted by the colorful and enthusiastic characters. Talk of becoming a \"super star\" captured our imaginations as we geared up to party. It was one of the few games we played where even though we played competitively, it wasn't so much about winning rather than the sheer enjoyment we got out of playing it together. It became an instant classic among us.Ever since then, Hudson has been releasing iterations of the same game each year, each more monotonous than the next. Year after year I would give the latest one a try, and then leave, feeling disappointed and unconvinced that the latest party outing was worthy of my time or consideration. Frustrated and disillusioned, I left the Mario Party scene and moved on to other games.Recently I dug up the Nintendo 64 and brushed up on a few of the games I loved back in the day. I hadn't even thought of Mario Party for a few years, and to my pleasant surprise, Mario Party 2 still makes for a great party. It arose my curiosity... what has the series has been up to recently? I picked up Mario party 6 and loaded it up. At first it kinda looked like another crappy iteration. But as I played, I found something a little different.For the readers who have yet to play a Mario Party Game, there are basically two aspects of the formula. First, a cast of Mario characters take turns rolling dice on a virtual board game, where the goal is to collect coins by various means, which in turn can be used to buy stars. The player (out of 4) with the most stars in the end wins. The second aspect is Mini-Games. These simple yet fun games are activated by landing on certain spaces on the board, and are hosted after every turn sequence. The winner of the mini-game is rewarded with coins. Mini-games have been a staple of the series and are accessible for anybody to pick up and play. That aspect of gameplay, along with the random nature of board games in general, make this a great game for kids, older players, and other contenders, who might not have experience with video games, making it a perfect party game.Mario Party 6 has not strayed from the core mechanics in this respect at all. For the most part, that is a good thing because the core mechanics allow for the foundation of a great game. But the problem with previous games in the series was that there were little to no meaningful additions to the formula, which was beginning to show its age. While the quality of mini-games decreased, the real issue was the board game aspect, which suffered from pacing issues and increasingly uninteresting, monotonous gameplay.Mario Party 6 is now here and seems to offer solutions to those issues.  The first major addition is an improvement of \"item\" use. Items, which are objects usually used to benefit the users, are now called \"orbs\". While some orbs are intended to benefit the user directly, many can be thrown onto nearby spaces to hinder other players and steal their coins. If a player lands on their own space, they gain coins. It is reminiscent of monopoly, and in its own way reinvigorates the board-game aspect of the series.Another big addition is the new boards that actually completely change the way games are played. For example, on the Snowflake Lake board, each player stars with 5 stars. The catch is that the board is entirely based upon stealing stars from other players by summoning Chain Chomps from their homes, which can cost different amounts of coins depending on the situation. These innovative boards offer refreshingly different ways to experience the board game.Finally, board activity has been sped up a whole lot, improving (but not solving) the pacing issue. All of these factors combined do make a much needed difference in the failing board game aspect of the series.The mini-games in Mario Party 6 also seem to be an improvement over its predecessors. Mini-games in previous iterations traded quantity for quality. So there were a lot of mediocre games and plain bad games. In Mario Party 6, there seems to be fewer stinkers even though there are over 80 mini-games. Some are so fun you might just skip the rest of the experience and want to just play them in Mini-game mode, which allows players to play only mini-games. A microphone is included for additional mic-based mini-games but it is a gimmick. You might have a little bit of fun for a few hours before it gets obnoxious, but luckily the microphone is not required and can be omitted completely.It should be noted that this game will only be fun if it is played with friends. Players who go into this game looking for a decent single player experience will be surely disappointed. The game is funnest with all four players and the fun decreases as there are less human players (actual human players will be replaced by CPUs, which are passable but not very fun). This is just an unfortunate truth that exists in all Mario Party games going back to the ones I loved as a kid.Graphics are utilitarian, meaning they serve their purpose. They are not impressive by any means, but they are clean and unoffensive. Music and sound are not great either, but they do not detract from the experience. The whole presentation is a little childish and juvenile. Nintendo is obviously trying to appeal to younger audiences, so you might be discouraged to play with your macho friends. But if you can look past that, the gameplay will more than make up for it.Mario Party 6 takes me back to what I loved about the series as a kid. It's that same competitive yet imaginative wonder I shared with friends as we partied 'till dawn. It attempts to solve many of the issues plaguing previous iterations with considerable success. Those who aren't fans of the series will not be convinced otherwise, but those willing to give this game a chance will find a fun little gem, a definite must for your next party.4 stars out of 5.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2006"}

This game is the furthest from the franchise to date.I enjoyed Resident Evil when you were thrown into an environment, had to figure out how to get out and were threatened by the creatures and lack of ammo etc. (Gahh I have to go through this hall in the mansion to get a key that's down there but I know the 2nd hallway is full of zombies and I have 5 bullets). The first games RE1-RE3 were about 65-70% puzzle and 30-35% action. Now we are down to way less than 5% puzzle (I say that liberally with regard to what could be considered on leons quest) and 95-99% action. That in itself doesn't make it a bad game, I like games that are solely action oriented, its just the action at many times is practically on rails and has you walking through a lot of quick time events and cut scenes which hurt the flow, the camera is not as good as re4-5 and revelations and many times you are forced to run TOWARD the camera which is the worst view possible because you cant see what you are running into (obviously someone thought this made for good cinematics).Having said that, it does have a few good ideas for the series, monster play would be good if it were further developed, the way the enemies (perticulary the zombies) show damage is much improved. It was a good idea to have different story lines but I wish it were developed further, meaning that if Leons quest was ment to mimick old RE, then put him into that role more, and if Chris's was about action and being a captain of a bsaa squad, then let me do the things a captain does like tell all my squad what to do etc. If sherries was suposed to be like the RE3 tyrant that chases you, then make it even more so. Then it would be more like having a few games in one but all based around the RE story which would be cool and keep everyone happy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2013"}

Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Kyle Slayzar","summary":"Excellent Sequel with Beautiful Atmosphere, Lacks Length and Has Moderate Glitches","reviewText":"If any of you played the original, you remember many of the WTF Mate moments that made the game.  It's rare that an FPS actually succeeds in making a horror game that works.  Others have tried, but failed miserably (This means you Condemned 2!!) whereas FEAR captivated many gamers with creepy atmospheres, bizarre moments of hallucinations, and one strange little girl that you wanted to either hug or give a swift kick to.In other words, for us gamers FEAR 2 had a lot to live up to and they did alright but I fear the FEAR franchise is going the way of Halo; letting it go to their head.The story is simple.  You are Delta Operator Beckett sent in to extract a bad CEO from some company doing bad things in a town plagued by weirder things.  In the process, all goes to hell and so does reality and the story as well.  The story keeps you reeled in w/o the main character engaging in any dialog and without any cut scenes scene outside of first person.  This is what made the first FEAR and Project Origin does a good job of staying faithful.  The ending, however, is a Halo 2 \"that's it?!\" since it ends so bloody abruptly.  When the credits started to roll, my brother and I looked at each other and spent a whole minute exchanging \"uhhhs\" and \"huh.\"  Like a rug in The Big Lebowski, endings are supposed to tie the story together but perhaps I am spoiled by RPG endings.Despite the WTFness of the ending, Project Origins does sport some major improvements.  The animations are top-notch and true to reality.  When you have to press a button, move something, or open a door, you actually have to temporarily move your weapon while your other hand does the action.  This grounds the animation in reality and is executed properly, especially when you use the ladder (which is automatic instead of requiring you to carefully place your aimer).  The aiming reticules are also improved as the weapons have red-dot or neon iron sights similar to actual firearms.  Even the recoil is accurate and the movement through the sights as movement causes the red dot to move around since they are never really fixed but projected.Another improvement is the weapons and their balance.  The shotgun is no longer an end-all weapon and you can hold more then 100 rounds of assault rifle ammo as opposed to the first FEAR.  Grenades are also more abundant and you don't accidentally shoot incoming grenades (which causes them to explode in midair) as easily as the first game, which caused me more deaths than anything else.  The special weapons are also more abundant such as the penetrator (now the Hammerhead) and the sniper rifle.  Not to mention new weapons such as the laser.  Sadly though, the particle weapon seems only to come at the end of the game.And yet another improvement is the enemy AI.  Replicants are no longer just small obstacles but considerably smarter opponents.  In the first FEAR, you could slow time down through \"reflex time\" (which is in Project Origin), dash into a crowd of Replicant soldiers, lay waste, and then take cover.  Not in Project Origin... or as much.  Now the enemy will actively try and outflank you so it is easier to get pincer in by enemy troops.  Sadly, they no longer talk like Half-Life marines but still scream like them.  The stealth ninjas only appear towards the end of the game and are a lot easier to handle as they appear in better lighting so it's easier to recognize the distortion they create.  No more hiding in wait.They also created three new, and very annoying, enemies.  The first are what I crawl \"non-tongue lickers,\" a play on the Resident Evil version but they do not have tongues.  They will, however, crawl agilely across floors and walls and lunge at you.  The second are what I call \"puppet masters,\" civilians that have little stringy tentacle thingies that resurrect the dead to kill you.  To me, these guys were the most annoying because they usually soak up the bullets like a sponge and will continually bring back those you just killed.  The third are the power units, similar to those in the first FEAR, but a lot more dangerous as they have shields and will chase you down.  However, you get to drive two later on!!  That was my favorite part as I was driving the armor down the street, laying waste to... everyone, almost casually.  The only features missing in the power armor is a Mr. Coffee and an MP3 player since I was humming \"On the Road Again\" by Willie Nelson while launching rockets.The last improvements, and probably the most important, are the atmosphere and the freaky moments.  The first FEAR executed this almost flawlessly so how do you improve upon that without going overboard?  Simple, Monolith simply spread them out so the player, who probably played the first one, will keep expecting it and then lower his guard since it doesn't happen as much.  I noticed there weren't nearly as many freaky apparitions or lunge in front of you moments, although you do wrestle with Alma more.  My personal favorite scene involved an elementary school and a crap load of lockers.  There is also a lot more blood and gore as the first one.Now, despite all these advantages, there are three distinct complaints I wish to bring up.The first is the length of the game or the lack thereof.  My brother and I started at 3pm, played until 5:30, stopped until 7pm, resumed then, and beat the game at 11pm.  If you do not count restroom and food breaks, our total completion time was (rounded up) 6  hours.  The first time around in FEAR, which had around 13 intervals as opposed to Project Origin's 7, took twice as long and then half the time the second time around.  An FPS should take longer than that but, as they did with Halo 3, they figured quality would trump quantity.  It doesn't quite work this time around.  They could have expanded significantly or, oh I don't know, MADE THE ENDING LONGER!!The second is how the wacky linear nature of the environment is hard to tell at times.  By that, I mean it can be very hard to find the hidden ladder needed to advance, or the door, or even see the lock you have to shoot out.  Dead Space did an amazing thing with the interface by allowing the player to press a button to see where they had to go and it did not take away from the overall experience.  This isn't Resident Evil 2, where you bounce back and forth in the police station like a ping pong ball.The third, and probably my biggest complaint, are the blatant transition glitches.  I swear, my brother and I are glitch magnets.  When Alma attacks and you have to fend her off your person it ALWAYS effects the environment whether it be opening an elevator door or knocking some boxes down.  However, three times the transition did not occur and we were stuck to either wander around endlessly or reset to the last checkpoint.  The first time was in the elementary school right after we fought the principle.  We went back to the elevator and fought off Alma.  Normally, she opens the doors but this time they did not and we wandered around for 20 minutes trying to figure out where to go.  Once we restarted, we did the fending off again and this time the doors opened.  GLITCH!!  This happened two more times during the same play through.  THIS is bad.All in all, FEAR 2 will dazzle previous FEAR fans with brilliance while no players will be dazzled with BS as you seemingly have to be a fan to appreciate it.  Nonetheless, if you're a new player then do yourself a favor and get the first FEAR, THEN get this one.  It is well worth it, I promise you.Overall, an 80/100-10 for glitches-5 for lack of length-2 for hard to find paths-3 for bad ending","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2009"}

If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies. The ships move with a fluidity and grace you wouldn't have thought  possible from such a tiny purple cube.

The result is both fun and sometimes frustrating.Unlike just about every game out there, The Getaway doesn't give you any breaks. You start out watching your wife get killed and your son kidnapped. And then, without any training or help or 'get used to the system', you have to do a *timed* car chase.You don't know where you're going. Even though your *character*, Mark Hammond, would of course know London, YOU don't. So you're stuck with this really annoying flashing-turn-signal system. It tells you in general which direction to go - but isn't good at exact turns. It can have you zig-zagging all over creation.The car modelling is good, and the driving is fairly realistic. The cars seem to be very flammable and prone to skidding, though. Where a good driver could get through situations fine in real life, in this game you're constantly restarting because your car got bashed into a wall or caught on fire after a few bumps. You can't look left or right (or behind for that matter) so you're constantly getting slammed into from regular cars you didn't see.Finally, you figure out your destination. Now you're thrown into a GIANT gunfight. Again, no getting-used-to-things here. There are no health bars, no indicators, nothing. All you have is red spots on your body and the ability to lean on the wall to gain health. I think a medkit is far more realistic actually, to stop bleeding and feel better!That's not to say I didn't like the game. We did enjoy playing it, first 12 missions as bad-guy Mark Hammond and then 12 more as rogue-cop Frank Carter. But where other games give you a sense of satisfaction as you plow forward, this game involved a ton of replaying the same mission over and over (many times with long cut-scenes which were unskippable) and getting killed because someone broadsided you, or someone shot you 3 times (you die very quickly) or a myriad of other reasons.The graphics are *gorgeous*. When you shoot someone on the stairs, they roll down. The car models are great. The city of London is extremely realistic, as you can tell by looking at any real life London map. There are a ton of indoor and outdoor scenes.But the game is very stagnant. Your missions are forced down your throat, no breaks. No 'hang out' or 'drive around' time. No day/night cycles, no weather. Characters love to swear and are just nasty with each other 99% of the time - no cool dialogue. Sometimes the dialogue doesn't match up with the action, either. You only get to have 'free drive' at the very end of the game.A good way to blow through a weekend or two, but definitely not the months-of-fun that the GTA series provides!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00008QOL6","description":"When it comes to first-person shooters, there are two schools of thought. One harkens back to the originalDoom--frantic action, scary monsters, big weapons, and story is given short shrift. The second school is best exemplified byHalf-Life: strong narrative, consistent real-world weapons, consistent monsters, and settings.Doom'sheirs up until now have beenQuakeandSerious Sam, but nowPainkillercomes onto the scene leaving bloody footprints, and &#x85; let the carnage begin!You play a man who dies in a pathetic car crash (he's distracted because he's holding his girl's hand) and has spent a long time in purgatory. He thinks this is unfair because, despite being well-schooled in the art of killing, he maintains that he's done nothing wrong. Heaven makes a deal with him. Take care of a little invasion problem concerning Hell, and our hero can enter those pearly gates.Weak storyline aside,Painkillerbasically amounts to a brilliant series of arcade-style levels and challenges. The settings include darkened monasteries, graveyards, a horrifying asylum, a medieval town under siege, and even H-E-Double Hockey Sticks itself. The level design is brilliant, varied, and jam-packed with enemies. There seems to be no end to the amount and variety of cool monsters to fight, and they each explode into chunks of blood and gore in a most disturbingly satisfying manner. At the end of each level is a challenge, such as collecting a certain amount of gold or killing a Boss within a time limit. Winning the challenge gives you tarot cards you can use to make the game easier. The different cards bring haste, double-damage, invulnerability, and so on. This simple mechanic makes the game far more replayable than your average shooter.The graphics are first rate, which means you need a powerful PC to run the game with all the detail settings maxed out. The only other problem is a CD-copy protection bug that makes the game unplayable for some (a patch is available).Painkillermay seem a bit silly at first glance.

One of them is pure, addictive, incredible-looking, adrenaline-pumping action Nirvana.  The other is a dull and sometimes frustrating game when Painkiller deviates from its formula by trying to give you something besides mindless action.  Thankfully, the former is what you get to play most of the time, which is why Painkiller is such a great game.When Painkiller is on, it is really on.  This game does &quot;mindless action&quot; as well as any game has ever done.  Picture yourself running around the edges of a room, never standing still, shooting at stuff like there's no tomorrow, trying to gun down and blow up dozens of enemies while dodging their punches, axes, swords, and bullets.  A wide variety of enemies exists for you to blast into bloody chunks or stick to walls with your stake gun.  The generally have simple behaviors.  They rush at you, shoot stuff at you, or shoot stuff and then rush at you.  There is just enough variety in the enemies though to keep you on your toes and force you to use all of the game's 5 well-balanced weapons.  There are enemies that poison you, enemies that slow you down, enemies that take 3 shotgun blasts to kill, enemies that zig-zag when they rush at you, etc.  You will quickly learn the hotkeys and alt-fire modes for your weapons and switch back and forth, based upon what situation you are facing at any one second.The game only has five weapons, but don't be deceived into thinking that this is some kind of shortcoming.  They are all really cool and useful, and each has a meaningful and useful alt-fire mode.  Thus, the game effectively has ten weapons, all of which you will use frequently throughout the game.  The game's namesake weapon, The Painkiller, is like a chainsaw on crack.  The shotgun has an alt-fire mode that freezes enemies in their tracks so that you can blast them to bits with one blast.  The stake gun is a powerful weapon that showcases the game's rag-doll physics by letting you impale baddies onto walls.  The fourth weapon is a powerful chain gun/rocket launcher combo, and the fifth weapon can create a miniature electric storm that fries anyone who comes near it.A couple of minor upgrades in this game make it slightly different from other run-and-gun shooters.  The most notable is the collection of souls, which come from the bodies of your fallen enemies.  The souls only stay on the screen for a short time, so you have to run and collect them.  When you collect 66 souls, you morph into an indestructible demon for a short time.  Thus, the game actually rewards you for not running backwards all day.  Another feature of this game is the tarot card system.  Tarot cards are basically power-ups that you can use once per level, and that you unlock by accomplishing certain tasks (like finishing a level using only one weapon).The graphics for this game are gorgeous, and they exist across a wide variety of scenery and environments.  Everyone one of the game's 24 locations looks different.  All of the scenery is inspired and creative.  Painkiller shows an astonishing level of polish and attention to detail that I don't think I have ever seen in a first person shooter.  One little example of this is in the game's fantastic Opera House level.  All over the Opera House, there are at least a couple dozen paintings on the walls.  And all of those paintings are highly detailed and unique.  None of them repeat.  This is different from most games, where scenery such as this repeats the same five or six items.  As I said, this is a minor detail, but it is one of many, many little things that prove that an enormous effort went into this game.The game's audio is also impressive.  Most of it is consistent with the bizarre afterlife setting that the game tries to convey.  In most areas you can hear low-pitched moans, whispers, creaks, etc.  The exception might be the game's heavy metal action soundtrack, which isn't bad, but seems a bit out of place.That's the great part.  Then there's the &quot;other&quot; game-the one where Painkiller tries to do other stuff, like forcing you to break open a hundred containers on every level looking for gold.  Yes, that's right.  The game is like Diablo when it comes to breaking open boxes and chests to find treasure.  You have to do it, because you need gold to use your Tarot cards.  This stuff isn't much fun in RPG's, so it is TOTALLY out of place here.  To make matters worse, a lot of the gold and ammo are hidden in secret areas.  These areas are insanely hard to find, and just as hard to get to once you do find them.  I was able to find over 50% of the secrets in Serious Sam, but I couldn't find 10% of the secrets in Painkiller without help from the message boards.  You could spend 2 hours searching a level for the secrets and only find 2 out of 4 of them.  Occasionally, the levels are set up in a way that makes it hard to find an exit.  Once again, this is when the game is NOT fun.  Painkiller would have been better without the material that disrupts the fast-paced action.The end boss for this game was a huge letdown.  I spent a frustrating hour trying to figure out what &quot;magic trick&quot; I needed to beat him.  Then I went to the message boards, found out the trick, and beat him in about 2 minutes.Painkiller takes the old Quake and Serious Sam formula to a new level.  While doing so, it also provides an experience that is different from those games, and in some ways, better.  If you enjoy defeating swarms of enemies in fast-paced shooters, then you can't go wrong with Painkiller.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2004"}

InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"Joey","summary":"MOH is the best","reviewText":"Medal of Honor Frontline is a really great game.

Scroll back to the upper left corner of this product's web page to see them.I'll address the issue of the metal rivet first. Yes, there is a metal rivet at the bottom of the PSP compartment. However, my case has a bit of material over it and the rivet does not come into contact with my PSP (see product image). I know that some reviewers have cases with bare metal rivets so I assume that this is a correction made by the company or there was a batch of cases where somebody forgot to put the covers in.The other complaint is about fitting a PSP inside of the case. It fits and I invite you to check out my product image to see for yourself. However, it is very snug (see image). I have all linds of gizmos from pocket camcorders to cameras to multiple game consoles and I have never seen a case where the product fits so tightly. I was able to hold the case upside down and gently shook it and the console did not fall out. (Don't try this!) I had to wonder if this was intended for a PSP 3000.While the console does fit, the shoulder buttons will be pushed into the console. I was able to squeeze a few UMDs into the other compartment and close it. This case can hold up to four UMDs along with the system.The case is a hard rubber but you can still squeeze it. I'd compare it to somewhere between a travel case for your razors and toothbrushes and those generic rubber camera cases you can find at WalMart. If you put your PSP into this case and then put the case into a messenger bag then your system will be well protected.I paid $6.29 for this case and I'd say that it does its job but I am not comfortable storing my PSP with the shoulder buttons squeezed in. I want to give this product four stars but I would advise my friends to get a case that is a little roomier. As it is, I'll give three stars.

Equal parts amorphous blob of paint, struggling artist, revolutionary and juvenile delinquent, de Blob's goal is to replace the drab, lifeless gray coloring that the I.N.K.T. Corporation has imposed on Chroma City and its inhabitants, the Raydians, with a range of vibrant life-giving colors, all the while avoiding and battling the gray-clad forces of the Inkies.Players must acquire paint and hurl de Blob at the buildings, walls, statues, roads and skies above Chroma City. As de Blob bounces around, adding color wherever he lands, his supply of paint is depleted and he begins to dry out. As this happens players must collect more paint and rehydrate in pools and in front of hydrants scattered across the city. As the game starts access is limited to the colors red, blue and yellow, but these can be blended to create a number of other colors. Being able to create and apply these colors becomes important as Chroma City and its inhabitants come to life, and de Blob makes contact with a range of other characters known as the 'Color Revolutionaries' and receives an increasing amount of missions that charge him with splattering color all over town. Success at these mission gains the player point which drives the game forward, eventually leading to a direct assault on Comrade Black's I.N.K.T. fortress guarded by elite Inky soldiers and massive ink turrets.Key Game Features:de Blob- Flip, bounce and paint your way past the all-powerful I.N.K.T.

And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive.

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"PS2 addict","summary":"crappy game!","reviewText":"it's not really action rpg...this is more of a platform game which is why i hate it! you have to do alot of stupid jumps that are not easy to do because the platforms are ridiculously far apart. don't buy this game! frustrating, not fun at all! worst game ever!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000FRS9II","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"A war to die for.","reviewText":"The Xbox 360 killer app. Cliff Bleszinski's pride and joy. The Halo-killer. Whatever it is that you want to label Gears Of War, rest assured it's accurate as long as it's the most positive thing that's come off of your tongue in recent times. If it's not, well, you're just plain mistaken.Gears Of War isn't just finger-lickin' good. It's your-fingers-are-soaked-and-dripping-with-insert-your-favorite-food-here good. The interesting part is that nothing is particularly innovative or creative. Gears Of War is your standard third-person shooter that emphasizes cover mechanics and tactical-but-quick gameplay. It's not the twitchy Unreal or the slow-paced Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter. It's a perfect mix between the two. The game feels like a blast to play and because of that it simply is.Credit the level design and intelligent A.I. for that as well. On Hardcore and Insane difficulty settings, the enemies will simply spank your rear if you sit there and let them. They'll flank. They'll lay down surpressing fire. They'll roll behind obstacles and jump over barriers. They'll do anything they can, including ripping your body to shreds with their chainsaw bayonets, to survive.. Of course, you can return that chainsaw pain, and it's sweet.Story-wise, I think Gears Of War will earn comparisons to Halo. The story is simply a set-up, and without any intentional spoilers, Gears Of War 2 simply has to be in the front of Bleszinski's mind. The story revolves around a war between humans and an alien race known as the Locust, and more specifically Marcus Fenix, an ex-military man rescued from prison. He quickly joins up with Delta Squad, and as part of the squad, his mission is to plant a bomb deep inside the enemy Locust territory and end the war once and for all. Unfortunately, the story isn't much deeper than that. Gears Of War doesn't explain why the Locust are attacking the humans and barely gives any sort of background on Marcus and his squad mates. As I said, Gears Of War 2 is inevitable and hopefully the story is fleshed out with it.The single-player campaign is broken up into five acts, and each act clocks in at about an hour to an hour and a half on the standard difficulty setting. Of course, you'll finish the game quickly, so attention must be focused to the multiplayer. Quite bluntly, Gears Of War has the best online multiplayer I've ever experienced. Ever. It's got cooperative Xbox Live play. It's got three (yeah, only three for now) different game modes to play, and the maps are simply brilliant. Each map is on the small side, but with all of the matches being 3-on-3 or 4-on-4, they're a perfect fit. The maps are also very symmetrical, so getting lost isn't much of a problem and learning the maps is an easy affair. After completing the single-player game in about 7 hours, I clocked in more than 35 hours of online multiplayer in the first week of the game's release. Of course, I enjoyed watching my excessive play's effects on the Leaderboards as I climbed from about 100,000th to 1,000th place on the boards.Visually, there isn't a more beautiful game out there and there never has been. There weren't any shortcuts taken in Gears Of War-the environments are so loaded with detail that it takes a keen eye to spot some of the smaller touches. I could stare in the same spot for two minutes and still find new details to look at. The animation is fluid, with humans and Locust alike diving and rolling between cover points. The gore, with enemies being blown into giblets, is supported by amazing smoke and explosion effects and particle effects that fly off the screen. The sound is explosive, with machine guns and shotguns tearing out of the speakers, Locust growling from behind cover, and squad mates shouting enemy positions at each other. The voice acting is decidedly manly, with the super-raspy and super-stereotypical military voices fitting pretty well. And don't let me forget the soundtrack, which makes the intense battles even more heart-pounding. There isn't a prettier or better-sounding game out there, and Dolby 5.1 users might shake pictures off of the wall while playing this one.Gears Of War's only fault is that it ends. Honestly, the single-player could have continued for twice as long and I would have been more than pleased. However, after being absolutely crack-addicted to the multiplayer, I can't complain. The replay value is simply pouring out of this game, making it one of the most valuable games out there right now and one of the best that Xbox owners have had since Halo 2 came out in 2004. It's easily the best Xbox 360 game and it's quite the contender for Game Of The Year. Pick up Gears Of War as soon as possible, it really is the killer app.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2006"}

Summoned by urgent order, the player in the form of the lowly Prinny rushes to meet his boss, Demon Lord Etna in her chamber. You arrive just in time to see Etna beating your fellow prinnies to a pulp. She is definitely in a bad mood, being even more abusive and violent than usual. As it turns out, someone has snatched her favorite dessert from the fridge. Eager to vent her frustration, she orders you to hunt down the ingredients to create a new Ultra Dessert and promises that if you do not deliver the goods by the next morning that you will learn what eternal suffering really means. Since you are at the very bottom of the netherworld food chain, if not its gutter, you have no choice but to snap into action.GameplayPrinnyis a side-scrolling platformer filled with classic flavored gameplay that requires timing of jumps and memorization of the patterns of enemy movements. As non-threatening as dessert making might seem, nothing could be further from the truth. In the game players are given 10 hours and the use of 999 identical comrades from the Prinny Squad to defeat demon bosses spread throughout the game's levels who possess the necessary ingredients to create a new dessert for Etna. Although this may sound like way more than enough help, surprisingly challenging gameplay that consistently has players one blow from either victory or defeat and the nature of the prinnies themselves will quickly change player's perception on this.True to their origins in theDisgaeauniverse where their literal explosive nature makes them perfect cannon fodder to aim at enemies, prinnies are extremely volatile. Players can only only control one prinny at a time because you only possess one red scarf, which not only indicates your status as current game hero, but also keeps you from blowing up. Wave after wave of enemies within the game also conspire to exploit the prinnies' tendency towards combustion, and more often than not are successful, underlining the importance of your 999 friends. This means that players do not actually play as a single prinny. As one meets his end another takes his place and you are kept informed of how many prinnies you have left, as well as how many hours. Prinnies are not defenseless though. Players have use of a variety of attacks and moves like the 'Dual Sword Slash' to deal with enemies in front of you, the 'Hip Pound' which allows you to stun opponents with your bottom and standard platformer jump and sprint functionality for mobility. In addition, prinnies can lift and throw objects like bombs, stomp enemies and even pilot tanks and planes to bombard whatever gets in your way. The game comes with two modes: Standard Mode, which allows you to take damage up to 3 times before losing a life and Hell Mode where one blow means instant death. In this ridiculously comic adventure you will need every advantage if you hope to survive the cost of the ultimate sweet treat.Key Game Features:1,000 Units- Players will get 1000 lives to beat the toughest action of this platforming side-scroller.Lift &amp; Throw- Prinnies are able to lift and throw objects on the battlefield.Vehicles- Steal and control powerful vehicles, like tanks and UFOs.Hip Pound: Jump and pound enemies to stun them. Then you can inflict multiple combo attacks for extra damage.3D World with 2D Characters: InPrinny, character art is created using fluid 2D sprites, giving it a classic look with a comical tone. Battlefields and backgrounds, however, are created with 3D models. This allows for a smooth and unique combat action where certain attacks are rendered in a 3-dimensional view.Boss Battles Galore- 10 Major stages featuring many hidden characters and a boss waiting at the end of each.Music Collection Mode- Find music tracks during game and replay them as background music.Humor- Ridiculously comedic storyline and characters.","reviewerName":"Alessandro Viani","summary":"Too Frustrating","reviewText":"This game is too frustrating!

Hayes","summary":"One of the best RPG experiences on the PS3","reviewText":"Star Ocean's story explores the world and the prompting that they needed to explore the Star Ocean to support the future life of planet Earth.  Following the inaugural launch of ships capable of warp travel, the main character and associated ships set out to find hospitable planets for the people of Earth.  What starts out as an easy task soon involves a mystery that holds the uniting of numerous species, takes place across numerous planets and dimensions, and one that promises to be an emotional ride that has the entire universe at stake.The story seems to last at no less than 40 hours (for me it took 83 hours) and spans about five or so planets.  Each one is more diverse and filled with quite a bit of space for exploration purposes and dungeon variety.  Yes, in this RPG you can actually explore the land and traverse it to get to the dungeons and such.  There are numerous enemy types, weapons, chests to find, items/material to harvest.  Players even have the ability to synthesis items, and return to each planet to complete numerous quests in each town and in locations too.  The amount of things that can be done is actually quite exhaustive and can not be listed.  The game is perhaps one of the best epitomes of replay value.  There is even a coliseum with ranks to face numerous monsters, as well as post game content.Gameplay wise enemies are visible on the overworld map and skills can be used inside and out of battle. Battles take place using an active system in which you use the trigger buttons to do specials and x to attack and such.  Theres a nice battle simulator that goes over all the details of battle such as blindsiding to land critical attacks, counters, and etc, so the battle system is pretty enthralling and flashy.  Unfortunately one can not control all their party members but one can freely switch to them in battle.In terms of the presentation, the games looks gorgeous in battle in and out of battle.  The planets look to be filled with lush life if appropriate, the scale of the way distances and objects looks makes you feel as if the world is big, and the detail given to places in dungeon and such is pretty remarkable. I thought it was pretty awesome indeed. This version allows for the switching of characters models from 3D models to 2D Portraits for onscreen dialog displays, which are quite nice, as well as six text language options (two voiced, English and Japanese).  The cutscenes are voice-mouth matched only to the Japananese track. The soundtrack has some excellent themes such as the battle one, the intro one, one used for whenever the ship is to take off, as well as the credits.The game meets all expectations that people may have for their role playing games in this day and age.  The game only flaws in the sometimes large number of enemies in many dungeons, the distance to some save points in dungeons is rather far, and there are some pretty difficult to get trophies, otherwise its an excellent and fantastic game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2010"}

Really, really nice actually. The graphics on the single player mode are fantastic, especially on an HDTV.SOUND:Top notch. Can't say anymore than that other than Ubisoft is usually on the money in this department.GAMEPLAY:The online multiplayer is a drastic change from Pandora Tomorrow and Chaos Theory but still worth a look. One worthy upgrade is three men to a team as opposed to two per team. The mercs and spies feel a bit more even than they did in the previous two titles in the series. There are also new modes like \"spy vs. spy\" that are pretty fun as well but it seemed to me that it all got kind of old pretty fast in regards to online play. One thing I have to mention is that this game has probably one of the smartest, if not the smartest, enemy AI setups in any game I've played to date. This can be both exciting and pretty frustrating.The single player campaign however is easily the best of all four games, including the original. I would go as far as to say that this is the first game I've ever played where I actually felt like I was undercover. Placed in the middle of a domestic terrorist cell, the game gets really suspenseful really quickly. You will be forced to make tough decisions with only a matter of seconds to mull them over, in order to prove your loyalty to the band you've infiltrated. Trust me when I say, the single player game is a worthwhile experience. It's actually the reason I bothered to write this review in the first place.WORTH PURCHASING?I'd say yes but with caution because this game isn't really for everyone. The controls can get a bit cumbersome when you're trying to do things in a hurry and the game requires a level of patience like few other games out there. This game is all about hiding in the shadows for a couple of minutes before you make your move and if run and gun is what you're looking for, I'd say look elsewhere. The single player is worth the money alone and adds a good amount of replay value for your buck. If you liked the Sam Fisher adventures of before, try it as you may be surprised.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2007"}

{"product_name":"B000CQIDTC","reviewerName":"Matthieu P. Raillard","summary":"Terrific game, terrific value","reviewText":"I can't understand all of the criticism regarding the game's length vs. price, and its originality.  Yes, HL: Episode One is a short game (4-7 hours, depending on how you play, whether you cheat, etc), but it costs less than half the price of a new game (even less than that on Amazon right now).  This is a better game, both technologically and in terms of fun, than most full-priced games that are coming out.  Why this obsession with game length?  I'd rather have a terrific 6 hour game than a dull and tedious 15 hour game!The GOOD: Graphics are even better than in HL2, they now use HDR lighting effects which look pretty cool.  The gameplay is also more refined, with more creative logic puzzles, and better enemy AI.  Your sidekick, Alyx, is one of the few computer companions that you actually care about, and she's smart and resilient (ie: doesn't walk into pillars all the time).  The story is great fun, too.The BAD: A couple of the puzzles can get annoying, such as the Antlion sections of level 3.  The use of darkness and flashlight is atmospheric at first, but makes it feel like Doom 3 at times, and I don't mean that in a good way.  And yes, it'd be great if the game were longer, but that's more a testament to the quality of the experience than a shortcoming!The UGLY: Those Zombines... ugh.Bottome Line:  If you like HL2, this is a no-brainer.  If you like a thinking man's shooter, this is for you as well.  Recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2006"}
{"product_name":"B0087OZ5FG","description":"","reviewerName":"Dat Hong","summary":"Amazing sound","reviewText":"This is a truly awesome headset made by Sony.  The sound that comes out of this thing is AMAZING.  The bass effect has a slight vibration and the surround sound makes it feel like the action is all around you.  I really enjoyed using these because the built in mic and noise cancellation worked flawlessly.  The person on the other side says everything is crystal clear and since the sound is being directed into my ears, they can't even hear the background.  Once you put these on and turn up the volume, you won't hear nothing but what is coming out of the headset.It's comfortable and designed well, but a bit difficult to adjust settings while playing.  All the controls are on the headset itself.  They are all a bit recessed so you wouldn't notice it.  You can press the mode button and it will give you preset settings such as \"music\", \"game\" or \"movie\". When you press the button, a voice says what mode it is currently set to.The USB Dongle needs to be inserted at all times in order for it to work with the PS3.  There is nothing to set up.  You just plug in the dongle and turn on the headset and it automatically connects.  The on screen guide shows you how much battery is left in the headset.Quick FAQs.1.  There is no bluetooth.  If you want to use this with your phone/media device, it works via the 3.5mm jack.  I plugged the 3.5mm cable into the Samsung Galaxy S2 and I can use the headset to listen to audio, as well as use it for conversation.  The conversation came out clear and there was no distortion.2.  You can plug the audio from your TV into the USB stick via the 3.5mm jack and it will switch the audio coming out from your TV to the headset.  However, the USB stick must be plugged into a powered USB slot to work.3.  It does not come with a supplied power source.  The same USB cord you are using to charge your PS3 controller will be the same needed to charge the headset.  It takes about 3.5 hours to fully charge from a near depleted state.4.  Once the headset is connected to the PS3, no audio will come from your TV. Not sure if you can change the setting, but not sure why you would.5.  The power on the headset does not need to be turned on when using through the jack.  I can listen to music on my Galaxy S2 with the headset power off.6.  You can answer calls when it is connected to the headset and use the mic even when the headset is turned off.7.  Only one headset can be plugged into the PS3 at all times.8.  The USB dongle has to be connected.  I tried connecting the USB cord to the PS3 and into the headset.  I could NOT get audio.8.  Yes, you should buy one.

The graphics, the music, and the sound are unbelievable.  I've only played the first level in the Single Player game so far, but from what I've seen and heard so far I was impressed.  When I was playing this game, I thought I was in a Stars War movie.  It was so much fun getting into blaster gun battles with my blaster rifle against the evil Galactic Empire Stormtroopers.  The Stormtroopers don't just come at you when they're fighting you.  They actually team up against you and when the Stormtroopers can see they are losing a battle with you, the ones that are left still alive will actually run away from you and hide somewhere to try to ambush you.

There's just so much I love about it, but let's start off with the story.  In this game, Jak and Daxter wander off to Misty Island, where Daxter falls into a pit of a dangerous substance called Dark Eco and gets turned into an ottsel (a weasel/otter).  They go to Samos the Sage for help, who tells them that another sage, Gol, is the only person who might be able to help.  But, he lives far away, so Jak and Daxter journey north to find him.  Along the way, they find out about an evil plot involving Lurkers, Dark Eco, and old Precursor technology...This game is a lot of fun.  I've played it so many times, but I still can't get enough of it.  It's challenging, but not too hard.  And though it's not super long, there is a lot to do.  The game consists of exploring different areas, such as a jungle, a cave, or an underwater Precursor city and collecting Precursor Orbs and Power Cells.  Power Cells are used to progress in the game.Much of the gameplay consists of exploring and platforming, but there are other things to make things more interesting.  For one thing, Jak can use different kinds of Eco.  Blue Eco makes him move fast and allows him to activate Precursor technology.  Yellow lets him shoots yellow balls to destroy stuff, and Red makes him extra strong.  There are also a couple places Jak can ride the A-GraV Zoomer (it's kind of like a floating motorcycle with a big propeller and no wheels), which I always found fun (and the rumble in the controller makes it feel more real).The gameplay in this game is great, but a lot of games have fun gameplay.  It's a lot of extra stuff that makes this game so wonderful.  The plot's somewhat interesting, though I'll say no more so I don't spoil anything.  The levels look very nice and much of the character design is pretty good.  And the characters and the voice acting are great.  This game has some really fun characters and some very entertaining cut scenes.  I remember the first time I ever played this game, I was surprised at how fun even the minor characters were.  This game can just be hilarious at times (and anyone familiar with the series knows how fun Daxter can be, though he can also be a bit annoying at times).I like the animation, as well.  The characters just seem to move in a more realistic way than I've seen in other games.  The way Jak moves is so fluid and natural, and the way he even keeps walking in place a short time after he stops running makes him seem more real.  I love extra details like that.  This game also has no loading.  It is one, huge world, and you can look into the distance and see places far away that you've been to earlier.  I love looking at the view as time changes from day to night and back again.  There are also, in a way, never walls or anything.  In essence, you can swim out into the ocean and never run into an invisible wall like in other games (well, because a Lurker shark will eat you before then).  All this combines to make a world that feels very real.  I've always felt so at home in it.  The music is also nice.  It can get forgotten a bit easier than the music of other games, but it also never gets in the way at all.  It complements the areas well without ever being distracting.My main complaint with the game is the health.  Jak only has three units of health, and to restore a unit, he needs 50 little balls of Green Eco or one big one, so it can take a long time to restore his health.  Also, as I mentioned earlier, it is short.  While there are 101 Power Cells and 2000 Precursor Orbs, it can still be beaten 100% in about seven or eight hours.I would highly recommend this game.  It's really wonderful.  It's a lot of fun while having some of the best cut scenes and characters (including the minor ones) I've ever seen.  It has a better story than many platformers, and maybe it's just me, but I feel this game manages to be both silly and beautiful at the same time, with funny characters, but at the same time, lovely locations and music, not to mention the mystery of the Precursors who left their technology and artifacts lying around.  I can't even fully describe how great this game is, but it is always a huge treat to play again.  So why not give it a try.  It could very well become one of your favorite games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2012"}

Xbox 360 was designed with online gaming in mind, and as such Xbox has the most robust online gaming features of any console.  Hooking up with friends is easy, creating and joining parties and games is a breeze, and since every Xbox comes packaged with a headset, you know you'll be able to communicate with other players, which is a big deal for online games.Gold members get access to demos early, features such as Facebook, Twitter, Last.fm, Netflix, and more, plus access to the best online gaming service around.  I have both an Xbox and a PS3, and the online service and features on Xbox are far superior to PS3.  The speed and connection on Xbox is better, with far less lag and dropped games than PS3.Now, Xbox Live can get expensive, so the best value for your money is the prepaid 12 month card.  For starters, a 12 month card costs less per month than the 1 or 3 month cards.  Second, if you buy a card you don't run the risk of being overcharged with recurring payments.  If you pay for Xbox Live through your Xbox by credit card, they will automatically renew your subscription when it expires without telling you, and continue to charge you until you call them.  And they make it difficult to cancel.  The prepaid card eliminates this headache and is much safer.  Third, if you shop around, you can get the $50 card for much cheaper.  I got the 12 month gold card for $30 from Amazon, which comes to $2.50 per month, plus no tax and no shipping cost.If you want the best online experience you want Xbox Live, and if you want Xbox Live you want the prepaid card, and if you want the prepaid card, you want it from Amazon.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2010"}

Anyone who has not played the first game won't understand much of the dialogue in this second game.Cole has a new voice, so that at first is hard to get use to. But with other characters sounding just the same, like Zeke, it's easier to get use to the new Cole.Just like in the first game, your choices make you either good or evil. This time, not only do you chose the good or evil missions, but you get a new partner/side-kick for these missions as well. Depending on the path your chose determines which new partner you get.The enemies are harder, but the fighting and missions are definitely more diverse this time. In the first game, many of the missions that you did to take over areas of the city started becoming repetitive. inFamous 2 has done a better job of making each mission more unique.The game graphics are outstanding. Your electric powers seem to explode from you. The colors are more vivid and the city is amazing. Each building seems completely different than the others. In the first city, most all the buildings were similar in shape and height. In this sequel, every single building is different height, color, shape, age, etc. There are architectural landmarks, sky scrapers, political buildings, etc. Much more like a real city this time.The gameplay is almost identical. The same ideas of taking over areas of the city, becoming more powerful by unlocking moves, and working towards a final enemy are all here. While the gameplay is the same, it's doesn't at all feel like your playing the same game as the first one. It's just similar enough to make it easy to pick it up and jump right in, without a learning curve.In addition to the regular missions, there are also user created missions all over the city to play. They vary from easy to difficult and you can rate them and leave comments. You can also create your own missions for others to play.While inFamous 1 was great, they managed to make inFamous 2 even better. They have improved so many aspects to the game, it has brought it to a whole new level. And as always, because you can chose the path of good or evil, once you've completed the game one way, it's time to start over and complete it the other.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2011"}

Now Tell Tale games have unleashed their latest game called Lego Marvel Super Heroes but is this a game you will want to play?The game centers on the villains that have banded together to free their brethren from secured facilities. From Rykers Island to the Raft six groups have been formed and each of them are in charge of all the lackeys underneath them. The six teams are led by such iconic villains such as Ultron & Loki , Dr. Doom, Tinkerer, Dormammu & Baron Mordo, Magneto & Mystique and Enchantress, Executioner, and the Mandarian. They have banded together to build a Doom Ray of Doom to unleash against the world. Nick Fury decides that he is going to need some help on this one as he summons the worlds greatest heroes to help him capture these bad guys.And the roster of heroes that you will be able to play as is just as immense. Thor, Wolverine, Spiderman and Deadpool are just a sampling of the great characters you can play as. Each of the missions allows you to choose between two heroes and go against hordes of a common enemy. For example the first mission that takes place in New York has two heroes (Spiderman and Nova) going after the Sinister Six. And the bosses of course reflect this as you will be going up against Doctor Octopus , Electro and others.One of the unique features of this game are the comic missions that you can undergo. Some of the more iconic missions are going after your uncles killer as Spiderman. Or you can head over to Japan as Wolverine to battle the Silver Samurai.

Using a core team of engineers, medics, and soldiers, players must manage and control their level of trust in, and fear of, you.

The game itself is pretty fun to pick up and play for the first couple of hours, but the repetitiveness of crashing into people, other cars and just the city environment gets tiring. It doesn't help that, despite having an easy set of driving controls, Wreckless lives up to its name in terms of controlling the car.Maybe it was done purposely, but a racer which causes a player to spin-out, fishtail and crash at the slightest bump or pebble on the course doesn't make for a high-speed gaming. It seems that there's a great game just waiting to come out of Wreckless but instead it remains locked behind a repetitious gameplay, balky driving mechanics and boring missions objectives. Wreckless does make for great eye-candy as the developers made great use of the Xbox's graphical power. The sound effects are above-average and works great with a home theater surround sound system.

{"product_name":"B003O6E67A","description":"","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"Resistance is Back and Better than Ever","reviewText":"I'm the author of the featured critical review of Resistance 2 here on Amazon and after finishing Resistance 3 I can gratefully say that Insomniac has restored my faith in the Resistance series with their latest offering!Resistance 3 lands almost three full years after Resistance 2. The extra year in development, according to press reporting, was to be used to polish and refine Resistance 3 to levels unseen before in the series. I'm happy to say that Insomniac's extra efforts mark a dramatic increase in just about every facet of the game.The story of Resistance 3 picks up where R2 left off. Nathan Hale is dead at the hands of Joe Capelli one of his squad-mates once the Chimera virus began overtaking and changing Hale. Capelli finds himself making a meager living in Oklahoma with wife, child a few fellow survivors. The Chimera at this point has completely overrun the United States and most major cities have fallen. New York seems to be the epicenter of the Chimera's terraforming activity though no human survivors of New York are known. Humanity is on the brink of extinction as Earth's weather continues to cool to fit the Chimeran plan for settlement.The graphics in R3 have taken a dramatic turn for the better. In my review of Resistance 2 I was critical of the frequent graphic flaws and poor attention to detail. In R3 it's clear that Insomniac took more time and care in crafting the game world. The initial scenes in R3 start with a gritty grain reminiscent of films like The Road. The intent is to portray humanities desperation as the Chimera continue to erase the remaining pockets of humans from the map. As you progress through the game you'll be treated to several different areas of the United States from the humble towns and villages of the Midwest to the Industrial wastes of St. Louis and then to the frozen remains of New York. Each area has its own distinct feeling and style to separate it from the rest. In New York for example you'll find yourself running from ruined building to building advancing against a horde of Chimeran snipers and assortment of enemies.My complaints about Resistance 2 included a lack of many of the gameplay features that made the original Resistance: Fall of Mankind so endearing too many of us. Insomniac has gone back and tweaked R3 to more closely resemble the original title. Vehicle segments are back in limited scope; this time you won't get to pilot any human or Chimeran craft but you'll at least get to ride shotgun and engage enemies as the gunner. There are various vehicle segments including a dramatic train sequence that will have you running from car to car and desperately fighting off a series of enemies. Another change comes to the health system. R2 incorporated a Call of Duty-esque regenerating health system. You could get shot up to pieces then hide and your health would regenerate. In R3 the health bar is back and there is no regenerating health system. This adds a sense of urgency and suspense when you're barely hanging on to life in an intense firefight sprinting for the green canister that is a health pack. Also back in R3 is the weapon wheel. Just like in the original Resistance, you'll be allowed to carry all your weapons concurrently and select them via the weapon wheel!Speaking of weapons many of our old favorites from previous Resistance games are back including the Bullseye, Auger, Deadeye, Rossmore, Hedgehog grenade and more. New additions include the Cryogun, Mutator, and Atomizer. Each weapon is unique and useful in situations you'll be faced with throughout your play through R3. Each weapon in R3 also features a 3-tier leveling system; you gain levels by killing enemies. These levels serve to strengthen your weapons and unlock upgrades such as incendiary shotgun rounds for the Rossmore or an upgrade to the Deadeye that marks the enemy's heads for easier headshots. It's a fantastic addition to the series that adds much to the gameplay. Each weapon also features awesome alt-fires that are alternative uses that you'll find very helpful. The Auger for example has an alt-fire that creates a shield in front of you. The Atomizer generates a mini black hole that sucks enemies into groups that can be easily dispatched and so on.At this point I have not yet tackled much of the online gameplay. My understanding is that the online multiplayer in R2 is a bit more contained and smaller than the massive, chaotic battles of R2. R3 also features an online cooperative feature. More on this in a future update to my review.Much has been made of the online pass that Sony implemented with R3 and it's worth mentioning here. The online pass is a code that comes with new copies of R3 that have to be redeemed via the Account Management section of the XMB in order to access the online portion of R3. If you purchase R3 brand-new you have nothing to worry about, it's business as usual. However, folks who purchase R3 used will need to purchase a new code via the PSN Store for $9.99. There can be many accounts that can be used on one PS3 console. Two players (or more) with different accounts can play using the same online games on the PS3 system. Further you can activate the code on up to 5 different PS3 systems.Lastly, though my review has been overwhelmingly positive thus far there are some minor stutters in R3 that should be mentioned. First, there are some technical issues; one for example in New York pitted me against a boss creature that unbeknownst to me couldn't be killed. This of course was a glitch but I still spent 45 frustrating minutes fighting the creature over and over again. A restart of the game fixed the problem. Second, the story is generally very good and does a great job conveying humanities last throes but there are moments that can only be described as \"cheesy\". Whenever Capelli is interacting with his wife and child it's almost painful to watch and worse on the ears. I get what Insomniac was trying to do but for the most part Capelli's family could've been done much better.In closing, what are you still doing reading this review? Go buy this game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2011"}

Now, when 2011 rears its ugly head, I'm going to have to think all the way back to Jan 26 when I contemplate the games that defined 2010. Thank you, Mass Effect 2.As I sat down to type this review the first time, I found myself trying to go down a bullet list of pros and cons of ME2.  I found myself able to list out a disturbing number of cons that I could easily put into words. The pros, however, weren't so easily wrangled. As we've mentioned numerous times on the podcast, BioWare games have a knack for making you think about the whole, rather than discrete parts.I've never played a game that is so clearly disjointed. Shooting, dialogue, cut scenes - each segment is completely isolated from the rest. You're never caught off-guard by the action, unlike in Uncharted 2, where you sometimes don't realize when the cut-scene is done and it's your turn to play. In ME2, the game jerks from dialogue  to third-person action.  The game is very clear here: now is the time to start killing things. The talkie bits are done.I stress this disjointed construction because it makes the ultimate impression the game leaves on you all that more impressive.  As I think about the game days after completion, daydreaming while doing other things, I find all the segments of the game meld together.  I'm left thinking about the experience that was the game.And that sums up the most compelling thing about ME2: it is an experience.The experience was compelling enough to zombify my girlfriend, someone who usually detests merely watching me play a game, and glue her to the couch next to me for the entire 25-hour adventure.  No, she was not mistaking the game for a movie; she was caught in the same strange gravity well as me. If I neglected to visit a crew member in between missions, both my in-game personal assistant and my girlfriend were eager to hear the next dialogue.It's important to point out that the game designers felt that you might want a reminder in the CIC, the bridge and information hub of ME2, of all the characters that want to talk to you. This is a feature that would have been useful in the original Mass Effect, in which I wasn't sure when I was supposed to talk to crew members, but it is unnecessary in the sequel due to the well-defined structure of the game.That well defined structure is actually a point of contention; some people find it the worst part about the sequel, and others find it the strength of the game. I'm in the middle of these two camps. On one hand, I wish that the game afforded you more leeway with handling the relationships you develop with your crew. On the other hand, I understand that framing conversations in an interesting way means that the game designers could be more creative with direction during the dialogue.It's very clear that the design focus of the game was altered from the first. An in-game satire of a game store makes BioWare's direction very clear: \"big decisions and visceral combat.\" Everything that gets in the way of these two things was on the chopping block for ME2.  Cumbersome inventory?  Gone.  Plodding Mako missions?  Gone.  Complex character statistics?  Simplified.  Poorly implemented cover mechanic?  Overhauled.As a result, if anything besides dialogue scenes and decision making was your favorite part of the original Mass Effect, you will not like the direction of the sequel. This isn't to say that you'll dislike the game as a whole, but I just don't think you'll be as excited about the game as others. I was a big fan of the dialogue and story of the first game, and as a result, I couldn't be more satisfied with the result of BioWare's pruning.The variation between each player's story becomes the most compelling discussion topic among those who've completed the game.  I sought out message boards, an act of desperation, in order to share my experience with other players.  The fact that I didn't want to expose my fellow podcast-mates to my version of the ending, even in vague terms, is a credit to the power of the game's narrative.  Suffice to say, the game delivers the parameters of its final mission in a way that had me holding my breath every step of the way, actually afraid of the consequences of the actions built up over the course of the game.In the original Mass Effect, the sum total of the decisions you made in the game seemed to matter less. While there were \"big\" decisions to be made, the consequences weren't represented. It was very easy to see the structure of the game - make X decision to see X cutscene; make Y decision the second time, see Y cutscene. There may be an easy explanation for how ME2 determines what your ending will be, but as the gamer, I'm completely mystified. If there is a pattern, I don't see it.And that's the beauty of the refined system in ME2, as I'm left contemplating the possibilities I skipped over.  I genuinely regret some of the decisions I made in the game. Normally, I would consider reloading an old save and fixing my mistake - gaming the system. In any other game, I wouldn't think twice about optimizing, but in ME2, I left those regrettable decisions untouched. I feel like they only add depth to the character I'm creating.It's that ownership over the character who you create that cements this sequel's status as far superior to the original.  Other games allow you to customize the appearance, name and voice of the main character. Mass Effect 2 goes one beyond that - you can shape the identity of the main character, too.It's been more than five years, but we're finally seeing games that are more than just \"next-generation\" in graphics alone.  And this one isn't a small step - it's a giant leap.--Reviewed by Nick Kosareo","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2010"}

And I liked the GTA games. So I REALLY liked Red Dead Redemption.By now the basic premise is something we all know. RDR is essentially a GTA IV style game draped in the cloth of a Clint Eastwood western. Instead of an urban environment you've got the wide open expanse of the American west circa 1911. Instead of city gangsters you have bandits and outlaws. Instead of cars you have horses. Instead of endless city streets you have huge expanses of wilderness.These are all reasons why I love the game, incidentally. Because I love what the GTA games do, but I've never been all that enamored with the setting. This? This is right up my alley.The basic gameplay is very similar to any GTA game, GTA IV especially. You've got a big, three-part map you unlock as the story moves ahead. Story-based missions appear on the map, during which you watch a cutscenes, gallop off to a location, and shoot a load of people. These usually have good variety and mix things up frequently. Between missions you're free to wander the world, engage in mayhem, do side missions, explore, and so on.The setting is a major point of departure from the GTA formula, however. No dense city streets teaming with people and cars to run over and crash into. Instead you get a huge swath of American and Mexican wilderness peppered with towns, outposts and landmarks. Everything from the Great Plains to the Sierra Nevadas to Monument Valley to vast desert landscapes. You'll see herds of buffalo, packs of wolves, wild horses, and loads more. You can hunt game, catch horses, and so on. It's a big place made even bigger by the fact that there are no sports cars to hop into. Though you can fast travel using carriages, trains and a campsite quick travel option, most of the time you'll be motoring along on a horse.While you're doing this, STUFF happens. There are all sorts of crazy people out there, many of them doing crazy things or having crazy things done to them, and you can intervene at will. Lawmen might be chasing down an escaped criminal, a husband might as you to help his kidnapped wife, someone might try to steal your horse, and dozens more. Get involved and you can see your fame increase. These events are random, and they breath life into the world.The meat and potatoes of the game is in the main story, and it's a good one. Reformed outlaw John Marston is being forced by the government to track down his old gang mates. A series of rich characters help you find them, but only after you get involved in their stories and help them out. You'll help a lawman and a swindler, get involved in a Mexican revolution, work with some insane loons, and eventually fight it out in the dying days of the old west. It's a Rockstar game through and through.As with most Rockstar games, the voice acting is impeccable and the cutscenes are well written. There are a LOT of them, and they can be long, but the story is never less than entertaining. And the ending is as bold as it is inevitable - the story COULDN'T have ended any other way, and I love them for doing it.When not doing the story, there are plenty of side missions to do. In addition to a series of 40 challenges involving hunting, sharpshooting and other skills, there are a number of \"strangers\" missions, brief mini-stories prompted when you encounter certain people while out and about in the world. Some are brief and pointless, others interesting, but all add to the richness of the world.This being a Rockstar game, a few of the usual niggles still apply. The save function still requires you to stop in at safehouses to save (though you can now save on the road using a campsite), shooting isn't always easy or accurate (you'll be using the slow motion Dead Eye system a LOT), and the instructions and tutorial stink. If you haven't played a GTA game, there will be a learning curve involved.But it's hard to dwell on these flaws when the game itself is so darn good, in my opinion easily surpassing the acclaimed grand Theft Auto IV. It's Rockstar gameplay through and through, with a great story, a fantastic setting, and loads to do. Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2010"}

Your mission isn't terribly new (infiltrate a terrorist base and blow everything up), but the gameplay is: your numerous enemies are watching for you, and you are encouraged to sneak rather than simply charge in. Every level brings new challenges. You fight snipers, invisible ninjas, psychic warriors, and even an M-1 tank! As the father of the modern spy game genre, this game is an instant classic.Your allies and superiors speak to you via a cool, implanted radio,  monitoring your progress, offering  tips--but failing to give you the full story. The combination of a mysterious and engaging plot and high in-game tension makes this a thrilling ride. Campy humor also abounds as you rescue beautiful women, verbally spar with your allies, and blow up enemies in the bathroom. A user-friendly control interface allows for sniping, hiding, crawling, and running, and the graphics leave nothing to be desired. If you like espionage, spy movies, or just want to own and play a piece of gaming history, then this is a must have.Metal Gear Solidis one of the all-time greats.

It was considered so original, it influenced many, many stealth-type games that followed it. Too many.Where do I start with the things I hate about this game?1. It's way too difficult. You get awfully sick of hearing \"Snaaaaaaaaaaaaaake!\" every 10 seconds. There should have been a way to ratchet down the difficulty even further for 'tards like me. \"Easy\" mode really isn't.  Sheesh.  I wonder what \"Hard\" mode was like.2. Way too many cutscenes! I've never seen anything like it. There's one cut scene that goes on for like 30 minutes. This has got to be the talkiest video game I've ever played.  And these dialogues are all so silly, and you're pretty much forced to watch them or you won't be able to understand what's going on. In fact, I would say that most of your time in this game will be spent watching cutscenes. It's not so much a video game as a movie in which you are occasionally allowed to press buttons.3.  I hate video games that won't let you pause at certain moments, as this won't.  I wouldn't advise playing this if you have a wife or mother who's gonna occasionally ask you to help her in the kitchen:  you'll find yourself saying, \"Yeah, I'll help you after this scene finishes . . . in about half an hour!  Not allowed to pause it for some reason!\"4.  Even more excusably, there's not way to pause the cutscenes.  You can't even pause the codec dialogues!5.  There are many scenes in which the game disables your weapons and accessories for no logical reason other than that if it didn't, the scene would be too easy.6.  There are far too many boss monsters.  It's like every other encounter is a boss monster.  The first part of the game (say, up until the first encounter with Revolver Ocelot) is pretty great, but that's not representative of the game:  after that it's basically an unending series of boss monsters.7.  Frustratingly, you have to fight several boss monsters twice because they never seem to die.  Having to \"kill\" the same boss monster over and over again makes you feel like you're going in circles.8.  The principals having these deep discussions about delicate emotional issues while an enemy is shooting at them or while a timer is ticking down. Was this written by a 14-year-old?9.  The system for flattening oneself against a wall is not ready for prime time:  most of the time you find yourself flattened against the wall and you didn't mean to do this.  This will get you killed several times as you are thus basically standing still, allowing your enemies to shoot you.  It should have been running up to a wall in combination with pressing L1 or something.10.  The way your guy stands there uselessly for about two seconds after choking somebody.11.  The way you can easily bypass critical lifesaving devices, such as the thermal goggles.12.  The way the game takes all these cheap shots at you:  you can't look ahead because your radar is \"jammed\" and then you get shot by a security camera.  Or blown up by a mine.13.  The way you are prevented, after having killed a boss, from going back into the battle area and collecting the stuff you didn't collect during the battle.  Is it there or not?  So why can't I get it now?14.  The absurd anti-nuclear message at the game's finale.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2010"}

This game is one reason to own an XBox.Now here is what pisses me off - the story. Although it is a good story it was not ended properly. Questions were left unanswered. How did Queen Myrahh (leader of the Locusts) and Marcus's father know each other before Emergence Day (the beginning of the war)? Why does the queen look and sound human but her subjects do not? Where is Marcus's mother? Was she the Queen? Why is the queen so infatuated with Marcus? How and why did Anya become such a badass soldier? Where did the Locusts actually come from and why is a human looking woman leading them? If there is a queen there must be a king. Where and who is he? Were the Locusts born or made, or both?

But when I came across one game produced by a company I never heard of called Maxis I was really intrigued. The game put you in control of developing a city and placing various structures to get the city to grow and thrive. Of course I am talking about Sim City and the game frustrated me to no end as I was used to playing games that were very simplistic and this was incredibly deep and confusing to me at the time. Now years later Maxis and EA are at it again with their newest released simply called Sim City. But will you want to take the trip to this city or would you rather just drive on by?The first thing you will notice about this version of Sim City is a huge graphical upgrade. Running on a engine called Glass Box, this game looks far superior to the previous versions and you can see what is going on in the city in real time. You will be able to see water, power, traffic and other conditions below your city and it all looks incredible. But what really stands out is the gameplay as what you do impacts the environment and the citizens of your city. You need to make choices as what city you want to build and whether or not to listen to the populace. But be warned if you fail to listen to the populace then disastrous things can and will happen (ex: if there is no police department then crime will run rampant.)Also added to this version of Sim City is multiplayer as you can play with your friends online and share resources with your friends. There is also a global market as the resources in Sim City are finite and you will run short of some of the basic needs at some point. You can trade with other users to get the items you need and shell out money on this global marketplace. But the most unique part of this is the City Log feature which allows you to compete with friends and as you complete challenges you will unlock various achievements and content unlocks.The one thing I want to stress about Sim City is if you love any type of management games or have been a fan of Sim City from the start you need to get this. Sim City allows you to create the metropolis that you want and caters to your style of play and there are endless combinations that can be made.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}

We have absolutely  no complaints. I love the fact that there actual buttons no more of the sensitive touch pad like the older one. It is also a lot slimmer. I was shocked at one thing though. There are only two usb ports on the unit. Where as my older one has four. Not a big deal. It is super fast on downloading data. It takes a fraction of the time as our older model does.

You play Sam Fisher, and UBER-Operative working for a splinter NSA group called &quot;Third Echelon&quot;. Your goal is simple; infiltrate enemy strong holds (and even friendly ones [CIA HQ]) and gather intellegence to keep the US from going to war with Russia and China. You will accomplish all of this from a third person view of Sam Fisher, with support from &quot;Third Echelon&quot; members.The game has 2 difficulty levels (normal and hard) and I have played through the normal level so far, which was a challenge, but not nearly as difficuly as I expected. Novice players will have an easy time getting to know the game. The controls are laid nicely and camera control with the right analog stick is great. Your first mission is some training at the CIA training facilities. This mission was designed to help players get used to the controls and I really appreaciated it. It's not a long level, nor is just an annoying tutorial. Which is good, because you have to complete training before you can start, no matter what.Each succesive level adds just a little bit more difficulty, but you also become better equiped each time too. After completing the first 2 missions, you'll be stalking and knocking out unsepecting soilders and police like a pro.The enemy AI is bar none, some of the best I have ever encountered in a video game. One wrong move out of the shadows or make too much noise and they start looking for you. You can loose them in the shadows too, but they'll even start firing into random areas were you thought you just escaped to.The graphics range from fair to great. Some areas of the game could have been rendered better, but that's just nit-picking on my part.The sound is also top notch and the ambient back-ground music does a good job of adding to the suspense. The &quot;in-game&quot; music annoyed me a little, but you can adjust that to your taste. The voice acting ranged from good to a little funny at times. Micheal Ironside does a great job voicing Sam Fisher. He's creepy, it was great. There is an interview with him in the games extra features that was interesting. If you don't know who Micheal Ironside is, you'll recognize him when you watch the interview.My biggest complaint would be screen and sound adjustment. If you want to hear everything said in the CGI between mission sequences, then make sure both music and ambient sound settings are on. You do not have any control over in mission screen displays either. There were a few times when I wish I could have dimmed the status displays on the screen.One other problem annoyed me a little, and that was collision detection. I personally hate invisible walls. When dumping an enemy body all the way into a corner, a portion of their body would dissapear into the wall. It was just an annoyance however and didn't make the game any less fun.Slide the disc in, turn on the tube and turn off the lights for some great espionage action.

{"product_name":"B002EE5SAC","reviewerName":"E. David Swan","summary":"Oh the Joy of Fighting as Ken the Eagle","reviewText":"When I was in college Street Fight II gobbled up more quarters than I want to admit given my tight budget and at the time it was the cutting edge of fighting games. Heck, I can even remember seeing the first Street Fighter game in the arcades back when it was relatively new. I played Street Fight II Turbo quite a bit less and as money became even tighter I was satisfied peaking over shoulders as others played the latest Street Fighter games including the Alpha series. Years later when the Dreamcast was winding down I picked up Street Fighter III and Street Fighter Alpha for cheap and discovered something interesting. After only a few days I was quite bored. Somehow the games managed to be both overly complicated (with multiple fighting styles) and overly shallow (button mashing) at the same time. My revelation was that I loved the concept of Street Fighter, including the spectacular art, more than I loved actually playing it. What hooked me into buying Tatsunoko vs Capcom the day it came out can be answered with one word, Gatchaman, or as I knew the series growing up, Battle of the Planets. Here was a match made in Heaven and the game was getting excellent reviews. So is it really a dream come true for all Street Fighter and Anime fans?Let me start by saying that the art is absolutely spectacular from the box cover art to the opening movie to the character art. Udon's artwork may have as much to do with the continuing success of the series as anything else. What didn't impress me as much was the in game graphics which I felt did not look nearly impressive as they did in videos you might see online. Capcom uses 3D rendered background and character models and I just don't find them as appealing as the old 2D rendered characters that I feel gave the designers more of a chance to flex their artistry. The backgrounds in particular are rather bland and lifeless and I was surprised to see them repeated even in a single run through Arcade Mode but it was a hoot fighting in Galactor's base. In the case of the 3D vs 2D it might be just a matter of taste and by and large most of the characters look excellent but when I compare 2D Ryu to 3D there just is no comparison as to which I prefer. I will say that when blown up on 42\" plasma TV the jaggies start showing quite a bit. The music is pleasant but nothing to write home about and the song for the finale is a really odd choice.Like previous Street Fighter games TvsC is a button masher. I figure most people will settle on a few favorite moves and stick with them ad infinitum. The super moves are now a breeze to pull off and even the lesser moves are massively simplfied. Ryu's Hadoken, for instance, no longer requires a sweeping motion on the directional pad. Instead it's just a press of button 2 on the Wiimote. The training stage shows the various button configurations for each character but some seemed rather odd. Ken the Eagle has one move that's shown as a Z like motion on the directional pad but the final arrow isn't even on the pad. I have no idea how the move is supposed to be performed and unfortunately the tutorial doesn't say whether you actually performed the move while practicing. I've played Mortal Kombat games where the training forced you to master each move and I found that much better than the training here.I don't tend to have super high expectations for Street Fighter games. They are what they are, a very shiny package with not a ton of depth. What sets this one apart and encourages continued play is the amount of unlockables. I was a bit surprised that almost all of the characters are unlocked from the get go but there are plenty of other treats. What I can't fault the game for is the roster which is absolutely huge and awesome including three members of Gatchaman. I have to admit that although I was completely ignorant about most of the Tatsunoko characters they were intriguing enough that I was interested in learning more. A search of YouTube will find all sorts of videos and I watched a few subbed Yatterman cartoons that were pretty entertaining. Along with Gatchaman, Yatterman is well represented with three characters making it into TvsC.I don't regret getting the game but it definitely didn't exceed my expectations. The ending boss in particular is a total dud. The game has high quality production values and compared to other Street Fighter games it holds up well. I can't compare it to Street Fighter IV since I've never played the game but it'll entertain if for nothing else than the sheer joy of fighting as Ken the Eagle.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2010"}

The problem with this controller is that (1) there are too many gamers that are used to the PS2 controller, (2) there are plenty of children that play video game consoles, and (3) third party Xbox controllers (such as Mad Catz) and the new S-Controller use the diamond button configuration. The button configurations are different enough that you can get messed up switching between the two.I think more and more people will migrate to the S-Controller or other third party controllers, and that this controller style will slowly fade out.

{"product_name":"B000085AHJ","description":"In the open-ended space action/adventure gameFreelanceryou play a ne'er-do-well with a lucky streak, one of two survivors of a space disaster. Penniless and shipless, you venture around a space dock until you find a ship and a job. You'll encounter a heady mix of canned missions that follow one main quest, and a million opportunities to make money or aggravate the various factions that co-exist in the universe. Like an online role-playing game, or Bethesda'sMorrowind, you determine who your enemies are and who your friends are by your own actions, and, in another nod to role-playing, you can customize your ship with guns, rockets, and equipment just as you would customize a RPG character with swords, bows, and magic items. Best of all, you can play cooperatively with friends or fight it out with enemies online.The backstory posits a future where various countries, divided by both nationality and, seemingly, race, have boarded massive colony ships and ventured into a wormhole that appeared within reach of our crude space technology. They found themselves in a galaxy far, far away and they got stuck there when the wormhole collapsed. They quickly colonized new home worlds and named everything with familiar locales that make navigation a breeze. In the American sectors you'll feel at home entering the New York system and landing at a spaceport called Manhattan, for example. While contrived, this device is used beautifully and it's far better than having to memorize a bunch of sci-fi names and remembering where they are, perfect for a massive universe such as this one.ThoughFreelanceris set in space, it is technically not a space simulation. The game was designed to be accessible to casual gamers. For example,Freelancermakes you use the mouse for ship control. This is quite a shift for a game genre normally known to require joystick control. But even old-schoolWing CommanderorX-Wingfans may find that the sacrifice of verisimilitude is made up for with gains in agility. The mouse controls your guns, while you use the keyboard to maneuver around the rich universe that developer Digital Anvil has constructed. Much like a first-person shooter, you can dodge and weave while precisely blasting your enemies.Despite the game's age, its graphics are spectacular, as is the sound and voice acting, and in that way, fighting and trading with friends or alone,Freelancerproves worth the wait. Just keep in mind that it is explicitly not a hardcore space simulation, and you'll have to leave your joystick on the shelf.--Andrew S.

A literal universe of planets, space stations, debris fields, wormholes, ships, and other encounters wait to be explored.  Docking areas are all fairly interchangeable, typically comprising a bar, store, supply depot, and ship dealer.  You can talk to people for gossip or side-missions, load cargo for trade, upgrade weapons and equipment, and buy new ships.Now, I say 'effort' because hidden beneath all the trappings of a free-range space game is a very restrictive main mission.  Following the main mission of the game is fun and its elements are interesting, but in order to shoehorn you into it, Freelancer made the extremely poor choice of tying it to your pilot's progression.  In other words, if you ignore the main quest and light out on your own, you won't ever get any better.  Sure, you may win a thousand dogfights or earn a million credits from trade, but you won't advance.For example, my current character is a mere 5th level pilot.  In order to progress to 6th level, he has to complete a certain mission tied to the main quest.  This character, however, has already completed over 50 side quests, blown up over 250 enemy warships, and earned about $300,000 in trade and resold looted equipment.  None of that affects his level.  Now without going up another level, he cannot buy a better ship, nor can he buy better weapons.  Ship equipment, like the ships themselves, is tied to one's level..hence he is unable to buy anything that requires level 6 or higher.  So he, despite being wealthy and highly experienced, can not get the many advanced ships and weapons he's already encountered in his explorings.This scheme makes absolutely no sense.  It generates innumerable Catch-22s where one must complete a mission in order to fly back to the base you *just came from* in order to get a better ship, yet completing the mission is nearly impossible with the crappy ship you're currently stuck with.  It also makes side-missions nearly pointless unless you've already gone up a level and just need some money to outfit your new ship, or perhaps want to alter your standing with a particular faction.  I could, using any number of clever tricks, take my weak ship and explore hidden planets, gaze in awe on their awesome vessels and equipment which I can already afford, yet unless I cleave to the main plot I will never be able to get one.Thus while the game theoretically lets you explore however you want, that exploration is almost meaningless if you're stuck up against one of the level-requirement missions that happen pretty much in succession for the entire game.  Even the fight-induced nausea of 10 swirling enemy fighters attacking you (they always all attack you, ignoring even anyone else you may be traveling with) pales in comparison with the knowledge that you'll be back to fight that particular group over and over and over again if you ever want to go up a single level, without the ability to upgrade your ship or equipment until you do.In short while this game can be a lot of fun, don't be fooled into thinking it's even half the open-ended 'freelancer' game it makes out to be.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2004"}

There was only 9 of them, and basically if you complete the game, you will unlock all of them while doing so and get the 1000 pts.

{"product_name":"B00C71034I","description":"Warner Bros. Batman: Arkham Origins 1000381341 Xbox 360 Games","reviewerName":"007 \"cmyth007\"","summary":"Decent game, but flawed! SPOILER FREE","reviewText":"Contrary to popular belief, WB Games has NOT taken over the franchise from Rocksteady. This is a separate franchise that is being started, and Rocksteady is STILL WORKING on a continuation from Arkham City. With that, let's get started...First off, WB Games did NOT mess with the beautiful fighting mechanics that made this franchise so fantastic. Freeflow combat is alive and well, and indeed it has been polished a bit here and there for some added excitement. New moves, new animations and new uses of gadgetry. The WONDERFUL challenge maps have returned, which I played like crazy in the first two games. The one thing that is missing from the \"custom\" challenges, at least from what I've seen so far, is the ability to really customize who is coming at you. Sometimes it would be fun to line up endless low-end goons just so you can practice the freeflow combat without having some guy with a shield bash your skull right in the middle of a combo. This is a minor complain, but it is an added refinement that would be effortless for the developers to add and create a great time for players. The challenge maps can be very--ahem--challenging early on, so you can expect to get your teeth kicked in until you've leveled your hero enough to get some of the upgrades, but that is to be expected from the first two games.Bats can now fast travel using his plane, and the gameworld is almost twice the size of Arkham City, and that is saying a lot. Once you get into New Gotham, you are going to see a GREATLY expanded gameplay element in the vertical arena. There are some REALLY tall buildings here, and it is a blast to navigate from high up in the shadows. So if you loved the first two games as much as I did, you're going to be thrilled with this installment, plain and simple. Another cool addition is the ability to access the challenge maps from the main menu or from inside the single player campaign within the Bat Cave. A nice touch.MULTIPLAYER! I actually hadn't heard there was going to be any multiplayer in this game, so that was a nice surprise when I put the disk in. However, it wasn't quite what I was hoping for. I realize that having a multiplayer on the challenge maps would be quite difficult to implement because of the freeflow combat, but I would really like to see them try to get that off the ground at some point. This is a game that would be a blast to play with a friend, even in the campaign.Another thing that was missing from multiplayer is the implementation of bots. Some of us don't like playing with bratty little thirteen year olds online, and having some bots available would eliminate that. Because of the complexity of the multiplayer, I realize the inclusion of bots would not be easy, but I think it could be done, and done well.Having said that, the multiplayer was actually cooler than I was expecting, and I'll be playing it much more. It's actually three different teams squaring off against each other. You have Batman and Robin on one team, Bane and his crew on another, and the Joker's clan on the third. Midway through the match, Bane and Joker come available, and have to be \"freed\" by their teammates. They each come with their own special abilities which are pretty cool. Even the thugs have some great attacks, gadgets, and the ability to counter some of the heroes most potent attacks.Bats and Robin, meanwhile, lurk in the shadows, pounce from above (or below) to take down their enemies. Other players can take cover, throw grenades etc, and it is all pretty well developed, and it's a surprising addition to a fantastic franchise. If they'd implemented bots or allowed multiplayer in challenge mode, I'd have given this five stars with ease. You will not regret picking up this title.****UPDATE****I had originally given this game four stars, but after playing it all the way through, I had to knock of a star. There were some problems with the game that became more apparent as I played it.First of all, the branching upgrade system is completely lame. They force you to purchase upgrades to your armor, for example, before you can unlock the ability to reduce your hit counter from 8 hits to 5 hits for special moves. That is a terrible idea. So by the time you get to it, you have like four upgrades to your armor. I'd like to be able to chose which upgrades I get--and when. What is the most insulting is that in the past games we WERE able to do this, but they have taken it away. Not okay.The most disappointing part was the fighting. All to often, I would push my attack button and Bats would jump over to the next guy, swing--and miss. Yes, he would just miss. Other times I would push toward an opponent in the midst of a huge combo, and he would just stand there, ruining my combo. I also had a number of failures while doing reversals, which is beyond frustrating.The last thing that I noticed, which was a problem, was the special attacks when you get your 8 (or 5) hits. In the past two games, when you pushed toward a group of enemies and went for the special attack, Batman would flawlessly target the most dangerous enemy, taking down the guy with the knife or some other weapon. I liked that. It attacked who I would have attacked if I'd had the time to make the choice. Granted, when you are moving that fast you don't always have the ability to pick out a single enemy, especially when they are grouped together and halfway across the screen. That feature was a very nice thing. In this game--gone. Batman will routinely pass up what I would consider a far more dangerous opponent and tackle the punk just using his fists.I think the game had the potential to surpass either of the first two games if they had only kept what worked and made the wonderful additions that they have. But they tried to change things that didn't need changing, like the branching upgrade system.

If you're new to Ratchet & Clank, the concept is a simple one:  Ratchet is (he thinks!) the last of his kind.  He is a whiz with gadgets and mechanics, and as we start Going Commando, both have he and Clank have fallen into the role of 'Hero', having gained a bit of celebrity from their previous adventures.  Ratchet's sidekick is a clever little robot named Clank.  Clank not only helps him figure things out, he serves as some of Ratchet's gadgets, transforming into gadgets like a helicopter backpack, and more.  Clank also gets some play-time of his own, too:  there are times when you get to navigate him around a smaller-scale world, often enlisting the help of his fellow robots.  The world of Ratchet & Clank is a sci-fi world where there are plenty of planets to explore and all kinds of interesting life forms, most of whom want to kill you (but a few would settle for a good 3-lap race or two).  Dialogue varies from funny to downright hilarious, and there is enough variety in your objectives to keep things from getting boring.The beauty of the Ratchet & Clank series is that it marries both sides of platform heaven:  Ratchet gives you the jumping-action-shooting, while Clank lets you play strategy-maze-puzzle styled areas.  As a whole the series is quite fun, and each installment seems to come up with more gadgets and fun things to do than the entire run of Warner Brothers' Roadrunner/Coyote cartoons.  While the same concept of collecting bolts to pay for ammo and new weapons is still here, Going Commando also adds a bit of an RPG element:  your guns and gadgets can 'level up':  the more you use them, the better they get.  You also have some smarter tools at your disposal, such as a kind of whirling boomerang that's really good at homing in on multiple bad guys and hitting them once or twice.That said, if you're a fan of Ratchet and Clank and you know your way around, you'll have to be a little forgiving of this title:  it's not as polished as the later entries and it still suffers from some of the basic camera problems that can make a 3D platformer frustrating.  You have more gadgets than the first, but your auto-targeting can still get jumpy sometimes and cause you to miss a lot.  Just remember that the early days of platforming were not a perfect science and you'll still find something to enjoy here.  If you're completely new to the series, this is still a good place to start.  It's fun, it's got entertaining characters and dialogue, and the level-up mechanic adds to Going Commando's fun.  I'd love to see them remake a \"Ratchet Trilogy\" with this title, as has been done for Sly Cooper.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0071NH8B8","description":"","reviewerName":"Gaia Rockweiler","summary":"Sony's Retarded Child Born From Apple Ipod Touch's Mother","reviewText":"It is apparent to me that Sony has taken a lot of notes from Apple's Ipod Touch, and other Apple products in general. This is not always for the best, however. The first negative aspect I encountered was with the navigating the menus. You cannot use any buttons. It is all touch-screen and the PS Button (sound familiar?). Secondly, the features in the video player. You have to tap the screen to make a 4:3 video full-screen, and it only zooms into the video and not stretch it (same with the Ipod Touch). The problem here is that the Ipod Touch has a 3:2 Aspect Ratio and zooming into a 4:3 video would not cut off HALF the video.Why would they remove great features that the PSP and PS3 had, instead of adding onto it? It's simply idiotic. Sony wants to be the new Apple, and by making an Ipod Touch with the addition of a PS3 controller's inputs they think they can succeed. The problem with this is that the console is made out of crappy plastic and is super fragile, unlike Apple's stuff.The analog sticks aren't precise and are terrible with FPS in my experience. Also, while playing Uncharted, I felt like I moving the analog sticks up to go down and down to go up because of how awkward it is to grip the handheld and use the analog sticks. This can be remedied with a grip attachment, though.With the newest update, the PS Button's blue light has been turned on at all times. I think they did this to remedy the fact that people probably couldn't figure out how to get out of sleep-mode and other situations, since all the other buttons don't work out of game.Similarities to the Ipod Touch: 1. Only the power button, volume buttons, and touch-screen work out-of-game. 2. Tapping the power button goes into a lock-screen and holding it pops up the option to shut down or cancel, which you have to choose using the touch-screen. 3. The USB cable is the only charging cable. 4. Video player can only do what the Ipod can do. 5. Menus are laid out the same way. 6. More stuff. I don't even care to list anymore stuff since it might give some readers heart attacks.Edit: Oh yeah and how could I forget the Content Manager. 10x worse than iTunes. Also when cropping larger images to be used as a background or start menu screen, the edges become jagged. You will have to use a program like Photoshop to crop your images beforehand unless you like looking at crap (well you already are, so not like the extra crap will make a difference.)","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2012"}

If you loved the original Deus Ex, stop reading and buy this. It feels, looks and smells like the original. All the dystopic things that made it so memorable with the perfect musical soundtrack.2. If you thought the first Deus Ex was too complicated or boring or you ignored all the side missions and hacking and just played through and didn't think it was fun, SKIP this.Ubisoft obviously loved the original, the attention to detail and love they poured into this version of the Deus Ex universe is palatable. Much like the original, they have created a oppressively controlled and hopeless world with little sprinkles of hope stuck between the cracks. The effect is powerful... is this a world you WANT to fight to save or do you think we are all better off if you just press the reset button on all of it?TIP: Do NOT try and play this game if you are in a rush, you need to sit down when you have time and experience it. Boost your hacking skills early so you can hack all the computers and get all the extra backstory from emails and security documents. There is a wealth of information in there.TIP: Try and hoard your praxis (upgrade) points and upgrade as you get to missions or circumstances where you need a specific power. For example, say you've hoarded 5 praxis points and you are in the middle of a mission where you have 2 routes to choose from; 1 is to drop down and get into a fire fight, or 2 is to add the jump ability and leap onto the roof and sneak by everyone. Don't try and guess at what you will need before you need it. I used this technique and it allowed me to buff my character *exactly* as I needed him so I never had to skip out on a part of a level or mission because I couldn't get to it.TIP: If you enjoy stories and don't love big challenges, play on Easy. I love stories, it is the only reason I play games. On Easy, DX was the perfect balance of challenge and progression. I could sneak when I wanted to, but if I got caught i could fight my way out or run away. If it had been on harder settings, there is a chance I couldn't have gotten away.TIP: The \"punch through weak walls\" powerup is way more useful than you would imagine, especially for completionists.The story in DX is so nicely flushed out and complete that I don't really have anything to say about it, it fits the world perfectly with your character smack in the middle.I think I put 50hours into this game over 1 week just to finish it. It had great pacing and just like the original, lots of ways to accomplish each mission. A lot of times playing the original I was amazed at how I would find some organic and unexpected way to complete a mission and look back and think \"How did they design that such that it felt like *I* was discovering that completely randomly but it was an intended solution for the mission?\"Fortunately that skill has been brought back when making this DX as well.Obviously i liked the game. I spent a ton of time in it, reading every single email, magazine and PDA in existence and enjoyed every minute of it. If you are an impatient gamer type and only like hoping into multiplayer COD games, I think DX is the wrong kind of game for you. It will probably feel like a slow action game to you as you push your way through the main narrative as fast as possible.Sort of like someone telling you that Usual Suspects is a great movie and you normally only like Michael Bay movies, but you pop in Usual Suspects and proceed to watch the whole thing on fast forward and the complain that the ending was stupid.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2011"}

I like to play in front of my kids and they get a kick out of seeing me look like a idiot while I play.  My nieces and nephews are in seventh grade and below so they don't really know much about old rock so when I play in front of them I stick my tongue out and spin and try to play while laying on the floor (which doesn't work well).  I played through the game in about a week and so far have not played it since then but every once in awhile I like to get it out.  No doubt fans of Guitar Hero will eat it up despite what I say so it doesn't matter but its probably better served over Live or with other people.  There aren't that many songs to really pick from and unlocking them isn't really that hard.  By now I think there are newer versions so if you don't pay much for it and you already have the instruments then by all means pick this up.

I only saw the first trailer early of last year. After seeing it I was interested but at the same time was not too excited that I wanted to know more about it. I did this with homecoming(hyped it up,overly excited) and ended up playing a sub par SH game.With this one I just waited and listened what the developers interpretation was of  the series. And surprisingly they actually played the first three games knowing enough to understand that SH series is a character study, with the main character and the town playing the key role. bravo to vatra game for doing researchNow does the game play like a SH game, its tough to say. Obviously its going to play differently then the other ones gameplay wise(new team,different engine). But all the familiar feeling of isolation and subtle detail found in a SH game is there(more or less). So in general yes it a SH game, more then homecoming and shattered memories that's for sure.Murphy is an interesting character, I'd say he's a cross between James and Heather (he's in the middle interesting wise . He has a confidant voice but is easily frightened in a life and death situation. He actually reacts verbally to the horror around which gives his character more logical reaction right after events which is realistic.The characters that inhabit Murphy's world are not bland or boring they will raise eyebrows at first but thats part of the SH charm. The voice acting is pretty good and the other characters are just as interesting as Murphy.Thankfully combat is an afterthought to puzzle and exploration which is a good thing. No one plays SH games to bash on monster's head. Exploration for the most part works well, it is a lot more enjoyable then the previous games especially with hardly any locked doors even so you can break the locks. The puzzle difficulty is back which was a much needed return .As much as I lauded how good the game is its still has a few problems in my opinion.Firstly the game is pretty easy, checkpint anyone? Why put it in a silent hill game. Why not a save point. You'll loose all tension knowing there's a checkpoint before you died at certain parts. Why not penalize players for dying too much at least. homecoming at least had save points.Sudden choppy frames when quicksaving it'll make you worry if the game might freeze.I still think this is the silent hill game that most will enjoy. There is no fan service everything is original and fresh.Akira Yamaoka's music is not on the game but Daniel Licht did a superb job. Licht's stuff almost comes close to AY work. Regardless Mr. Licht shows he can do SH his own way.If your a SH fan looking for that new experience this is definitely it. It has the DNA of the first three original games. But shows it in a seamless way without it being forced. REMEMBER PYRAMID HEAD IN HOMECOMING how forced it was yeah there's none of it here.Be sure to pick up SH HD collection if you want nostalgia in HD.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2012"}

You pick up sidekicks along the way and you can always use 1 with you at all times. Lots of different sidekicks, each with their own story.Story: One of the best stories in a video game ever! Lots of cut scenes and back story and it was well written and brings the game to life. It all comes together so well in the end and is very powerful.Replay: You have a set of responses you can use to every conversation. You can choose to be good or bad but they refer this to the way of the open first, or closed fist so it's not so Jedi clich&eacute; light and dark side and they explain each one to you in the game.Graphics: Excellent for Xbox quality.Sound: I usually don't rate sound but it's very good in the game. I normally don't pay attention to much but it's always setting the mood or events that unfold.If you missed this game for the Xbox, I would highly recommend you pick it up. It will also play on the Xbox 360. This is one that will stay in my collection for a long time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2011"}

They almost look as good as the new PS3 releases. Okay, the only negative is that the cut scenes weren't updated for some reason and look pretty weak when compared with the actual gameplay. Other than that, even if you already own the older versions, this is worth the upgrade. For those who haven't had the pleasure of playing, buy this now.

Worst of all, an ages-old conspiracy bent on world domination has decided that the time is right to emerge from the shadows and take control. No one believes the conspiracy exists--no one but you.In this thrilling role-playing adventure, you play the part of J.C. Denton, a powerful, nanotechnologically augmented antiterrorist agent.

{"product_name":"B002I0KP4G","description":"","reviewerName":"Jack Fox, Badgerlord","summary":"Falling in love with Starcraft 2 all over again","reviewText":"First off I would like to say that While i love Starcraft 2, I was never much one for the eSports competitive side, so I cannot comment on super balance of everything and how the new units figure into it all and what not. I am more interested in the Campaign, and playing with friends against AI. So that is what My impressions are on!I have only played the game for 4 hours so far (finished 5 levels), I woke up at 3am just to play it! And I feel like I have fallen in love with Starcraft II aaaaall over again.The Campaign starts right where wings of liberty finished, if you haven't finished that campaign you owe it to yourself to do so! It's still an amazing campaign and well worth the time to play.The campaigns starts out a tiny bit slow for veterans, but for new players it quickly shows you the ropes of how to build up a zerg army and other necessary tutorial based things. After the first 2 missions you get to really get into building an army of zerg and stampeding over your enemies. And I am loving every second of it.Zerg being my favorite race in Starcraft II does help my love for this game, but even still the game is done so well. The Graphics in and out of actual gameplay are great, the story is amazing, and the voice acting is top notch (All things you expect from the SCII Saga).What's new:They added a few things to make the campaign more... interesting. First of all is the leveling. Kerrigan can gain levels by completely story missions and extra side missions, every 10 levels or so she gains a new (and often extremely overpowered ability). For instance at level 10 you get the ability to either have Overlords build instantly and provide 50% extra control, or, whenever a zerg unit dies it revives at your hive after 10 seconds. You can only chose one, but you can switch them around between every mission.Evolving Units is not something new but it is handled differently. Each unit has 3 different choices, for instance zerglings can be Faster, Have more health, or Attack faster. Again you can switch between them between missions freely, each unit also evolves into a more advanced unit. Zerglings can become a leaping Raptor for example. You get an amazing amount of customization choices in this.The Achievements in missions are done the same in this as was in WoL and I enjoy that. There are 3 achievements for normal mode, and 1 for Hard mode, and some of them are quite difficult but rewarding. One of my favorite things to do in WoL was to try and get the achievements, some of them really made you think or change your strategy completely in order to complete them, and added a great deal of replay value for me.Vs AI Mode has been added, and by that I mean you and your friends will be pitted against AI that is balanced to meet your level of skill. And it's awesome. It will chose the varying levels of difficulty automatically based on how you play so you don't have to think \"Well maybe I can do hard...I don't know\" You can still chose if you want but only in custom game mode. I find the auto choice to be more fun!There are also added tutorials and things for new players, show them the ropes even get into some of the more advanced skills to learn for SCII, and the Challenges are back to teach you the REAL hard things.New Units:At this time I cannot comment much on any of the new units as I mentioned above I don't play Multiplayer so the whole balancing issues and such are lost on me. I can say that the new Zerg units are cool and offer a great deal of versatility, particularly with the Viper's pull skill. But that's sadly all I can really say for now on it. I only watched videos of them in action (and they all look awesome).All in all, I think the game so far has been amazing. I feel that the campaign this time is shorter, but with more re playability than WoL even had, considering the amount of variations in evolution and skills you can go into missions with. I have been reminded how much fun SCII is to play and how well it's made. You aren't just getting a small expansion, like brood war was to SC1, you are getting a whole new game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2013"}

F3 happened to be a game I enjoyed immensely, so naturally I was really taken with New Vegas. The fighting design has improved and well...all the things that made F3 fun have improved. The story is also a little more entertaining than that of its predecessor. Those who were pleased with F3, should find plenty to like here. Plenty and more owing to the fact that the game is actually a bit larger in scope than that of F3.I was fortunate to never experience glitches with F3 and with New Vegas, I have encountered minimal glitching. Like with any large game, it behooves one to save often.The weapons and character creation are amongst some of the best improvements. In addition, the loading screens and times are done a great deal better than that of F3. At the same time, this game feels a hell of a lot like F3. In some places, however, it is a little more challenging. This is a game of discovery, and those who want a straightforward storyline that pushes them to the end need look elsewhere. However, those who enjoy being rewarded with hard work and who enjoyed F3, will not be dissapointed with this installment.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2010"}

{"product_name":"B003O6HDHA","description":"","reviewerName":"MurphysLaw","summary":"Would be better if it didn't have 'Silent Hill' in the title...","reviewText":"I have mixed feelings about this game.  I was a fan of the first few installments of Silent Hill - mostly because the storyline was so messed up and the creatures so deliciously twisted. Now to be fair, let's not forget that the first few games had more than a few issues with the camera and controls and at times those puzzles and wandering all over town with a crappy map got downright tedious but the story line was so strong that you could overlook them because you HAD to find out what was going on.  The fact that this is a Silent Hill game is probably it's biggest downfall.Downpour does have a few things going for it and is probably the best effort in recent years.  The game looks good overall and the development team clearly took their time to focus on the details and for the most part it paid off.  Certain areas of the game were done extremely well. The mine is downright creepy but you will find that as you progress through the game, that while the details are still there, the settings become more and more mundane and for the most part fails to achieve a truly scary atmosphere. The town is drab and boring, which is a shame since you will spend a great deal of time there.  The houses all look the same, the streets all look the same, there are a few stand out areas like the movie theater and the Monastery and one very dark maze-like basement but for the most part, it is all quite forgettable.  The use of rain instead of the trademark fog didn't really bother me but it certainly didn't add anything either. The game mechanics are improved over previous installments and movement is quite fluid and realistic.  In fact, this is probably the biggest success of the game.  The controls are very easy to master but you'll find yourself spamming a good bit. The storyline is okay...not spectacular and nowhere near as intricate as the initial games. It doesn't exactly drag you in but the story and main character are interesting enough to make you want to continue playing to see where it all leads.Now for the bad - the monsters/creatures are PATHETIC.  There are a few that you will see over and over: Minions, Screamers and Juggernauts are the main ones and sadly they are just downright boring.  Later in the game a few more are tossed into the mix but you can figure out how to kill them almost immediately and from that point on they pose very little threat. In fact, you can usually just run past them if you don't feel like dealing with them. The developers seemed to have completely overlooked this aspect of the game and just threw them in as an afterthought. While Downpour is not as combat-intensive as say Homecoming was, you can't just completely ignore or overlook the creatures because they are part of the basic atmosphere. This by far was the biggest letdown of the game because there was just no sense of danger or suspense. The creatures from the old games were so illogical and twisted that you couldn't even wrap your brain around them. I can still remember all those years ago, going into that hospital with those creepy nurses, checking my inventory and realizing that I did not have nearly enough bullets to get through that room. Or wandering around in the fog and your radio starts crackling. Or going in any new area and just not knowing what you would find or what would jump out and try to grab you. It ratcheted up the tension and made the game suspenseful and creepy. You were never prepared and never had adequate ammo. In Downpour, there are no \"gotcha\" moments nor is it survival horror. I played on normal and always had plenty of ammo and oodles of med-kits. There are so many melee weapons lying around that a gun isn't even necessary. Not once did I ever feel overwhelmed or in the least bit of danger. I would hope that on the difficult setting, the med kits and weapons would become more scarce because normal felt more like easy so keep that in mind if you are looking for a challenge. As for the Void or whatever that is supposed to be, it is pointless and frankly just annoying.  You shift to the underworld and think 'Ok, finally here we go!' then you run from this swirly red thing for a short bit and then it's over.  Huh?  Whatever.The puzzles are a big improvement over recent installments of the franchise (I'm looking at you Homecoming) and more in tune with the environment but many are in the form of side quests which you can completely skip if you are so inclined.  If you decide to complete them then you will pick up an item here, wander around town for a bit, pick up an item there, backtrack, put it all together, get a trophy and that is about it.  The puzzles in the main story are treated the same way - a few you have to think about to solve but for the most part they involve fetching and backtracking.  None are overly exciting or difficult.One other thing I wanted to mention is that there are frame rate issues and lag times that plague the game, especially in the later chapters (for the PS3 version at least).  It doesn't make it unplayable by any means but it is noticeable and can be annoying.So, in the end I would say that Silent Hill Downpour is an improvement over recent installments in the franchise.  It has a decent protagonist, a cohesive storyline, and shifts the focus from combat back to puzzle solving without becoming bogged down in it. The combat itself is handled very well. The did a good job creating the setting and atmosphere but sadly missed the mark on what they put in it.  They do seem to be on the right track however it is still not up to par with the originals in terms of overall atmosphere and story and it's not like we aren't going to compare the games - if they had wanted to avoid the comparisons, then leave \"Silent Hill\" out of the title. In fact, had they done that then the game would have received better reviews and been considered a better game because as a stand-alone game, it is actually rather good.  So if you forget about Silent Hill or if you never played the originals and you enjoy these types of games then Downpour is right up your alley.  Especially at a discounted price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2012"}

WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon.

The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number  of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode,  but it's strictly one player. In spite of these flaws, the game remains  addictive and fun.

{"product_name":"B002I0J9M0","description":"","reviewerName":"Spence","summary":"One of the best games I've ever played.","reviewText":"No exaggeration, this is up there with Mass Effect 2, Fallout 3 and Bioshock as one of my favorite gaming experiences of all time.I will say though, that it is pretty much more of the same. The ideas of Portal are expanded upon, both in story, scope, and gameplay dynamics, but at the end of the day they are pretty much the same. So if you didn't dig Portal 1, you probably won't dig this.What's great about this game, and it was great in the first one too, is how it messes with you. Not just your character, but you personally. Unexpected things are constantly happening, most of the time they are hilarious, but there is a lot of interesting ideas and character arcs going on under the surface. GlaDOS gets very fleshed out in this story and you almost start to feel that you understand her and how her mind works. Her twisted, twisted mind.GlaDOS is hilarious, but the other two big additions to the game are Wheatley, a small eyeball-like robot played by Stephen Merchant of Extras and The Ricky Gervais Show, and Cave Johnson played by J.K. Simmons of Spider-Man and Juno fame. Both of these characters are fully fleshed out. Wheatley becomes your guide at the beginning of the game, and his neurotic, cowardly persona keeps the game moving until you eventually bump back into GlaDOS and all hell breaks loose. Cave Johnson is the former CEO of Aperture Science, and you hear his voice recordings when you take a journey into the deepest, oldest part of the laboratory.This section is one of the best and most innovative. A new element called gels is introduced. The gels all do different things to the floor, for instance making it super slippery and fast to move on or causing you to be able to jump really high. That section of the game is probably the most fun.This game is great at easing you into things. Though there are tons of new elements (gels, thermal discouragement beams, light bridges, propulsion tunnels, launchers) they are all revealed slowly and methodically until you understand them, then they start mixing things together. It gets very complicated, but you never feel completely lost. It's just the right amount of challenging.I don't want to talk too much more about the game as to risk spoiling the fun, but if this game appeals to you at all, pick it up. There's tons of replay value, and a fully seperate co-op game that is an absolute blast.Go buy it. You monster.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2011"}

At the time, I wasn't sure what to get so I curiously perused IGN's TOP 25 PS3 games and saw that Ratchet & Clank Future Tools Of Destruction had made the list.  With its tantalizing Pixar-like imagery, I was intrigued and purchased it.And played it to death.  I immediately followed up with Quest for Booty and A Crack In Time.I was hooked.  Then, my 8-year old daughter and I saw an opportunity in Ratchet and Clank All 4 One.  Was it Ratchet and Clank Future?  No, but it allowed the father/daughter team that had previously bested Super Mario Galaxy 1 & 2 to play again and we enjoyed it despite the sneers that some greeted it with.Then I learned that the original Ratchet and Clank trilogy was being re-released on the PS3 in one collection.  My daughter and I traded a look and the pre-purchase was instant; our PS3 slim model won't support PS2 disc-based games so we knew that this was going to be our one and only shot of experiencing how such a remarkable game series that ensnared us both got started to begin with.Of course, I was a little apprehensive.  Some HD updates have worked and others haven't (Silent Hill anyone?  although they DID finally patch it on PS3).  Was a PS2-era game going to wow me?Unequivocally, yes yes YES!  The work is phenomenal.  An IGN reviewer stated that the controls were \"buttery\" (extremely smooth) and OH, they ARE!  You can tell that the games were from a PS2 era, but you can also see how Insomniac must have definitely and quite fully utilized the PS2's potential just as much as the Future trilogy used the PS3.  Gameplay levels are beautifully remastered.  Cutscenes do show their age, but it's not as bad as some of the others that I've seen out there.If you're familiar with a number of the Future controls, you'll almost feel instantly at home from the startup of the original and it won't take long for you to work out the few controls that are different.  The 3D is also quite well-done, although it will drop to 30 fps instead of the 60 fps that you'll experience without it.  That said, it's still pretty smooth and if 3D is your thing, then you don't have anything to fear.  If it's not, you still will be quite pleased with the work done on this title.  This is a remaster that was done RIGHT.My daughter and I are loving it immensely and if you've never played Ratchet and Clank before, you should...now!  Insomniac's beloved duo has made a much welcomed return...and, in our case, a welcome first-time arrival.  Fully recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2012"}

The environment plays a huge role in the game, especially shadows and rainstorms which obscure visibility and rooftops, blind corners and drops which leave one vulnerable to attack by Special Infected.

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-Fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.Xbox LIVE support including LIVE Achievements.","reviewerName":"B.

But I think I've played it enough to make some comments.The first thing I noticed is the BioShock similarity.  By that I mean, you get this fancy hand device which does a number of fantastical things the more you progress.  Just like Plasmids.  You spend a lot of time walking around listening to audio recordings like BioShock.  You collect E99 Tech like dollars in BioShock so you can upgrade your weapons at weapon lockers which remind me a lot of the \"Power to the People\" weapon upgraders in BioShock.  Add to that, the fact that you have intermittent radio communication with a Soviet doctor who seems a little to anxious to help, and this feels like the whole Atlas/Fontane double cross in BioShock.  I haven't figured out if this doctor is actually going to double cross me, but I've found of graffiti that suggests he will, and that too reminds me of graffiti I saw in BioShock.  So.  Yeah.Bottom line, if you like BioShock, you will probably like Singularity.  But be prepared to choke on the similarities.  It even runs the same Unreal Engine that BioShock runs.Also, the control scheme seems more convoluted than Bioshock, and that's definitely not a good thing.It's still a good buy now, since you can get it on the cheap.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2011"}

Still, the amount of familiarity you experience is a little disappointing.  You play in a new city, interact with new characters and a \"new\" story yet I rarely felt that I was doing something that I hadn't done multiple times in the previous games.  To put it bluntly, the gameplay is starting to get stale.Bomb crafting is new to the series and I will be concise.  It can be cool at times, but it feels forced and is overall completely unnecessary to succeed in the game, especially considering the vast amount of options you usually have (hiring factions, ranged weapons, calling in assassins).  Mediterranean defense returns but once I promoted Master Assassins to guard my dens, I never bothered with it again.  \"Missions\" take only a few minutes and you eventually realize you're spending a lot of time sending your assassins out to do things that don't really affect the game.  Den defense never bothered me because I always try to keep my notoriety down (I only had to do one den defense - the mandatory tutorial one).The multiplayer has been greatly improved over Brotherhood, but it still doesn't have that spark that would keep me playing for more than a week or two.  There's still a huge amount of potential here, but AC:R has failed to nail it.  You also run into the problem of 3-4 people spending every game blindly running around, causing half of your time to be spent in chase sequences.  This isn't the game's fault, but it's still annoying.Overall, fans of the series will probably get their money's worth here.

Booker Dewitt, a former Pinkerton agent, is sent on a mission to retrieve Elizabeth, a girl with mysterious powers, from the magical floating city of Columbia.  Dewitt is a bit shady and only takes the deal initially to settle a debt but as he gets to know Elizabeth, they develop a bond.  The story is set in 1912 and the characters and settings are perfectly suited to the time frame.  The story also depicts the struggle of part of Columbia's citizens for equal rights and treatment.  It could honestly play out well as an alternative history novel outside of the game and be worth reading.  You travel from place to place via floating ships or gondolas or take a zip line ride on the sky rail system which is fun all by itself.  I'm not into all the technical game jargon but I can tell you that this is one of if not the best FPS game that I've ever played.

I am pretty obsessed with it; I've played it on all difficulty levels (that's including 1999 Mode and I did an Easy playthrough just for easy fun that was brainless). 1999 Mode is definitely a challenge but it's not impossible by any means, and it really makes you utilize all the tactics the game has to offer. The graphics are very good...I wouldn't say they're better than any I've seen before, but the colors are bright and it's so detailed. The environments have so much to explore and look at...the Voxophones you find help tell the backstory, which makes it very interesting. The combat is fun, of course; it's very like the other Bioshock games with the ability to use Vigors (like Plasmids) and shoot with the other hand. The gameplay is addicting and fast paced but like I said, there are areas to explore. Music is very good too...and although I don't usually listen to oldies on my own time, they fit well in the game. The best part of this game, in my opinion, is the story. The twist at the end definitely has you wanting to play it at least once more to see things you may have missed, or to understand the plot better. I also love Elizabeth, the female lead. She's not useless! Like, I actually wanted to rescue her instead of wanting to blow her head off like Ashley Graham in Resident Evil 4. Elizabeth throws you items in combat, finds you money, doesn't have the risk of dying herself, and I found her personality interesting and very likeable. This is definitely a great game and I don't think it'll get old very soon, even if all you can do is play the campaign, as there is no dlc yet or multiplayer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2013"}

The game was not nearly as big of a success as other titles of the year such as Halo or Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, but it quickly seized hold of an enormous cult following that became very emotionally attached to the game.  The game was so beloved and so much of a success that when Bioshock 2 came out a year later it couldn't have hoped to be as beloved.  After all, the original Bioshock was groundbreaking from a narrative standpoint.  A game that reached so high any game which followed it couldn't hope to come within an arms length of its legacy.  Nevertheless, Bioshock Infinite is here and it reaches.  In some regards, perhaps even higher than the one that started it all.You play as Booker Dewitt.  He's got some debts to settle and believes he can do so.  He must first venture to the floating city of Columbia.  There he must rescue a young woman named Elizabeth.  But it will not be easy.  Columbia is a city ruled under the watchful eye of Father Comstock, a prophet who can supposedly see the future.  It isn't long before Booker realizes that rescuing Elizabeth and escaping the city of Columbia will be much more difficult than he imagined.  Quickly branded as a false prophet, Booker comes under attack.Like the first game, Bioshock Infinite is a very thematically ambitious game.  One that begins to elevate storytelling in gaming.  There will surely be a lot of discussion to follow with this one.  There's a lot of care taken with the world in which it takes place in, as well as with some of the themes it handles.  And Bioshock Infinite opts to hold very little back.  Here you'll be tackling themes such as racism, religion, false prophets, gender roles, even moments that will test your own morals.  It's got a lot to say.  The story and the world also come to life in the same way that Rapture does.  While Columbia is not as dazzling as the trip into the underwater world, it does have a pulse just the same.  You'll find Voxphones scattered throughout.  These, like the original Bioshocks audio diaries, add a lot more to the tale at hand.  They add to the story, the world and the atmosphere.  To ignore them is to miss out on a considerable portion of the game.  For those very curious about the world they're playing in, they will most certainly want to pick these up.From the outset it doesn't seem as though there is much which separates Bioshock Infinite from it's predecessor.  Indeed, it takes a moment to get there.  Many aspects will be familiar to you from the outset.  Instead of Plasmids, for example, you have Vigors.  These allow you to do things such as possess machines and make them attack your enemies, or hurl explosive fireballs at your foes.  If there are crows an area you can even turn them against your foes.  There's a lot variety with the vigors, as well as many different ways to use them.  There is a limit, of course, you need salts to be able to use them.  Like the original there are also vending machines around where you can use currency to buy upgrades for your vigors or guns.  You can also restore health.Unlike the original, however, you don't stock up on health packs that will be used immediately when your life reaches zero.  Rather you have one life gauge that doesn't recharge at all.  You must find food or other means of sustenance to restore your health.  There is, however, a shield you'll get early on that does recharge.  If you can find cover in the midst of a gun fight or keep from taking damage your shield will recharge and you'll be ready again.  This seems like it'll make the game particularly difficult at first, but Bioshock Infinite is not too challenging in and of itself.  Sometimes the enemies can come in large waves.  But should you bite the dust you are never punished too harshly.  You'll respawn really close to where you died and you'll be given some health and some ammo.  Your enemies will also have some of their health restored as well, so whatever killed you is usually still lurking.  The only downside is that there will be times when you respawn and you'll need to take time to adjust to your surroundings.  Though you never respawn far from where you've died, there are times when you'll feel disoriented and turned around when you do.There is also gear you can put on to help you out along the way.  These will enhance your abilities.  And if you mix and match things will change.  One piece of gear, for instance, allows you to run faster when your shield burst.  Another lets you set people on fire when you attack them.  This adds a layer of strategy and gives you a different means of approaching the bad guys.  Get enough variety of gear and you'll be able to create different \"builds\" for your character.  You might think of these builds as various job classes from an RPG.  This all provides many different ways to tackle many of the big firefights in Bioshock Infinite.Chances are you won't die too many times.  Bioshock Infinite's biggest change to gameplay is adding Elizabeth into the equation.  Elizabeth will accompany you throughout much of the experience and as such she is a companion.  This isn't some game where you'll have to babysit, though.  Elizabeth can't die.  Although she will supply you with ammunition and health if you need it.  This little tweak can make the game a bit easier than it has to be, but it won't make death impossible.  She also helps you unlock doors when you come across them, although it is just a tad bit strange that youWhat really helps Elizabeth along is how well realized of a character she is.  How she develops and her facial expressions give her a lot of life.  To say much more than that would be to spoil a lot of the fun of the game.  Booker is not a bad character, by any means, but the story quickly lets you know it isn't about him.  He's a man with a simple mission, but this is much more her story than his.  She is truly a loveable and charming character.  Not that Booker is bad, but he's primarily there to make sure you experience the story more so than to add a lot.  While he makes commentary and quips (that are mostly to provide hints of where to go) every now and then the game makes no illusions about who is the star of the show here.That being said, because of such a huge emphasis on its narrative and story, Bioshock Infinite often has a real clear path for you to go.  It's a very linear game where you'll rarely (if ever) find yourself lost.  That doesn't mean you can't explore.  There is plenty off the beaten path where you can go off track for a moment to find gear, vigors and sometimes even going so far as to find a sidequest or two.  If you ever find yourself exploring too much, a tap of a button will show the way to go in order to get back onto the right path.Most areas are not too big, but they are filled to the brim with a lot of details.  For the most part, Bioshock Infinite doesn't look that much different than the previous two games.  This is fine as they were gorgeous looking.  Here there is a lot of detail to the world.  One of the chief criticisms lodged at Bioshock 2 was that we'd already explored quite a bit of Rapture.  A return there wasn't exciting enough.  Columbia definitely is.  The tone is very similar, but the atmosphere is not.  Instead of going down dark corridors you're exploring a lot of open spaces.  Not everyone you meet is someone who has lost their mind either (and some do not even care to try to kill you).  Especially in the beginning moments of the game, you may come across citizens having idle conversation.  Likewise, where as the original Bioshock was pretty dark in its environment, Infinite is not afraid to let the sunshine in.  Many of its set piece moments stand in contrast to the original.The audio is just as good.  The sound effects are great.  But what is the most rewarding is listening to the voice acting.  All the performances are great.  Comstock, in some cases, can be downright haunting (particularly listening to him on Voxphone).  It helps to make a pretty engaging experience.  If there was anything about the presentation that might be a bit of a nuisance it might be that from time to time the frame rate can get a little choppy.Bioshock Infinite is not for the weak-hearted however.  It's a violent game with some pretty gruesome death moments.  Nothing to cringe worthy for those who have played the original Bioshock or other violent games.  What makes it more startling is that there is a much deeper context to much of it here.  As in, moments in which you'll see innocent people brutally murdered before your eyes or treated very poorly.  Much of this is put forth for thematic or story driven purposes.  It can be brutal, but it isn't here just for the sake of shock or as a means to see how far they can push the envelope.  There are many things thrown into Bioshock Infinite as a means of either reinforcing how horrible the bad guys are, or reinforcing how horrible the society you're in is.  In particular, a lot of it seems to be done as a means of showing the player just how cruel this world really is to those they do not deem to actually be worthy.  The enforcement here is to show the player how wrong this \"utopia\" they've found themselves on is.If there was anything about Bioshock Infinite that immediately sticks out like a sore thumb, it would be some of the \"choices\" and \"decisions.\"  Some moments you're able to make certain choices by pushing one trigger or another.  The problem is that the impact of these choices isn't really clear--if they even manage to change anything at all.  At the beginning of the game, for instance you can choose to throw a baseball at a couple or throw it at the MC on stage.  Regardless of your decision things will play out the same.  It isn't particularly obvious if this has any lasting impact.  It has a bit of an impact later on, but it doesn't really have a major impact on the story.Bioshock Infinite isn't a perfect game, but it is a great one.  A thematically ambitious game with a well told story, Bioshock Infinite is sure to delight fans who fell in love with the original back in 2007.  It is a game that not only delivers well from a gameplay standpoint, but from a narrative one as well.  If you enjoyed exploring the world of Rapture in 2007, then you'll love going through the land of Columbia, here.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2013"}

However, all good things must soon come to an end - and the picturesque resort falls into madness, carnage and chaos after a mysterious and contagious zombie outbreak claims its once peaceful atmosphere. Cut off from the rest of the world, only four individuals who strangely find themselves immune to zombification have the power to protect the remaining survivors from the horrors of the island, to discover what's really going on and find a way to escape before their own fatal ends.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gameplay HighlightsIn keeping with an atmosphere of desperation and survival by any means, Dead Island focuses on serious,first-person actiongameplay with a close-quarter,immersive melee focus.Dead Island'sseamless 4 player co-op multiplayerseeks to provide the most immersive multiplayer experience to date.

Bush \"mechanical engineer\"","summary":"Solid foundation, Needs some refinement","reviewText":"I pre-ordered Dead Island and thus was not able to develop any biases against it before playing.  My first impressions were rather bad, but as I continued to play I soon began to enjoy the game.  In the end, Dead Island has a great number of flaws, but also offers a lot and is a unique game.  What it needs, however, is a reprise with a similar concept but some better polishing on the gameplay mechanics.Dead Island seeks to combine RPG, melee, FPS, driving, and open-world game types into one title.  While this is ambitious and if pulled off properly, rather exciting, Dead Island falls a bit short because of the struggle to mesh all of these game types.  Shooting is clunky, slow, and lacking in detail (for example, when reloading a rifle, the old magazine remains in place while the character merely rubs it with his hand, as though this refills it).  Driving is devoid of any reasonable physics engine (turning radius does not vary with speed...it's just bad) and the provided in-car view is very narrow.  Melee works reasonably well, which is fortunate considering that it is the main focus of the game.  However, hit detection is spotty and attack blocking does not always work.  RPG elements, so I've been told, are not as good as they could be, but since I have never had interest in RPG games, I can't comment too much there.  As I've tried to express, each feature of the game is functional, but not top-notch.The game is an open-world, quest-based environment where you can do things in whatever order you please. However, until you perform main plot quests, you won't advance beyond the starting area, as the transition \"portal\" between areas remains locked.  Until you do advance to these other regions (which include the resort complex, a slummy port city, a jungle, and an island prison), your access to exciting and useful weapons is rather limited.  Completing quests earns you XP, as does killing zombies (far less for the latter), and after a certain amount of XP your character will \"level up,\" gaining access to a new skill of your choice (this is the RPG element of the game).  Unfortunately, the zombies level up alongside you, making them no easier to kill in higher levels.In addition, you must collect money (given as quest rewards and found on nearly every dead body, with tougher zombies generally having more) which can be used to buy weapons and weapon upgrades, and to repair your weapons, which wear out at an alarming rate.  You can also collect non-weapons items to a basically infinite degree, but the number of weapons you can hold at one time is quite limited.I'm not sure what Dead Island is trying to achieve as an overall tone.  At some points, it seemed to be trying very hard to be a serious and emotionally compelling title.  At other times, it seemed to be a darkly humorous, campy, arcade-style romp...and that latter impression definitely overrode the former.  Provided that's what the goal was, Dead Island succeeds, and those who try to take it seriously will naturally be let down.  For example, the dialogue is hopelessly cheesy, some of the quests are rather lame, and the animation in some of the cut scenes was rough and very obviously fake.In addition, the game suffers from glitches such as NPC's getting stuck on objects, zombies with no arms \"punching\" (NOT kicking) you, mini-map displays not working, and more.  Many people have lamented a bug that caused their save file to get corrupted, but I did not encounter this (I completed the game and started a new one, called \"New Game Plus\" in which you retain your skill level and inventory but restart the storyline).  I think that it may have finally been patched.  Since I still enjoy old arcade-style games such as Star Wars Battlefront, which is plagued with glitches, I did not mind the bugs in Dead Island that much, but for those who expected a polished modern title, these proved very frustrating.As far as replay value goes, some people might say that Dead Island has a short storyline which, when completed, ends the game.  I don't find this to be the case.  As it is an open-world game, like Grand Theft Auto, I enjoy just \"messing around\" and slaughtering various zombies, hunting for new weapons, and so forth.  In addition, the online co-op feature allows me to play this game with my buddy over XBox Live, and since he is a lower level than me, the zombies are finally easier to kill with all my skills and upgraded weapons.  In this regard, the online co-op seems to work well.  Random people can join your co-op sessions as well, but I generally don't care for this, as random people are not likely to take the same approach as you and unless you feel like chatting with random strangers (some people do, so nothing wrong with it) your paths may quickly diverge.  In addition, if you are trying to listen to all the [tacky] game dialogue for the first time, the stranger may skip it, leaving you unsure of what is going on in the plot.Overall, Dead Island provides some fun melee experiences with plenty of gory graphical details to intensify your assault of the zombies.  Other game aspects, such as shooting and driving, are not as good, but still useable.  If you go into the game expecting it to be tacky, and enjoy a good laugh at the repetitive dialogue and some of the animations, then you will probably have a fun time.  But if you are looking for a cinematic storyline, excellent gameplay mechanics on all fronts, and a polished title with no bugs, you will NOT LIKE Dead Island.  I personally find it entertaining and good mindless fun to unwind with after other games leave me frustrated.As an aside, here are a few humorous observations:NPCs constantly refer to how useless money is in the wake of a zombie apocalypse, but without any, you will soon be left with broken and worthless weapons, even though you personally carry out all weapons repairs at a workbench.As long as you are in a vehicle, it will roll on an incline, and the gas is so touchy that you can't hold it steady (there is no brake, only \"reverse\" which doubles as a brake).  As soon as you get out, however, the car remains still.Your character guzzles energy drinks in order to increase health, but these provide no stamina improvements.  Water cannot be consumed, but only given to other people (in particular one woman who constantly complains that her muscles are starting to cramp up, no matter how much water you give her).No matter how many people are playing, all cut scenes show the 4 playable characters, and all NPCs refer to you in plural form.You can fire a gun directly through an NPC's head, but cannot hurt or kill any of them.When you reach new hideouts, the doors are always barricaded closed, but once you exit, you can leave the door standing open and nobody will close it, nor will zombies enter.One side quest involves killing the looters in a man's house.  At that point, you can then loot his house yourself, and are still praised and rewarded by him.You can tear apart computers, copier machines, and telephones (although no animation accompanies this) but the only things you will ever find are (choose one):  electronic scrap, battery, magnet.There are plenty more humorous details in the game, so if you feel good about Dead Island, give it a shot.  If you are unsure about the glitches and lack of refinement, it's best to rent the title.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2011"}

Now, thanks to Valve, we get what is possibly the most fun zombie apocalypse to grace the world of video games.  Left 4 Dead allows you to play as either a human survivor taking out hordes of the undead, or as a flesh-hungry zombie coordinating attacks to feast on your prey.  Whichever role you choose, Left 4 Dead is a fun and frantic blast to play, with some of the best multiplayer offerings around today.  Seriously, with a few pals in tow, the Versus and other multiplayer options are reason enough to pick this game up for alone.  The single-player campaign is fun and plenty enjoyable, but the real star of the show is the game's multiplayer capabilities.  The game looks and sounds spectacular, controls wonderfully, and offers enough challenge and variation to keep you coming back again and again.  If there's any drawbacks to Left 4 Dead, it's that there are only four campaign maps, but it doesn't take away from the fact that the game is an absolute blast.  All in all, if multiplayer and/or zombie gaming is your thing in the least, Left 4 Dead is wholeheartedly worth your time and attention.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2008"}

The game world is immense and the story is riveting, but the dialogue system, where the player character is silent and the dialogue is chosen from a restaurant style menu, is dated.  The combat system of DA:O is painfully slow, so much so that I set the difficulty level on casual, so that I can get through the combats as quickly as possible and get on with the story. The graphics are passable but not nearly as crisp as DA2.  While playing DA2 is like watching a DVD action movie, video game style, playing DA:O is like reading a graphic novel.  I was going for the story, not the action.

It is full of creative violence, and it's designed with a simple and effective combat system that feels nice.  When you chainsaw an orc, you feel the rending flesh and spurting blood.Just awesome animations too: not every chainsawed orc dies the same way.  Lots of blood spurts from bullet wounds, and the orcs all reel under the concussive force of explosions, gunshots, and melee stomps, kicks, etc.There are just enough weapons to keep killing interesting, just enough melee combinations to keep from getting bored, and just enough AI skill to allow you to play through the levels differently each time.The word here is \"simple.\"  There is no complex open world--just a simple linear quest design done well.  There is no complicated combat system--just a fun, brutal bag of choices that are each satisfyingly implemented and displayed.  The gameplay is ferocious, but never too difficult.  Yes, you can change difficulty to get a harsher experience.The voice-acting is top notch.  It feels pleasantly like participating in a movie.A lot of detail went into the settings, as simple as they are.  Really appreciate that.Overall, I think this game is a labor of love that reflects the genuine tone of the Warhammer world, and of the Ultramarines specifically.Multiplayer is a fun romp through interesting and multi-leveled boards and it allows you to steal the loadout of your killers, so if you are a newby you can still have fun trying out a few different weapons you have not unlocked yet.For the price, you CANNOT AFFORD to miss out on this game.

God of War had Ascension, Tomb Raider had, well, Tomb Raider and (lo and behold) Batman had Origins.  Like most other origin games this year, Origins itself is tepid in comparison.  I myself am a huge GOW fan, yet Ascension felt like a 3.5 or even 4 vs. the perfect 5's of literally every previous game in the series.  Tomb Raider was the sole shining star in my opinion, showcasing an amazing story unique to the Tomb Raider canon brought to life in nearly perfect unison.  I love Batman and the Arkham series, although not as fun as God of War (just personal preference), was tons of fun to play with great story lines and action sequences.  Origins feels dated, like so many other reviewers have pointed out, in that it's simply a rehashed game of what was good (and sometimes bad) about its predecessors.  That's not to say it's bad or unworthy (Ascension looked great and played like a classic GOW game too), but I feel like origin stories are roads that need to be tread carefully by developers because they need to offer up the same fun but with a twist - something that is different and stands out enough to be something that doesn't just seem like the game is at a standstill.  Graphically, Batman has never looked better and the utilization of more characters in the Batman universe is impressive, yet there just feels like something's missing here.  It's still good, just not great.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2013"}

This game is relaxing and there is no storyline, so you can just take your time and really enjoy your dog(or dogs).YOUR PUPDOGS: The breed options are great, everyone loves Chihuahuas and Yorkies! The dogs respond to the way you care for them over a period of time, which means they will either be very sweet, or rebellious(although they do not get too bad).Tricks: The dogs can learn up to 14 tricks. The tricks can be weird, too. I once taught my puppy to cuddle another puppy! The tricks get more advanced as you bond with your dog.Trainer Points: These come when you do things like pet, clean, play, or walk with your dog(or dogs). At a set  trainer point total, you will either unlock a new breed(You can not unlock the Jack Russell Terrier or Dalmatian this way, that happens when you find certain presents on a walk), or a new interior design.

The Championship round awards $1,000 each time you win, so that is $3,000 a day for 1 dog($6,000 a day for 2 dogs, etc.)Obedience Trial: This one is my least favorite because of the challenge of getting your dog to respond to commands. It awards $2,000 every time your dog wins the Championship round.Disc Trial: This one is O.K. You have to work harder on this one, and your timing needs to be pretty good. Also, throw the disc straight so that it is easier for your dog to catch it. I do not know the payout.WALKSPresents(Items): You can not tell these apart from the dog meeting presents, and the presents tend to be more common closer to your home, so build up your stamina, and walk to the outskirts of town!Presents(Dogs): The dogs you meet can be friendly or mean, so encourage friendly dogs to meet yours, and stay away from the mean ones.TIPSScoop the poop! If you don't, neighbors will reprimand you when you meet their dogs. Also, when the dog on the map stops moving, keep a watch out for presents or trash(don't let your pup eat trash, you might lose trainer points).Go to the gym and work with your puppy until it MASTERS the obstacles. You have a better chance of winning, and little to no faults.Pet and spend time with your dog before going for walks. This might increase the chances of finding hidden presents on the map.Wash and groom your dog before Obedience Trials for a higher score. Learn advanced tricks for the Freestyle part of the Obedience Trial for a higher score.To get your puppy to go to sleep WITHOUT the \"Naptime\" record, rub the puppy until sparkles appear. Make sure you don't give the pup any bones that might pop up when you are petting it, and do not do anything to disturb your puppy, or you will have to start over. Repeat this ten times(I tested this)and then go to the home screen. Your pup should then curl up and go to sleep after 2-4 seconds.CONCLUSIONIf you want a dog but can not have one, this game is for you.

{"product_name":"B004FS8LYK","description":"","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"A Worthy Reboot","reviewText":"I was worried when I heard they turned Lara into a whimp in this game, but now that I played it, I can assure you she is anything but whimp in this game (excluding the very beginning). As a matter of fact, she is a balanced character portrayed in a decent story.******************************Pros****************************************Action Adventure Setting and Gameplay: The story takes place on an island. There is a good mix of both uncharted games like action and island exploration. While story is linear for most part, you traverse through many open areas and allowed to go back there for exploration.**Freedom in Stealth and Action gameplay: While at times you are forced to fight the enemies, other times you can either sneak past them or stealth kill them. I enjoyed this variety in the gameplay. A welcome addition.**Great Character Development: When the story starts out Lara is just a girl, but they do a good job showing how she turns into a survivor and a warrior. I like how during the mid and late game she calls out onto enemies. \"Yes, still alive you bast....\"Made me laugh. Very enjoyable.**Nice Scenic Location and Graphics: The scenery is pretty great: woods, caves, ancient tombs, wreaked ships, shores and more. It looks great and feels great traveling through them during day and night times.**Upgradable Skills, Weapons and Equipment: I never thought I would like using and upgrading different weapons so much in this game. Especially the composite bow. It rocks. It is nice how you can gain experience doing various tasks ranging from killing enemies and animals to collect experience and material to upgrade both your skills and weapons.**Reward for Exploration: I only like exploring different places in the game if they have something useful and interesting. The best thing you can find in this game while exploring is diaries. It has texts but also voice recording which adds depth and emotion to the writings in the diaries. Also they help you understand the story much better. Other than that there are treasures which are somewhat interesting as you can examine them and gain some additional experience.**Action Sequences: This game has uncharted like action sequences. While I am not a big fan of quick time moments, I didn't mind them in this game and enjoyed the action sequences.**Tombs: Very interesting puzzles.******************************Cons****************************************Glitches: Good thing there are no game ending glitches like Skyrim, but there are noticeable number of them. I am happy that restarting the last save point fixed all of them.**Enemies and bosses: This game has very few different types of enemies. And the types of enemies that are interesting are at very end and for a small portion of the game. Also could have included more boss fights and could have done better job with the ones that are in there.**Tombs: Interesting puzzles but very short and could yield better rewards than simply experience.**Survivor (Batman) vision: Nice how you can spot objects of interest with it, but I found myself tapping L2 so many times and it is not nice how everything else turns black and white. It is a strain on your eyes. It would be easier and better if they just make the objects of interest glow without making everything black and white.******************************Conclusion**************************************Yes the game is not perfect, but it is a worthy reboot. Liked how they developed Lara's character from beginning to end. The gameplay is enjoyable and something I can see myself playing more for 100% completion. With the cons I described I would give it a 8.9/10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2013"}

On the planet Hillys, where people can be animals, and animals people, Jade, a young woman is raised by Pey'j, a pig person who is part father image, part inventor, and part revolutionary.  Hillys is caught in the throes of a war with the alien Domz, and are very much under the control of the military, especially as manifested by the Alpha Sections.While the Alpha Sections are supposed to be protecting the people, they often fail.  Too often, according to the IRIS revolutionary force, which claims that the military seems to have several extra agenda.  Jade, who makes her living as a freelance photographer when she isn't helping Pey'j raise the orphans of the war, is drawn into the conflict by a series of assignments.  She soon finds herself fighting for the lives of her friends.The story unfolds with a light, tongue in cheek flavor (with a dash of a Caribbean accent) that belies the growing seriousness of events.  Jade's quest takes her from caves and factories into outer space, as she seeks evidence that will convince the world of the truth.  In the process, she fights, gambles, races, and sneaks.  Mostly sneaks, as a matter of fact.  Jade is a good fighter, but she lacks the firepower to handle an extended conflict.  While the game has its share of violence, it cannot be won without a great deal of stealth and problem solving.From a play viewpoint I found the game very pleasant.  Fighting is straight forward and pleasant, and character control is good.  I've seen several commercial reviews complain about frame rate, but I didn't seem to experience the same problem.  From my viewpoint, animation was fairly seamless.  One of the things I particularly likes was that the game allows you to replay difficult sequences without penalty until you get them right.  This allows the designers to include very complicated sequences without creating the intense frustration that some less forgiving games create.Beyond Good and Evil is a complete success in my book.  Jade is a terrific role image, and her fellow characters are all endearing, even as they fight the good fight.  Seek this out if you enjoy puzzles, stealth, and a good bit of comic mischief.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2003"}

Some tiny prompt on the screen is advising me what to do -- I think it says mark the two guards.  After much trial and error pushing all the buttons, I get an arrow to appear over one of the guy's heads.Now what?  I don't have a clue.  None of the buttons responds in any way.I have tried going to the options menu and looking at the control map -- and once again, the type is so small that I can't read the captions on a standard-definition TV.Did I mention that no instruction book -- not even a control map -- is included in the game box?If I had rented or borrowed this game, I would have returned it already at this point.  Because I agreed to review it for Amazon Vine, I will try again at some future time and report back.In the meantime, however, I have Bioshock Infinity and Grand Theft Auto IV in the house, two titles that I find infinitely more intuitive and enjoyable to play.So -- I would have to say avoid this game unless you have a GIANT HD TV and considerable patience.

Wii, like all the previous releases in theSuper Mario Bros.franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros.

The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"Mario looks more stunning than ever!","reviewText":"I mostly have positive things to say about the New Super Mario Bros. game.  Now I admit at first I thought the entire game looked like a big, overrated gimmick (by keeping the familiar 2D Mario engine and only enhancing the graphics to please the new generation of pickier graphic-obsessed freaks out there).I still believe the gigantic Mario power-up that enables the player to increase Mario's body size is VERY gimmicky.  This is because you can basically plow through absolutely *everything* including enemies, bricks, pipes, you name it.  Oh sure it LOOKS cool filling up the screen with Mario, but it only serves a slight purpose that wears thin after a while.  If you remember the advertisements that ran for this game a while back, it was seriously like this games reason for existence is so Nintendo can emphasize this ONE unique feature.  I still don't know where I stand with it either.  Maybe it was Nintendo's intention to try and base an entire gimmick around the new feature of a \"screen size Mario\" or maybe it wasn't.Anyway, moving on, some of the enemies are pretty awesome.  Now the bone dinosaurs wear sunglasses and remind me of Steve Miller for some reason (from the Steve Miller Band), the Cheep Cheep's are enormous in a few spots, and actually, *several* of the familiar foes have increased in size.This game is definitely influenced by Yoshi's Island and the original Super Mario Bros. more than anything else in the Mario library.  I come to this conclusion based on several reasons- the sound effects resemble the ones from Yoshi's Island for one thing, and you can collect red coins which, not only contain the same sound effects from Yoshi's Island, but the actual idea behind them was borrowed from Yoshi's Island as well.Speaking of coins, I can't help but think that collecting those big coins is an idea taken directly from Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest.  At least searching for these particular coins offers a fair challenge, and an additional boost in replay value.  Also whenever you step on those mushroom platforms, they make you feel dizzy which reminds me of the level Touch Fuzzy, Get Dizzy from Yoshi's Island.  Also baby Bowser came from Yoshi's Island.  Lots of Yoshi's Island connections all around.The connections to Super Mario Bros. lies in the level design, especially the very first level which is basically the same level as Level One with minor design changes.Speaking of challenge, those of you who grew up with the NES will probably feel right at home with this game.  It basically plays the same as those old school Mario games but with radically unique background graphics and innovative enemy designs.  I like these features.There's a new move Mario can perform where he jumps DOWN on coin blocks and bricks, and collects the power-up that way.  It's strange, but it works.I wish the final level was actually difficult though.  It's really simple compared to the final levels in previous Mario games (especially the NES ones) and it basically consists of simply dodging those burning cannons that temporarily shoot out fire- these were first introduced in the airship levels of Super Mario Bros. 3.Some of the boss fights offer unique stategies, which is commendable.  I REALLY wish the last boss fight with baby Bowser and actual Bowser consisted of more than just performing two lousy moves in order to accomplish, the second of which is downright pathetic.  I feel cheated.Overall- fun game, slightly easy perhaps, but it's still a pretty awesome game (especially for old school Mario fans).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2012"}

This will store/play all your music, play all your movies and even work as a PC if you install Linux (my next project, actually.)  My only complaint about it is still the lack of PS2 support on this model.  I'm hoping for Sony to get their act together and release software emulation via the PlayStation Store...

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"jmpg","summary":"Nintendo shows the competition how it's done","reviewText":"I haven't been terribly impressed by the last few years of gaming machines. In recent times I've asked myself, \"What ever happened to great videogame consoles like the Sega Saturn and the SNK Neo-Geo?\" The last great system in my opinion was the Sega Dreamcast, which I thought was the best system of the last generation. While the PS2 and GameCube had both good libraries (the XBox was the most overrated console in the universe), they didn't strike a chord with me like the machines of yesteryear.Nintendo understands what direction to take. They know that the future of gaming is about innovative entertainment, NOT processing power. After all, how much more upgrading in hardware specs can we stomach until we finally realize we've been playing the same kind of games for years? Everything about the Wii is NO JOKE. It's fresh and innovative. It's small. It's light. It's well-priced. It comes bundled with a game. It's accessible to all ages. It's about the fun, the interactivity, and the replay value.At first, I thought everything about the Wii was all gimmick. I was wrong. Wii Sports, while not the most impressive graphically, has tremendous replay value (especially with the Mii feature). No longer will playing Nintendo, or games in general, be called a lazy couch potato hobby. The Remote, Nunchuk, and overall motion sensor capabilities more than impressed me. I can't imagine Sony even trying to market such hardware with their shoddy parts. As for other games? For starters, it's backwards compatible with GC games and has the Virtual Console to play classics. It has many exclusives that utilize the controller in unique ways such as Raving Rabbids, Twilight Princess, WarioWare, and Red Steel. Players have other games to look forward to such as Super Mario Galaxy, Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition, and Super Smash Brothers Brawl.Nintendo struggled in the late 90's, but has slowly came back with the GC, GBA, DS, and now the Wii. I am downright convinced Nintendo now and will always stay true to real gaming, and am glad they are still around since SNK and Sega have backed out from the console wars years ago. I don't even care if the Wii doesn't win this generation's console wars (though it deserves it). Nintendo still created the best console of them all which I'd find myself still playing with.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2007"}

Allen","summary":"Overall fun and funny","reviewText":"I'd like to compare Bullet Storm with Duke Nukem mostly because it's over the top and attempt to take seriousness out of the game and put in intense violent action with funny colorful dialogs.Storyline ~I like to think that the developers were aiming for a 1980s style B-rated film plot line. For those of you who don't know, 1980's b-rated movies were generally gems where funny one liner dialogs and corny plots occur while trying to be serious but being extremely funny.The story of Bullet Storm puts you in the role of character who is trying to seek revenge. The character is part of a team who had orders from a general who told them to assassinate people they thought were terrorists but it turned out that the general only wanted to kill people trying to expose the truth about their government. The point is the story is ridiculous and silly.The game has it where you shoot down the general's warship, but your ship was badly damaged as well. You land on a planet that happens to be a resort planet, but somehow it was overrun by violent gangs and mutants. The entire game has it where you're to try and exact a revenge on the general.Many funny dialogs and plot are exchanged as you advance the story. I won't give away much but then there isn't really that much to say other than it's corny and silly and very unrealistic but it has its share of funny moments.Graphics ~The graphics of Bullet Storm is beautiful. As I said earlier, you're in a resort planet so you're going to see many wonderful tropical places as well as inner city surrounding a beautiful place. However, I've noticed sometimes when you think a place is beautiful, if you zoom in, you can see that they're not actually objects, but pictures that the developer trick you into thinking that it's a far off scenery. That isn't really distracting unless you take the time to really pay close attention.As far as your character graphics, there are so problems. While the graphics is wonderful, from time to time, the gun on your characters back may \"bounce\" or \"distort\" for a second. It doesn't happen often, but it does happen from time to time.Gameplay ~The game is set as a 1st person shooter. You do get one scene where you actually get to shoot from a space ship, but otherwise you're stuck in the 1st person view. The cut scenes tend to have it where you're viewing the characters in 3rd person, but sometimes you see scenes unfold in 1st person. Doesn't totally matter.The environment in this game is sort of confusing from time to time. You don't have \"free roam\" in areas. What I mean is, for example, you can't jump off a rail. Even more so, you can't freely move. While the environment may appear to be open and unlimited, you can't actually move around. You have to follow a set area and sometimes and invisible wall may block you from doing something. I recall one part near the end, you have a lot of \"free roaming\" but yet when you think you can go into an area, an invisible wall sort of blocks you from going to that area even though you can see an opening.You don't get that much of a weapon selection. You get guns and all of them has a primary fire mode and something called a \"charge\" shot which is basically like a secondary fire mode that cost you a \"charge\" that you can upgrade. You also get this thing called a whip, which is used to pull enemies out on the open. You can also you a charge shot on the whip which causes a lot of people to fly into the air at an radius. I found that most of the weapons are boring to use. They have some good ones like a grenade launcher, but it isn't fun at all. I found the best weapons are the standard machine rifle, pistol and the sniper rifle. The sniper rifle is probably the funniest weapon to use as you can navigate the round to the target. It's quite fun but again the AI behavior is the same. Like for example, if you use a sniper rifle, start steering it towards the enemy, he'll slow motion dodge it but once you figure out the pattern it's very easy because the enemy always does the same exact pattern.To get upgrades and ammo/charge shot purchases, you have to have point. Each time you kill an enemy, you get this thing called \"skill shots\" points. For example, if you just plainly shoot someone, you'll get really low points. But if you kick someone to a spiked fence, you get more points. You can compound it like for example, you can whip someout out in the open, kick them to a spiked fence then you get bonus points. It's fun at first, but sort of gets boring at the end when you realize every option is pretty much exhausted. In some cases you can kick these funny looking hats on people, or even shoot a plant that causes mass hysteria. You can even drink booze or inhale the mass hysteria plant and get bonus points by being in an intoxicated state. It's quite fun.There are problems executing the skill shots. For example, some places have decent barrels laying around. So if you \"aim down the sight\" sometimes the auto aim follows someone running off in the distance. So you miss the skill shot chance and now you're stuck having to find another way. It's rather annoying to have the auto aim lock onto something you don't intend to shoot. This can be bypassed though. I've learned that if you want to do this, don't aim down the sight. Instead hip fire and perhaps waste some rounds trying to do something that should have been done easily by aiming down the sights.Also, you get two AI partners in this game. While they appear hardcore in cut scenes, they don't really help out in game. They run around and from time to time may just run past enemies. I don't recall any AI saving me in the game. Matter of fact, they just randomly run around and take cover and so fort. Personally I like it where they don't help, but sometimes it's a wonder why they're so \"dumb\" yet in scenes they appear so different.Some of the boss battles in the game are excellent. I recall this one plant boss, and I never had so much fun fighting a boss. It's fun and exciting. However, that is pretty rare. I think that is the only large boss of the game. Plus one train level, you had to dodge a giant tire while escaping which was extremely fun and exciting times. The game has few great moments but near the end they degrade to simple story line. There isn't even a final battle except a button mashing one which made it about as exciting as pong in 2011.Overall I was happy with the game. The ending to it is horrible. Just horrible. It opens up for Bullet Storm 2, but I don't think I'm getting that title due to some of the issues with this game. Overall it's funny, but I don't think I want to make it a habit buying sequels to this game. It's fun but the story is non-existence and having one large, continuous b-rated storyline would not be very fun. Plus the gun play, which exciting at first, gets boring at the end when you figured out the patterns. Overall fun, but don't want a sequel.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2011"}

Sure, it was no Mario Galaxy, nor was it anywhere near as awesome as Super Smash Bros Brawl. What it was, though, was a great way to experience the power of the motion control.It's a simple collection of 5 simulations of, well, sports.First, we have Tennis. It's easily one of the best tennis simulations you'd ever play, mainly because it was easy to pick up and play. You didn't even have a WiiMotion Plus with you, yet the Wii Remote takes full advantage of your arm movements. It feels just like tennis, and it's just as fun as the real sport, too.Baseball is perhaps the most flawed of the bunch. It's not that it isn't fun to play, but it's because it's not as robust as an actual baseball game. You pitch and/or swing the bat, but the rest of the work is done by the game itself. Even with all sorts of crazy gimmicks and items, Mario Super Sluggers is the better, and more realistic, baseball game.Bowling is the family pick of them all. My brothers and father love this. Although the Wii Remote could have read the arm movements a bit better, this is a very fun and robust game of bowling. It even requires the same kind of strategy to knocking down the pins as in an actual bowling game.Ah, yes. Golf. There isn't anything much to the sport, unlike the others. You just whack the ball, and putt it on the Green. Virtual wind conditions and types of grass add some more variety to this classic sport. You also gotta be careful about how hard you swing the Remote.Lastly, we have Boxing. You can probably get the most exercise from this game. It's all about knocking down your opponent. It gets addicting, but be sure your arms are up for it all. It's the only sport that requires the Nunchuck with the Wii Remote, and BOY does it work out (No pun intended).All of these games are very fun, and they are sure to bring that fun to the whole family. Looking for new ways to enjoy these sports in this game? Then try out the Training Mode in the game. Don't be fooled by the name. Training Mode provides new ways to have fun with the sports. For example, Bowling allows you to pick up just spares, and there's also \"Power Bowling\", which has you bowl against huge numbers of pins! There's also target practice for Golf, hitting the ball in the right direction for Baseball, and whacking down bunches of punching bags for Boxing. Definitely a great game for the Wii. If you don't already own it, get it now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2012"}

I don't, but I still bought an Xbox 360 HD-DVD player for the holidays. Why?-It's cheap. I got the player for not much more than you'd pay for any good upscaling DVD player.-It still works just fine. Even though Xbox 360 has gone through some major upgrades, including the full revamp of the dashboard through the New Xbox Experience (NXE), the player is still 100% compatible, and it still still plays regular DVDs in addition to the HD-DVD functionality.-It enhances the Xbox 360. I tend to play one game at a time on my 360, so I like leaving that game disc in the tray. Now I can pop in a DVD without swapping out my game disc, and if I want to swap from my DVD to play my game, it's literally three button presses away (Guide button, scroll down, A button). The 360 can effectively swap between two discs at a time with this add-on (although the HD-DVD player cannot play game discs).-The 360 is always on. Playing a DVD leaves the Xbox 360 in \"quiet\" mode, making whisper-quiet noise but continuing to charge controllers or download content without interrupting playback. If someone messages you online, your Friends list is one press of the Guide button away. You can also wake the console from background mode to full functionality in moments. As an example: You could be watching a movie, get a friend invite from someone to play the new Call of Duty (or ignore it with privacy settings), and boot over into a Party with them in one seamless experience (should you choose to). The unified experience is really marvelous.-Planet Earth. Frankly, I only care about the \"HD\" part of the player for the documentary Planet Earth. Considering the HD-DVD version is available for bargain prices, I am one happy camper! The rest of the HD-DVD catalog is similarly bargain-priced, and I'll probably pick up a few more titles eventually.-Doesn't use up ports. The HD-DVD player plugs into your 360 through a USB plug (and comes with its own power cord), but it has two additional USB plugs on its backside, so on balance you're actually adding one USB slot to your console. Again, just brilliant design.-It comes with a free universal remote. A good DVD player plus universal remote usually costs as much as this is going for now, so you're getting a good deal.-And newer 360 consoles do output to HDMI, which was a complaint at launch. I don't really care about this, and most HDTVs still don't really support true 1080p through HDMI, so you probably don't care either. But if you do, it's there.Overall, this is one of the very best extensions for the Xbox 360 console. You might not even care about HD-DVD, but this is still a great buy for the disc-swapping it saves, not to mention the universal remote, and the extra USB port might be handy. You even get access to a library of bargain HD-DVDs, which is a very good thing too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2009"}

{"product_name":"B007SRM5U6","reviewerName":"Genryu","summary":"Not just the best Batman game, but the best superhero game too","reviewText":"Rocksteady's first entry into the Batman series with Arkham Asylum was a admirable one, and like many first efforts it showed with some unpolished edges and overall limited scope with the game design. Arkham City from its very outset is the Batman game most fans really wanted. It's got a nice big prison built in old Arkham to explore, plenty of challenges to keep you entertained, and a revamped and accessible fighting system. In short, Batman Arkham City is not just the best Batman game, but the best Superhero game to date.StoryThe story takes place within the walls of Arkham City, as you could probably guess. Arkham City is an old part of Gotham City that has been repurposed into a open prison, with the inmmates free to run around and do as they please. This means that the main villains like Two-Face, Penguin, Mr. Freeze, The Joker and many others are all waging war with each other over territory when the game begins. This is all occurring under the watchful eye of Dr. Hugo Strange, orchestrating events within the Prison that Batman is tasked with uncovering. The story begins with Bruce Wayne being thrown into Arkham City as a prisoner by Hugo Strange, knowing full-well that he is Batman. Don't want to say much more than that since playing through the game is the best part. Beyond the main story there are several side-missions to play through involving various Batman villains, and I've found them all to be worth the time to play through.GameplayThe game does an admirable job about making you feel as powerful as Batman with a very easily accessible fighting system. Even if you've never played games that involved physical combat, you can pick up how to play Arkham City within a few minutes, and work on becoming an accomplished fighter over the course of the game. The game also does an excellent job keeping the game continuously challenging by ramping things up smoothly in difficulty and variety. It's not often that I can say that about a game, and it made the game very entertaining to keep playing without frustration. There are plenty of gadgets to use as well, from the trusty grappling hook to more elaborate weapons like the freeze grenade. There is a seamless integration between the open world exploration and the missions themselves, which makes the whole game feel like a continuous experience. There's also some elements of detective work, though it's not one of the core experiences unfortunately. Hunting down your enemies from the dark and terrifying your enemies has never been more satisfying.Graphics/SoundThe graphics of this game are well done, and a notable step up in terms of some of the textures compared to Arkham Asylum. I think the game looks very good, especially considering the continuously smooth framerate throughout. The use of darker colors everywhere though does help mask some of the less pretty sights, but hey Arkham City is meant to look run-down which it absolutely does. The real winner is the sound-design, always finding such powerful tracks to play when you have to take down the enemies in a room or are tasked with just a difficult fight or mission. It just fits so perfectly and gets you pumped up when you're playing through those scenes. I actually am considering buying several pieces from the game soundtrack because of how well-done they were.ExtrasYou get to play as Catwoman for part of the campaign and for certain side-missions, and thankfully her missions are entertaining and she genuinely does play differently than Batman. Batman hits very hard and has many gadgets whereas Catwoman is much swifter and more agile with her whip and bolas to keep enemies down. If you're a big Batman fan like I am you will find plenty of extras like riddler trophies and puzzles to solve to keep you very entertained for quite a while. I had a lot of fun trying to solve puzzles related to characters and events I recall from watching Batman: The Animated Series as a kid. It took me a decent amount of time to finish up everything in the main story and there is game-plus mode for those who want a real challenge since it removes the warning signs for incoming attacks and lets enemies hit harder. There's also the challenge missions where you can play as Nightwing or Robin trying to get a higher score.All in all, if you're a Batman fan or just someone that wants to know what it feels like to be Batman - Arkham City is the game for you. I know Arkham Origins is coming out later this year, but since it is being made by a different studio than the one that made Arkham City I'm a bit cautious about how it'll turn out. Whether it turns out to be good or bad, I can tell you right now that Arkham City is great and worth playing on its own merits.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2013"}

There is a 1 to 1, bullet in to bullet out reload time, which I might appreciate in a game that wasn't so difficult to hit a target even if it's standing right in front of you.Summary: I got this in a discount bin and feel robbed, mostly as positive reviews for this seem incredibly unlikely. Where we playing the same game?You have been warned.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2009"}
