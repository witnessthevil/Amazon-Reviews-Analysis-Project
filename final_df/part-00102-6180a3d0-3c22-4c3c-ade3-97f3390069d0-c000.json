{"product_name":"B00019AZBO","description":"Shocking and evil, Mortal Kombat: Deception pushes martial arts-style fighting and the Mortal Kombat franchise to new heights with an innovative fighting system, unparalleled depth and brutally intense action that will appeal to long-time Mortal Kombat fans as well as next-generation gamers. The game features lightning-fast hand-to-hand and special weapons combat, secret and returning characters, moves and combinations with new death-dealing battles and fatalities.","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"The best Mortal Kombat game yet","reviewText":"Taking everything that made Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance a revolutionary entry into the long running series, Mortal Kombat: Deception ups the ante considerably and is by far the best Mortal Kombat game yet.  Running on the Deadly Alliance engine, Deception picks up right after the conclusion of the previous game as Onaga the Dragon King makes short work of Raiden, Shang Tsung, and Quan Chi; and has taken the rest of the MK warriors as his slaves and prisoners.  Deception not only introduces us to a list of new fighters, it also brings back vintage fighters from MK 2 and 3 like Nightwolf, Sindel, Baraka, Mileena, Jade, and cyber-Smoke; along with all their glorious and gory fatalities as well.  Besides one on one fighting and the returning Krypt unlockables feature, Conquest Mode has returned, and it has been greatly revamped.  This time around, it is much less linear as you go through free roaming environments to be taught the ways of Mortal Kombat by Bo Rai Cho and others on your way to becoming a master kombatant.  There's also some new features as well: Puzzle Kombat and Chess Kombat.  Puzzle Kombat is the most entertaining of the two, as you line up blocks while bobbleheaded fighters smack each other around at the bottom of the screen.  Also, for the first time ever, Midway offers up some online play which is a more than welcome addition to the series.  The most apparent thing you'll notice about Deception are the various odes to past games in the series, as well as some graphical improvments over Deadly Alliance.  Everything else about Deception is top notch, helping make it the best game yet in the series.  All in all, Deception isn't only a must own for long time MK fans, it's one of the best fighting games to grace consoles in the past few years.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2006"}

{"product_name":"B000TVT8PI","reviewerName":"Adrian Jenkins \"southerndudeman\"","summary":"Ah, 80 GB machine, we hardly knew thee...","reviewText":"I was fortunate to pick up yesterday the now-discontinued 80 GB PS3. I'm pretty happy with the purchase, although there are some bad points to the new playstation. Still, let's begin with the good:1) Solid construction - the machine itself is pretty damn solid. I think it weighs 10-12 pounds or so. I like the jet-black reflective color, although it looks like it hides a turn-table or something.2) Backward compatibility - this has been beaten in the ground, but its worth mentioning. The current 40 GB model lacks backward compatibility. It's a stupid move by Sony on my part, as this feature is worth the extra bucks spent (although not worth the exhorbitant rates charged by some of the private sellers hosted by Amazon.3) Wireless controller - man, I hate the fact that the Wii controller uses batteries. So many batteries. Wouldn't it be much simpler to have a wireless controller charge an internal battery off of the machine itself? Voila. The PS3 gets this one right.4) Multiple use - Blu-ray is poised to dominate the home entertainment market in the next few years. If you don't believe me, just look at the recent jump in Sony's stock prices. It is very nice to get a Blu-ray player on this machine. Of course, there is a downside to this, which I'll elaborate on later, but I'm happy to have the technology. You can also load photos, music, etc. on the machine, but this is less interesting to me.5) Great graphics - Stellar stuff. The graphical potential of this machine is almost unchartable. If it can just get off the ground (and I think it finally is, despite the buffoonery of the Sony execs), watch out. The PS3 will REALLY shine in this department.Now, the bad:1) Lack of software - Sony has been monumentally stupid in its wooing of 3rd party platformers, and it shows. The dearth of games on the system is unacceptable. Hope is on the horizon, but man, lots of good games have been lost to X-Box 360.2) Devotion to Blu-ray - it is my opinion that Sony is banking on the PS3 to be a Blu-ray delivery device, rather than a gaming machine. If you look at the \"evolution\" of the system, we've seen deletions of backward compatibility in every iteration of the system, and now it is completely gone. My opinion is that SOny thinks they can get away with this, since people will (supposedly) buy the system for its Blu-Ray player. It's a shortsighted vision - as the Wii has proven, gamers want machines...that play games. Sure, the extras are great, but I didn't buy the PS3 for its Blu-Ray.3) Ridiculously large - did this machine REALLY need to look like it houses a turntable? It looks like something out of the 70s, with a jet-black finish.4) Dearth of games - did I mention this already? Well, it bears repeating.Sony will rise high with this machine, as it is a good one. They won't dominate the market anymore, which is also good, as it should cleanse the execs of the arrogance that has surrounded this system (Nintendo ran into this problem in the mid-t0-late 90s, with their 64DD debacle, as well as their loss of market share from the N64). All in all, I expect this machine to do well in the long run, as Sony realizes just how arrogant it has been in all of this. Until then, tread water.Addendum: Don't buy a $750 80 GB machine. The backward compatibility isn't worth it. There are still some of these machines in stores (check places like Sears and Kmart, where no one seems to shop anymore), but in the end, I would just get a 40 GB machine and hold onto my PS2, rather than pay these ridiculous gougers the prices they seek.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000WEQL02","reviewerName":"007 \"cmyth007\"","summary":"Should be better","reviewText":"A fantastic follow-up to the best FPS in history. Halo 3, while it had a fantastic story, just isn't nearly as good as the Rainbow series in terms of gameplay. I'll start with the positives...The weapons are fantastic. The way they shoot, the way they sound, and the way they look. They added a few new weapons, but I'd have liked to see a lot more. In addition, only being able to put one attachment on is a little silly. If you put high cap magazines on, for example, you can't have a scope. Unrealistic to the point of being silly.They allow us to once again play cooperatively via split screen, online, or system link. THANK YOU! So few devs are letting co-op play get the attention it deserves, and they wonder why their games don't sell.The new leveling system is wonderful. In the first game, the only way you could unlock the cool looking gear was to play versus online. And guess what? Not everyone likes to do that. This version allows you to get all the experience either online in versus mode, or playing the Co-op story or terrorist hunt.Wonderful multiplayer options. You have your story, of course, and terrorist hunt, which gives the game unlimited replayability. The new online modes are cool too, if you're into that.A few \"negatives\" for the game. First, the difficulty. Some of the silly reviewers found it so difficult that they gave it only one or two stars. Apparently they felt it was just that bad. The game is certainly more difficult than the first game, it sort of has to be. It had to be balanced to allow multiple human players. So although it may be a bit tough on single player, it is perfect when you have your buddies playing with you.The player customization feature is nice, but unusually limited. In addition, the facial features like facial hair--all look the same. The pictures look different, but when its mapped onto the actual character, they don't really look any different at all. The goatee version--doesn't even have a goatee, lol. This is a mild complaint, because with camo and gear on your head, you never see the face much.Not a lot of new weapons. Some people may not like the new \"kit\" system, but I think its pretty nicely done overall.In a way it does feel like an expansion, as there aren't a lot of new features, but who cares? The first game was the best ever, and I'm perfectly happy having a bunch of new levels to play. They did add the sprint button, which is nice as well.The BIG problem with this game was one that they claimed to have fixed after the first game. The spawning problem. For those of you who don't know, it is not uncommon at all for terrorists to appear, as if by magic, right in front of you--or behind you, in a room you had just cleared. Instead of populating the map with terrorists at the beginning, they sprinkle them in throughout--there is really no excuse for this. It is lazy game design and purely irresponsible.And their idea of \"difficulty\" levels is just as bad as everyone else's. Instead of the logical thing, throwing more enemies at you, they just take away half of your ammo and reduce the number of respawns. Again, lazy design. I would have liked to change my rating from five stars to only 4, or even 3.5.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2008"}

The AMD driver update makes the game playable, but you'll still encounter tons of graphical glitches, problems etc. Some of this makes it less fun to play and a little less pretty, other glitches make it a complete waste of time. If you're running and gunning maybe low texture quality won't be that big of a deal, but don't stop to admire an outdoor vista! You'll think you were playing a game from 1997.The glitches that really suck are when characters don't draw correctly and turn into a mess of geometry and ghosts of that character being drawn in and out of different positions, with different weapons. It certainly makes the cities seem... alive, if not seizure inducing. You can also see enemies drawn through walls in weird ways, and shadows can go across walls/floors when the enemies are actually a floor above you. I've experienced this all, with a top of the line system and the most up-to date drivers.You cannot change most of this - it's a console port so there's no way to adjust any graphics settings aside from AA and screen dimensions. Nothing else. Now, if you follow some community hacks to try and get the game to work there are config files and console commands that can attempt to force the game to work at your systems capability level, but this is rather technical and a real waste of time since it doesn't really fix anything, just slightly improves the badness.Now - once the game is fixed up it'll be much prettier and the fun potential is all over the place. Bu there's no multiplayer, the RPG elements are wholly without any interaction, any choice, and since all you do is click \"E\" when facing a character that can talk to you, any sort of replay ability is going to be reserved for those that enjoy driving between cities, doing menial tasks and not being able to skip through cut scenes, character dialogue and any other part of the time wasting that's marketed as RPG.Finally, just a couple more indications of what this game is about - the bar in the second city has a man smoking a cigarette in it... well it's random when you load, but he's either got the cigarette in his hand, or it's floating mid-air about 2 feet away from his hand. It at least follows the movement to take a drag, but again, kind of a near miss when the guy is 2ft away with his smoke.In terms of AI, stare at some enemies that see you, fire at you, watch you step into a doorway and you'll be met with a near continual loop of \"where'd he go?\" coming from them. Apparently the AI doesn't know how to move, and doesn't understand anything beyond Peek-a-boo.There's some fun elements, there's a lot that could have been fun, and if they ever fix the game the graphics will probably be great... if they fix it. Just don't buy this for PC, if you want to play it, it's really not as great as all the pay-for-review sites say, but it is fun. It'd even be a great $30 console when that time comes. But until then, save yourself the headache (literally with the graphics bugs!) and spend your money elsewhere.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2011"}

Some of my recent favorites are Rune Factory, Shiren the Wanderer, and the Zelda series.  I love games with lots of secrets and long \"checklists\" of difficult goals to accomplish.  I review from this perspective.TWEWY is quite different than the usual fantasy RPG dungeon crawl I enjoy.  The action takes place entirely within an alternate reality version of downtown Tokyo (Shibuya).  Despite that fact, I've played over 30 hours now and there are several things about the game that I like.  My favorite aspect is the intriguing plot.  It reminds me of The Matrix:  completely arbitrary, inconsistent, and absurd, and yet somehow the story works so well that you ignore how ridiculous it is.  The combat system is innovative, making excellent use of the DS hardware (touch screen, wireless features, etc.).  Left-handers will appreciate that fact that TWEWY controls are (nearly) perfectly symmetrical.  You are rarely forced into battle without warning -- combat is avoidable, optional, and you can see it coming in most cases.  The game has a wide variety of \"pins\" (weapons) and monsters, both of which break up the monotony of combat somewhat.  Also, there's a decent wireless minigame for 1-4 players.  Some players will enjoy the \"street punk anime\" design ethic; I'm neutral on this particular aspect.But on the downside, the game is highly, highly repetitive, the epitome of a \"grind\".  In many checklist-type games where you \"have to have them all\", I enjoy finding all the secrets and mastering all the possibilities.  Not so in TWEWY.  In order to get all the secrets, you would need to grind and grind and grind the same basic combat approximately 5,000 times (no exaggeration) -- and that's if you're good at the combat and know how to maximize the experience you get from it.  Yes, the weapons and enemies do change over time, but I'm well past sick of the combat system after 1,000 battles and have given up any notion of \"getting them all\" and am just focusing on finishing the plot.  Moreover, it is simply inconceivable that anyone could find most secrets on their own.  For example, \"pin evolution\" (e.g. creating rare and hidden weapons by evolving them from lower forms) is so convoluted you'd have to be insanely dedicated to explore the evolutionary possibilities on your own, or, do the only sane thing and \"cheat\" with a hint book or online guide.  I looked at an online guide and was glad I did, because it completely disabused me of the notion that I'd enjoy mastering all pins.  Many secrets cannot be obtained unless you play via the DS wireless system.  Even more secrets cannot be obtained except by *not* playing the game for days or even months on end.  (Dozens of secrets only unlock if you leave the game shut down in specific states, and you have to leave it shut down for a *long* time.  See my comment on this review below for a spoiler secret which can greatly help ease this frustration.)  In short, 99.99% of all gamers simply aren't hard-core enough to enjoy getting all the secrets, and I say this as someone who enjoyed spending 300+ hours unlocking all the arcane secrets from the very difficult Shiren the Wanderer.My biggest complaint is harder to quantify, which is that I just don't enjoy TWEWY as much as other RPGs.  In another RPG, I might enjoy teasing open a long chain of puzzles to unlock a final mystery; but in TWEWY, the inter-twined pins/brands/items system feels very flat and arbitrary.  I imagine this is what a good RPG must seem like to someone who doesn't like RPGs.  Maybe it's the weird setting, or maybe its the unabashedly massive grind, but for whatever the reason, I plan to finish this game for the plot but don't plan to recommend it to any of my friends.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2008"}

Normally they love to shoot and blow up every thing. This time around; instead of going head on, they want us to run away. You even get trophies for not killing and not for getting shot.  This is coming from DICE :).The game is fast first person platformer. A fresh new adaptation of true and tried platforming. Rather than moving slowly and timing the jump from the edge. Speed is what counts here. You need to be moving at a constant speed to kick open doors, catch a drop wire etc. etc. Every thing is setup for constant nonstop movement. The level designs are so perfect; once you get hang of controls there is no need to stop. The game takes you through roof tops, A/C vents, malls, office walk ways and lots of other varied setups. At every stage there are multiple paths to move forward. There is a lot of freedom and it is tied well with risks.  As with Battlefield risk reward balance is impeccable throughout the game.The character is not a military marksmen. Neither are the enemies. They are just guards patrolling the building. So don't expect a epic gun battles. She is a fast and cute runner, so just run run. Don't waste time in gun battles. Your aim is to reach the check point not clearing the enemies. The game controls are very easy to pick up, yet very satisfying. I liked the time travel mode much more than the main game, mainly for the sense of accomplishment.The game will take easily 10 hours to finish in the first run. I read reviews about 7 hrs, they must be super humans. Some of the latter levels do require you to try a few times. The real challenge comes in finishing the game without shooting any one. The main character can disarm, kick the guards un-conscious. If you really want to shoot them you can do it too. There is no penalties for shooting guards, you can't carry weapons while moving fast.Audio is spot on. The art direction depicts the totalitarian regime. Every thing is cut out from a single template like old communism. It is a nice breath of fresh air. If you are tired of post apocalyptic burnt and brown  backgrounds, join the party. The character models and physics are very impressive. Every thing moves as you expect them to.It may take some time to get a handle on the game.

Its a lot of fun now and im having a blast sniping. if you like sniping, youll like this game. I only got a couple hours into the campaign, so far its not bad, but im hooked on multiplayer at the moment. this game i feel is one of those that needs to grow on you, so i say rent it first if you dont like throwing money around, and i suggest give it a couple days then make your decision. but for me, im really liking it!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2010"}

I am not sure exactly how long it took me to complete, but it was no more than six hours. My brother feels like he complete it in about four. So, it takes somewhere between four to six hours and is a solid game with a decent story line. The game felt smooth, the weapons were workable. Throwing a grenade is a little awkward compared to other first person shooters, but the rest of the weapons are solid. I especially enjoyed the sections where you play as a tier 1 operator. Also, you get to play as a chopper gunner, which was decent (much better than the silly tank gameplay in COD: World at War).I was hoping that I would be able to enjoy the multi-player, but this just isn't the case. It feels like a reduced version of Battle Field Bad Company 2. EA should have used the same engine as the single-player campaign in the multi-player. The game feels like fighting in Jello. Everything feels thick, and somehow slow. Also, the mortar fire in the game is annoying and encourages snipers to sit back at the edge of maps and do absolutely nothing (a similar criticism that I had for BFBC2). All around, the multi-player is a poor experience. I am not sure why anyone would choose Medal of Honor's gameplay to BFBC2 or Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2. The large scale battles and interactive maps in BFBC2 are far superior, while Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is a tighter game with a more addictive multi-player experience; both games offer a better range of class options than Medal of Honor. It feels like Medal of Honor tries to take elements from both games, but doesn't succeed with capturing the good elements of either game.Overall a decent experience, but it is probably worth waiting for Black Ops or sticking with BFBC2 or CODMW2.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B00434FED2","description":"","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"He Rocked Black Or White","reviewText":"It is honestly hard to believe that it has been almost a year and a half since Michael Jackson tragically died. With all the heartbreak his death hit upon the world, yet so many people were honestly re-awakened by what had made him famous during his lifetime, his music. His songs on his own & with his The Jackson 5 made him one of the most influential and dynamic singers of all time. Not just with his music, but also with dance and by the standards of his music videos too. Now, with his music being re-introduced to a whole new generation, many people are still dancing to the rhythms of his feet from his songs like Thriller and Leave Me Alone. But, that also has came into video games as well. But this isn't the only time Michael Jackson had put his mark into video games. Back in the 80's he had a video game based on his movie Moonwalker, and he also helped compose the music for Sega's Sonic The Hedgehog 3 (but never took any credit for it at that time.) Now, his music has came into the Wii's eyes, as you step to that page that made Michael Jackson the King Of Pop.Michael Jackson: The Experience is a daring and challenging Dance game that mostly compete well with Nintendo's other dance game competitors in music games like Dance Dance Revolution & Just Dance. The challenge of the game is that you have to simply move and try to match Michael's moves through dance from the catalog of his big hits. The graphics are alright, but the gameplay is challenging, as you try and master the moves Michael Jackson had made to the music on his classics like Thriller, Billie Jean, Black Or White, and Remember The Time. The control with the Wii-mote takes a lot to get used to though, but it really does go with the challenge of Michael's dance steps. While the game is challenging, there are a few faults with the game. One of them is that I honestly was surprised that there could've been more of Michael's hits to be challenged with. I was surprised that some of his #1 songs like You Rock My World, Scream with Janet Jackson, P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing,) and Man In The Mirror weren't showcased here in the game, as is with lesser-known songs like Workin' Day & Night and Sunset Driver. The second thing is that I wish that there could've been more challenging multiplayer modes, like Wi-Fi to play against friends online.Despite those few faults, Michael Jackson: The Experience is a really challenging game for the Nintendo Wii, and one that can still say even after Michael's death, this was the way he made us feel. Just swaying away to his music. It is mostly worth the money if you're a hard core Michael Jackson fan, or looking for a change of pace in dance video games. Nevertheless, the way Michael Jackson made his projects was elaborate and over the top. I was honestly hoping for more in the game, but there is a lot to sway and dance your way to the top.Graphics: B 1/2-Sound: BControl: BFun & Enjoyment: B for solo & multiplayerOverall: B","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2010"}

The controller is excellent, xbox live is an excellent online service, and of course you can still jump from app to app and play a game and watch tv at the same time. The xbox one is constantly being updated with major updates being released once a month, each update brings new innovative ideas and already the xbox one is a much better console than it was when it was released back in November of last year. I guess buying the base console makes it feel more game focused.There are a lot of great xbox exclusive coming in the future. The halo master chief collection which has all 4 halo games with each one being remastered in 1080p was just announced and will be coming this fall. Halo 5 will be out in 2015. Titanfall 2 will inevitably be released sometime in 2015. Sunset overdrive seems to be interesting. and for racing fans Forza horizon 2: and open world racing game is coming this fall as well. All these excellent games are on Xbox only. Also GTA V is coming to xbox one and ps4 this fall.and If your concerned about the graphics being slightly better on ps4 that's bull, people always said the same thing about PS3 having better graphics than 360 but it never really did(i own ps3 and 360 so i know).

{"product_name":"B000ZJVDA2","reviewerName":"FicktionPhotography","summary":"A Filler, but Possibly not Worth the Time","reviewText":"DOES CONTAIN SPOILERSFor a video game that seems to hark on time and how important it is, I found myself utterly astounded that I dedicated so much time to the game itself. Now, don't get me wrong, I found the game to be, at the very least, entertaining. However, there are several things that I found about this creation that is in serious need of a face lift.Kaim Argonar, our angst-ridden protagonist is about as likable as an emo kid bewailing his musical escapades with a dull razor. Thankfully, however, there is reason to believe that Kaim has a meaningful explanation to be the way he is. He's 'immortal' and has seen the full scope of far too many lives, the pains of war, and how capitalism drives societies to their ends. Not too far off from our world, which is a plus. Kaim, however, becomes rather likable after a while, simply by his dedication to continue to fight for something that will inevitably pass on in his lifetime.The other immortals, however, seem strangely above this condition and continue to be rather chipper throughout the story. Seth, being a prime example. Even though she has her quirks towards Kaim-emoness, she is rather likable and just does what she needs to and calls it a day. The most expression we get from her is in regards to her son, Sed, who resembles a 70 year old man in comparison to the 20 year old looking Seth. The end, however, is hardly capable of swallowing. Seth becomes a sacrificial hero which doesn't seem to sit well in my hands. I just never built up enough for her to care since Kaim, despite his bewailing, is the main pusher and puller of the story.The White Boa...needs to be at the bottom of the ocean. It's as useless as the Nautilus' ability to fly. True, it can smash through ice and, therefore, progress some of the story and complete some of the missions, but it is the slowest thing around. I used it as little as possible. Whoever said this would be a great idea ought to have a talk with me. Just equip the jack-of-all-trades Nautilus with a blow dryer on the front and all will be well.The story itself isn't bad. We'll talk more about that later. However, it seemed rather slapdash. It certainly had the potential for greatness but fell short and hit a few steps on the way down. I think the best part of the story that I enjoyed was Cooke and Mack's mother, Kaim and Sarah's daughter, who seems to piece the entire story together with her infinite love and compassion. It is, unfortunately, not the focus of the story. A sound mind will realize that Gongora is the antithesis to Lirum's passionate zest for life, as short as it might have been, but the story also tries to slide towards the world domination category with Gongora. Compassion seems to be the side thought to a much greater evil, when it should have been emphasized more in both regards. Of course, who wants a sappy story about a dead woman?As hinted out before, the character development is strangely lacking. Sure, I laughed at some of Jansen's jokes and got a twinge in my eye from Cooke and Mack or some of the 'memory' stories that are unlocked throughout the game, but I certainly was not particularly moved by life-or-death scenarios. Sarah and Sed were probably the least interesting even though I felt like they could have been if they had a little bit more stage time.While on the subject of characters. The way they level up is bothersome. It is strangely effective in new areas where your leveling up becomes a kind of steroid power without ever having much difficulty behind battling anything you encounter. Because of this, each area will level you up to a certain number where it feels comfortable that you can continue and then it becomes a terribly slow ordeal that refuses to give you even so much as a point, if that. No wonder Kaim is whining. Regardless, it is somewhat effective, but then you never have that exciting pleasure of whether you think you are strong enough to battle the next boss. Bosses, therefore, become rather easy, even if some were positively infuriating. The most difficult battle in the entire game is the last battle of the Backyard, a kind of battle arena. All others should be a cake walk if you find yourselves slow on the leveling up category.Okay, okay, so not everything is bad. A lot is good! The music, for one, is fantastic. Why? Because it's composed by the notorious Nobuo Uematsu. I would spend a good deal of time 'leveling up' just so I could listen to some of his music. Unfortunately, the leveling up part was hardly enjoyable from other RPGs.Being clearly sarcastic myself, Jansen really kept the story rolling for me. He started the story going, flitted along sarcastically along the way, and wound up helping a great deal in the end. The writers should be complimented with some of his comments, even if the other characters lacked much vocabulary. Speaking of writers, the little memory stories were sometimes corny and other times strangely linked up with the reality us humans live in. It certainly helps for us to care about what is being said. I recommend reading them, even if they aren't required.Despite the leveling up fiasco that occurs in each area, the fight sequence is stable and often times fun. There is also a variety of interesting critters to fight, even if some are painfully repeated in other areas. I did not find myself frustrated with any of the game play, and the ability to hit perfects being in your control is a wonderful concept.Not to be long winded, but I chewed up the game enough to begin with. The story, as mentioned, was almost there. The potential was great but somehow slacked off and became negligible. Regardless, there is a deal to like, such as Lirum, mentioned earlier. She is truly, regardless of never actually feeling like she was important, presents the antithesis to Gongora who cannot love even though he feels he is giving into the virus of emotions. Nobody ever explained that one. There are also Lirum's kids, who, despite being irritating at first, are just as beneficial to the party as Kaim is. I expected them to be more like Tolten, in other words, useless, but they came through in the end.There are also a decent amount of side missions that can be completed for loads of goodies, and they aren't particularly maddening. I don't think I could have dealt with another maddening boss, such as the last fight in the Backyard. The dedication to the game just isn't there, so I was happy with mediocre difficulty being faced in the dark places of the planet.So, all in all, it's not bad. Sure, there are problems, but it wasn't as miserable as I expected it to be. I feel like if the producers just spent a bit more time fiddling they would have had a fantastic game. Unfortunately, they didn't. So I won't be returning to Kaim's world anytime soon. I wouldn't swear it completely off, but I certainly don't recommend spending as much time on it as I did. 80 hours.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000PS4X7S","reviewerName":"Tanya McHenry","summary":"A True Cooperative Experience","reviewText":"Too often, a game will boast that it has online content and multiplayer options and then only wind up giving you some sort of vs. skirmish mode with no story at all a handful of maps, some sort of matching system all having next to nothing to do with the single player campaign. Left 4 Dead is a true cooperative experience for 2-4 players.  There will always be four Survivors against the environment, and the AI for the remaining Survivors is adequate enough where you could play 2 players and have fun.  It is a first person shooter so there isn't a lot of material to work with, but the guns, the strategy and the knowledge that if you loose even one of your fellow Survivors at key moments in the game, you are toast makes it a challenging games.  I played the game for free for hours using Steam's promo so I wasn't able to finish the game but here are some highlights.ProsMultiplayer: up to four in true cooperative modeFour sets of maps which changing mob location: the maps were stagnant but the couple of times we played the map, some of the more difficult opponents were not in the same locationDrop in and out, one of our friends lost connection during the game: she was able to come right back in with no trouble at all. We waited for her but we could have continued easily.Varying difficulty levels that actually seem to vary: often times a game is too difficult on its normal mode, or too easy, the range here is great for a group to find whatever challenge they enjoy mostA few game modes - we didn't play the vs. mode or the survival mode but the option there is great.Graphics: the game looked really good and didn't seem bogged down like some of the other games get when there is so much happen on the screen, very smooth playing on a variety of gaming machines including one that was a fairly dated backup machine used while my friend worked on his more current systemConsOnly four sets of maps, they take around 2 hours to complete at a moderate pace, and I would have no qualms playing them again, but more is always better.Not many weapons, the weapons each have a different play style to them and you can change them at several times during the game, but I just kept wishing there would be a few more hidden somewhereGore: for some this is not a con, for me, I wish I had a setting to drop it down a little. The game play was too fun not to play but other games have blood levels so why not this one? I know this is a dark genre within the fps genre, so no worries, I didn't knock off a star for this reason alone.No Tutorial: I have enough experience with games to  be able to pick them and just go most of the time, but other than a few directional hints on the map, there didn't seem to be much in the way of an introduction to someone new to gaming or the genre in generalLast tidbit: I am hoping this kind of cooperative game play is only the beginning and that we will see several more like it and see better cooperative options in other genres as well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2009"}

The Genesis and Dreamcast were great systems. The Saturn however, is not the same caliber of those two systems.If you've done your research on the system you know the Saturn had problems from day one. Sega decided to put two processors in the Saturn as a response to the Sony's announcement of the Playstation specs. This made development difficult, as a result, many Saturn games were inferior ports. Furthermore, they made a surprise launch (before the internet was popular)and no one was ready except for Sega. This simultaneously angered, retailers, developers, publishers, and consumers, simply put, the strategy backfired. In a nutshell, that is the problem with the Saturn. The system spent it's entire life trying to prove its superiority to it's competition, when in fact, the PS1 and N64 went on to be very successful systems.That is not to say that the Saturn is a bad system. I would never go that far. I do believe it has some redeeming qualities that make it attractive to the right kind of gamer. I am simply saying it lacks the universal appeal that its competition has. So if you want to see if the system is right for you continue reading:1 First party titles. Much like the N64, the best games on the system were developed (or at very least published) in house. It's really a sight to behold Vituta Fighter 2 running at 640x480/60fps and then seeing the Saturn buckle under trying to run some of the third party titles like Symphony of the Night. But even Sega had trouble with the Saturn, for a good example look at the original releases of Daytona and Viruta Fighter 1, they were re released later and look like someone put a new video card in the system. In general the first party titles run the best on the system. I'm not saying third party titles can't look good too, just not as much.2 Fighters. For whatever reason, fighters run particularly well on the Saturn. And of all the Capcom fighters in particular seem to run best of all. Darkstalkers and Xmen: children of the atom are very well suited for the platform. The fludiity of the animation, and the controls just flow in games like this. If you invest $40 in a 4MB Action Replay (think expansion pack for the N64) you can run games like Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter and Metal Slug and it really shows that the Saturn was mean to be a 2D powerhouse. It also helps that the controller is practically made for fighters.3 Imports. The action replay also allows you to run Japanese games. The Saturn was much more successful in Japan than it was here in the states, thus a lot more games were released in that region. As long as the Japanese text isn't an issue, you can get a lot of the games that never came here, or get the games that did come here significantly cheaper.The real problem I have with recommending the Saturn is that they are not only hard to come by but surprisingly expensive to collect for. Think of it this way. The PS1 is not only cheaper to collect for, but is also easier to get games for in general, it has some expensive/rare games, but there is more than enough quality software that is common. The Saturn has about the same size library that the N64 does but the expense and the difficulty finding games can be very prohibitive. Don't get me wrong, there are some gems to be had, but with digital distribution and services like XBLA and PSN re releasing older content. It's a hard system to reccomend.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2013"}

Xenosaga takes the top on my list of great role playing games.  This game will make a great addition to the serious RPG player's collection.The story is good enough for a movie screen play. Drama, comedy, suspense, and mystery are all present. It is unfortunate that most Americans do not see video games as a valid and serious medium for telling stories. Perhaps this game will change that mentality. By giving you the opportunity to take on the role of the main character, an RPG can immerse and involve you in the story in such a way that a movie can never do.Xenosaga is an epic story that starts off with the discovery of a mysterious golden artifact in Lake Turkana (The Jade Sea, supposedly the birthplace of man), sometime during our century.  The story leaps 4,000 years into the future, where man's technology has evolved to the point of being magic.  But still, humans have yet to unlock the secrets of the mysterious artifact.  To complicate matters, a very mysterious and lethal species of aliens, called the Gnosis, are trying to take the artifact.The central character is Chief Engineer Shion Uzuki, a brilliant young scientist working for an intergalactic corporation called Vector. The former project chief had died during a freak accident two years before.  Her assignment is to continue and finish the development of Vector's most ambitious project, an Anti-Gnosis humanoid weapons system called KOS-MOS.  KOS-MOS is the only weapon capable of fighting and defeating the ethereal Gnosis.  KOS-MOS is equipped with the Hilbert Effect, which sets off a wave that forces the Gnosis to materialize and take on a physical form.  At that point, she can finish them off with her powerful Triple Gatling Guns.  However, as the game progresses, it becomes obvious that the battle android is hiding many secrets from her human handlers.  Is this battle android simply a weapons system, or perhaps a totally new and unique form of life?In addition to controlling KOS-MOS, you have the option of using giant, mechanical humanoids during combat.  Those who have played Xenogears would feel familiar with the concept.  Anyway, controlling these mechs is the most fun aspect of the battle system.  You can customize your mech's weapons, armor, and abilities.  Weapons can range from the more exotic Gatling guns, grenade launchers, drill claws, gyro saucers, to the more traditional swords and axes.There are no random battles in the game, so you will not have to put up with that repetitive and distracting time-filler that you have to put up with in most other RPGs.  This is like a breath of fresh air after playing Final Fantasy X, where you could not walk for more than thirty seconds without triggering a battle.  With Xenosaga, you can see the enemies.  And, since the amount of Xenosaga battles are less, there is little to get in the way of the grand story.  However, if you really love to fight battles, then you will certainly have the option of engaging the enemies that you can see, or you can follow one of the optional battle-rich sidequests.This is easily the best RPG that this old gamer has ever played.  The main selling point being the epic story.  However, let me say that this game may not appeal to everyone.  It might not appeal to the more energetic gamers who care very little for strategy or story and instead mainly prefer to bash, hack, and slash at enemies every fifteen seconds.  And you do need to pay attention in order to catch nuances in the story and character interactions.  In addition, this is only part one of a six-part series, so do not expect most of the plot lines to be resolved at game's end.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2003"}

So here's my quick review:Pros:- Tron world is beautifully rendered.- Disk battles are pretty cool.- After a few hours into the game it does feel kind of cool/fun disk battling.- Fills in the story about Clu so ties in neatly with the movie.Cons:- After a few more hours however it begins to really get repetitive and you're about ready for the ending. It boils down to a mashup of 4 types of games interspersed with cutscenes: platform jumping, disk battling, light cycle riding, tank battling.- There are the odd platform jumps which require you to try a dozen times because it isn't obvious where or when to jump.- Stereoscopic 3D works and makes the Tron world come alive but it's unusable because the camera turns will make you throw up.Summary:It's worth playing to the point that you've experienced the 4 types of games, and then you can pretty much put the game down.The platform jumping will make you want to throw the controller into the screen.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000MUW98O","description":"InBurnout Paradiseplayers are treated to a rarity in the video games universe: a complete reinvention of an established franchise that equals, if not betters any of the previous games in the series. Yes, this is a large claim, but one that can be explained in a single phrase: Next-Gen Freedom.Driver's heaven is a wide open worldIn Paradise City even cars can fly.View larger.Go for broke in 'Marked Man' Mode.View larger.Nothing is off limits, even head-on crashes.View larger.Start a race any time with 'Easy Drive.'View larger.Although theBurnoutseries&#146; over the top mobile action has been its calling card since it ignited audiences on the PS2 in 2001, and later on the first generation Xbox console,Burnout Paradiseis the first game in the series that has been designed specifically for play on Next Generation consoles. This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Peace Daddy \"Eclectic ReflectionZ\"","summary":"The potential for so much more....","reviewText":"Being a longtime fan of the Burnout franchise since the beginning, I can't tell you how much I was anticipating this game. After releasing the horrible \"Dominator\" for PS2, I was hoping it was because they were spending all their time focusing on perfecting \"Paradise\" for the PS3. Unfortunately, that was not the case.To start out with, the graphics are amazingly smooth and may be the best of any racing simulator released as of yet. Even on a standard television it looks great, but hook it up to your HDTV and be prepared for an awesome visual experience. But where they've succeeded graphically, they really fell behind on the content and layout. Having to drive to Timbuktu and back just to find a race is ridiculous, and the customization that existed to a certain extent in previous installments is pretty much gone. On top of that, Crash Junctions are again non-existent, and instead we get the ability to just \"crash\" anywhere we want and proceed to bounce around all over the place, taking out transportation along the way. While this is fun for a while, it does get to be old, and lacks the extreme fun factor of, say, Burnout \"Takedown\" or \"Revenge\" with the actual Crash Junction setup. Should we see another installment of \"Burnout,\" we can only hope they bring these back.Also, it really boggles my mind what they were thinking when they set up directional markers on these tracks. There are none. All you get is a small little map and compass which are pretty much useless, and you're left with memorizing the tracks before you have a legitimate shot at beating them. Add to the mix the lack of multiplayer support except for online, and this title really disappoints on some key factors.Overall, while it is indeed a somewhat fun title, it does not meet the expectations so many had for it. Burnout \"Paradise\" disappoints on too many levels to make it a worthwhile buy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2008"}

It is rather refreshing to see a Mario game where the characters are not playing soccer to, say, free the twelve star maidens to chase Bowser away from the land, so they can party all night. This game is lacking any type of story, other then to win a tournament. It is full of out right hatred for the other players, and is quickly evident. The characters begin each match with a taunt, and then continue to bash each other around into electrical fences. (I really enjoy the sound of Daisy screaming as she hits an electrical Fence) It is the most fun I have ever had playing a soccer game.The basic play is you and a team of 5 others (Sidekicks) is on the field competing against another team of 5. It will take tackles, shells, and the Captain?s (main character) super striker move to beat this match.Over all this was a great game. Its graphics were not the best in the world, but they suited very well for this game. The one player mode was pretty fun, but where this game is best played in is multi-player mode.

I ordered an Xbox 360 directly from amazon, and not from another seller.Before I go into my experiences with the Xbox, I have to mention that I have a PS3 plugged into a HD Computer Monitor, with an HDMI to VGA converter. In fact, that leads me to the Xbox's first flaw: the normal A/V output is directly above the HDMI output, and you cannot use both at the same time, meaning that if I were to play a video game , I would have to play without audio. Fortunately, Microsoft has addressed this issue by selling a VGA HD AV cable...for $ 30! That is absolutely ridiculous! I bought a PS3 HDMI to VGA converter for $ 8!Secondly, a hard drive is not included with the Arcade version of the Xbox 360! The cheapest model of the PS3 slim comes with 120 GB! Another joke, if I were to buy an Xbox 360 with a hard drive, it would cost me the same as a PS3, which defeats the argument that the Xbox 360 is cheaper.The Xbox 360 is also far too large and comes with a huge power adapter, another design fail.The Xbox 360 controller runs with batteries! If you want a way to recharge your controller you need to spend extra!I've also heard complaints that the Xbox 360 is far too loud.To play games online with the Xbox 360, you need to pay for an Xbox Live Gold account! Of course, the online experience is faster and smoother than the PS3's, but still, I'd much rather it be free.Now, I knew all of this before I bought the Xbox 360, and really, I didn't care that much about these flaws. There are some great games exclusively for the Xbox 360, and for me it would have been worth buying if not for one thing that is the absolutely ridiculous...the Red Ring of Death. I didn't even get to play any games on the Xbox 360, the moment I turned it on FOR THE ABSOLUTE FIRST TIME (this is not a refurbished unit), I got the Red Ring of Death, and I am currently waiting for amazon to ship me a new Xbox. But making a console that is so badly designed and engineered that a person who turns on a new Xbox finds that the unit is completely defective and worthless is absolutely inexcusable! Save your money...if you must buy a console buy a PS3, if you already have a PS3, beware that the Xbox 360 features horrible design.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2010"}

The bookends aren't pewter or something, they're made of a weighty fiber, however, and look very nice. I honestly love them.The Sackboy doesn't look 100% like Sackboy as you would think he would, but from reading half these reviews, I thought he was going to pop out of the box having sprouted a second head. It is a cool looking piece of memorobelia indeed. And you can't go wrong with all the costumes. Things like that cost anywhere from $1-$5 to DL on PSN for these types of games which would set you back almost the extra cost of this CE alone.

{"product_name":"B00432O50W","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Not Just A Suda 51 Trip","reviewText":"Goichi Suda is one of my favorite developers in the game industry today. He and his Grasshopper Manufacture company have crafted some of the most unique and entertaining games of the past decade, such as the excellent \"No More Heroes\", \"Killer 7\", and the intentionally flawed \"Flower Sun and Rain\". Shinji Mikami's resume is no less impressive, creating and producing such genre-defining (if not genre-creating) games as \"Resident Evil\", \"Resident Evil 4,\" and \"Devil May Cry.\" Akira Yamaoka, while not a developer, is often considered to be one of the greatest composers in gaming, scoring the music for every \"Silent Hill\" game with the help of vocalist Mary-Elizabeth Mcglynn. \"Shadows of the Damned\" is what happens when all of these people unleash their unbridled creativity, and the result is as gloriously messy as you'd expect.Hot-blooded, Hispanic demon hunter Garcia Hotspur is pushed over the edge when his \"angel\", Paula, is kidnapped by Fleming, the lord of all demons. With the assistance of his talking skull/gun/torch/motorcycle companion, Johnson, Garcia sets out with the intention of saving Paula, killing Fleming, and creating their own \"road movie\". The plot doesn't thicken much from there, but boy, does it ever keep you entertained; expect many cracks about the size of Hotspur's \"Johnson\" and dialogue that repeatedly breaks the fourth wall.The type of immature humor would be irritating in anybody else's hands, but the saving grace is that Suda 51 knows how to nail this style of dialogue without getting annoying with it. It also helps that Shinji Mikami had a clear impact on the gameplay, which feels like a more fine-tuned version of \"Resident Evil 4\"'s over-the-shoulder shooter vibe which so many others have tried to imitate. With well-written jokes flying at you at a rapid pace in the middle of the game's intense action, it feels like the video game equivalent of having the perfect sandwich; these ingredients would be pretty good by themselves, but together they're freaking heavenly.Unlike those two things, though, Yamaoka's score would need no companions. It stands on it's own as a fantastically eerie and exhilarating piece of work, dipping into his own \"Silent Hill\" sound while also pulling off rock, salsa, and just about anything else you can think of. Players may find themselves standing still for a few moments just hear the tracks in more detail. His tracks with Mary-Elizabeth Mcglynn are also wonderful, and hearken back to their earlier work on \"Silent Hill 3\".But like any Suda51 game, \"Shadows\" isn't devoid of flaws. There are an irritating amount of technical hiccups which both frustrated and confused me, including but not limited to: hit-or-miss graphics, disconcerting amount of pop-up textures, lagging in menus, and occasional inability to spawn checkpoints, making it impossible to proceed without restarting the level. Also irritating is the lack of replayability due to the inability to start a new game with your fully upgraded weapons. These aren't the only issues, but certainly the most noticeable to me. These things, and more, are what kept me from giving this game a perfect score. It seems like the developers were too focused on the player having fun than being impressed with the technical aspects of their product.That would be an issue if they were trying to do anything else, but it's hard to fault one for wanting you have unadulterated fun, especially in the field of video games. With increasingly repetitive games such as \"Call of Duty\" flooding the market that take themselves so seriously, it's a relief that games with a great sense of what it means to have fun are making a comeback with \"Shadows of the Damned\" and \"Duke Nukem Forever.\" While those games aren't anywhere near comparable on an aesthetic or gameplay level, their goal to give gamers a brainless good time are almost one and the same.And that goal is what keeps me from picking on \"Shadows of the Damned\"'s tech issues, much like I was able to look past \"Forever\"'s lack of graphical horsepower. Grasshopper, Mikami and Yamaoka aimed for the player to laugh, to feel like badass, and to experience something that is truly memorable. With such a noble goal, and with such originality imbued in the experience itself, one would have to be pretty self-important to pass up one of the most fun games of the year.Plot: B+Gameplay: B+Graphics: BSound: A+Overall: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2011"}

And I will be honest.  I was pretty pissed about ODST.  You had an uninteresting main character.  Boring to OK fight maps.  It felt like a rushed game...on top of the Halo Universe.  Halo Reach seems even more uninteresting that Halo ODST.  I was shocked and let down.What are the gripes?  Where do I begin, there are so many.Before you say I am just entirely complaining. Actually, my main gripe is that the characters weren't that compelling.  The story wasn't that interesting.  The single player was too short.  I like Halo 3 and Halo 2. Those were good games.  ODST and Reach seem rushed.On the single player:+ The Bad:- No Master Chief or Cortana.  People are talking about the Halo Universe and there is more to Halo.  And this is what you give us?  A boring, dying planet.  No thanks.  These directors get all cute and force us to care about your completely new take on the store.  Master Chief and Cortana made the Halo \"game\" serious.  He was a bad ass character and to completely take him out from the game seems absurd.  Not only that.  But, you gave us some random character with no story.- No story:  You are a soldier, you kill the enemy.  Try to save the planet.  No real story, just shoot.  And maybe towards the end, the bring up some connection to the Halo Universe.  Boring.  Here is Master Chief?- Boring ODST style game play:  It is basically ODST.  Your mission consists of moving around the maps and they throw enemy at you.  Occasionally you have a couple of Hunters to kill.  Here come the drop ships.  Shoot at the enemy.  They huddle in the same area.  Kill them and move to the next area.I am not saying this is entirely bad.  But, I wish they mixed it up a little bit.  Besides the vehicle combat.- AI sucks.  They say the AI is better.  But really, it seems like the advanced AI characters just move around a lot and at a high speed.  And they have more health.  I don't know if that is advanced.  You can normally kill them through attrition.  Just sit of them, dodge and find as much ammo as you can.- Weapons still suck.  The weapons have kind of sucked sense Halo 3.  The enemy weapons are OK and much better than human ones.  But you still have some issues.  The pistol has 8 bullets.  I was hoping in some modern universe that the humans would put more rounds in their weapons.  Maybe they deserve to lose.  8 rounds for the pistol which is OK, but it takes two clips to kill anyone.  The assault rifle is still worthless.  32 rounds and you can't kill anything with it.  So you have about 600 total rounds.  I bet you only kill 3-4 enemy with all your ammo.- No scarabs.  They had 3-4? In Halo 3.  Why none in Reach.- No advanced modern FPS movement.  Like blindfire or hiding behind cover.  I know, I know.  This is Halo.  But, they added running and jet packs and space flight.  It sure would be nice if I could hide behind cover and/or sneak up behind the enemy (see Bad Company2, Gears of War, etc).- Let down because I thought I was going to be blow away.  When we heard about Reach, I was expecting a 20 hour single play with a bunch of replay value and a great story.  There is some replay value, but the single player is so uneventful.  What is the point?+ Good points- Great graphics, great environment.  Despite my issues with some of the game play.  The environment is pretty amazing.  The background and the landscape do look amazing- Some replay value for Single player with the \"skulls\"- Vehicle combat was pretty good.  Space combat, helicopter combat were nice.  If half the game was just space and helo combat, I would have been happy.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8M4","description":"It's often argued that Nintendo makes the best video games in the world,  but one thing the company isn't known for is scary games. If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster. While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C. Persia. And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Scott","summary":"One of the best survival horror games in its genre","reviewText":"This is an absolute masterpiece, and its on the level of Resident Evil, but infinitely more creative.

It is a perfect combination and both the game play and story are very well balanced in my opinion.PROSGreat story, amazingly perfect game play and quite a stable game.Voice acting, character models and scenes mesh perfectly with the over-all style of the game.The style is very creative and stands out as a unique game in a sea of the same old stuff these days.CONSThe graphics are not top notch; however this game was going more for style and stability.

Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Hours of fun","reviewText":"I'm a bit late in my review of this game but I'll try and offer my opinion as it's format has changed somewhat since former episodes. So I think you need to know what you are in for if you have played any of the previous FF games, because things have been shaken up a bitSo...it's Final Fantasy 12, set in some far off magical place, and our hero is the young wannabe sky pirate named Vaan. He's got girlish features and blond spiky hair, as well as a taste for adventure and justice for all. His childhood friend Penelo hangs around him and helps out, with a bit of mild scolding when necessary. Together they meet up with a band of unlikely friends and begin an epic journey across the land of Ivalice, searching for something which may just save the entire world from being crushed by an evil force. Okaaaaay... I could have written that in my sleep, it's so formulaic. Is there any other kind of plot for an RPG to have? Ah well, the plot of FF12 is not one of it's selling points. It's very standard, with no emotional highlights to challenge any seen in previous games in the series. So why five stars? Just for the sheer fun to be had playing it...Before you get stuck in, though, let me point out the few things that are probably going to throw you when you start playing. First of all, and most importantly, is the battle system. Now before you even get to this, know that you will start the game by playing a pretty long prologue sequence that features none of the main cast, and during this time you may not have a clue what you are doing. The prologue to me is a severe drawback to the game. As it features none of the important aspects of the fights that you'll be mastering in the main game, it's little more than a chance to run around and look at some nice scenery. The fighting style and battle commands are all quite severely unlike what you'll be handling in real play mode. I hadn't a clue what I was doing, I just lead my character around while non-controllable team members did all the work at killing enemies. There's really no options available for you to play with.Anyway, after a while this little prologue comes to a climax and we meet our real hero, Vaan. What the game does now is put you in a bewilderingly large town with all sorts of fetch and carry games that seem to drag on forever before you actually get to leave the city gates and fight something. Stay with it here, it gets pretty tedious, as there are dozens of NPCs with seemingly nothing important to say. But eventually, you are sent out of the city gates into the wide open space beyond! Now we're talking! Or are we? Well, it's still early days and as a lone fighter, Vaan's options are severely limited. You'll find out soon enough that FF12 does not have random battles. Monsters are right there on the screen walking around. Run over to one and if it sees you, it will attack. If you see it first, as soon as it's within range, a targetting line will extend from your character and point to the enemy, and this is your cue to start fighting. Choosing the simple \"attack\" option at this time means that Vaan will whack away at the enemy until one of you is dead. There aren't any other options apart from \"use item\" during this early level so you really can't go wrong. Oh well, unless you're like me, because here's where I messed up...you can't actually use your new and dynamic manouverability to dodge what the enemy throws back to you. If the enemy wants to land a physical attack, you WILL get hit, even if you are behind it or nowhere near it, and so the energy I put into running around the back of them or running to one side never resulted in me avoiding a hit -  it just doesn't happen. As in normal RPG procedure, if it's the enemys turn to go, you will just have to take the blow, and wait for your turn. You see, it's also somewhat turn based, as each attack move empties your active bar and you CANNOT hit the enemy as fast as your little thumbs can hit the attack buttom, like say in Zelda or something. Remember the filling active bar in Final Fantasy 7 battles? Well, it's like that, except that you can move the character around while it's filling. So is there anything worth moving about for? Well yes, in that if you really run away you can be far enough to be officially out of the enemy's range so that he has to catch you up before landing his blow, so in that sense you CAN hit and run away. But it's not the way you're expected to handle things. You're supposed to trade blows and heal when necessary like in all RPG's. It feels odd, but you will get used to it. The movement controls also get you across the terrain, of course, and a lot of the play areas are VERY large. Strategically, being able to see the monsters is also marginally useful as you can bait lone enemies or draw a single monster out of the vicinity of others. Running into a pack and then fighting four or more at a time will most probably kill you.Now that you are getting started, you may find out at this point that the game is really difficult in this early level. Vaan is totally alone, so every fight means you have to retire and heal yourself frequently. Because of the active time bar, if you use a turn of your attack to use a potion item, the enemy will continue bashing you for each turn it takes and you can be worn down to 0 HP very easily if you are not careful. Once a battle has begun, the enemy will not give up on attacking unles you run very, VERY far away. And it will still hit you while you're running, so it's better to finish them off sooner rather then later. You also don't get very much money. Money and items are not plentiful in this game. Take my advice and get the Cure spell as soon as you can, because in a pleasant surprise, your MP bar fills up naturally as you move about! Hooray! Actually I don't recall if you can even get the Cure spells in the early stages. Spells, like weapons and items, have to be bought in shops, and at the start no-one sells anything good (no surprise there). So be careful with those potions. And the only way to rest and heal is at save points, of which there are not may. But at least it's free (no more inns).After what seems an eternity, you finally get additional team members and the battle system proper starts to become clear. What you now need to learn about are Gambits. The way it works is this: You can pre-set all your team members with several battle commands, and list them by priority. So action 1 might be \"Attack nearest enemy\" and action 2 might be \"Heal anyone at less than 50% health\". With this set, a team member would attack everything seen in the field as soon as they came within range. Then, and only when there was nothing within range to attack, action 2 would come into play and anyone in need of healing would be attended to. By varying these commands you can build a team with someone as healing at top priority (who can then join in the attack as long as no character needs healing), a magic user (who can stop using magic as soon as they run out and do something else like use an Ether item), and so on. There are LOADS of Gambit commands and you can build complex chains of priority-based actions so that you know exactly how your team is going to behave and with plans for every eventuality. Now the reason for doing all this is that you only directly control ONE character at a time in battle. So while you keep control of Vaan, and make him run around and attack whichever monster you choose, you're going to have three other characters right beside you who all need telling what to do. This is what the Gambits are for. Without them, you'd have three people doing nothing until you take control of them one at a time and input a command for every action required. To do this for a whole fight would take far too long. Best to set up good, foolproof commands for the whole team and let battle commence. And then just step in if things get out of hand. So does this mean you just have to run towards the enemy and then sit back and watch the team do their own thing? Well, erm...yes. Well, just a bit. But take heart, it's actually very involving as you'll soon realise that no one set of Gambits will suit all occasions. And if you DO find one that seems to work most of the time, then give yourself a pat on the back for being a master planner. I found a good set of rules for all six character after many hours of play, and for most dungeon crawling, I could get them through it on this pretty much alone with only a few tweaks, for example where the majority of enemies in one dungeon are weak to ice magic, you set characters up to use Fire as a first priority. Then when you move to a new location you can soon work out what attacks and weaknesses you best need to react to, and tweak the Gambits as required. It's like being a strategy commander and seeing your hard work at setting up the plan of attack carried out do smoothly...I found it very satisfying.But that's before you get to... the bosses. Hold onto your hats here, because the bosses in FF12 really know how to beat you up. Chances are in many boss fights you'll be constantly jumping in to add new commands and switch off others that are not working. As well as manually grabbing control and making characters do the right thing before it's too late! The fun really starts here. Gambits can be edited DURING a fight! Not only that but weapons and armour can also be changed, and team members can swap in and out. Maybe that's why some of the bosses are so tough. Entering a boss fight and finding that it's immune to fire magic when you had two people set to to use that as a priority means you have to be able to jump into the menu and turn that option off, or swap out those two members, or at least give everyone ice-based weapons. And we haven't even started talking about status effects. The game has a lot of these and they can really spell disaster in a battle which might start well, but go horribly wrong when suddenly everyone is Confused or Petrified and you have no-one available to use the spells that remove them because they are all attacking. FF12 seems to have introduced brand new misery-giving bad statuses like Oil, Sap, Reverse, Immobilise and Disable to add to the already impressive list of woes like Blind, Silence, Poison and so on. A boss fight can be a very complex exercise in managing your strategies, so if you are the kind of player that likes action over planning, you might feel that this is a bit too much for you. Thank goodness using the menu button and making any changes within it happen pauses on screen action! Although the hardcore player can change settings so that the fighting never stops whatever you do, but I was not brave enough to attempt this.I've spent so long talking about the fighting, it's not left a lot of space for anything else. Well I will just add that the scenery and graphics are all very good. Dialogue is spoken for cut scenes, and is also well done. The six team members you have are all nicely defined as characters although you can make them all pretty interchangeable for battles as they don't tend to have any greatly different fighting traits. Stat wise, you work with a kind of giant grid, and points won for defeating monsters can be spent on various upgrades and abilities, so if your points are scarce, you'll probably give your magic users the best spells and for your fighters, the points can go on strength and weapon skills. Apart from these points to learn the skills and weapon abilities, you also need cash to buy the spells and equipment to suit how you are building your team, so there's a lot of stuff to do in the quiet moments to get these setting right. There's also the usual levelling up from fighting experience. Towns are often very large with 5 or 6 shop types in each one. The world map is massive, and although it's not totally free-roaming, every external area between towns or dungeons is explorable on foot and needs to be crossed at least once to reach anywhere new. After you get to a new place you usually open up a warp point (acting as a special type of save point), or in the case of a town there may also be an airship station. Both will allow you to jump to any previously visited locations, although it does cost money to do it this way, so if you want to save your cash, you'll be doing a lot of walking.And of course there are optional side quests, which range from very tedious fetch and talk quests, to seeking out entire uncharted places in search of optional bosses. Oh yes and there are also Limit Break type attacks to learn and Espers (summons) to search for. The biggest optional game is probably hunting for Marks (answering calls for help to kill one-off monsters from people all over the world), which get increasingly more difficult, especially if you try doing them too early, as some have more HP than bosses! But the rewards can be well worth it. You can also do other hunts for rare monsters to win trophies, plus a substantial amount of very small games that net you cash or weapons if you bother to do them - or even find them, as some of the side quests are very deeply hidden.This brings me on to one criticism; the game is non linear and you can go off exploring at anytime you see fit, which is great, but the game is not good at warning you if something is coming up that you are not ready for. Wthout notice, one corner of a dungeon will suddenly be full of monsters that are three times as strong as those just around the corner, or in other cases, one lone enemy in a large area will be able to flatten your entire team in one hit whereas all the other monsters are just knocking off a few HP with each hit. This is to be taken as a warning that you are not ready to be where you are, or to face this particular enemy, and you should turn and run, and come back much later in the game. Trouble is the game is so vast that you may be forgiven for thinking that this time is never going to come, and give yourself much grief over these incredibly tough encounters thinking that this is just how things are. Be patient though...you WILL eventually gain the strength and even the cripplingly hard Necrohol of Nabudis area will be a pushover if you just wait long enough.My only other gripe is that there are some non optional tasks that are equally as boring as the mini-games, such as the one where you have to roam around town and talk to people and pair them off, or where you have to get people's interest up by shouting within earshot.But enough of that. I have no other complaints...it's a huge game, well designed and very engrossing. Once you have finally nailed the battle system, you'll be on this thing for weeks.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2007"}

And so when I started playing this game I was in part amazed and horrified by the likeness which this game has with FFXI Online.  Chocobo's available for rent from towns, zoning, aggro, NM's, even the save crystals looked so much alike, airship docks . . . the only thing we were really missing was the Auction House.  Oh, and we did have the level grind, item hunting, mob camping, long arduous walks (made somewhat easier with teleport stones), and repeatitive battles.  We don't have wandering noobs, raise requests, gilsellerz, HNM camping, party seeking and the Dunes, so I guess it does make up for many things.  It does take a lot of the cooler aspects of the battle system seen in FFXI and uses it in here.  Weapons have different attack speeds, battles are very dynamic and can easily turn very chaotic.  But it does miss several things that just . . . well, made Final Fantasy games truly Final Fantasy.JOBSFirst off, the mesh between FFXI and FF Tactics seemed to have completely missed the job system.  I mean, it really just disappeared.  There are absolutely NO jobs or even really anything that indicates jobs other than the fact that Vaan starts out with steal (theif), Baltheir starts with a gun (corsair?) and Fran starts with a bow (ranger?).  The only way to indicate a job is by equipment really.  Since Penelo has the most MP, i give her all the Magic Power boosting gear, which turns her Melee attack into crap.  I stopped doing this after I realized giving her a sword was more effective.  Every character \"CAN\" adhere to a class, like not picking up spells for Vaan or Basch . . . but then you're just shooting yourself in the foot.  I'm sure any Thf/Nin would love to be able to cast all Blm and Whm spells without losing Utsusemi instead of saying \"but no . . . then i wouldn't really be just one job / subjob.\"So really . . . where did the jobs go?  Well, this game makes use of a funky looking chessboard grid system where you purchase the abilities, something similar to purchasing job abilities from the Tactics games.  The \"job\" specific abilities are sort of grouped along paths in the grid, in which most cases the characters start from somewhere in the middle of the grid and move outwards.  You purchase one square and the adjacent squares become available to purchase.  This system seems initially frustrating as you have to BUY the ability to equip a sword you were just given.  There's a tutorial that walks you through this.  Then it seems pretty cool and nifty.  And then it just seems pointless after you realize every character is exactly the same save for a few small stat differences, HP differences and MP differences.  Vaan can do what Penelo can do and Basch can shoot a bow just as well as Fran.  This is why I don't give this game 5 stars.  \"Oh, but reviewer, FFX was just like this too!\"  Yes you are right, in FFX you could also purchase the entire sphere grid for Tidus or have Yuna using Delay Buster . . . it just took longer and you couldn't do this from the beginning due to locked spheres.  In FFXII you can have all your characters be mirror images of each other from the beginning with just a couple hundred LP (liscense points).  FFX-2 had a great system of jobs (it's most redeeming quality) as well as FFV.  The last time we had a loss of jobs was in FFVIII where once again the characters could be copies of each other with time and effort and the use of the chocobo mini game (so that everyone could get Devour, Mug, Recover, etc).Along the line of Jobs, there's a lot of job abilities that are missing, like monk abilities, jump, mug, armor break, black mage focus . . . in fact other than spells the only real job specific ability is stealing.  When I heard this game was going to be set in Ivalice and be from the same creative engines as Final Fantasy Tactics, I expected jobs, a focus on them, the ability to change them.  I was excited to see another fully rendered dragoon armor!  I wanted to see white mage cloaks and blackmage hats and the pimp suit red mages get to wear!  Oh and dark knight armors, hehe, i was looking forward to this . . . but what?  What's this?  NO JOBS?  The game disappointed extremely in this area, but it redeemed itself enough in other aspects and overall fun, but first another gripe . . .SUMMONSThey are called Espers, like back in FFVI.  Oh, another thing a lot like FFXII, FFXI and like FFX was that the summons became actual members of the party.  Though there's a complete loss of your standard summons such as Ifrit and Shiva that have been around since the beginning.  Instead, the iconic names were turned into airships which are part of the enemy fleet . . . I thought it was kinda cool but then you really have no interaction with these standard FF icons.  The replacement summons are still very cool in appearancee and function, though only the latter ones are really worth using, because Summoning reduces your MP by 1/3, 2/3's or full 3/3's (depending on your Mist Charges).  When you summon, the characters all go away except for the character that summoned.  And only one character can summon the Espers EVER.  You cannot switch who \"owns\" them, once you buy them on the board, they are forever that character's esper.  Which can suck but at least it breaks up the cloning thing going on with the characters anyway.Graphics:Oh, boy . . . these are some good graphics.  Being someone who knows what awesome PC graphics are, has played PS3 and 360 enough to see the nextgen and has also played a Commodore 64, this game makes the PS2 look very good.  I can tell how they pulled off a lot of the graphical effects (very good quality textures).  But everytime I see the realtime rendering of Fran's hair, i'm still somewhat amazed at the PS2.  Yes the graphics are by far very good, very pretty and solid.  That aside, the look of the game is great as well.  You realy get a sense of the locations now that this game has full 360 degree rotation of the camera (like FFXI).  It's the first time any of the FF games had controllable camera angels.  Though I somewhat wish the controls were more like FFXI in terms of zooming and collision control.  When you get too close to a solid object, the camera moves way in and looks down on your character.  You have to walk away from the \"wall\" or change the camera position.  This can be frustrating when the camera moves with one person in combat and all of a sudden you can't see anything but the top of Penelo's head (she's got cute pigtails though).  This gives you the ability to see what's going on in these dynamic battles where your position can be very inmportant.  Being next to Penelo when she's casting a cura can be the difference between life and death . . . unless she's being targetted by a Fira spell in which case you may want to move away.  It's positioning like this that FFXI players will very easily know, others that have played the FF tactics games will also be somewhat familiar with area of effect.  Any D&D; player will think that it's about freaking time this was done.  Others who are used to the strict turn based, single or all target will find that it can be somewhat difficult to get used to the first time you encounter it.  Though the game is pretty good with easing you into things.  So keep your camera moving and make sure you know where you are.Audio:Audio . . . suffers.  The sound effects are great, the music is really cool and nostalgic, the voice acting is fairly decent . . . but the overall quality suffered.  I guess the game barely fit on the disc and one of the things they sacrificed was the quality of the sound.  The voices do not sound as clear as FFX or many other games on the PS2.  It sounded a lot like a radio broadcast recording.  In the beginning Penelo's voice was kind of annoying to hear, not because of the tembre or tone of her voice, but because it sounded like she was talking into a can.  Some of the smaller characters cast to the side have clearer sounding voice clips.  Overall the sound and music is great, but it's still missing a rung or two in bit rate.Other little things:Combat:Since it's open, you can see enemies before you encounter them, before you have to fight them.  You can get the jump on them or be surprised by them (sorta).  To escape, you have to actually run away.  FFXI players will be familiar with this.  Anyone who has played an action RPG will know this too.  Positioning is important, timing is important and so is function.  But, I found myself standing outside the zone where I knew an hunt was, and I was casting buffs on myself preparing for the upcoming battle.  That is the coolest part.  No longer do you enter combat and have to worry about casting protect and setting up defenses AFTER combat starts.  You can cast it between battles and be prepared before you go in.  Enemies do the same thing too.  So in a way, it does still have a lot of tactics in it, you have to devise strategies and know what commands to issue and when to issue them.  But you only control one character at a time and have to give out commands individually.  But don't fret because there are . . .Gambits:Since you only control one character at a time you're left to wonder what about the other two, right?  Well not so.  There's a system in teh game which lets you pre-program the other two characters on the battlefield.  The Gambit system lets you set a condition and an action to use when that condition is met.  Such as you're playing as Vaan and Penelo over there is shooting a bow.  When Vaan's health hits 50% Penelo casts Cure.  Or when Vaan gets blinded, he uses an Eye Drop item on himself without you even having to do it manually.  These gambits become available during a part of the beginning of the game, but once they do, use them.  They can also help remove the monotony of actions, such as attacking.  You can tell everyone to attack the closes thing they see, or just to attack when the party leader does, or just when they are attacked . . . or just when they see an undead, flying or enemy with sleep status.  You can do pointless ones too like have a character cast Fire when Vaan is under the effects of Stone (which will target Vaan with the fire) being effectively useless . . . but nonetheless capable.  The gambit system could have used a little more user friendlyness, such as a quick button to turn them on and off or memorized sets or even the ability to change equipment based on the condition.  Flying creatures are very annoying because you can't hit them with melee weapons: but then you usually can have 1 person with a bow or gun at all times.Ease:Perhaps it's just me since I'm a FFXI player and have no problem with level grinding . . . in which case FFXII is a dream come true with regards to level grinding . . . there's hardly any in comparison.  Though my brother, who doesn't play FFXI, found the need to level boring.  The game I found was very easy, especially if you find certain items.  I also hardly ever used Magic for attacking.  Instead I had about 6 gambits set up on each character for curing, buffing and removing statuses.  I equate this to the ease at which I found this game.  I'm sure that if you do not level grind you will find it harder and may be relying on Oil and Fire a lot more often, using the elemental weaknesses effectively.  One of the things that I did notice quickly was that one of the first creatures you encounter can totally rip you a new one . . . do not attack the T-rex looking thing in the Eastersand.  It's not aggressive to you and won't attack unless you do . . . and it will at lower levels just eat you quickly.But along the line of ease is the difficulty of obtaining powerful items.  A great armor called Dragon Mail lies in a cavern swarming with level 38 undead, in a chest that randomly appears when the region loads and then the chest has a small chance to actually award you the armor.  If you don't get it, you have to reload your game or leave the region (not just that area) so that the chest has a chance of spawning again, and then you can take you chance again at getting the armor.  Another item, the deathbringer, is a powerful sword that you have to steal from a creature that may or maynot spawn in an area with level ~40 creatures.  And then many items require you to sell items to the merchants in order to obtain, and this is the . . .Bazaar:This is the FFXII answer for the auction house?  Nah.  It's the games answer to crafting.  Really, it is.  You sell items to merchants.  When a certain combination of tiems have been sold to the merchants, a bazaar item appears.  You can purchase this item (which you don't know whati it really is at first).  There are no pictures of them and the names are like \"Matching Reds\" or \"Healing Packet\" or \"Forgotten Grimoire.\"  The bazaar gives you armors, items, special items and . . . some of the games most powerful items that you cannot obtain any other way.  And is there a way to know the combinations of these?  I haven't found it in the game telling me.  Well . . . every beastiary entry has a second form in which there's another page for the monster.  This second entry (after you defeat enough of the given monster) tells you a little about the world and hints on bazaar combinations.  So wading through these is like going through an untitled, unorganized encyclopedia without an index . . . or like trying to find obscure facts out of Wikipedia without a search feature or organized browsing feature.  This is where online guides will really help you out if you really want these items.  But you may find that some of them will bey VERY hard to get because you sold all of this one item and the bazaar resets the item's count after buying any item that required it, no matter if it only required 1 High Arcana, all 8 that you sold will be \"gone\" and Tourensol will be that much further from your grasp.Strategy Guide:I suggest just picking one up because there's a WHOLE LOT of this game you probably won't understand or even see.  This includes the afore mentioned bazaar combinations.  My brother is amazed at the number of quests that I have taken on.  The only quest system that the game really introduces you do is the Hunt system.  The concept of quest hunting is somewhat lost on him and probably will be on other players.  When Treasures of Aht Urghan game out, I talked to every NPC in the new areas just looking for quests.  I did that in Rabanastre, Buhjerba and Archades as well . . . it just came natural.  The quests are somewhat repetitive, at least the hunts are.  They just ask you to go and kill a monster.  That's about it for the hunts.  Sometimes there's a puzzle to getting to the monster, or a trick to get it to pop, but it's basically the same.  You fight it, defeat it, and return for the prize.  Plus the guide also tells you what's on the board, so when you happen upon a Deathbringer, Dragonmail or Demonsbane you'll know where to go on the board to purchase the ability to equip those items instead of guessing the direction these above average items are.Who will like this game?  Most any avid FF fan probably already has it, so I guess I'm speaking to those who are just looking at it and wondering if it's worth the hype and wait that the rest of us have had to go through.  I would say that you will probably like it.  My brother really likes it.  My mother likes watching my brother play it.  It's very different from the other FF games, so very different that you could hardly call it FF anymore.  There's iconic figures, moogles, items, spells, weapons, but the game play is so different from the other games (other than FFXI).  The dynamic battle system is something none of the other single-player FF games have done.  If you've ever steared from FF games becuase of the turn-based systems then I say you've missed out, but you might find that this installment in the series that never seems to live up to its name just might be something you'd like.  I'd recommend renting it at least.For those that know FF and have just been holding back becuase you were afraid that this game was going to be so different you'd hate it, well it is but you'll still like it.  It's just barely enough FF to be FF and still is a somewhat refreshing difference.  We thought FFX gave us a very different combat system, it was dynamic and different . . . but this really blows any other system change out of the water.  If you thought the difference between FFVI and FFVII was big, the difference between this game and the rest of the series is HUGE.But then I'm an avid fan, so yeah . . . I was in line at 12am to get my collector's edition.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00005B8FZ","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"Perhaps a strange choice for a launch title, but fantastic nonetheless","reviewText":"The Gameboy Advance is unique in the Nintendo catalogue as being a system without an original Mario title.  Barring the abysmal failure of the Virtual Boy, the lack of a Mario title has never occurred before or since.  Much like a person without a country, a Nintendo without a Mario just feels adrift and cut off from the rest of the gaming universe and real time gamer economy.Of course, one could argue that Mario IS Nintendo.  To remedy the lack of Mario, instead of developing an original game, instead Nintendo elected to issue the \"Super  Mario Advance\" series, which are simply remakes of pre-existing Mario side scrollers.  There were four total.  Although disappointing that we never got a real Mario game for the Gameboy Advance, the Advance series holds its own as great portable Mario fun, although this strength is primaly found in the original games themselves.Although probably not a concern now, years after the fact, if you have a Gameboy Advance and you are looking to purchase one of the Mario Advance titles, you may be better served with one of the other, longer games.  If you are not familiar with \"Super Mario Bros. 2\", the game is twenty levels long, and can easily be beaten within an hour if you are speed-running or even if you are taking your time.  If you want longer play time then I would probably go with \"Super Mario Advance 2: Super Mario World\".However, for those who love the Mario series and \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" in particular, this is a fine remake, even with all the changes from the original game.  Given the age of this remake, unless you want to experiences the changes for yourself, you may be better served picking  \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" up in some other regard, such as a digital form or the 2010 \"Super Mario All-Stars\" remake for the Wii.Beware of one change.  The voices.  Oh God, the voices.  They are horrendous.  All four have been given voice acting.  These sayings get grating, to say the least.  Almost to the point where you want to play the game without audio, it's that bad.\"Super Mario Bros. 2\", for those unfamiliar with the game, is the most drastically different of the four 8-bit Mario titles.  Mario defeats enemies by  picking either them or vegetables up and throwing said enemy/random vegetable at other enemies.  The story is that an big green final boss named Wart has taken over the World of Dreams (called Sub Con), kidnapped the citizens of Sub-con, and has taken over and styled himself as king.  It is up to Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Princess Toadstool to overthrow Wart and restore order.  There are seven worlds total, with three levels per piece and the final world having two levels, for a total of twenty.The enemy roster for \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" were almost exclusively limited to this game in the first few years after its release, with only Bob-Ombs appearing in the follow-up, \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", and Ninjis appearing in one level of the SNES \"Super Mario World\".  However, in subsequent years, enemies from \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" have become main-stays in the Mario universe and also appear in numerous spin-off titles.  Notably, however, the four bosses, Mouser, Tryclyde, Fryguy, Clawgrip, and the big baddie Wart have never been seen or heard from since.  Unlike Fawful from the RPG series, Wart is not very distinguishable from Bowser - they're both big, green reptiles.  Still, I would love to see a return of Wart and the other bosses!Strangely enough to some (Gamespot in particular), Nintendo's ingaural release in the \"Advance\" series is a remake of \"Super Mario Bros 2\" from 1988.  Yes, pretty much everyone who is a fan of Mario and Nintendo know SMB2 was originally released in Japan as a Famicom Disk System title called \"Yume Kojo: Doki Doki Panic\" and originally featured non-Mario characters; it has since been revealed by Nintendo that \"Doki Doki Panic\" actually began development explicitly as a sequel to the original \"Super Mario Bros.\", even before \"The Lost Levels\", but they were having issues with the prototype and ultimately released \"The Lost Levels\" as the followup.  However, Miyamoto and company always intended \"Doki Doki Panic\" as a Mario title.  Miyamoto has even stated in E3 2012 that, next to the original, \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" is his favorite Mario game.  High praise indeed.That being said, how does \"Super Mario Advance\" stack up as a remake?  Well, those looking for a straight port will be disappointed - \"Super Mario Advance\" contains the most changes to the original game of all four \"Advance\" games.  We will get into the changes momentarily.First off, you should know the game is based heavily off the version of \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" found on \"Super Mario All-Stars\".  Although gameplay was untouched in \"Super Mario All-stars\", all four games (\"SMB\", \"Lost Levels\", \"SMB2\", and \"SMB3) were given extensive graphical and audio upgrades, with \"SMB2\" being the most drastic.  Nintendo has taken these upgrades several steps further, touching gameplay in addition to the cosmetics.Like \"Super Mario All-Stars\", the original NES title is not included.  I wish they had included the original as an unlockable, like they did with \"Metroid - Zero Mission\" and the original \"Metroid\".  Although now available on the Wii and Wii U Virtual Console, at the time of this game's release that was still several years away.  The only way to play the original NES title in 2001 was either an emulator or a working NES.Here are the following changes:-In a precursor to Comet and Star Coins found in all \"Super Mario\" titles between 2006-2012, there are five Ace Coins hidden throughout each level, which, when collected, put a star on the level map and yield a 1-up-Player begins with only one heart, as opposed to the original two hearts.  An extra mushroom appears in every level, taking the total heart count from four to five.-Hearts (which restore health) appear much more often than in the original.  Hearts can also be pulled up from the earth and are called Heart-Radishes.-The intro to World 1-1 has been redesigned, including a giant Shyguy and a hill that bounces the player when stood upon-The jar interiors feature new music tracks and have been completely redesigned, featuring Shyguys riding Ferris Wheels.-Some 1-Ups have been moved from their original locations.  Others are encased in bubbles sitting on the ground, which the player must throw three items to break the bubble and obtain the 1-up.-The game now strangely features points like the original \"Super Mario Bros.\".  If you get enough points by hitting multiple enemies with a single vegetable you are awarded an additional 1-up.-Giant vegetables, enemies, and POW blocks are now present.  Carrots have also been added as a new vegetable platform, but only appear in two levels, and the Red Shells are much larger.-After defeating Wart, two Yoshi eggs appear in Sub-Con in all twenty levels.  Just like Pokemon, you gotta catch `em all!There are also numerous aesthetic changes as well.The biggest change of them all (at least in my estimation) is a brand new boss called \"Robobirdo\".  A robotic version of Birdo, this boss is a giant machine that now acts as the final guardian of World 3, replacing Mouser.  As of 2012, \"Super Mario Advance\" is the only appearance Robirdo has made in a Mario game.This new boss is easily the best addition/deviation from the original game.  Notably, the original second Mouser Battle that originally ended World 3 has been shuffled to World Six, replacing Tryclyde.  As a result, Mouser still appears twice (just like the original NES \"Super Mario Bros 2\") and Tryclyde has been reduced to only one boss battle, which occurs in World 2.In retrospect, \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" does feel as a somewhat strange choice as a launch Mario title for the Gameboy Advance in 2001; however, the game proved to be a best seller and a Player's Choice as well.  If you love Mario then I highly recommend you get this.  You will greatly enjoy yourself.  For those few gamers who are considering investing in the Advance series and HAVE NOT PLAYED \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" in any of its vast incarnations, most likely you will find the game entertaining as well, if a tad different from the \"traditional Mario formula\".","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0050SX7BQ","description":"","reviewerName":"McShopper \"Kevin\"","summary":"Different type of Game that I truley enjoyed","reviewText":"This is a &#34;different&#34; type of game, the game play is similar to Heavy rain, but I really hate to compare it to heavy Rain as besides the concept of real time events thought the game it is its own stand alone game. The battle scenes are a new take on how action is played in this type of game. The best way i can describe this game is that it is an interactive movie, that has several outcomes depending on the choices or actions you make. The Game is about the life of this girl who has a spirit tethered to her. The spirit and her work together to sold puzzles, fight, explore. It is a hard concept for me to put into words, and this story is very Sci-fi so anything I say will sound really weird. The story is told over a timeline, that bounces all over the place, You start off as a teen, then go to a 4 year old, then to an adult and back to a kid, each telling bits of the story of her life. As the story bounces around the time line, it really works well. Very well written and flows very nicely. I am seeing all type of mixed reviews on this game. All I can say is I really enjoy the game, and more I really enjoyed the tech behind the game, the voice acting, and knowing how long it took to put this game together. The actors did an excellent job. The game is relatively short, only about 10 hours, but the whole time I played I was making mental notes, of &#34;next time I want her to respond this way, or I so want to find out if I did this what would happen&#34;.If you enjoyed Heavy Rain (I played that game at least 6 times) I think you will enjoy &#8220;Beyond&#8221;. There is a great mix of storytelling, battles and a lot less down time that you had to go through with Heavy Rain. And although it was a short game, I think it was just the right length. If it went on much longer I think I would have lost interest and I doubt I would go back to replay it. Now I cannot wait to start the game over to see how I can change some things in the story.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SX7BQ","description":"","reviewerName":"W. freeman","summary":"An Honest Review An Acquired Taste","reviewText":"If you were a fan of Heavy Rain you'll probably be a fan of this game, just maybe a little less and in a more frustrating way. The storytelling while great isn't really a problem at all, most know the story of Jodie and get the basic premise of her and her supernatural friend just by playing the demo. But yes playing the full game obviously is the only way you can get the full story of course. I had a lot of store credit so I decided to use it towards this game since nothing really interesting IMO is coming out anytime soon. Heavy Rain was a breath of fresh air if you like interacting with an animated movie. This game is much the same. You do get \"some\" and I do mean very little chance to roam around without having quick time actions involved. Does this get old? Well yes and no. The controls are what I would call, using the word wonky. When you first starts especially with fighting, training and dodging it can be a real headache. Shake the controller, which doesn't always respond. Hit x and move the control stick (though which one?) during a slow motion sequence. I think you get the point. Heavy rain seemed much more refined and less hectic in it's controlled movements.Graphically this game is far superior than about any game I've ever seen on PS3, and even some that i've seen on a high end gaming rig. That says a lot for PS3 and the question do we really need a PS4, with games like this? So basically you run through this girls life interacting with people trying to find out different aspects of the question why? Which I won't get into spoilers etc. Lets just say a lot of it is very engrossing, some of it is just annoying. When you move as the entity Aiden if you \"literally\" get motion sickness then you definitely want to steer clear of this game. Moving through walls, cars, people, and about everything you can while floating through the air while fun, is also very very sloppy. When you have to hold L1 and L2, hit buttons to make things move/or possess people it's not full proof. And sometimes very tedious. One example is when knocking over a vehicle it will pin point where/what you need to hit with a blue dot. It took about 10 minutes for me to finally get it in the right spot to flip it. Frankly because when I would try it just did not work. The same with many other scenes that come at you 100mph and you have to react. If you get it wrong you don't die, the story continues, but that may not have been the action you wanted. Sound more like a pain in the rear than a fun game? Well yes it's mostly true. Also I will mention the acting is superb, also with Willem Defoe as the creepy doctor he's very good.But there is something endearing about going on the journey, and frankly more engrossing about it than Heavy Rain. I walked away from the game only to have it on my mind a few hours later. So I give it points for that. But overall I still prefer games like Drakes Fortune, The Last Of Us, Killzone, among other PS3 titles. This is a breath of fresh air for those who want a movie based game (to interact with) more so than a controllable game with just cut scene interactions. So don't buy this unless that's your cup of tea. It's not for everyone. Much like games for the wii people seem to sometimes/most times, want to just sit back take the controller and play. So remember before you drop 60$ on it. Am I sorry I did, well yes and no, I played the demo, so I wanted to continue and find out more. Much like the trailer from an interesting looking film. But it's no loss for me. It is what it is, and it's something new rather than the same ole FPS games. Which are getting older and older fast.In summation, fun yet tedious, exciting yet exhausting, can literally cause you to be sick (don't play if you have seizures or severe motion sickness issues). You be the judge, I'm just a partial jury. Thanks.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2013"}

The reason is that in Little Big Planet, you can can create your own levels very easily, and then share them with the world instantaneously.You don't want to create levels?  Well, that won't stop you from hopping online and playing the millions of levels being created and ranked by other users.  In these levels you can make anything you want.  You can use your playstation eye to bring in pictures of the kids, or pictures of little monsters you want to create for your world.  You can take your pictures and plaster them on the scenery, put your kid's head on a billboard, tree, wall, you name it.Further, the actual game is really well done.  You can play by yourself and have a great time, you can have a friend or your kids jump in and play, or you can connect to people online and play with up to four people.  They make this even more fun by creating areas in levels that you can only go to if you have someone there to help you.  You can still get through every level alone if you want, but if you want to get all of the hidden items, there are times you'll either pull in a friend, or you can even just pull in someone randomly online to help you through those portions.Item gathering is also fun, and there are COUNTLESS items.  So what do the items do?  Well most of them are items that you can use to create your own levels.  So sometimes you'll get a sticker, which has a funny face on it that you can then resize, spin, flip, and stick anywhere in the environment (even during standard game play).  Some items are pieces of your outfit, ie you can gather all of the pieces to make yourself look like a lion, or zebra etc...  Some items are actual things, like tree leafs that you can then attach anywhere in the environment, even during standard game play.  Some items are objects that do things, like a rocket car that has a button on it that you jump on and then the car rockets off.  There are probably 30-150 items in every level, and I believe there are 60 levels.  PLUS, you can create your own items and then make them objects that other people around the world can collect and use if they play your levels.It's hard to fully describe Little Big Planet, because it does so much and so much is included in this game.  Let's just say the game is 100% fun, 100% unique, and while all of this may sound daunting, it's actually very easy to jump in and play.  I played about 3 hours of Coop with my six year old son last night and he picked it up with ease, and I had more fun playing this game with him than I have with any other game.  The Co-op elements in this game are just really fun to play.  So don't walk, RUN to go out and get this game for you, or your kids.  It's great fun for all ages, and I can count on my hand the number of games that are TRULY fun for all ages.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2008"}

It was incredibly fun, very replayable and had a wicked sense of humor. Lego Star Wars II is just as fun, and covers Episodes IV-VI!It's very rare to find a game that kids can play, adults can play, and everybody truly loves it. This is one of those games. I'm sure kids enjoy the game quite a lot - but pretty much every adult gamer I know loves this series as well. It's fun, it has classic scenes from the Star Wars movies done in a VERY funny style, and you can keep replaying it. You can play it with friends! You can unlock new episodes, new ships, new characters, you name it.The first thing you notice when you enter the \"Cantina\" is that now you can MAKE NEW CHARACTERS!!! Yes, you can mix up Darth Vader's head, Princess Leia's torso and a stormtrooper's pants. You can mix pretty much any character you find in the game, and give them personalized names! Then you can bring 2 of your creations into the game with you on free play mode. Talk about fun!!The game gets even better. Yes, you work through all the classic scenes - Luke buying the droids, the Death Star blowing up, and so on from the \"first 3 movies\" (in release order at least). The cut scenes are VERY funny. Being able to play along as the various characters is amazingly fun in story mode, and even better in \"free play\" when you can randomly switch between a variety of characters to find all the hidden items.I love the stud finding system. You want more money? Just replay a mission a few times. You can get all sorts of fun \"cheats\" (not cheats, really, but fun add-ons), you can buy new characters to use, and much more. It really gives you incentive to keep playing.Is a youngster in the house having trouble playing? Just have an adult pop into the game for a while to help out, then the adult can pop out again, to let the child keep playing! It is just brilliant. I love this game.The graphics are superb, as last time, with little lego movements seeming just right. Their swaggers and sliders are incredibly funny. The sound, of course, is the real movie soundtrack and is superb. You couldn't ask for anything better.Even the tiny touches are funny. If C-3PO starts getting hit, he loses an arm, then another arm, then a leg. You have him hopping along valiantly behind you, trying to remain with your team. Chewie rips off arms from stormtroopers.Now of course, there are always a few things the game designers get wrong. While Chewie's arm-ripping is quite funny, it is REALLY annoying when he does it - very slowly - in the middle of a firefight when you wanted him to be blasting away. The characters automatically switch into close combat mode if they think someone is nearby, even if you really needed to fire away at someone with the blaster. Even more annoying, if you're blasting away at \"destructables\" (wall items, whatever) and your friend gets near you start bashing on him!The camera is also really annoying. You get a *slight* amount of view control, but not much. When you are craning around trying to find a mini-kit on the screen and the camera keeps swooping wildly exactly where you do NOT want to look, it can get very frustrating.Still, these are minor problems in a game that is so stellar. I highly, highly recommend this game for any gamer of any age. It's incredibly fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2006"}

The story mode if you wanna call it that was set up in 12 episodes like a reality TV show which you can either take as pretty lame or cool but it doesn't make an impact on the game so it didn't matter to me. Split/Second revolves around taking out opponents with environmental explosions and it varies from head to head races or survival races where you have to avoid exploding barrels or missiles shot from a helicopter. Also there's timed races which I found frustrating but not a big deal. Split/Second has good ideas but they seem to have run out around episode 6 because it becomes redundant and stale.

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

The ability to make your character Good or Evil was fun albeit pretty generic, also the voice acting is pretty lame. But thats it! The game feels like your playing a awesome comic book that you can't put down, the story line is fun and original and the conclusion of the game is satisfying. If you have a PS3 you have NO excuse for not having this treasure in your library, BUY it now...

{"product_name":"B000ZKDOV2","reviewerName":"Marvin Powell","summary":"Grand Theft Auto IV: The Non-Suck Version","reviewText":"Saint's Row 2 is just about everything fans of the original could've asked for, and more! Right off the bat, you'll notice just how many improvements have been done over the original. You start off in a coma, and you're asked to either re-create your guy from the last game, or make someone new. And this time, you can have a girl play as Stilwater's legendary gangster! You can go around the 'Saint's Row' equivalent of Chicago as a male or female.The character customizations have been far expanded, and rival that of another THQ franchise, The \"WWE SmackDown! Vs. RAW\" series. You can fine tune just about any facial feature to your liking, and once the game starts, you can buy your way up to owning cool clothes, which are far superior to the first game's clothing options. Even in Sloppy Seconds, you can customize color, material, and style of your clothing. Of course, keep in mind that Sloppy Seconds has some pretty awful clothes, too! I had my guy back in Saint's Purple in no time! The women's clothing is far less appealing though, although maybe I just haven't unlocked the hot Victoria's Secret wear, yet. The character cutomization truly is more advanced this time around, but a little bit of things irk me in the customization.For example, you can't choose height once again in your character. In the first game, the Protagonist was way too short. About 5'6\" or so. In this, he's kinda too tall. Maybe 6'1\" or 6'2\", but he (or she, as females have the same towering height as your men) completely towers over everyone else in town. Also, the body options are kinda weird. It's like, you can only choose a body \"type\" for them, like obese, or thin, and you can't fine tune things, like their stomach or chest. For women, their breasts are kind of too pointy. For men, their body shape is kind of odd, with big arms and a slightly disproportionate body (assuming your guy isn't an obese fellow). Some things are kind of too in-depth (like ear customization, for example. Who cares about ears?) While the body customizations could've been more expanded. Also, the \"Personality\" features aren't as in-depth as I was hoping for. Basically, you choose voice, walking style, compliment taunt, and insult taunts. The voices are basically White, Black, and Hispanic male and females. The White guy voice is British, probably because the game developers are also, British, and they wanted a local guy in there. I'm guessing most people will end up using the Black Male voice or White Female voice. The gender equality goes beyond your main character though, and also shows up in the gangs, too, as before, only about 10% of your enemies were female, as now it's about 40% of women in the enemy gangs. And it seems like the entire police force seems to made up of women, which is a little odd.When you actually begin, you start off with a prison break, and get access to the newly expanded fighting system. While very simple to use, it's actually quite hard to master, and I like that. Basically, you can punch two different ways, do combos, and block. There's other things you can learn later too, like the new Human Shield option, where you can toss people acorss streets like they're only 10 pounds light. Of course, this is just for your basic fighting style. You'll learn new ways to brawl later in the game, as well! You also now also pick up inanimate objects like cinderblocks, trash cans, or virtually anything, and use them as makeshift fighting weapons. Your non-firearm weapons have greatly been expanded, and the variety of different melee weapons rivals that of San Andreas. However, in this game, you can make much cooler use of them! I stongly suggest once you hit the streets of new Stilwater, to find a Ronin gang member and steal his or her katana blade. That thing rocks! Both objects and newer melee attacks are also available in Grand Suck Auto IV, but Saint's Row 2 makes much better uses out of all of them! It's a complete no contest here in which game's are better. With weapons, all your favorites are back, and the annoying habit of constantly having to switch out guns for ammo to get different ones that have been taken off of your enemies is gone! Because now, we have dual-weilding, baby! Your guy or girl will be able to shoot out two Vice 9's, at once, now, and do it like the pro they are! Unlike San Andreas, you won't have to level up skill points to earn advanced weaponry weilding because the game assumes your guy is already a master of the firearms from the first game! I love how convient Volition are! They're willing to cut the crap (like having to swim miles to make it to shore) and just give you the fun gaming goodness you want from the get-go! When you deal with explosives, if you're too close to the blast, it'll blast out your character's ear drums and they'll be temporally deaf! It's a nice touch with really shows you how much explosives can mess your character up! Saint's Row 2 also gives you Autosaving, so if your game freezes on you or the power goes out, you can start off from the last mission or activity you completed. Autosaving at first doesn't seem to useful, but once an unexpected something DOES happen to you or your game, you'll be so glad it's there! I made it to Lv. 6 of Drug Trafficking and didn't save any of it when my 360 shut down on me. But with the Autosave feature, I was able to restart from the end of Lv. 5 and not lose a thing! It's such a great and convient feature to have!Once again, you'll have to earn respect to do new missions, but the Activities now are a lot more fun, and many of the lame ones from the first game, except the stupid Insurance Fraud ones, which I've always hated, are gone. Activities are now divided by Diversions (the lesser, old Activities) and the true \"Activities\" now are the ones that take much longer time to complete, such as Chop Shop and Hit Man, which once again make a return. I hopped in a car with my girl and immeadially started a Drive-By activity on some Sons of Samedi. Now, in the Diversions, there are six levels instead of eight, and for some, you can continue up to each level without interuption. I didn't even know I was on Level 5 in Drive-By until I actually checked up the top of the screen. The new diversion activities are awesome. \"vehicle Surfing\" is tricky but fun, until you fall of the car, that is! In \"Trail Blazing\" you get to race to a checkpoint all while on fire, blowing up cars on impact and lighting people on fire, earning time. It's sort of a mix of Mayhem and Racing, and it's very fun. \"Fuzz\" is the Stilwater equivalent of Cops and you get to play as the all-around corrupt police officer, hurting people breaking the law, and getting good and violent footage for the TV show. By the further levels, it gets really fun and interesting, like stopping a Pirate-Ninja war! \"Crowd Control\" has you playing as a celebrity bodyguard, stopping mobs of crazy fans from hurting your client! Depending on the level, you can trhow people into chopper blades, toss them into attack dogs, crush them with a bulldozer, cram them into an airport security x-ray machine, or chuck em into an oncoming el train!There are more ways to earn respect now, too. Inspired by the Balls Meter from the \"Scarface: The World Is Yours\" game, you can now earn respect by doing ballsy things that Tony Montana did in his game, like driving in the wrong lane of traffic and taunting bad people like cops and gang members, and also now pimps and hoes, who are now official \"enemies\", as well. The only thing missing is the ability to yell at people who crash into your car while driving. Just don't get TOO much respect before using it up on missions, though, as after Lv. 99, your respect is Infinite, and that sort takes all the fun out of it, having Infinite respect and all.The new Stilwater is a much darker, depressing place than the old Stilwater, which is ironic considering that the old Stilwater was probably much more violent. It's about 50% larger, and the new places are less inviting to you than you'd think they'd be. They clearly don't like your kind around there. The new gangs have a bit more unity than the old ones did, and respect each other's territories, leaving the endangered Third Streets Saint's pretty much their only common enemy. Many parts of old Stilwater have been rebuilt by Ultor's multi-million dollar city renovation. With Ultor Corporation owning Stilwater and turning it into a bleak metropolis for the Upper Class and snobby, you'll have the incredible feeling of both familarity and newness, all at the same time. Some old, favorite neighborhoods will look familar, but will be dark, barren and full of bums and prostitutes. Others, such as the humble Saint's Row, have been completely taken over! Seems like at least 20 years of change since 2006, though, when our old familar Stilwater was Ultor-free. Only a few list of people actually return for the sequel, but luckly, it's all the ones you would want to see return, including your best pal, Johnny Gat. Also in Stilwater are the new gangs. They also follow the same trend of having a Drug gang, a street punk gang, and a Corporate Business gang. Taking the place of the Latin Los Carnales, the Caucasian Westside Rollerz, and the Black Vice Kings are the Haitian Sons of Samedi, the Caucasian Brotherhood of Stilwater, and The Asian Ronin. The fourth, \"unofficial\" gang are the Ultor Corporation, themselves, and they run pretty much everything in new Stilwater, including all of the police. The Ronin are probably the deadliest gang, as they all carry katana blades and chase after you on high speed motorcyles, which comes off as a lot more vicious and scary than the standard street car pursuits the other gangs do. I won't say too much, but there's a little bit of \"Kill Bill\" as you progress through the Ronin storyline. They're definitely the best to take on out of the three. The Brotherhood of Stilwater are basically just giant-sized bullies. They're all very large people with even bigger vechiles. They like violence just for the sake of it. The weakest gang has to be the Sons of Samedi. Bascially, all they do is sell \"Loa Dust\" (a kind of cocaine you smoke out of broken lightbulbs!) to college students. They're all very easy to take out and all of their vechiles are pretty weak. With these new gangs though, comes new vehicles, such as bikes, boats, and planes. They're all just about as cool, if not better than the selection in GTA: San Andreas. There are also plenty of new cars, including three new ones that put classics like the Zenith and the Attrazione to shame. Even though they're now a lot more common in a Stilwater that caters to the heartless and corporate republican Upper Class, you'll probably want the three new luxury/sport cars even more. They are the 'Hayate Z70', the Ronin's offical car, the 'Bezier', which is like a MUCH better Attrazione, and the 'Superiore', which is like a Lamborghini Countach. Just don't own more than two of each or else, you'll ruin their rareness of owning them.The graphics, which I've yet to mention, are incredible compared to the old game, and yet, still have that Saint's Row \"toony\" look to them. They almost rival GTA IV in their beautiful lighting effects and such. Saint's Row 2 now, also like GTA IV, has the \"blurring\" effect of when you go too fast in a car or quickly turn the opposite way while running. The beauty of the new Saint's Row really makes you appreciate your 360. Name-brand artists are now featured for the music. No longer any obsure, underground third-rate Hip Hop stars. Arguably, it's a better sounding soundtrack than Grand Theft Auto IV (At least in the Hip Hop department, anyway). This time, when you listen to the radio, it actually sounds like you're listening to the *real* radio, thanks to the more mainstream artists and songs. The one thind thing that sucks though, is there's only about half the number of songs on this game compared to the original. There's also no more custom playlists, either. Instead, you get your own radio station to replace your old audio player. But at least the music is from people like 50 Cent, Nas, Fat Joe, Joss Stone, and Kelis. They're not my favorites, but I know people out there like them. Unfortunately, Aisha singles are still circulating around... not much we can do about that, though. And no, Saint's Row 2 doesn't allow you to go to the Cabaret for a nice Sunday evening out, or have your character watch TV while you're watching him watch TV!Saint's Row 2 is a bigger, better, more FUN version of the original! I'd rate it about a 4.75 out of 5! *JUST* slightly short of perfection! There are some little problems still around, like the ragdoll physics of your character, and the fact that a six foot fall can still pretty much kill them. Also, don't expect EVERYTHING to be new and wonderful! But, would you really want the game to not have ANY shades of familiarity in it at all, anyway? If you liked Saint's Row the original, then it's virtually impossible to dislike Saint's Row 2! It's very, very easy to lose coutless hours in this game with all the fun, exciting, and crazy things you can do. It's the FUN game Grand Theft Auto IV failed to give us! There are tons of enhancements and new features in the game which will make it THE game you'll still be playing a year from now! (or at least, longer than you did with that Rockstar title!) This is a Don't Miss! Buy it! Buy it now! You won't regret it. I promise you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2008"}

I typically stick with the DS for RPGs nowadays, but thought what they heck... But I'm not reviewing the other games or systems.  So here goes:This game is so remarkable for one big reason:  Keeping the core of the classic game with a shiny new appearance!  This is the first (and only) DQ to have a truly 3-d interface (meaning you can look at length, width, height - not that 3-d stuff like Avatar).  I was worried that using the new model, SE would lose the classic feel of this game.  Not so!  Instead you have rich, cartoony expanses of wilderness and towns to explore.  Random encounters are the norm here.  But you never really feel irritated when a baddie pops up.  The game presents a nice challenge in battles without feeling 'cheap' or that it is 'cheating'.  Combat is turn based, so plan your actions accordingly.  The nice aspect is that is seems that heal spells get bumped up a bit to the beginning of the turn, so if you have someone who is near death, then you can usually save them.  But sometimes not!Again, the challenge is nice.  There are many side quests and hunting and catching special monsters for the 'arena' is a fun way to pass the time and come up with some great items.The cast is fantastic.  Akira Toriyama worked his magic.  The characters are unique, though Angelo does look a lot like future Trunks from DBZ... and the hero does come off a little like Crono, but that's a compliment (to the silent hero).  The English voice acting is mostly top notch.  The actors are mostly British, so it adds a fun little element of a foreign feeling to the game.  Yangus and Trode are real treats to watch!  Sometimes I was laughing out loud.Towards the middle of the game, the world really opens up and you can spend a lot of time exploring and level grinding.  If you don't the upcoming portion is more difficult, but not really impossible.  The ship really is a nice touch and is a joy to pilot.  The bird later on is the standard DQ mode of enemy free transportation.The story starts kind of silly in places, but is really quite powerful at the heart.  Dhoulmagus is an amazing villain in the same vein as Kefka from FF6... just insane and evil.This is a seriously deep game that can consume well over 80 hours of a gamer's free time.  Enjoyable and tedium free time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2011"}

Bioware has succeeded many times before in the RPG department, who could forget Never Winter Nights?  Immediately, you will see a lot of NWN in Dragon Age, but they took all of the things that where bad about NWN and removed them, to create an amazing RPG with all the right elements.The incredible broad open-endedness of the game is definitely a hallmark of Bioware. Wow did they get it right.  You can do almost anything in this game, and your actions have consequences that ripple out.  Because of this, and the different origin stories, this game has an insanely high level of replay-ability.  The voice acting is top notch, and the story line is amazing.  It doesn't leave any room for clear cut good vs evil, these are very difficult moral choices with consequences that could shift the entire story.The games nonlinear nature makes for a really terrific environment to Role Play with a character of your chosing.  Someone can be a sweet talker, and get themselves out of situations or even con people out of money, or you could take the vigilante aproach, you could be a saint, or violent insolent bastard haha.  The possibilities are endless, and truely amazing.The game forces you to role play by these grey area decisions, its not as easy as being \"good\" or \"evil\" like so many \"open ended\" RPGs offer you.  There are consequences to actions, and most of the major choices in the game make you really reflect on what you should do, what your character would do.  Its wonderful and delightful, and even people new to RPGs will enjoy how involved one gets in the story.Pros:Extreme Open-endedness makes the game the best RPG out for the PS3.Story line is top notch and deeply involved, and large enough to accommodate several play throughs while still uncovering and learning more about the world your involved in.Character Customization borders on ridiculous with the level of detail control.Music is beautiful and consistent through the gameCharacter relationships make the story much more interesting, allowing the player to gain trust of different characters and learn more of their past.D&D; reminiscent character levelingVoice Acting is really terrific, the best I've heard.Combat is a bit clumsy, but it is basically very good, very much like NWN.Cons:Combat is a little clumsy, as stated, but it really isn't THAT bad, it takes some getting used to is all.Graphics the game is older now, and it shows, but that being said the graphics still look very good.The game is hands down the best RPG available for the PS3.  Its a must own for any RPG fans, you will not regret this purchase :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2010"}

To the 21+ (18+ in some states) crowd you will probably find yourself quickly reminded of the Megatouch games found in many bars.  You're generally given some obtuse amount of time in which to find a small grocery list of items which I found to make the game a bit of a yawn-worthy inspection versus a frantic scramble to beat the clock, a point in which I think they could have made the game more appealing.  There's a mildly coherent story to bridge the gap between games but it meerly serves as a segue from one game to another.I guess I can't fault the simplicity of the game but it didn't quite tickle my fancy.  The presentation is pretty bland but I'll be the first to admit that it's probably pretty difficult to jazz up a seek and find game.There really isn't a whole lot to say about this game.

Squires \"theDrizzle\"","summary":"Awesome, but expect failure","reviewText":"I hate to give three stars to such an incredible gaming machine but the immenent failure of seemingly every system has led me to this review. I keep hearing about how everyones 360 is failing, but I couldn't help but laugh as mine was still working great. However, I guess the jokes on me now. I didn't get any red lights, but my console is now freezing constantly until it heats up. I guess that the Mobo on these things isn't mounted well and they begin to warp until the solder joints seperate. It seems that for the time being, heating it up warps the board back and fixes the issue. But, I'm sure that it will get worse and worse until I have to get a replacement. It's really unfortunate that such an awesome gaming experience is plagued with so many hardware issues. I would have to recommend purchasing one anyways though because they're just so great. Just be prepared to have it fail at the worst time and have to get a replacement atleast once. Apparantly even the elite is subject to issues and I'm wondering if Microsoft will ever solve this issue entirely.If you're console is freezing with white lines and popping noises after a few days of inactivity, let it play some videos for about 30 minutes to an hour so it can warm up. It seems to only get the freezing issue when the processor has to generate graphics for a game. After it heats up it should start working again. This will of course not work if your problem is originating from overheating.So in summation, I would recommend buying a 360, but be prepared to get a replacement. It's a fun ride while it lasts.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2007"}

Developer Obsidian proved itself a worthy weaver of tales, and this looked very much like a third-person Deus Ex with a Mass Effect-style conversation system. While that is an impossible expectation to live up to, I really don't think it's worthy of the panning it's received from some people. Alpha Protocol is a good game that I enjoyed playing through -- staying engrossed throughout.The Good:- The story is decent. It's got a typical spy style overall, but the real quality comes in its branches. Depending on what you do and to whom, it goes off in different directions. And not just one or two; whole people will either become your best buddies or dead. I like the feeling that I'm causing all this to happen.- RPG elements are always welcome. You're constantly improving a variety of skills. I was able to tweak my character to be the stealthy melee expert who's good with a pistol that I always try to be in games.- Non-linear missions work. This was one of the best parts of Deus Ex (my #1 game of all time), and AP does a good job with this. You can infiltrate silently or guns-blazing, and either could work. I'm personally a completionist -- finding every item and dispatching ever guard. I could do that fine in AP.The Bad:- It's not the prettiest game. I didn't find the graphics as bad as some reviews, but this definitely didn't knock my socks off. There are also a few instances of sloppy design, graphics-wise, that shouldn't have survived such a long development cycle.- It takes a while to get going. The tutorial stage is rather long, and mission one doesn't allow for much deviation. It's not until the game splits in three that it opens up. Also, the RPG elements can bum you out early, as your finely-tuned agent is a pretty crappy shot with a firearm. That, to me, requires you to be savvy.OverallIf you want a neat action game with a good mix of story, stealth, and open-endedness, Alpha Protocol could fit the bill. As long as you don't expect the sharpest triple-A title or the next Gears/Halo/Uncharted, you should enjoy it. It's definitely worth the sub-$20 price tag it's going for on Amazon. I bet when all is said and done, your in-game story will be quite different from mine. That's definitely a feather in AP's cap.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2011"}

The only Resident Evil game I have played in the past was Resident Evil 2 and I never played the much accalimed Resident Evil 4 so I will not be comparing this game to that classic.  I will be judging Resident Evil 5 on itself alone and what it tries to be compared to what it ends up being.First off, I played this game through on coop with a friend as it clearly was not designed with singleplayer in mind.  I will not comment much on singleplayer as my time with it was limited but thanks to the limited A.I. of Sheva, your partner, you spend a large chunk of your time babysitting her and monitoring her inventory instead of enjoying yourself.  It's perfectly playable on singleplayer, but this game was made for a cooperative experience.Moving on to coop, Resident Evil 5 is a fun game with a friend.  It is not the best out there and suffers from some awkward game design decisions but you should have a good enough time playing through this game with a human partner.  During my playthrough I noticed that the game had a rather dated feel to it underneath the gorgeous coat of polish.  The graphics in this game are quite impressive, even in split screen coop.  The screen is split in a way where the top view is not directly above the bottom view, but where the top screen is to the left of the top portion of your tv and the bottom screen is to the right.  There is a blank black space to one side of each screen which I felt could have been used for U.I. data such as ammo count, health and the mini-map so none of this obstructs your view when playing the game.  The blank space is just a waste of space imo.The characters are quite detailed, they look good, the enemies are just as impressive and the bosses can be a sight to behold.  The environments are just as meticulously detailed with some impressive lighting effects in certain levels but there is not nearly as much object interaction or environmental destruction as I would have liked (such as shooting out lights) and the level design is very linear.  Nice looking levels but I feel as if I am being pushed along from point A to B on a set and predetermined path which makes the levels feel much smaller and confined than they should.The gameplay is where the mixed emotions come with this game.  Yes it is fun, but it seems as if it could have been much better had they just added in some basic controls that are commonplace today.  I never did quite get used to having to stop dead in my tracks to aim my weapon and fire, it's just awkward.  The game does not even allow the player to reload while on the movie, you have to come to a complete stop.  Stopping would be fine if it was to steady your aim but it would just make sense for the game to allow you to shoot, or at least reload, while on the move to provide for a more fluid gameplay experience.  There are also no evasive maneuvers in the game either which make the controls feel even more restrictive and there is no designated melee button, just a QTE option which appears if you stun an opponent with a gun shot.  This QTE driven melee I found to be unintuitive and a hassle.  The one move you have in the game to make your character more nimble is a side strafe, which is as basic as it gets, but at least it's still there.  You can sprint too, thankfully.The aiming and shooting itself works just fine though.  It's a pretty old system, but I took pleasure in using it.  Challenging enough where you have to steady your aim to get that perfect shot but accessible enough where you don't waste too many bullets and suddenly find yourself out of ammo.  Shooting and killing is fun and the weapon selection is decent but nothing too special.  There are a couple special weapons in the game which are very cool to use but they can only be used in certain spots.The sound of the weapons is a little underwhelming, particularly the shotgun which just didn't have the Boom I would expect it to have.  Environmental sound effects were much better and the voice acting was decent.  The story was forgettable, but perhaps that is because I'm not too familiar with the RE lore considering I only played one other game in the series.The one game in the franchise I played before this, RE2, was true survival horror.  It scared the crap out of me in certain areas, I will never forget that room with the two way mirror where I just knew something would jump out of it, and eventually something did, as soon as I stopped expecting it.  That game got me everytime, it was an amazing experience.  I knew going in that Resident Evil 5 would be an action game so I will not take points off like some for it not being scary at all, but it's not a grade A action experience either.  It just isn't as good as other top quality, high octane shooters out there because of the restictive controls.  Even Dead Space, which is a much slower paced game that relies on horror more than action, felt more flexible with it's controls.  I just didn't see the reason to keep the constricted survival horror controls of the old days in what is now an all out, unapologetic action shooter.  It feels like this game has an identity crisis where it can't completely let go of the past, yet wants to evolve into something else.

{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"Caraculiambro","summary":"hated it","reviewText":"Christ, this game was annoying.  While I do admit, having played them all so far, that the voice acting, the storyline, and the general atmospherics are the best in the series, it simply got too annoying having to drive clear across town to the site of a mission you'd failed.  Why weren't you allowed to save right before the part where you kept messing up?  The fact that some of the missions were difficult was par for the course, but it was simply inexcusable wasting my time driving across town merely to see another cutscene.The only good thing I can say about this game is that it features an excellent, very convincing atmosphere of New York.  Besides that, though, all I have to offer is a bunch of gripes.  I don't give a toss if you find this list useful or not:  here I'm actually writing to myself, so that I check this list and remember how infuriating this game was SO THAT I DON'T SOME DAY FORGET ABOUT THIS STUFF AND PLAY IT AGAIN!1.  Receiving these calls that you can't hang up on just as you're finishing missions, often when the police are still shooting at you and you're about to die unless you can shoot back or get in a car.2.  You can't run while talking on your cell phone, or enter a car.3.  The cheats for this were not enough, and the ones there are are unsatisfying.  Why couldn't you simply have been given an infinite life cheat?  Why did you have to keep dialing on your cell phone?  What an annoyance!4.  The missions don't have difficulty levels.  Why the heck not?5.  The camera defaults behind you and there's nothing you can do about this.  Even though you can move it about, it invariably drifts back to just behind you.  There should have been a way to turn this off in the options.  Though there are several camera angles, there never seems to be quite the one you need.6.  Why can't you shoot Michelle?  And others?  Open-ended Sand-box my heiney!  I say shoot her and move on.7.  You can't make mini-map any bigger:  kinda hard to see at times what's what.8.  The plot doesn't make any sense:  we're hounded by loan sharks and yet I've got 300K in my pocket?  How much are we in the hole for?  Like I'm sure a poor Russian would have been able to borrow 300K.  This is ridiculous.  Whatever I or my cousin borrowed or stole, I definitely have the money to pay it back right now.  So why can't I?9.  The auto-save interrupts what you're doing!10.  There's no way to collect cars, as there was in previous versions of this game.11.  You can't zoom in on something to get a really good look.12.  You can't replay any of the missions without starting the entire game over.13.  One must complete all missions to progress.  Brutal!  Can you let us skip one once in a while?14.  I hate having to call people you don't to call and having to be friends with people you don't want to be friends with!  Who's in control of my character anyway?  Like I'm gonna spend another second with that reggae guy.15.  Your auto-aim system blows.  It'll have you shooting at a pillar when there's an enemy right in front of your face.16.  The villain responsible for all your sorrows kept changing about every 10 missions.  This got ridiculous real fast.  Like I said, they had a great set-up for an action game, but no actual plot.17.  They give you all these fancy cars, yet there's no place on the map to really open up any of the cars.  Disappointing.  Instead you're just stuck in traffic with your Ferrari.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000K9OP2A","description":"Emotionally charged, stunningly beautiful, and delivering unprecedented dramatic character performance, Heavenly Sword&#x2122; showcases the power of PLAYSTATION&#xAE;3 (PS3&#x2122;) computer entertainment system. A dramatic tale of revenge sees Nariko, a fiery red-haired heroine, embark on a quest for vengeance against an invading King and his army. The story builds around the ancient Heavenly Sword, which once belonged to a powerful deity. It can never be wielded by a mortal without it slowly but inevitably draining their life-force.When the invading King (played by Andy Serkis) destroys the warrior clan that guards the Heavenly Sword, the clan leader&#x2019;s daughter, Nariko, takes up the sword in a desperate fight for survival. Nariko must now pay the ultimate price as she embarks on one last mission of vengeance against the King and his army before her life is finally and irreparably overtaken by the omnipotent Heavenly Sword&#x2026;","reviewerName":"B. Cooper","summary":"Heavenly Graphics but Hell on my Stomach","reviewText":"Several months back I was introduced to Ninja Theory's work through Enslaved: Odyssey to the West.  Despite the plummeting price point typically indicative of gaming mediocrity, I found Enslaved wholly intriguing and masterfully crafted.  After discovering that Andy Serkis had also contributed to Heavenly Sword's cinematic and narrative development I decided to immediately make a purchase.Heavenly Sword took me about 6 hours to complete on the normal setting.  6 hours in itself may seem like a valid reason for lowering a review score, but (surprisingly) it does not factor into my scoring.  I have always been a fan of quality over quantity.  The problem is that the game ultimately falls into 3 hours of arena battle sword fights, 1/2 hour of arena/quick-time boss fights, 1/2 hour of cinematics, and 2 hours of sinaxis slow-motion cannon/arrow shooting.For the most part, the characters are very engaging with strong individualized personalities and interesting dialogue.  The narrative often falls more into bouts of witty dialectic than substantial plot driven revelations, but the presentation is so strong that it still draws in the viewer.  Even 4 years later (with the exception of Nariko's squid-like hair) the facial features are stunning.  Facial animations and expressions are still light-years ahead of another game I recently reviewed: Dead Space 2.  The game's \"menu\" screen that opens after the first battle has some MAJOR lip synch issues, but these are corrected in every other cinematic.  The  scenes with Bohan yelling at his son (who looks like Sloth from the Goonies) and Flying Fox preaching his sadistic ideas about style while prancing like the Flash are definitely entertaining.  The problem is that even 30 min of great cinema does not draw me back into the 5-1/2 hours that make up the rest of this game.Almost every battle is broken into a room, arena, hallway, or enclosed road and does not allow you to progress until all enemies are defeated within that section.  Environments are beautifully rendered, but ultimately all look similar in design and color.  Enemies only come in about 6 varieties of soldier types.  More importantly is that  the only major difference when facing enemies is how often they block, how many hits they take to kill, and how often they strike with \"unblockable attacks.\"  Without exception enemies just don't feel unique like they do in other action games.  The combat system also doesn't do much to keep the game from feeling repetitive.The Heavenly Sword can be used in three different styles: Speed, Power and Ranged.  Each style has its own set of combo attacks and by holding R1 (power), L1 (ranged) or no shoulder button (speed) you can combine combos with the square (regular) and triangle (hard) attacks.  The game actually has a multitude of combos to use.  The problem is that, despite changing the style, every combo is just a combination of square and triangle.  So, depending on which style you use you are still using combos that look like [] ^ [] [] ^ or ^^^ or [] [] [] [] ^.  When you don't touch any buttons Nariko will block a \"blue\" attack.  Pressing triangle during an attack will trigger a lethal counter.  Since you are stringing together so many combos only using a few buttons, you ultimately end up button mashing combos and keeping different styles in mind.  A typical fight works like this:  (L1 ranged-  HAMMER DOWN THE BUTTONS, R1 power - HAMMER DOWN THE BUTTONS TO KILL THE POWERFUL ENEMY,  roll away, roll away, no button for speed - HAMMER DOWN TRIANGLE TO HIT AND TRY TO INITIATE A COUNTER KILL).  I'm sure that somebody could try to memorize each and every combo to try and use it in the best way possible, but it became an exercise in tedium for me.  Mashing buttons while using different styles depending on the enemy type took me to the end of the game with only 2 deaths.  Rolling to avoid \"red\" attacks also becomes difficult because you cannot stop a combo mid sequence.  Pressing NO buttons to block a \"blue\" attack is almost ridiculous because you're almost always mid-combo on an attack when you see an enemy light up.  Quite honestly all of the rolling, flipping, spinning and slicing through enemies began to make me feel nauseous.  The environments, enemies, and attacks all seem so similar you lose focus on what you're doing and begin to see a blur on the screen.  The sinaxis controls are even worse.Now I know some people will love controlling the cannon shots and arrows with the sinaxis.  The controls are actually decent using the motion controller and have a novelty to them.  The problem is that the blur effect used around the object in flight, together with the slow-motion ups and downs of your path are UGGH...NAUSEATING.  I have never felt like this in a game before, and dismissed several of the reviews here on Amazon that mentioned people feeling sick after these sections.  Well, after about an hour of using the motion control I found it could be disabled and you could use the analog to steer.  That helped a lot with the swaying to hit your target with motion control, but the slow-motion blur effect was still awful.  The real problem is that the character you \"usually\" use for these sections (Kai- the mentally disturbed cat hat girl) can only shoot enemies or jump over them.  The levels are extremely bare and offer only a few barrels to shoot with flaming arrows.  You have to guide the arrow through fire and onto its target to ignite the gunpowder, which results in more boat rocking action.The ending battle was the highlight of the action and was actually quite engaging.  Aside from 2 very short sequences, it also didn't feature a string of 1 second quick time events to memorize like other bosses.  Ultimately Heavenly Sword is best described as an experience with extremely tedious gameplay juxtaposed with AAA visuals and cinematics.  Maybe it will be enough for you, but 30 min of great video was not enough for me to warrant keeping this game in my collection.  I can watch any of the Lord of the Rings to see 3 hours of Andy Serkis doing some great voice acting and motion-capture.  Ninja Theory is a very talented company, as my review of Enslaved notes,  I just hope they keep  diversity (and lack of motion controls) in mind for the reboot of Devil May Cry.

{"product_name":"B0088MVPFQ","description":"","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"4 stars..with a deja vu feeling","reviewText":"New Super Mario Bros. was a monster hit for the Nintendo DS. It breathed new life in the legendary platform series not seen since Super Mario World for the SNES. Ir basically took the gameplay mechanics of the NES titles and modernized it for today's current video gaming generation. After seeing the hugely successful New Super Mario Bros Wii perform so well on the Wii, Nintendo wisely decided to release the sequel to the DS hit for the 3DS. While it's still just as fun and challenging as the DS title, it kind of feels like you've been there before (just like deja vu.)The story is just like any Mario game you've seen before: the princess gets kidnapped...yeah yeah yeah. Bowser returns as the main bad guy and his Koopa kids (from Super Mario Bros. 3) are back to help spread the mischief. 6 worlds plus 4 alternate worlds AND a secret world await you. You can choose to play the game on your own or include a friend to help you tackle the stages together. Also, the game gives you three save files in case your friends want their own file. Nintendo introduced new elements for this game. First, the main theme is to go grab as many coins as you can; the game now keeps record of how many coins you collect on every stage. Because of the new coin theme, there's a new power up to use: the gold flower. Use it to collect even more coins and turn almost anything into coins. Second, there's another power up (White Raccoon tail) that makes you invincible in case you are having trouble getting through a particular stage. Third, you can unlock Luigi at some point in the game and use him to clear the stages. Finally, there's a new mode called \"Coin Rush\". Here, you can play through stages from the game where you must collect as many coins as possible before the timer runs out and complete it. You can save your records and exchange them with other players who have the game through the SpotPass feature; doing so lets you challenge other players' records to see if you can beat their score. Nintendo went a step further and released extra Coin Rush stages that you can purchase and download online to your 3DS.The PROS: Leave it to Nintendo to keep a good thing going. The stages are fun, clever and interesting. They also get challenging as you get further into the game. The graphics and sounds are top notch. The music is pleasant and controlling Mario (and Luigi) is as easy as if it ever was. There is plenty of incentive to collect everything and find every secret as this is how you can get to the alternate worlds as well as finding the secret world. Unlocking Luigi is crucial since you need him to get the lucrative 5 star rating (you get rated on how well you perform in the game.) The Coin Rush mode is an interesting feature as it gets players to complete and unload their records online so that they can receive and challenge other players' records from around the world; it also helps to increase your overall coin total. If you get 1,000,000 coins, the title screen changes (and there's a small bonus for collecting 3,000,000 coins.) For those of you who want a challenge, you will find it here as it's no walk in the park once you get past the first world.The CONS: There's one glaring flaw with NSMB2......you get the feeling that you've done this before. Sure, it's still fun to play but Nintendo could have put more twists and added more variety to the game. Most of what you see in this game looks familiar and that's a problem in the long run. Also, the first game on the DS had a lot more stages compared to what you see here. The same goes for the music; while it's good, most of it was lifted from New Super Mario Bros. so don't expect to hear new background music.While New Super Mario Bros. 2 is fun and challenging, Nintendo could have added more stages with more variety. They also dropped the ball by using most of the same background music that you heard from the first game. Thankfully, the Coin Rush mode throws in a twist to the tried and true Mario game and adds life to it long after you beat the main story mode (collecting coins becomes a little addicting.) It's still worth getting whether you pick up a physical copy or download it online and straight to your 3DS through the eShop. I recommend it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2013"}

InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"blackaciddevil","summary":"Medal of Honor Frontline is an awesome start for the PS2.","reviewText":"Just got my hands on the new Medal of Honor game for the PS2 and, I must say, I'm very impressed.

You can customize cars, clothes, your looks, race, voice, and cribs. I became very addicted to this game, never getting tired of it, and always coming back to play the activities and missions.

The controls are good, the guns are nice and it was a good idea overall. It's just there are much better games on the market today. It is not better then Grand Theft Auto or Madden or even the Simpsons: Hit and Run. It's just another shooter that seems are overcrowded in the Ps2 genre.As for the game, you are a dirty cop who doesn't care if he kills a person or two. The cars are somewhat nice and the whole re-creation of LA is pretty good. the missions are basic, kill some people, follow a car etc. etc... It tried to copy Grand Theft Auto, but you can't have a cop stealing cars and not getting into trouble.As for side missions, being an \"enforcer\" is very fun. You can hang around and wait for a call of a street crime like a robbery, fighting, bum fights, kidnappings and even some rough hostage situations and you get \"points\" (which I think are supposed to be money) to buy cars and get new guns. You can also go around and search people and get their drugs and some very nice cool guns.Overall, True Crime is a good game for any system, but with all the better games out there, it seems like you get lost and don't be interested in it for very long. It doesn't have that addicting factor like Grand Theft Auto and some of the better sports games out there. Good think I sold mine for $30.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2004"}

There's a million things I love about it, but I'll just go over the best parts. First, there are the characters. Usually in RPGS, you don't see much of the characters beyond their battle performance and a few cutscenes, but in this game, there are dozens of little \"skits\" that you can participate in. They really help flesh out the various personalities, and make you feel attached to the characters. Plus, they're often hilarious.Then, although I'm loathe to mention it (I'm severely anti-graphics), I have to say that the look of the game is breathtaking. Again, I usually can't stand it when a game uses graphics as a crutch, but the anime style is just so different and cool, especially in the cut-scenes. And speaking of those, the voices are great too.The battle system is more action based than most. It lets you control one character (the others are ably handled by the AI), and use simple combos to pull off different moves. However, you can still control what moves your entire party learns and what basic AI pattern they follow. Plus, if you need a specific action carried out quickly, you can give direct orders to the other characters. Overall, battles flow at a fast pace and never drag down the experience.Then there's the story. Although it may at first seem unbearably cliched, good things come to those who wait. Around halfway through the game, a gigantic twist occurs, and from then on the story is fresh and intriguing. As more characters reveal their secret identities, you'll begin to wonder who you can trust.Finally, there are just so many extras to collect! There are dozens of sidequests, a boatload of items and equipment, and even hidden costumes! Let me tell you, you haven't lived until you've headed into battle with an entire party of swimsuit-clad warriors. And after you're done with that, you can entertain yourself by performing various feats to attain the hundreds of \"titles\" for the characters.Overall, this game is amazing. It's one of the best I played in 2004. Looking at this masterpiece and the similarly excellent Baten Kaitos, which I'm playing now, I think that Namco is the new Squaresoft!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2005"}
{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"Simon","summary":"The ultimate must-have game","reviewText":"There's little I can say about Resident Evil 4 that hasn't been said already. One of the few recent games that truly lived up to its hype, RE4 is a delightfully scary experience wrapped in stunning graphics and tight controls. It's a whole different game from the previous installments in the series, and looks to be the model for the next few games to come. There's more bullets and more weapons maybe, but that doesn't make the game any easier. Also appreciated is how lengthy the overall quest is, and for the first time Capcom has not resorted to tired fetch quests and backtracking.Right now there's two versions of this game (with a third coming to PC). The Gamecube version is the original, and has slightly better graphics and better controls (since it was specifically designed for Nintendo's console). It's also slightly cheaper as a player's choice title. The PS2 port loses a bit in the graphics department, but packs in a bunch of bonus content such as side missions, extra costumes, weapons, and story content. It's also in anamorphic widescreen, whereas the Gamecube one is letterboxed. It might sound like the PS2 game has more value, but overall the two versions are about the same. Whichever version you choose, Resident Evil 4 should not be passed up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2006"}

First of all this is not Star Wars SOCOM nor does it try to be. This game is a straight team action shooter so just forget any slams that say it doesn't live up to SOCOM. It doesn't because SOCOM is a different genre. Second, another reviewer said that he got tired of the game after playing for 5 hours everyday. I'm sorry but if you play any game that much, it will get old!! Other reviewers have stated that the game is too easy. The game has adjustable levels and defaults to the easiest. Bump the level up in the options menu and you'll be crying like a wookie and throwing your controller quite often.Honestly this is one of the best Star Wars titles I've  seen in years. This game does exactly what it says it does. It provides true to life simulations of the large scale battles from the Star Wars saga. Pretty much every trooper class and major vehicle is represented in the game as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each.The only negative side of this game is perhaps the  small number of game modes (a whopping 2, historical campaign and galactic conquest). The game is easy to pick-up which makes it accessible to anyone but exciting and detailed enough to hold even the most hardcore gamer's attention.

Sturgeon","summary":"A Sorely Needed Update","reviewText":"I just now loaded up my old save data from the N64 version of this game. Now don't get me wrong. I love this game. The story is very well written. The characters are endearing. The adventure is still epic even by today's standards. It is the only reason I shelled out the cash for an N64 back when I was a broke, Ramen Noodle eating college kid.But truthfully, the graphics just have not aged well. To be blunt, on my 1080p television, it's downright ugly. Unfortunately, I could very well see young gamers of today passing on this gem of a game simply because it's horribly outdated.So if you're asking why you should buy the 3DS version at full retail price, when you can get the same game off of Virtual Console for so much cheaper, this is the reason. If you're asking why you need another version when you already have the N64, Collectors Edition, Master Quest and Virtual Console versions owned already, this is the reason.The N64 game had game play and a deep story telling that was so timeless, truly all it needed was a graphical facelift and it would be just as good as any recently made game out there, especially for a portable system. This updating makes the classic game look beautiful again. I would have bought this game again simply for the graphic update and the 3D.If you need a bit more incentive, there's also a hint system (which you really shouldn't need, but it's there), a chance to replay defeated bosses both separately and in a boss rush mode and then there's also the revamped Master Quest with a flipped map and tougher enemies for added difficulty. So this package is not without additives. But like I said, this game would have been worth it if all I got was the graphic update and 3D affects.If you're a newer player who may have scoffed at Ocarina of Time before because it looked dated, this version will make you rethink your position. With such a great story and game play, all OoT needed was a bit of a facelift, and now it plays just as well as any game out today. It will show you why everyone who's ever played it considers it a classic.If you're an old school player who owns several different copies of this game already, you've played it enough times that you could write your own players guide and you're wondering why you should buy yet another version, then chances are you're a big enough fan of Ocarina of Time that you should want the absolute best version of this game. Without a doubt, this is it.I own the N64 version, the Collectors Edition disk and the Master Quest disk. I did not hesitate to buy this version and I have not regretted it at all. It has made me fall in love with Ocarina of Time all over again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2011"}

It did away with the monotony of &quot;Metroid II&quot; and enhanced the gameplay and environment of the original &quot;Metroid&quot;.  The puzzles and challenges presented by this version captivated all kinds of gamers.  It re-hashed the original story and gave it some extra kick.  New weapons and abilities were introduced, as were more complex storylines.  Having never played any of the 'Metroid' games before this one, it was quite a spectacular introduction.Now, fast foward a few years.  Knowing that the new GameBoy Advance System is making quite a profit out of porting old Super NES games for handheld, I was interested to see if Nintendo was going to put &quot;Super Metroid&quot; on the GBA.  Well, they did, sort of.  The game that ended up being developed for GBA was called &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot; and it resembles &quot;Super Metroid&quot; in many ways.  However, there are several distinctions.  For starters, this takes place AFTER &quot;Super Metroid&quot; and adds a new wrinkle to story by creating a new nemesis called 'parasite X' which was able to procreate after our hero, Samus, wiped out all of the Metroids on SR 388.  This parasite is a menace to the entire universe and all traces of it on SR 388 and the orbital research lab must be destroyed.  &quot;... Fusion&quot; takes place entirely aboard the orbital research lab and employs most of the same gameplay that &quot;Super Metroid&quot; did.  It's still a side-scroller and it presents many of the same obstacles of its predecessor.  There are numerous different types of doors that are sealed and unable to be accessed unless certain criteria are met.  There are other access points and hidden entries that can only be discovered if you have the right weapons or know where to look.  In addition, throughout the game, there are several different bosses Samus must defeat in order recover certain powers.It's hard to truly describe how satisfying this game really is.  You really need to play it yourself to see first hand.  Rest assured, though.  If you liked &quot;Super Metroid&quot;, you're going to love this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2002"}

{"product_name":"B001L8DKJ8","description":"InPrinny: Can I Really Be The Hero?players are treated to a single player spin-off from the popular role-playing (RPG) universe ofDisgaea. Here players step into the unlucky shoes of a penguin called a Prinny and 999 of his comrades as you slash your way through various Netherworld areas in side-scrolling service to the Demon Lord Etna. Although the mission that you are saddled with is ridiculously comic, the action you face is not, so you're given 1,000 lives to work with and you can use everything you find on the battlefield to help you survive and succeed.Caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Classic side-scrolling action.View larger.Challenging difficulty levels.View larger.Multiple vehicles &amp; aircraft.View larger.The StoryPrinnies are the reincarnated souls of evil humans trapped in purgatory. Summoned by urgent order, the player in the form of the lowly Prinny rushes to meet his boss, Demon Lord Etna in her chamber. You arrive just in time to see Etna beating your fellow prinnies to a pulp. She is definitely in a bad mood, being even more abusive and violent than usual. As it turns out, someone has snatched her favorite dessert from the fridge. Eager to vent her frustration, she orders you to hunt down the ingredients to create a new Ultra Dessert and promises that if you do not deliver the goods by the next morning that you will learn what eternal suffering really means. Since you are at the very bottom of the netherworld food chain, if not its gutter, you have no choice but to snap into action.GameplayPrinnyis a side-scrolling platformer filled with classic flavored gameplay that requires timing of jumps and memorization of the patterns of enemy movements. As non-threatening as dessert making might seem, nothing could be further from the truth. In the game players are given 10 hours and the use of 999 identical comrades from the Prinny Squad to defeat demon bosses spread throughout the game's levels who possess the necessary ingredients to create a new dessert for Etna. Although this may sound like way more than enough help, surprisingly challenging gameplay that consistently has players one blow from either victory or defeat and the nature of the prinnies themselves will quickly change player's perception on this.True to their origins in theDisgaeauniverse where their literal explosive nature makes them perfect cannon fodder to aim at enemies, prinnies are extremely volatile. Players can only only control one prinny at a time because you only possess one red scarf, which not only indicates your status as current game hero, but also keeps you from blowing up. Wave after wave of enemies within the game also conspire to exploit the prinnies' tendency towards combustion, and more often than not are successful, underlining the importance of your 999 friends. This means that players do not actually play as a single prinny. As one meets his end another takes his place and you are kept informed of how many prinnies you have left, as well as how many hours. Prinnies are not defenseless though. Players have use of a variety of attacks and moves like the 'Dual Sword Slash' to deal with enemies in front of you, the 'Hip Pound' which allows you to stun opponents with your bottom and standard platformer jump and sprint functionality for mobility. In addition, prinnies can lift and throw objects like bombs, stomp enemies and even pilot tanks and planes to bombard whatever gets in your way. The game comes with two modes: Standard Mode, which allows you to take damage up to 3 times before losing a life and Hell Mode where one blow means instant death. In this ridiculously comic adventure you will need every advantage if you hope to survive the cost of the ultimate sweet treat.Key Game Features:1,000 Units- Players will get 1000 lives to beat the toughest action of this platforming side-scroller.Lift &amp; Throw- Prinnies are able to lift and throw objects on the battlefield.Vehicles- Steal and control powerful vehicles, like tanks and UFOs.Hip Pound: Jump and pound enemies to stun them. Then you can inflict multiple combo attacks for extra damage.3D World with 2D Characters: InPrinny, character art is created using fluid 2D sprites, giving it a classic look with a comical tone. Battlefields and backgrounds, however, are created with 3D models. This allows for a smooth and unique combat action where certain attacks are rendered in a 3-dimensional view.Boss Battles Galore- 10 Major stages featuring many hidden characters and a boss waiting at the end of each.Music Collection Mode- Find music tracks during game and replay them as background music.Humor- Ridiculously comedic storyline and characters.","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Maybe 'Insanely Great', but also 'Greatly Insane'","reviewText":"For those of you not familiar, \"Prinnies\" are the penguin-like servants of the main characters in Disgaea.  Disgaea is a turn-based fantasy game (and a strange one at that), but this game is a side-scrolling platformer.In \"Prinny:  Can I Really Be The Hero?\", you take control of an army of 1,000 Prinnies, one at a time (your \"lives\" to beat the game).  You have a standard arsenal of attacks:  up close your Prinny will use his sword, he can jump up over bad guys and \"butt-bash\" them to stun them, and from a distance he can leap and fling infinite sword-blades, slowly dropping back to earth.  An interesting touch is that using this jumping special attack will cause the 2-D realm to pivot and give you a momentary 3-D view of the action.  This doesn't do you any good; it's just for effect.  Prinnies can also grab onto ledges and haul themselves up, but they don't appear capable of lowering themselves down.Unfortunately, despite bright colors, silly dialogue, and lots of eccentric cuteness, there are some gameplay problems that keep this game from really being great.  There's lag when turning around or stunning, getting the timing of jumps can be very difficult, and the double-jumps, while very high, are also very hard to control.  It's really easy to get yourself knocked off a cliff, and worse still, getting hit can make you \"bounce\" and go off an edge.  The addition of \"bomb\" attacks is cute:  you can pick up a cartoon bomb and throw it.  However, it's easy to drop it, and even have it explode in your hands.  Most of the time you play this game, you'll find yourself knowing what you want to happen, having your timing perfect, but then watching it fail to execute.  It can get very frustrating, and I've had to take the gameplay in small doses so as not to get too aggravated.The copy of \"Prinny: Can I Really Be the Hero?\" that I received came in a box containing the standard plastic PSP game case, a booklet, the UMD of course, and also a CD of the soundtrack, complete with colorful cartoons and Japanese text in the liner notes.  I don't recommend the game for children, and I do recommend that interested teens or adults have good twitch reflexes, and lots of patience.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2009"}

It should be also noted that while on foot you could pull weapons off mechs (only when the mechs are not in use) and use these over sized weapons.- Grappling hook -Shot (like the one in the Legend of Zelda Series or like the grappling hook from Tenchu), which lets you scale tall buildings, and fly across the landscape.- Online Gameplay (versus other players), this really helps extend the life/fun of the game long after you have beaten it.BAD:- Enemies can be pretty cheap, Example, after you get hit with a powerful weapon like a rocket you go into a fall and have to get up to recover, during your recover animation many enemies will strike at you making you fall over again. What ends up happening is you get stuck into a cycle where you fall over after getting get shot at or hit and while getting up it happens again (enemies shoot you or hit you) so you never fully get back up and fight back, you just fall again. It is very hard to break this cycle after it starts; usually it only ends if the enemies miss or you die.- Using mechs or any energy weapon uses up you reserve of \"Heat Energy\". If your \"Heat Energy\" runs out you can't pilot any Vital Suit or use any energy weapon. It should be noted that in this game \"Heat Energy\" ties directly into your life bar if you run out of this \"Heat Energy\" your life will slowly drain till you die. This makes prolong use of any Vital Suit (Mech) or any energy weapon a risk to your health.- Pretty confusing story which many people will not get nor care to understand.IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- Sci-Fi 3rd Person Shooter (camera behind the player).- The game takes place on a world covered in ice and snow, lots of levels have snow and winter theme.- Life energy or Heat energy plays a big role in this game, this energy ties directly into your life bar if you run out of this energy your life will slowly drain till you die. It should also be noted that this happens even while in doors and underground not just outside in the cold. The only way to refill this energy is to kill enemies or destroy objects in the game, by doing so you'll see a pool of gold colored substance when your characters body touches it your energy bar will refill.- Fight lots of \"Bug\" like enemies as well as human enemies.- Lots of mechs and Mech Combat - mechs are robotic suits of armor you pilot, in this game they are called Vital Suits, they can also equip their own weapons.- Game is broken up into 11 levels (so essentially this a fairly short game).- Shoot at to collect \"markers\" for a higher score (there are \"markers\" in every level and the look like big spinning coins).- Wining matches online unlocks new character dress options for your online avatar.- Online portion of this game has your standard set-up with Death Match, Team Versus, ect...GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction (Xbox, PS2)- Armored Core: Last Raven (PS2)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- This is the Special Edition of this game that comes in a metal case and comes with an Art book as well as a Mixed media CD (that contains Videos, Wallpapers/Photos, Music, and windows icons for your PC). This Special Edition also comes with a new multiplayer level (Battleground), which will be available to all Xbox Live players for free a few more months from now (people who got/get this Special Edition can play this multiplayer level early).- There are already a few new multiplayer levels available to buy over Xbox Live.

I like comparing the two games, because, I'm enjoying and hating them both in the same ways. Both games have wonderful graphics, great control and exploration and platforming of this game is great. That is until you fight enemies. In both games, the moment any enemies are introduced, the game grinds to a PAINFUL halt and all the fun get's sucked out and replaced with frustration.In prince of Persia the combat had me thinking WTF is going on?! your screen gets kinda red sometimes, the baddies turn black and you can't touch them for like 10 minutes, the power bar at the bottom 7 out of 10 times means nothing. Literally there's the same dude you fight like 3 times, he has a power bar, but you have to knock him off the side of a cliff, meaning his power is at 100% all the time 3 times. There's others where you knock off a quarter of the power bar and they bite the dust, just weird. i understand the need for the power bar, but man, unless it means something it defeats the purpose.This is a rare game that has me thinking I love this so much, as I jump around and look at the nice graphics, and then I have have to fight something  and I'm thinking when does this end!? I want to play some more. The people who designed the combat are either mentally retarded or have seen video games played, but never played one themselves and just kinda guessed what things are supposed to do. Don't get me wrong, the enemies are extremely easy, even without the lack of death penalty, but the designers so how figured out to make these battles boring and last FAR too long. This game is a soooo great in many respects, but sooooo far in others. It's a shame too.End of review - I'm venting a little, and the enemy battles don't make up that large a portion of an otherwise fun game. If you want a fun platformer, with VERY creative level designs, nice controls and great graphics (but falls short in the combat area) pick it up.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2008"}

(Che disgrazia!)","reviewText":"Silent Hill 3 manages to be brilliant, horrifying, and somewhat of a let-down all at the same time.  This is kind of hard to put into words... I have been hooked on and in love with Silent Hill since the instant I layed my eyes on the first game's preview as it played on a TV in Gamer's Paradise so many years ago.  The overwhelming nostalgia and sense of eerie contentment that I experience while playing these games are beautiful and unequaled in their glory. Silent Hill 3 - even with breath-taking graphics and brooding dread extremely prevalent - left me wishing it turned out better.  This game is basically a graphical redux of SH2 with a storyline that progresses where the original SH left off.  The gameplay is also a bit more linear than SH 1 and 2.  Not as much exploring to be done.  Which is a damn shame, really.  Just more monster killing and puzzle solving. - Don't get me wrong, it's a great game... it just doesn't really add any major boons or  benchmarks to the series' overall marvel.  - Not really breaking any barriers, so to speak. Che Disgrazia! ** It is a game worth buying, though.  It IS Silent Hill and it is well worth the replay time.  Loose strings from the first game are finally tied off, and we get to see our dear Silent Hill play host to a whole new batch of wicked abominations.  Disturbing imagery is not in scarce supply, and the enhanced, built-in surround sound toys with your mind and raises those little hairs on your neck.  Once again this is a game that has to be played in the dark with the TV volume cranked.  It's the only way to enjoy the full sense of terror and chaos that the game is trying to provoke.  That being said, I must attempt to close.  - Silent Hill 3 is worth the cash.  If you're a newcomer to the series this game will blow you away, because, after all, it's creepy as hell.  But if you've played through the first two releases and are hoping for a major leap, prepare to be a little dissapointed.

That means that each character has a meeter, and when it fills up, they can attack, cast magic, summon a monster, or whatever.  One annoying thing about battles, is that when you walk around, there are too many random battles.  One fun thing to do is equiping weapons, armor, and materia.  Materia is the magic get to use.

{"product_name":"B004L4AZ7Y","description":"","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"A good port of a 10 year old game","reviewText":"Oh yes.  We have a new gaming system release, which means it's time for publishers to dig through their past catalogues to release old games that won't take very long to port over.  Such is the case with Rayman 3D, which is essentially Rayman 2 but with the added 3D.  Here we have a port of a game that dates back to 1999 and has been ported to so many game systems (Dreamcast, N64, PS1, PS2, Game Boy, DS, iOS, etc.) that it seems a bit ridiculous to even consider reviewing the game.  What's left to say?  Pretty much the entire gaming population at this point has had the opportunity to play the game.  I am actually one of the minority, a gamer that has never played a Rayman title, let alone Rayman 2.  So I figured that since the 3DS launch titles are severely lacking, I'd take a chance and see why, exactly, the game's been ported a million times.The gist of the story is that space pirates are invading a world called The Glade of Dreams.  Led by  Admirable Razorbeard, these robot pirates destroys The Heart of the World, capture Rayman and his friend Globox and generally are making a huge mess of things.  Rayman escapes, is separated from Globox and sets out on a quest to locate four ancient masks, awaken some dude name Polokus and put a stop to the pirates.  Somewhere in there, you also are trying to locate 1,000 Lums to give you access to new parts of the world.  Not exactly the strongest story, but it does its job and takes a backseat to the action.  I'd always been curious about Rayman since it was designed by Michel Ancel who would go on to create one of the better games in the Xbox/PS2/Gamecube era, Beyond Good & Evil.  The framework for that game can be seen here, but Rayman's strengths lie in the gameplay.I'm not sure if this is a compliment to the timelessness of Rayman or a critique on how little we've changed in the last ten years, but Rayman could be released today (with a fresh coat of paint, natch) and no one would probably tell that it's a game from the 90s.  It's built on a strong framework of platforming, small puzzle-solving and collecting that you can still see in platforming games today.  Enemies are shot at with glowing balls.  You can lock on them with a press of the Left bumper and strafe while shooting at them.  Platforms will be jumped on and tons of items (in this case, Lums) will be collected.  Upgrades (such as the ability to swing from purple lums) will be acquired.  Pretty standard stuff, even today.  But Rayman has that little spark of magic that's really difficult to quantify that makes it fun.  The Lums are hidden around the world and most of the time they can be very difficult to locate.  If you are a completionist, Rayman 3D will keep you busy for quite some time.The chief upgrade here comes in the graphics and 3D implementation.  While you'll never mistake Rayman 3D for a new game, it does looks really good on the 3DS, especially in the little touches.  Bugs will fly in the air, groups of mushrooms will reassemble themselves, butterflies will circle in the air.  These little flourishes look fantastic, both on the 3DS and in 3D.  This is my first game on the 3DS and the first real experience with its 3D capabilities and I have to say I'm surprised.  It adds a level of depth to the game that not only looks amazing (as when the bugs fly toward the screen or when you're moving through a tunnel and the depth can be seen) but also aids in platforming, I've found.  With this truly three dimensional playing field, timing jumps and knowing where to land is even easier to judge.  Simply put, this definitely showcases the potential of the 3DS and I can't wait to see how games will utilize the 3D as developers have more time to devote to it and get more familiar with the hardware.Ultimately, Rayman 3D is an excellent launch title.  It's simply a port of a relatively old video game, but in some ways you wouldn't even know it.  I was a little nervous, dropping my $40 on this game when it's had such an up and down history in terms of ports, but this was a very fun game that plays really well, looks pretty good for its age and showcases the potential the 3DS has in terms of 3D.  If you're a fan of platformers and/or collectathons, I'd recommend Rayman 3D.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002I0GX88","description":"","reviewerName":"ITBeast \"ITBeast\"","summary":"An Awesome Comic Book styled sequel PS3 Game","reviewText":"The adventures (or misadventures) of Cole MacGrath continue in this very well done and much improved Comic Book Styled PS3 game sequel Infamous 2.A Brief synopsis's of the game: The story starts about a month after the events of the 1st Infamous game where things are either starting to come together and Empire City starts rebuilding itself under the protection of the games protagonist Cole MacGrath (If you choose the Hero route from the 1st game) or looks like a scene from Dante's Inferno and the people of Empire City cower in fear from Cole (If you took the Infamous route). When one day another NSA agent by the name of Lucy Kou that was also undercover with NSA Agent John White except she had been assigned to New Marinas where as John had been assigned to Empire City. Kou convinces Cole to leave Empire City in order to come with her back to New Marias (Fictional City Based Off of New Orleans like Empire City being based off of Manhattan Island) in order to meet the creator of the Ray Sphere which Cole destroyed in the 1st game with the promise of increasing your powers in order to face the foretold coming of the Beast. Just as your ship departs for New Marias the Beast arrives in Empire City and starts destroying the City, you battle the Beast but are ultimately defeated by the beast and barely get away in time. You along with Cole's best friend Zeke and Agent Kou, Cole must head to New Marias; find the creator of the Ray Sphere who has the knowledge in order to defeat the beast before the beast eventually finds Cole.What I like 1st of about the new game was you were able to carry over certain aspects from the 1st game like your Karma Level and how much power you could store from what you had earned from completing Infamous; however you can start Infamous 2 with a fresh slate without playing Infamous (I would highly recommend playing the 1st one before starting the 2nd one so you can get the story's background). Another downer is your initial battle from the 2nd game with the Beast takes a good chunk of the powers you had earned away as you have to earn them back again playing Infamous 2.  The graphics quality was greatly improved of the characters which you can tell that sucker punch used the motion capture technology for a lot of the Cut Scenes which helped give it the \"Uncharted\" feel. Much of the game play of the controls is similar except sucker punch modified how to access your powers from the 1st (This was due to adding more powers to Cole's arsenal). The Karma system also returns and is a lot more unforgiving if you're not careful of your actions depending what path you have decided to follow (Once again Hero or Infamous). This is also played out on the final outcome of the game where instead of there being a moderate difference of the outcome your decision makes a serious turnpike for whatever you decide to choose and how differently the game will end.I spent nearly 2 weeks with many hours a day put into the game finishing the game (This was due to completing all the side missions as well as the required Missions for the Campaign). There is also a user create tool in the game that can be used to not only create game missions for yourself but also place your user generate game on the PS3 PSN network as well to share with others.Overall an excellent sequel which I am continuing having fun with, I would highly recommend.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2012"}

There is a \"now loading screen\" with the little hero runing,after EVERY SINGLE RANDOM BATTLE!! That's nearly unforgivable.Konami should have gotten rid of all those needless voice over cutscenes to make more room for memory,thus cutting down on all the now loading times.I would be more than happy to give up some of the flashy graphics in exchange for less load times.What's bad is that voice over cutscenes are alright,so long as they are a significant part to the story.No,not here.You get a voice over scene when you regroup with your party at town,when you need to talk to someone at the inn,meet your sister,walk the dog,scratch your arm,go to the bathroom.What's with all these friggin' voice overs!? It's almost like Konami wants to prove so badly that they can do this,which to me isn't all that impressive to begin with.Part 1 and 2 didn't have the technology of 5,yet the story,and more importantly the gameplay was excellent.More isn't always better.Please stick to making video games instead of movies.Another bad thing is that we are seeing a return to Suikoden 3(the very worst in the series as far as I'm concerned)as there is soooo much \"go here,go there,talk to this person,talk to that person;wander around until you trigger the next scene\".With 4 as well as 1 and 2,you pretty much got to the fighting and experience gaining right off the bat.You know,the whole funof playing an RPG?Also with the way that the characters are dressed,I feel like I'm playing something that is really wanting to be FFX-FFX2, Kingdom Hearts.Please,you don't need to copy;you are BETTER than those games.Be a leader not a follower.This game is fun,WHEN YOU ACTUALLY GET TO PLAY IT!As far as the graphics and load times;if it was truely to much to cram on a PS2 disc,then Konami should have waited and released it on the PS3.For now I'll stick with playing Shadow Hearts:From The New World.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2006"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest. This unprecedented 60-player option could revolutionize online multiplayer game play and is sure to provide countless hours of action-packed fun.Resistance 2, set in the United States, is loaded with new weapons, enemies, and an unprecedented online gaming experience.","reviewerName":"Red Baron \"Rdeschain\"","summary":"This Is Not True to the First Game","reviewText":"This game is not bad, and it is not amazing,  the graphics are intense the game play is fun,  but it is so vastly different from the first game it makes me angry,  whoever was working on this game and decided that you only get two weapons was stupid,  I do not care if it makes the game more tactical it forces you to play the way the game designer wants you too,  you are forced to walk thier path and use the weapons the give you for the different situations you find your self in,  gone is the fun of killing monsters with a varitey of cool and sometimes wacky guns, replaced it is the repetive search for a new gun or grenade or something because you can only care two weapons,  the truly special weapons are few and far between and all you end up with are the basic weapons,  I am just saying when you  make a winner of a game like ratchet and clank, you do not change it when you make a winner of a game like Resistance you do not change things at the heart of the game,  you upset fans and push them away,  any video game designer who worked on and changed stuff should take a lesson from any TV writer out there,  FANS HATE CHANGE,  why do you idiots think Ross and Ratchel never got together till the dam show was cancelled I mean people like what they like and when you change it to something worse we are going to complain,  If you loved the first game you may be pissed at the second one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2008"}

If you're a fan of the series or of first-person shooters, why are you wasting time reading this review?  Just buy the game.Well, if you want a little more information...  This is a great game.  It starts off with Cortana waking the Chief up from cryosleep on an abandoned Forward Unto Dawn, shortly before the ship is pulled into the nearby planet's gravity well.  Here, the Chief and Cortana face not only the Covenant, but a new group of enemies, the Prometheans, along with a creature that's long been imprisoned that's been recently freed....  To make matters worse, Cortana is dealing with rampancy, degradation AI's go through once they are over 7 years old.I really enjoyed the story in this game.  It was interesting, but most of all, I enjoyed the relationship between the Chief and Cortana.  There seemed to be more of it in this game than in previous ones.  And I liked to see the Chief's concern for Cortana's condition.  I think this game had a bit more of an emotional aspect to the game, which made it a great game for me.Now I never do any of the online stuff; I only played the Campaign, so it's the only part I can properly review.  But, I read that it also comes with various multiplayer features and Spartan Ops, which appears to be a second story to the game that you get on XBox Live.Extra notes.  The graphics are spectacular.  There were a couple times in the beginning and end cut scenes where the human faces could've been mistaken for photographs, they were that good.  I have yet to see that in any other game I've played so far.  I also like the music in this game better than in previous ones.  Also, there are also some new weapons in this game, including a new grenade and the very powerful and very awesome Incineration Cannon (I'll let you guess what it does).  There's also a pretty cool new \"vehicle\", the Mantis, which is kind of a mechanized suit.All in all, a really great game, with all the things we love about the series, plus more.

Decent Game in General.","reviewText":"If you are a Simpsons fan, you'll love this game.  If you're not, well, you find it to be a decent game at best.  This game is a smaller, less refined version of GTA littered with great Simpson references.  Any true fan of the Simpsons will enjoy finding jokes from many of the shows scattered throughout the game.The Simpsons is like Grand Theft Auto 3 in that missions involve driving a car around a city, and sometimes walking around.  Instead of one huge city, there are 7 levels, comprising of one of three different subsections of Springfield - the neighborhood, the downtown, and the marina district.  All the Simpsons haunts and characters are there.  The Kwik-E-Mart, the Nuclear Power Plant.  It's all there.  You play as Homer, Bart, Lisa, Marge and Apu.Unlike other Simpsons games, this is a polished game.  It's fun to explore the places and characters.  There are many side missions and gags to do as well.  Unlike GTA3 though, the sense of being in a living, breathing city is just not there.  The main part of the game are the story missions.  There are a total of 49 of those to complete.  The missions are all a variant of race someone, gather something, or beat the clock.  After a while, the repetitiveness of these missions begin to pine away at the novelty.  The multi part missions are terrible in that failing a latter part of the mission causes you to restart the whole mission again.  Couple this with the bad traffic AI and sometimes you just want to break the controller.There are some other things that frustrate me.  The Multi-player is terrible.  All it is a cheap race that looks exactly like an NES game (the 8-bit version).  It should not have been included.  Also, the beginning levels are way too easy, and the latter levels are way too frustrating.All in all, it's a good game and I recommend it to any true Simpsons fan out there, but don't expect miracles.Pros:HilariousTons of obscure Simpsons referencesAn actual fun and polished Simpsons gameGreat for explorationCons:Missions are repetitiveTraffic and AI are badly designedStuck on some missionsThe \"multi\" player level is an insult to gaming.Time to Complete (Story missions only): 17 hoursFrustration Level: Medium/HighDifficulty Level: Easy/Medium","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2003"}

Players are free to choose your own fighting style by customizing Dante to your advantage.","reviewerName":"Dmg","summary":"Excellent game, revitalizes the series, extremely difficult","reviewText":"I must say Devil May Cry 3 is an incredibly awesome game. I loved the original DMC immensely, and like a ton of other people, I was very disappointed with the sequel. This game lives up to the original, and expands upon it in every way.DMC3 is a prequel to the series and focuses on the relationship between Dante and Vergil. The game actually has story behind it, unlike the other two games that felt like they had a little story tacked on. The cut-scenes are great, and everything's still over-the-top and cheesy, but in a good way. With the new Style moves, the game has depth beyond button-smashing; it even encourages it with Combo style points that are awarded for your flashiness on screen, and are decreased as you use the same move over and over, much like in the Tony Hawk games.This game is extremely difficult. The PS2's Ninja Gaiden. The American \"Normal\" mode, which is the only difficulty mode available in the beginning, is the Japanese \"Hard\" mode. After you get your butt kicked a few times, the \"Easy\" mode becomes unlocked, which isn't that much easier. Trust, this game is freakin' hard. Your skill, reflexes, and brain will definitely be up to the test with this one.The graphics are completely redone and it shows. Nice graphics and special effects, and the levels are greatly detailed and the gothic theme is superb. On the sound front, the music really pumps you up and puts you in the midst of the action. Sound effects fit the bill, especially melee clings and clangs.Replay value for this game is pretty good, since with the different Styles (with two unlockables), you can play through completely different every time. The multiple difficulty levels also add to the replay, along with secret missions and weapons. Seriously, this game is going to eat up a lot of your time, and you're going to love it.Overall, this is an extremely fun game, and I'm glad Capcom did the series right with this one. If you like action games, pick it up. But if you get frustrated easily, skip it since you'll be dying. A lot.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0050SZ0SY","description":"","reviewerName":"Moviedude","summary":"The Crysis for Everyone","reviewText":"Crysis took players to a lush tropical paradise to fight soldiers and aliens. It had near-photorealistic, organic environments, a surprisingly servicable sci-fi/war plot, and enough special effects to bring any video card to its knees. Years later it's still a pretty acceptable benchmark application, and continues to impress with its solid design and fun gameplay.For may gamers Crysis 2 was a mixed bag. The level design was still top tier, and the expanded arsenal of weapons was fun to play with, but the game's cluttered environments made vehicle adventures few and far between, and numerous console shortcuts- reflection mapped water, no more parallax mapping on the ground, low-def textures- kept Crysis 2 from being the eye-popping lunatic tech demo its daddy was.Crysis 3 mercifully keeps all the good of Crysis 2 and replaces its problems with POWERRRRRRRRRRRRRR. Where water in Crysis 2 was uninspired, here it ripples and foams realistically and casts encaustic light onto the surrounding environs. Like Crysis 2, 3 takes place in a war-torn New York, but 30 years have passed and the city is now an urban jungle, rife with flooding, dense foliage, and towering decrepit buildings that blur the line between urban and alpine landscapes. Every surface and object is modeled and textured in shocking detail, much of it can be exploded or knocked over, and the whole package is wrapped in a system of lighting, lens flairs, and weather effects so believable that at times it is genuinely hard to tell whether you are watching the game or a pre-rendered cutscene. Paralax mapped surfaces are back too, meaning that the ground outdoors shows physical deformities for details as small as fallen leaves. Look closely and you can see ambient animals frolicking in the ruins and insects flitting in the sun. This is possibly one of the best looking games of 2013, perhaps ever. It's also quite well optimized- my computer is very middle of the road and I can still flip most settings to high or better.Gameplay wise, Crysis 3 feels a lot like Crysis 2, which is a good thing. Power sliding, simplified suit controls, and mantling up ledges are all back, and you can also hack human and alien electronics (using a fairly inoffensive minigame). The roster of weapons has been expanded with a variety of over-the-top alien guns and human heavy weapons, and by the bow, a stealth weapon that is effective against all targets but carries very limited ammo. Players who felt Crysis 2 was a little too easy will be happy to know that Crysis 3 no longer hands out rocket launchers like fun-sized candies, and that the rocket launcher and remote explosives once again occupy the same slot, forcing you to be strategic as you explode everything. The visor of Prophet's nanosuit has also been retooled, with the option to track many more enemies and tag/identify targets from farther away. In other words, you will actually use it now.The story sees Prophet (who now seems to be in total control of poor old Alcatraz's body) rumbling through the jungle ruins of New York with a bitter, middle-aged Psycho (from the first game) attempting to shut down Cell, who have morphed from a uselessly inept PMC to a world-dominating power company by exploiting the energy of Ceph technology left in New York after the second game. Predictably, the alien threat returns and Prophet must fight humans, aliens, and a hostile environment to save Earth once more. It's predictable stuff, but the voice actors all appoint themselves well, the character models look great, and the settings are filmic in their dramatic detail. It's fun, is what I'm saying.Gushing aside, there are some issues. Vehicles play even less of a role in Crysis 3 than they did in 2. The \"watch Prophet do stuff in first person\" style cutscenes from 2 are back in even greater force, and while they are well executed, one still feels disappointed to see cool stuff happening that you aren't in control of. Performance varies widely by locale, and many players will be able to play the opening dock stage with all settings at full, only to have to turn them down once they arrive in the jungles of New York. The Ceph have also been toughened up to the point that avoiding them is generally the best bet, which seems frustrating after learning to take them down smartly in 2. Last but not least, you can sometimes catch enemies spawning, or worse, rubber-banding from one location to another. Several times I've heard an enemy who wasn't there loudly shout \"what was that\" then jerk from one end of the map where i'd left him to right next to me. This may be an issue with how the game handles path-finding and unseen enemy movement and might be resolved on a more powerful computer, I can't say.PROS:-Looks great-Plays great-More open and interesting to look at than 1 or 2CONS:-Fiddly enemy behavior-Not much in the way of reckless driving-Lacks first two games' epic soundtracks","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2013"}
{"product_name":"B005J5K9EI","description":"","reviewerName":"Tyler Johnson","summary":"It isn't perfect but it is definitely worth playing","reviewText":"I had my eye on Lollipop Chainsaw for a while. I had been following its development with much interest, mostly because of Suda 51's involvement. Once it released however,  some of the reviews I heard made me take a step back. There was just something about the premise of the game that wouldn't let me go though. How can a game about a cheerleader wielding a chainsaw against hoards of undead be bad? Turns out, it can't.Now, Lollipop Chainsaw is far from perfect, but none if its flaws are deal breakers. Many of the reviews I read talked about how terrible the controls and combat are. I've found that there is a growing problem in professional game reviewing, and that is many reviewers just aren't very good at video games. They will gripe and complain about game play issues that aren't a result of poor design, but of their own ineptitude, and I believe that Lollipop Chainsaw fell victim to this trend.To be fair, the combat starts off very limited. You have to unlock combos and power your character up to truly be effective, but it only took me going through the tutorial level to be able to afford the first really effective combos. Another supposed problem with the game is HOW you kill the enemies. If you can kill more than three zombies at the same time, the background turns starry and you're informed that you've just completed a sparkle hunt. Sparkle Hunting nets you more money and a higher score for your kills, and if you listen to some reviewers, it is practically impossible to do. Rest assured, this is not the case. The key to successfully sparkle hunting is finding the combos that work for you. My personal favorite was the Armadillo Spin, which is available very early on, and never stops being useful.Another point that the game has taken a lot of heat for is the fact that many of the zombies constantly spout lewd comments at Juliet, the main character. In my personal experience, zombies rarely lived long enough to actually speak, but the rest of the time I never noticed. If zombies in a video game making lewd comments offends you, than this isn't the game for you, though honestly, if that's the case, were you really going to pick up a game called Lollipop Chainsaw anyway?One of the things the game gets right are the characters. Juliet is blonde, busty, but thankfully never crosses into bimbo territory. Her decapitated boyfriend Nick, voiced to absolute perfection by the wonderful Michael Rosenbaum, is a joy to listen to, and their banter ensured that every second that I wasn't slaying zombies, I was laughing and smiling at their conversations. Juliet's family is varied and interesting, as is her Sensei, though I was slightly disappointed by the rather bland enemies. One thing Suda 51 usually nails are the antagonists, but in this they never become half as interesting as the protagonists.The graphics,sound design, and especially the soundtrack are all very much on point. If there is one thing that disappointed me, it is that Lollipop Chainsaw almost seems to go out of its way to make getting all the achievements/trophies in it as painful an experience as possible. The achievements range from boring grind fests, to insanely difficult. The achievement \"No Fear of Heights\" is especially painful, so be warned.Lollipop Chainsaw is a very enjoyable game that has a ton of replay value, and just a couple of blemishes. If I'm being totally honest, I enjoyed Suda's previous game \"Shadows of the Damned\" more than I did this game, just because they share many of the same elements, but they were better executed in Shadows. Regardless, if you know what to expect, you will not be disappointed in Lollipop Chainsaw. It is a very enjoyable game, if it falls into your wheelhouse, I recommend it. I can't say it is a must buy, but it is most certainly worth playing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2013"}

He either ends up dead or the enemies are dead before he lands a single blow he is so slow.  Not entirely sure when this happened as it was not that way in the beginning.  When calling the dog to combat the warrior freezes up entirely and is unable to move at all so the dog has had to go.  There are dialogue sections that are out of order such as Merrill talking about the fate of the keeper even before that quest is has been given, and other bugs that just make this second play through very tedious and boring.  If you played the first game, you will recognize that this game is a cut down version of that with a less of everything from skills to interactions with your team mates.  In the first game you could actually end up caring about the fate of your companions and that is much harder to do in the second game. Lack of an x button so you can actually see what you are picking up is annoying.  In the first game you could see if the the things you picked up was actually worth anything.  There is a lot of repetition of objects you pick up such stuff as raven feathers.  The flaws that were in the first game concerning making money are carried over into this game but since most of the stuff in the second game are junk anyway that might not be a big deal.  However, Hawke like the Warden is just a glorified junk man picking up stuff that really don't have much worth.  Maybe EA should have named him Sanford after Sanford and Son.  I loved the first game but have soured quickly on the second since the warrior is so unplayable.  It just has stopped being fun and there is no guarantee that the problem with him will not happen if a new game is started.  I played the first game over thirty time, but I don't see that happening with DA  2 unless the problems are fixed.  Lots of bugs in this game with even a mission that you can not complete as it simply isn't all there.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2011"}

{"product_name":"B005VBVQDI","description":"","reviewerName":"C. H. Mauricio","summary":"BANG for your buck!","reviewText":"Before Capcom's soul purpose in the video game industry is to annoy and piss off its fanbase (case in point, the cancellation of MEGAMAN Legends 3, re-releasing games at a content basis, shoving DLC that is on the disc you bought but can't access until you fork more dead presidents, and rebooting a franchise to a developer whose track record is iffy at best), they used to release their damn good (with the exception for one game in this compilation) games. Oh and may I add that they were complete games because game consoles then didn't shove DLC all over our faces.Such reminder of these games from years ago are Capcom's latest HD upscale romp with Devil May Cry HD Collection. A compilation of the first three DMC games with newly added trophies and wide-screen 16:9 gameplay. One video game generation ago, these games (well, I have to emphasize, two of them) were at the center of the golden age of visceral action games. DMC along with Ninja Gaiden and Shinobi, were challenging action games that forced the player to move with lightning fast precision to perform stylish attacks and evasion maneuvers. These games often forced the player to learn enemy patterns or to master the game's assortment of special moves in order to get high marks or to barely pass them unscaved.To say that this genre has died off this generation would be a complete farce. The Devil May Cry games (again, 1 & 3) are a legend in their own right and their HD reappearance only serves reason to why this genre flourished in the first place.As far as this game is concerned, all three titles all preserve their features (including DMC2's outfits by Diesel). Though keep in mind that part 3 is the Special Edition version which brought down the difficulty to Japanese version standard. They look pretty good in 720p but a strange decision was made with regards to the way menus were handled. They left them in their native 4:3 perspective when I'm sure it wouldn't take more time to upscale them like what they did to the gameplay. The cinematics, because they were rendered in SD 480i, look grainy and ugly which seems to be a plague running amok in these HD upgrades. However, the added trophy support ensures old players with a fresh new experience to once again, sharp up their demon slaying skills.You'll probably get the most mileage playing parts 1 & 3. Part 2 does suck, even without Devil May Cry in its name, its still a boring, worthless action game. In the tier of HD updates, the DMC HD collection sits somewhere in the 80% percentile in the way these games were treated. A bang for your buck at a relatively low price. The Devil May Cry HD is well worth your time and effort. Even if it has part 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002V16T0Q","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A wonderfully atmospheric game with some major flaws","reviewText":"The Good: Amazing atmosphere, great voice acting, decent story, unique weapons, decent length, looks amazingThe Bad: Story takes a dive toward the end, broken stealth, enemies are too hard to kill, some pathfinding issuesPost-apocalyptic games seem to be very popular these days and are ever more changing the FPS genre as a whole. Metro 2033 may not change it, but it does add incredible atmosphere and a dark interesting story that will keep you playing through this 12 hours adventure to the end. You play as a man named Artyom who lives in the Moscow metro system after a nuclear war destroyed everything in existence. Everyone is on the run, and hiding, from strange creatures, and no one can go to the surface due to flying \"demons\". You follow Artyom as he travels under, and above, ground to find a hidden nuclear missile silo to destroy the Dark Ones lair. While the story is enticing you never really find out who the Dark Ones are, or what they're even doing to the people of Russia. Not to mention the supremely disappointing ending that hardly satisfies.The game has some very interesting elements that make you really feel like you're fighting for your survival and scrounging around to make ends meet. The guns in the game are very original since they are hand made (especially the first guns you get) and they feel cheap and unreliable like any post-apocalyptic gun would be. As you make your way further into the game you can find pre-war guns that do more damage including guns that have silencers etc. There are sniper rifles, shotguns, and pistols in the game as well as throwing knives, grenades, night vision goggles. You get a battery charger in the beginning of the game that makes you recharge your battery for your goggles and flashlight. It doesn't feel like a nuisance since this is a post-apocalyptic game and this is something you'd expect.The guns feel very nice to shoot, but you have two different types of ammo. Pre-war bullets are used as currency in the game, but if you're running low on \"dirty ammo\" you can use your money as bullets to do more damage. This makes you search dead bodies for ammo, guns, gas masks, filter, health etc. I never really had to use the precious pre-war ammo until the very end of the game. You will probably only hit maybe 5 stores through the whole game to buy items so you don't have to preserve it as much as you think. However, ammo in a lot of places is scarce and it really makes you take your shots.While running and gunning sounds fun that's not all you do. There are stealth levels, but these are extremely broken and almost ruin the game (thus the lower score). Sneaking through enemy encampments isn't as easy as you think. Sure you can memorize an patrol route, find out where all the enemies are located, use throwing knives to silently kill, use silenced weapons etc., but it just doesn't work right. The levels are laid out wrong for this type of thing, and you have to be so precise and accurate with everything, and this includes staying in the shadows. You have a meter on your right hand watch that tells you how well you're hidden, but regardless if your in the yellow or not everyone will see you. You MUST be in the green or nothing matters. You can put out lights, shoot them out, but enemies will come charging even if you do this. I found this extremely frustrating and had no choice but to shoot my way out on certain levels.Using your compass makes finding your way pretty easy, but you have to actually switch to this and some times hold your lighter up to it to see it. This makes things hard when you're running from a creature, trying to maneuver your way through some maze, and switch back to a weapon to shoot. Shooting humans may be easy, but the creatures require so much ammo to take down it makes saving rounds a pain. No matter how powerful of a weapon you have some times it'll take three clips or more to take a creature down, and when you have like 5 or 6 coming at you this makes thing extremely difficult. Some areas require you to use a gas mask to breathe (especially above ground) and you have a timer on your watch that lets you know when to replace your filter. I still could not figure out when to do this right even at the end of the game. Some things just aren't clear in this game. If you take too much damage your gas mask will take damage as well and eventually break and you'll have to find a new one. This is no good when there aren't any around, and some times you won't see one for 2-3 levels. Regardless of these issues the game is still fun and exciting to play.The best part about the game, however, is the atmosphere. Boy is this game scary! Turn off all the lights and you're in for one scary treat! Just the way the game is designed with all the scary lighting, creature design, and the feeling of being alone. A lot of the times you are all alone and it really makes you cautious and think before you make any moves or enter any rooms. The sound design is superb, and the graphics look amazing. This is by far the best part of the game along with originality of the weapons. The main character is very generic as well as some other characters, but there are a select few that you will get attached too. Having a Russian language track option makes the game more authentic, but the English voice acting is just as superb.All in all Metro 2033 is an excellent game for FPS/survival horror fans, but don't come into this game thinking it's revolutionary per se Fallout 3. There are even some choice elements thrown in here such as helping a kid, but they are only a few and I wish they would have dwelled on this more. You should really only pick this up if you are into atmosphere and story otherwise stay away.NEW COPY: For a certain amount of time copies will include a code for the automatic shotgun that you can pick up mid way through the game. This shotgun is awesome and is faster than the double barrel, and will soon become your best friend.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"Brendan Ross","summary":"Guild Wars 2 Redesigns the MMO Experience","reviewText":"Arenanet has redesigned the MMO experience with Guild Wars 2.  Guild Wars 2 is less of a revolution or evolution, and more of a redesign of the entire MMO experience, taking elements which are familiar to the genre and creatively rearranging them, tweaking them, and reiterating them in a way that fundamentally changes the experience of the gamer according to a vision which places its primary emphasis on making gameplay fun, rather than something to be endured for the sake of gaining a reward.As a result, GW2 is both familiar and radical.  Nothing in the game is unfamiliar to a player who has some experience with the MMORPG genre of games.  GW2 features character classes, levels, stats, gear upgrades, instanced dungeons, instanced story quests, instanced group PvP, open field PvP, public quests/dynamic events, trading post economy, fast travel, crafting and so on - all very familiar elements from the genre.  The radical aspect of GW2 is how these familiar elements have been changed in the game so that the game orients itself primarily around gameplay-as-fun rather than primarily around gameplay-as-work-towards-a-reward.For example, the \"quests\" of the game consist primarily of dynamic events, which are similar to the \"public quests\" of Warhammer Online, but the \"tweak\" is that the game does not require grouping, and does not distinguish between players who are grouped and those who are not in any significant way.  Players can freely join an event that is taking place in a very organic, free-flowing way without having to form a group beforehand, or having to worry about whether they or other players are \"kill stealing\" (mob \"tagging\" does not exist, and every player gets \"credit\" for participating in the event).  The result is that the game flows very naturally (when it is working properly, more on that below) and fosters open and free cooperation between players, rather than players competing with each other over mob tags or resource nodes.  It also means that questing is no longer dominated by a player traveling to a quest hub, taking all of the quests offered there, and running down through the quests like a shopping list, then returning to the quest hub to turn in the quests and get the rewards - a scenario which more or less resembles running a series of errands, and is modeled around work, rather than the dynamic quest scenario which is oriented around core gameplay and is modeled around the event itself.  There are \"heart\" tasks located around the gameworld that are more similar to traditional MMO quests, but these were included in the game design simply to help direct people to the general vicinity of where a dynamic quest/event would begin, so that players could find them more easily.  At no point in the game is the player completing a shopping list of tasks as the primary game flow.Another example is the way gear upgrades work.  As with other MMORPGs, a central aspect of a character's power is derived from the statistics conferred on the character by its gear.  And, as with other MMOs, your character will upgrade its gear through quest rewards, items dropped as loot, crafting and so on.  However, unlike virtually every other MMO of this type, the gear progression does not continue endlessly once the character reaches the maximum level of 80.  Instead, it is relatively easy to obtain the high level statistical gear at level 80 (known as exotic gear).  For players who want to obtain a certain look for their character's weapon, there is a lengthy, time-consuming process involved for obtaining that particular look in the form of a legendary weapon, but this item does not give the player a substantial advantage over other players, and none of this gear (exotic or otherwise) is required to complete any of the content of the game - that is, none of the content is hidden away behind gear checks or similar mechanics that *require* players to improve their gear to a certain level in order to be completed.  In this way, the \"endgame\" of Guild Wars 2 is radically different from other MMOs, in that it does not revolve around an endless statistical progression gear treadmill, with content locked behind gear checks effectively forcing the players onto the treadmill if they wish to experience the content of the game.  Instead, top level gear is relatively easy to obtain, and there are long-term goals for players who want a more impressive aesthetic weapon as well - something which is voluntary and not required to access content.  The core principle here is, again, allowing the players to have fun, rather than requiring them to \"put in their time\" in order to be compensated/rewarded for their time, as they would be for paid employment.  This is a theme that runs right through every decision made in Guild Wars 2, and the result is a game that is familiar yet radical at the same time.Like any game, Guild Wars 2 has its flaws.  Bugs are common in games of this type, but unfortunately in the higher level zones (i.e., the zones beyond level 50 or so), the level of bugs is quite extreme (in some zones 25-35% of the content is not working properly).  This has happened likely because of the way the beta test was structured, with no proper ongoing closed beta but rather three distinct beta weekend events - the result of which was that higher level content was just not really tested externally.  Arena is working to solve these problems with nearly nightly updates, but at the present time they are still an obstacle to gameplay at these levels (which, to be fair, most of the players have not yet reached).  Another problem relates to the story quest line, which often features quests that are very overtuned in difficulty for a solo player to complete, leading to a good/great deal of frustration currently.  Again, Arena is addressing these on a case by case basis, but at this time it can be an obstacle for players.  And, finally, the highest level zones in the game, the ones for level 75+, are not nearly as inspired and interesting as the remainder of the zones of the game and generally feature one kind of enemy, in rather thick numbers, that most players find more irritating than any others in the game - something which can detract from the player experience at those levels.  Hopefully these problems will be addressed properly in the near future, so that they don't continue to mar the play experience, but as of the date of this review, they are serious enough to mark down to 4 stars.Overall, the main problem GW2 has, apart from the bugs I describe above, is that its approach may be too radical for the typical MMORPG player.  In its relentless organization around fun rather than work, it doesn't seek to replicate the \"unpaid job\" type of experience common to other MMORPGs, and eschews the Skinner Box, carrot-on-a-stick motivational design that informs these other games.  Because of this, I think many MMORPG players will find GW2 unsatisfying because it isn't what they expect from an MMO - it's too radical a departure for them from the existing template provided by other games.  GW2 is designed to be played in a very similar way to a single-player game:  for fun, when the player wants to, without the pressure of a monthly subscription which must be justified, or the schedule of a raiding guild which must be adhered to.  This is a radical departure for the genre, and many established MMORPG players will not like it, I think.  However, it is a very well made game, and it asks the right questions about where MMO design has been going for the past few years, and provides some answers about where it may want/need to be taken in the future.  Players who do not like (or have perhaps grown tired of) the \"standard design features\" of the typical MMO will probably enjoy GW2 very much, as well as players of single player games who have never liked the the design or play of other MMORPGs.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00GV4V8XC","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A refreshing JRPG experience that evokes nostalgia for the Squaresoft of yesteryear","reviewText":"I don't know about you, but I have sure missed the kind of PlayStation JRPGs, and specifically the Final Fantasy games, that Squaresoft published in the 90's. The many classics from that era had an intangible magic that is fairly rare in the industry these days. Thankfully, Bravely Default is a lovely gem that could easily be mistaken for some long-lost Squaresoft gem from that period, and playing it reminds me of the way it feels playingFinal Fantasy IXandXenogears. This is a special treat. Warning: somewhat long review incoming, either buckle up, or jump ship now if that's not your thing. Having become intimately acquainted with the eshop demo, as well as putting it quite a few hours into the main game by now, I feel confident in my ability to give an informative, honest assessment.The story in Bravely Default features four protagonists, all of which have backstories that any veteran of the genre would regard as painfully cliche at first glance. You get Tiz Arrior, a young man recently beset by horrible tragedy and great loss. He is joined by Anges Oblige, a sheltered priestess girl who must save the world by healing huge crystals through prayer, Ringabel, an amnesiac ladies man with a magical book, and finally Edea Lee, a spy for an enemy nation who joins the heroes at a later point (try to guess why she does this. Here's a hint, it's cliche, lol). Of course, political intrigue, giant elemental crystals, and world saving shenanigans ensue. It almost sounds like a \"Four protagonists walk into a JRPG\" bar joke, doesn't it? Thankfully, what Bravely Default's story lacks in innovation, it more than makes up for in execution. The writing in this game is, for the most part, very well done. The story is mostly coherent and moves along at a good pace with memorable events that make sense. The characters are all generally likable and developed well. Plenty of endearing humor offers a nice counterweight to the serious moments. There's a nice balance between freedom and structure, so you never feel strangled by linearity or lost with no guidance. Overall, Bravely Default is a very charming, well-written JRPG adventure. All of this is more than I can say for anyFinal Fantasy from the last several years(sadly), so Bravely Default gets a big thumbs up from me in its plot and story structure. It's very enjoyable to take in. It's a definite throwback to the classics of yesteryear and makes for a good adventure.To aid in the sense of adventure of the story are the visuals, all of which are influenced by hand drawn art, water color paintings, and old-timey children's fairy tale books. It's very unique, full of imagination, and quite beautiful. The visual designs of the settings in this game are nothing short of brilliant. Wondering around the various locales, all of which are quite unique, really reminded me of how I felt playing Final Fantasy IX for the first time. Amazing. The 3-D effect does even more to add dynamic impact to the visuals too. It's no stretch to say the awesome settings add a lot to the game's story. Akihiko Yoshida, known for his work designing characters in games likeVagrant Story,Final Fantasy Tactics, and the recentFinal Fantasy DS remakes, did the character designs in this game. To be honest, this aspect will probably be a love-or-hate thing for people. His stylized art tends to be. While some characters are kind of silly looking and clumsy (more on that later), I personally like the character design for the most part. All-in-all, Bravely Default is an undeniably gorgeous 3DS game.Let's talk about sound for a moment, and specifically the soundtrack. Let me put it this way... If you told me that the soundtrack in this game was some long-lost collaboration betweenYasunori MitsudaandNobuo Uematsufrom the 90's, I'd probably believe you. Seriously, Bravely Default's soundtrack is amazing. It has the striking emotive melodies characteristic of Mitsuda's music, and the lovely sophistication and elegant refinement of Uetmatsu's work. Every song fits its purpose perfectly for every situation/scenario/circumstance. Indeed, \"Revo\" nailed the soundtrack in this game. Other than that, most of the sound effects in the game are appropriately nostalgic. There's a surprisingly large amount of voice acting in the game, and thankfully most of the time it falls between acceptable and exceptional (keywords there being \"most of the time\").As a JRPG, Bravely Default works very well mechanically. All of the basics in the game are very well refined and play as well as any classic Final Fantasy game would. However, there are a couple twists in place that make this more than just an adequate FF clone. For one, the battle system features an \"action point\" system wherein each action, be it attack, use an item, etc. costs you 1 \"Brave Point.\" In \"Brave Mode,\" you can go all out up to a deficit of 3 BP, meaning you can attack an enemy four times in a single turn if you want. Beware though, because if still standing, the enemies get to wail on you for four turns in a row.  Then there's \"Default Mode,\" which is basically a turtle-up move that allows you to accumulate BP for later use, while greatly increasing your defense for that turn's duration. This system has a fantastic feeling of risk vs. reward that encourages and prizes smart strategy, and I appreciate that.The other unique aspect in this game is its robust job system. Anyone who has playedFinal Fantasy Vwill know what I'm talking about. Each distinct \"job\" or class has different stats and abilities and most (but not all) fall under archetypal roles (ie. White/Black/Red/Time Mage, Monk, Thief, Ninja, Knight, Swordmaster, etc), and you can change any character's class on the fly under most circumstances. There's a huge number of team combos you can achieve with this that not only allows for deeper strategy, but guarantees that every player can have a unique experience catered to their tastes. It's really great fun. Usually, I find bare-bones turn-based RPGs to grow rather boring shortly. Thankfully, the job system and Bravely Default combat modes makes this a very engaging RPG. Throw in unique streetpass features and an incredibly large amount of options that makes the game experience tailored to virtually any player, and you get a cocktail of smart design choices. All of this makes Bravely Default a unique, deeply refined JRPG that makes the experience stand out among its source inspirations.For the sake of being fair and all that, let's talk about some criticisms for the game. Like I said earlier, the character style will be a love-hate thing. Since the job system changes character outfits, the only constant distinguishing feature of the main characters is their face and their hair. Unfortunately, two of the main characters, Ringabel and Edea, have hair styles that look stupidly ridiculous, even for an anime character, which is a shame. Again, I usually really enjoy Yoshida's work, and it's *mostly* great here, but some designs fall short. Also, some \"job\" outfits look ludicrous in certain cutscenes. Try imagining a serious scene playing out while Ringabel is wearing the Las Vegas Elvis suit (complete with aviator shades) that the Performer job has, or the fox-mask wearing Ranger... You can't do it without laughing. Kind of ruins the serious vibe in those scenes. The pre-rendered cutscenes, while having stunning detail, feature characters with a bizarre, somewhat unappealing combination of chibi and realistic proportions and details that I'm not a huge fan of. It's a little off-putting if you ask me. The mechanics of the game are awesome except for one admittedly small thing that still really sticks in my craw. There's a special sleep ability you can use to make battles much easier. You replenish your supply by putting the 3DS is sleep mode for eight hours (pain), OR, pay REAL money in a micro-transaction. Now, to be fair, the game is balanced so you don't *need* it, but still... Call me old fashioned, but if I pay this much for a game, I expect every feature to be included, no strings attached. Micro-transactions in a game like this is just plain ugly in my opinion, and glaringly so in a game meant to salute past classics.  You stay classy Square Enix. This sort of stuff is why people these days call you an evil/incompetent out-of-touch corporation. None of these issues are \"game breakers\" per se, some are admittedly very nit picky (except for the microtransaction aspect), but they are worth mentioning for the sake of fairness.Bravely Default is, by and large, a great 3DS game, despite some nit-picks here and there. If I could be more specific, I'd rate this game somewhere between an 8.5-9 out of 10. In many ways, this game is a wonderful salute to the kinds of JRPGs Square made for the PS1 back in the day. In fact, I'd say that Bravely Default is to PS1 JRPG masterpieces whatRadiant Historiais to SNES JRPG masterpieces: a nostalgic homage while still offering enough new ideas to feel like a genuinely unique and fresh JRPG for the modern age. All things considered, I'd highly recommend Bravely Default to the majority of RPG fan/3DS owners who, like me, miss the kind of quality JRPG releases of yesteryear. Buy it, gather up your trusty four protagonists, and prepare to save yet another world in a new (but not final, sequel already confirmed) fantasy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2014"}

I had some time off recently and decided to indulge myself a bit in some old-school fun.  Just to get everything out in the clear, my review of this game is almost definitely biased - the Dragon Quest series provides a huge amount of nostalgia for me.Here's the short review:If you think that you'll like Dragon Quest IV, then you probably will.  If the idea of playing an 8-bit RPG with some minor updates sounds miserable to you, then you will probably hate it.If you want more data, then here's the longer review:The new version of Dragon Quest IV, of one of my favorite games as a small child, is pretty much exactly what a remake should be.  The graphics are completely redone (and in 3D), but keep the same feel as the original.  There are lots of bright and vibrant colors, and a wide range of characters, monsters, and environments.  Just like most of the games I actually enjoy on the DS, the stylus isn't used at all.  Neither is the microphone input or anything else funky.  Just screen real estate.The controls are very much streamlined when compared to the 8-bit version, updated to take advantage of some of the advances in video game interfaces that have happened over the past fifteen or so years.  In addition there are more modern conveniences that didn't really exist in the olden days, such as the ability to QuickSave instead of hoofing it all the way back to a King whenever you need to take a break.The gameplay is much faster paced than it was on the NES.  I don't have comparison data, but I'm pretty sure that the experience levels have been adjusted to provide a more easily accessible experience.  Dragon Quest IV isn't as much of a grind as it could be, and a very small amount of dedicated leveling is required - at least compared to the NES version.  The combat is also fairly simple RPG fare, consisting mainly of attacking, item use, and choosing from a variety of spells and skills - but not nearly as tedious as it was in the original version.The translation is also completely redone, which is always something that RPG nerds go crazy over.  I didn't find anything offensive about it personally, but things are much different in the new DS version.  The olde english is mostly out the window, and each different worlds in the game adopts an exaggerated real-world accent.  One chapter you'll be hearing everything in a crazy Russian tone, and the next chapter you'll be exposed to French or Scottish.  This will either be seen as charming or infuriating, depending on your point of view.Speaking of chapters, one of the coolest things about Dragon Quest IV (and a major innovation at the time) is the chapter system.  A brief prologue introduces the hero of the game, and then the main protagonist disappears until the fifth chapter - some fifteen or twenty hours later.  The chapters in between are used to introduce the supporting cast, who all unite in chapter five to team up with the hero to take down the evil in the world.Each chapter has a different feel.  In the opening frame you play as an aging castle knight named Ragnar, trying to rescue lost children.  Later on you'll meet Princess Alena, desperate to escape the safety of her castle in search of adventure.  The most original chapter sees Torneko Taloon building up an inventory in an attempt to become the world's greatest merchant.  You can do things the old fashioned way and search through caves and towers for treasure to sell, or you can focus on buying and selling - flipping your current inventory through markups at your store in search of big profits.In addition to the upgrades discussed, there's a decent amount of additional content.  There's an additional chapter after the main story is over, and a large bonus dungeon to explore.  There's a new character for your party with some cool abilities, and some tough new bosses at the end game.  There's plenty here to keep you going for a really long time.  This was all engaging enough for me to complete pretty much everything, but your mileage may vary.That's about it.  If you're into this sort of game, then I would highly recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2010"}

He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow.

Defreitas \"OK\"","summary":"Bioshock this is not.","reviewText":"In a word: Mediocre.In a sentence: This game has been compared to the Bioshock, Doom, and many other very well made games series, I find this to be an unfair comparison.In a paragraph: Going back to the year 1955 seems like this is an all to familiar concept with the likes of Michael J. Fox popping into my head but never the less this is exactly what these game developers having you doing.  The main premise of the plot is to stop the evil Russians from world domination, once again this seems like a plot that has been done and done and done to death.  In a nutshell the story is weak, and I didn't feel compelled to pick up the controller and finish the game at breakneck speed as I did with Bioshock series.  Games like Bioshock are akin to an addictive drug, I am not sure where but at some point when playing a well made game I allow myself to become  eating, sleeping and drinking deprived because I become too engrossed into the story of the game, this never happens with Singularity. Believe me Raven tries very hard to copy critical Bioshock elements, as an example leaving tape recorders with taped messages which are suppose to add to the plot but sadly most of the time they just say the same thing, E99 is bad/good, experimentation on humans is not good/bad, blah blah blah. The tape recorders are placed a lot in the beginning and some at the end, but not consistent and they add very little to the plot.  The other elements that the developers copy badly is the left hand TMD powerglove and the right hand control which is for the gun element.  The problem here is this powerglove looking device never seems to be as powerful at killing the mutated humans as the guns are at least not in the beginning to middle, so I found myself not using it very much.  Also the gun locker idea is a terrible construct; why only allow us to carry 2 guns? Due to this limitation they then force us to choose which two weapons we want, why???  If your going to have the ability to upgrade your weapon then once you find the weapon locker make them a single use item and the same goes for upgrading your TMD powers. On to the graphics Singularity uses the unreal engine which when applied here seemed a bit dated and a bit sluggish, as an example dead bodies twitch and jerk around long after they should. Ok ok I am harping on just the negative as there truly are a few bright spots, they created one big bad boy gun called the Seeker and I must say it is the coolest gun in the game, the gun actually slows time down and you have control over the bullets direction, this was a very fun and unique aspect of the game.  Here again though you get use this gun 3 or 4 times throughout the game and it never becomes a gun that you get to keep in your arsenal, once you run out of ammunition the gun isn't worth carrying anymore. Lastly, the story ends by giving you an ethical dilemma, which is fine but why incorporate this element only at the end? This could have been used several times throughout the game, but instead they decide to use this only once and for me adding it at the end seems like an afterthought.Some positives:  Seeker weapon was Great! Playing with the time aspect is also Great! Mostly the production value is very good.Suggestions to the game developers: More Seeker weapon time, a complete rewrite of the story is in order, Don't try so hard to be like another game, be inventive on your own.  Get rid of the weapons lockers and just allow the player to carry all weapons.  Make the TMD powerglove more powerful so that the player thinks of using this equally with the gun aspect.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2010"}

Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A Great Single-Player Experience With Loads of Fun","reviewText":"I haven't really written a review for a game in a long while, but I felt Singularity deserved one. Not many people have played this game, period, let alone on the PS3. It deserves so much more than that, so here is my two-cents.First off, the story: This game is set in 2010, when American special-ops go in to investigate radiation spikes on a seemingly uninhabited island near Russia's coastland. After an EMPlike blast forces our hero, Captain Nate Reinko, onto the ground of Katorga-12, the mysterious island locale of the game, things go the way of epic Sci-Fi. The island is the site of a previously unknown element called E-99, and the Soviet Union devoted huge resources to research of E-99 in the 1940's and 1950's so that they could establish themselves as THEE world power. E-99 is exponentially more powerful than atomic energy AND has trippy time-altering effects. Needless to say, disaster befell them long ago and you're left to figure out what went wrong and how to fix a new problem in the timeline. Singularity's story dabbles heavily in time-travel and alternate-timelines via \"Back to the Future\" ish story twists. Most stories that attempt to tackle the time-traveling mechanic beast end up muddled and confusing as a result. Singularity does not suffer this fate. The story is actually quite fantastic for what it is, and make no mistake, it is very campy in parts. That's part of its charm. I found myself in awe of just how well implemented time travel and alternate timeline related plot twists are used in the story. I for one am very big on good story in games, and this one does not in any way disappoint. The characters are pretty interesting, the setting and locale are compelling, and the endings are very impactful.The gameplay is solid throughout. All of the mechanics established in the FPS genre are here and implemented well and feel natural. The weapons are very fun to use and are interesting. Using a sniper rifle that can slow down time is awesome, and so is rolling a grenade on the ground into wherever you want. The other, more usual weapons like the assault rifle and shotgun are fun to use as well. The enemy AI is great, and so is their behavior. They act very lifelike, and I found that to be a nice touch. The mutant enemies are both scary and a blast to play with. The real treat is the Time-Manipulation Device, which allows you to do incredible stuff like freeze a giant bubble of time. That way, you can leisurely walk up to your enemies, casually pop off a round, rinse-and-repeat with the others, and when the bubble dissipates, they all fall down. This game really makes you feel like a bad@$$, and that is in large part due to the ridiculously awesome gameplay devices you're generously given.Lastly, the graphics and sound are very well done. The music is moody, while not being overbearing. Each setting achieves its goal of atmosphere, from the clean, distinctly Soviet-communist factory/lab environments of the past to the dilapidated, depressing current state of the island. Some of the native, mutated life of the island really reminded me of theMetroid Primegames, and so did the music. A nice comparison, if you ask me. One thing I really liked about the game was that the atmosphere always reached its goal of making me feel tense and cautious about what may or may not be around the corner. This suspense and dread is rarely executed well in games, and I have to give credit to Raven Software for doing just that.One thing I must point out that bugged me a little bit was the Russian language implementation. I LOVED the signs that were in full Russian. I didn't like substituting Russian letters into the English text simply because the letters are similar looking. Backwards N's and R's are abundant and it struck me as simultaneously unique and cheesy all at once. I have to point out that I speak a little Russian and that's probably why some of it gets to me a little. I mean, we're going to an island where everybody is a NATIVE Russian speaker, and yet they record their audio diaries in English with a heavy Russian accent? Gimme' a break. Most wouldn't find fault with that, as they don't know Russian at all, but I found it a little jarring. That's about my only jab I can think of for the artistic direction of the game.Singularity cannot be discussed without mentioningBioshock. Similarities to Bioshock are EVERYWHERE in Singularity, from the audio tapes that flesh out the backstory of major and minor characters alike, to the art-design of, well, everything in the game, to the plasmidlike abilities you get, to the upgrades you make to your character and his tools/weapons, even the main supporting characters and the roles they play to you and the overall plot is eerily similar to Bioshock (including a \"would you kindly?\" moment, making for one of the most impactful \"good guy\" conclusions I've ever come across in a game). They are ALL taken from Bioshock's textbook. Singularity pulls almost all of them off flawlessly, and this ends up being a big plus from me, as I really loved Bioshock. HOWEVER, I must say that Singularity's story seems much more focused on being a fun, \"cool\" sci-fi blockbuster adventure than the deeply philosophical, incredibly tragic tales thatBioshockandBioshock 2were. I don't say this as a negative, but it is worth noting that there is a big difference in tone and focus. Singularity's \"tragedies\" never touched my heart or got me thinking as deeply and so profoundly the way Rapture's sad tale did, not even close, DESPITE Katorga-12 being presented as a place befallen by tragedy and philosophy gone awry.Atlas Shrugged, this is not.Since it was developed by Raven Studio, the developers behind the masterpiecesX-men Legends,X-men Legends II: Rise of the Apocalypse,Marvel: Ultimate Alliance,Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, andStar Wars Jedi Knight III: Jedi Academy, I already knew the game would be another worthy installment, and now they have another game to add to an already impressive list of great games. It's so cheap now that I would say definitely BUY it NEW! We should be encouraging the publishers and developers to make these kinds of games. With its ridiculously fun and well implemented gameplay, its incredible, immersive atmosphere, to its very well-written and executed story, Singularity is a game worth playing. So for the sake of the motherland, buy it, teleport yourself into it, love it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2011"}
{"product_name":"Logitech G600 MMO Gaming Mouse, White","description":"","reviewerName":"Reviewman","summary":"It's terrible","reviewText":"I don't think I'll ever get used to this mouse. I bought it to help control some of the interface buttons in GW2, but it's so complex I'm back to the keyboard.First problem - Size. I imagine I have a standard hand size. Was this thing designed for skinny giants? My thumb isn't close to long enough to push these buttons. I'm forced to hover my hand over the top of the mouse to use all but two side buttons.Second problem - 3rd mouse button. I must click this button a hundred times an hour on accident. When your third finger leaves mouse button 2 to use the wheel or it's functions the fourth finger is going to click the third button my accident every single time. So now my ring finger is off the mouse and onto the mousepad.Third problem - Mouse 1, 2 and 3 don't feel like clicks. There's almost no gap between the button and it's switch. This contributes to normal finger weight accidentally pushing the mouse buttons. There's little vibration feedback, and the click is so quiet you'll not hear it. So I'm not really sure if I even clicked the button most of the time.Fourth problem - Extremely poor G9-G20 button design. Again, I can't reach any but the middle buttons to begin with which leads to not being sure what button my fingers are on if I move off them. Despite the two middle buttons having tabs, I can't feel if my finger is on them or not because the buttons also have edges that feel like... yep... tabs. Seriously, I have to look at my mouse now to know where my fingers are. Sure if i'm surfing I have time to figure this out, but in the middle of complex combat when you're dodging and strafing it's extremely difficult. I think these buttons need to be placed in a much deeper concave to really work well. Or, just get rid of four of them and make the others larger. Anything but trying to pack 12 buttons in such a small area.Overall I'm disappointed. It doesn't work for me, it's not ergonomic the way I have to use it, it feels like really cheap plastic. I don't really care about the money spent, but can't think of a positive thing to say about this device. Unfortunately I never found this mouse out of box at any store I visited before buying. The box design is such that it lies in the box forcing you to hover over the mouse and not at any angle you would use it at. So it feels great until you go to use it.I still love Logitech, no matter what my experience with this mouse was.Update after 2 weeks of use:Everything in my initial review still holds true, with some additional negative feedback.I programmed the mouse wheel left-click to change weapons, and click it by accident all the time. This is really painful and has interfered with my gaming so much it's now going to be another useless button for me. On a mouse with so many buttons, I'm running out of USABLE buttons.Maybe I'm blind, but I just now discovered the G7 and G8 buttons located beneath the mouse wheel. Not lit, colored black with black labels. Wow. I have no clue how anyone could possibly use these buttons in a game without removing their hand from the mouse to push them. Someone with a finger sticking out of their palm must have placed them there.Of all my gripes, the worst one isn't about the design of the G600. The G600 software/drivers is causing LAG in my keyboard. I initially thought it was LAG in the game, I'm pushing buttons without the corresponding game action (cast, move). I'm pushing the key two or three times to get a spell off while in combat. I blamed the game for the last two weeks thinking they deployed a bugged patch, but after some testing figured out it wasn't the game - it was the G600 causing a conflict with my keyboard. I have a top notch gaming rig getting 150 FPS in BF3 and I get lag from a mouse.I'm being completely honest in this review. I wouldn't recommend this device to anyone and have used it long enough where I should have gotten used to it. I would still buy Logitech, but will be much more critical and demand a hands on before purchasing.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2012"}

Having finished GT5 and having logged many hours on a friend's Forza3 I was ready for the \"Next Generation\". Well this surely is NOT it! Using the Logitech DFGT wheel makes this game frustrating to \"operate\" (to use the word \"play\" makes it seem as if it's fun and IT IS NOT FUN).In a complete opposite from Forza3 and GT5 there is no connection between player and car, changing settings seemed like it would help, and I did in fact find a setting that fixes all the issues and here it is: \"Press the eject button and re-insert the GT5 disk!\"...it's that easy.p.s. if this game were any good they would have launched a demo...UPDATE:I began playing this game again after the patch (which loaded despite the PS Network being down), and it made a huge difference. I can say I'm enjoying it. I don't think it will prove better than GT5 or Forza 4 (when it's released), but after the fix it delivered on what I was looking for - some new racing fun.Post fix change = 2 Stars before, 4 Stars after.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000038IFX","reviewerName":"Steven Rinck","summary":"A mix of very good and very bad","reviewText":"Xenogears is an odd game that manages to both excel and fail horribly at the same time.GRAPHICS / VISUALSFor the time it came out in, the graphics are decent.  When exploring sometimes becomes difficult to navigate when underground though, becuase the low-res washed out \"rock/earth\" textures all blur together making it difficult to tell if something is a wall, or has something you can jump onto, etc.  Also, while the game allows you to move the camera, it's just a token gesture since you can't change the elevation or distance.  Oftentimes you'll be completely unable to see the character as he goes between two tall buildings or things like that.The game features some anime cutscenes which are, unfortunuately, mostly worthless.  They're well drawn, but are often nothing more than something like 2 characters staring at eachother for 5 seconds; with the exception of the ending almost no plot ever happens during them.The combat visuals, however, are great for its time.  The characters do more than just move up and swing a sword.  You can chain different moves together (and learn deathblows, which are powerful combinations) that are usually visually appealing.  For instance, a character will run up, punch, jump in the air and do a sping kick, sweep the enenmy as they land and then finish off with a headbutt.GAMEPLAYWhile the combat graphics are nice for its era, it also makes the battles take too long (and boy are they frequent, often 1 random encounter/ 2 seconds of movement).  It's like final fantasy summons all over again, making each combat last minutes upon minutes...even when you fight the enemies from level 1 when you're level 60 it still takes forever.There is a bit of load time anytime you change rooms/go into your character menu etc. Very annoying.My 2 biggest complaints are:The dialogue is waaaaaaay too slow.  There is a lot of excessive dialogue, a lot of repetition, and it comes on the screen so slow you'd think a 4-year old child was typing it.  Sometimes you will have to go through an hour and a half worth of this only to get to a difficult part in the game, die, and have to go through all of that dialogue again without the chance to save in between.Secondly, as many reviews here have pointed out, the 2nd disc is drastically different.  I thought people were exaggerating; they were not.  It happens suddenly.  Exactly at the point you put the second sic in, most exploration is taken away from you.  A character literally sits in a chair and tells you what happened.  It becomes 1 hour of dialogue, then fight.  2 hours of dialogue, then fight, etc.  You get to explore again though right before the very last dungeon.CHARACTERS / STORY / PLOTThis is where the game is good...for the most part.In typical squaresoft fashion (or is it just all Japanese RPGs?) the main character is fairly UNlikable.  He's whiny, immature, a jerk even though he means well, and at times a bastion of self-sacrifice and purity in the name of good willing to risk everything for some small good and pulling it off through rediculous Deus Ex Machina.Fortunately, in typical squaresoft fashion, the supporting cast is well done.  There's a suprising depth to most of the characters, above and beyond most games I've seen.  Most are mature, and the game itself brushes with some mature topics of innosence, when is war right/justified, the cost of it and what its worth to end one.The story is a bit overlarge.  It's good, but needed an editor to trim it down a bit as it just gets too big for its britches by the end of the game.Overall I enjoyed the game.  I'm glad to have played it, but some of the gameplay problems means I have no desire to ever play it again.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2006"}

Jeanclerc \"Reader, Listener & Obsessive...","summary":"Expensive Yes, but the Results Pay Off","reviewText":"When I upgraded to an XBox 360, I initially attempted to use my old Linksys wireless game adapter to connect to XBox Live (XBL).  On paper, it seemed that there would be no difference between wireless access points, so why drop the extra money on the official Microsoft adapter?Well, the Linksys was a disaster with the 360.  I would have to reboot it almost every time I fired up the 360 and the connectivity would get dropped frequently.  I have a working understanding of networks but was unable to diagnose why this was occurring.  Eventually I realized that I didn't want to waste hours trying different network and physical configurations - I wanted to get online, stay online and play games!So I ordered the official XBox 360 Wireless Network Adapter and have been very pleased.  Plain and simple, it does what it's supposed to do - connects with no messing around and then stays connected as long as I want to.  Setup was very easy - just plug it in and it finds your wireless network.  Entering WEP/WPA security strings were a little tricky (the included instructions aren't clear, but you need to enter the hex string of characters, not your actual plain English passphrase), but once it's finished once, you forget about it for good.It's definitely debatable whether or not this wireless connectivity should be pre-installed on the 360 - basically, you're forced to pay an extra $100 to get the most out of your console.  But if you plan on being online with your 360, then this adapter is the only way to go.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2008"}

After contacting Microsoft and hearing what probably a few other hundred people have have heard that they're going to release a newer version that would accept the network I thought \"Hey that's great can I send this and get the newer version since I just bought this adapter\", but not only are they not giving out a release date of this supposed newer version bought you have to repurchase the damn thing.  I'm sorry but after paying [...] for this and hearing that it really pisses me off so now I'm just using an Ethernet cable plugged to my computer and going that way.

{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"JJ4prez","summary":"Simply fantastic *no spoilers*","reviewText":"Let's take a step back, visualize yourself playing San Andreas back in the PS2 days... now open your eyes and feast on the visuals and game play GTA5 offers. I wasn't a big fan of GTA4, crappy dialogue, terrible side missions, boring story (for the most part), and horrid car controls. GTA5 bring all of GTA4's negativity, the map the size of Read Dead Redemption and GTA4 combined, LA Noire's facial and body movements, and the combined efforts of Red Dead Redemption, Max Payne 3, and the GTA style shooting all into one game. So much experience over the generation has lapsed into this fantastic piece of entertainment that Rockstar North has created.Let's get started,Game-play:- Driving is a complete overhaul from the past GTA games. It's not the same, and it's for the better. Cars no longer drive like boats, simply put. It feels like modern car racing type controls/handling - which is amazing.- Car selection is great like usual, from rugged pos vehicles, to super cars, to big rigs, to submarines, to cranes, you name it. If it has a steering wheel, you can drive/operate it.- Shooting is amazing. Of course it still has it's GTA-like mechanics, so the guns don't have a weight to it, but they are easy to operate, customizable, and there is finally a WEAPON WHEEL (think RDR) that is slow motion (same as tuning radio channels) while you play it's semi-real time and extremely smooth and amazing. Very proud to see the big changes from GTA4.- They did a great job with swimming, diving is a good way to get away from cops.- The story is amazing, in my opinion, the best story dialogue in gaming since forever. Far Cry 3, RDR, The Last of Us, Uncharted 2, Bioshock, etc are also very good ones. GTA5 has one of, if not the best, story lines this generation. Trevor is hands down the BEST protagonist in any video game thus far in gaming in my honest opinion. He's crude, fun, nasty, over the top, and everything else. I think he's even better than the antagonist from Far Cry 3, Vaas.Controls:- Movement is almost the same as the rest of the GTA games. You still have that somewhat clunky movement when making turns when running or walking. It has been fine tuned a bit from the past GTA games but don't expect much.- Jumping is pretty much the same as GTA4. You can jump (awkwardly of course) into anything. If it's reachable, you can most likely get to it in some way or fashion. It's kind of stupid when you jump and miss and just hit something and fall down.- Actual control layout is okay, there is so much going on the controller at one time it can be cumbersome to actually operate it correctly. You eventually get used to it, flying takes some getting use to. I wish it was like Battlefield, but that's a long shot. However, aiming really has improved.- Shooting in a car is real tricky at first. Make sure you go and practice at a gun range and your accuracy becomes A LOT better, especially in a car.Visuals/Video/Audio- They did an amazing job with audio. From NPC interaction, AI, or just story characters, they deserve any kind of rewards of any video game this year just for audio. By far the most advanced audio recognition thus far in the generation. NPC story characters, Like Lamar, or Ron, or Wade, or Michael's kids, is just phenomenal.- Visuals are great. I am a big PC player (built my own rig) so I was going into this thinking a PS3 game. This game shines a lot like The Last of Us does. A huge amount of detail in everything, from graffiti, cracks in the highway, damage/construction to buildings, etc...They spent A LOT of time polishing this game - and it shows. Graphics are top notch for a console that has been out for 7 years now and is working with hardware inside from 2005.- The landscape is beautiful. From the city, to the shores/beach/under water, and the country. All well done and very recognizable.Overall appeal- This game should last people quite awhile. I have played around 12 hours and I am only 25% of the way done with the story. That's not even the side missions and such. They added in a lot of things like challenges, tennis, golf, etc...similar to things found in RDR (hunting, racing, etc).- This game actually matched up to the hype - unlike GTA4. Not that GTA4 was bad, but it definitely is not a 97-99 metacritic game. GTA5 definitely is.- Buying property, having nice homes/cars, golfing/playing tennis, swimming, flying, parachuting, going to strip clubs, buying new clothes, haircuts, gun range, bike riding, hiking, boat riding, jet skiing, you name it, it's in there, and boy is it fun!So my conclusion basically is, it's a great, entertaining, fun game. Lose your mind in the story, the game play, the fun, and just have a good time.Thanks for reading.JJ","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2013"}

You begin the game in a zombie infested London with absolutely nothing in your possession. You, with the help of another suvivor who guides you along using security cameras, must scavenge for weapons and supplies all while doing your best at avoiding the undead masses.&#34;ZombiU&#34; is the polar opposite of games like &#34;Left 4 Dead&#34; and &#34;Dead Island&#34; and last few &#34;Resident Evil&#34; entries.

Mizov","summary":"A Glorified Shooting Gallery - But Still Awesome","reviewText":"I've been eagerly looking forward to the new installment of Max Payne for quite awhile. I even went to PAX East this year to try it out in person. I'll pair the good against the bad and you guys can decide for yourself from there.THE GOOD:The Story: Max Payne's saga is a sad one as you well know if you had played the previous two installments. In this entry, Max has his rock bottom and he's a pill popping alcoholic. Rockstar knows how to craft a tight story and show some serious depth to characters. Max is no exception and his bleak story draws you in from beginning to end. His one liners and quips are also fantastic. He's a noir character through and through.Graphics: The environments, character models and areas look amazing. All of them are highly detailed, always fresh, and a lot of fun to blow guys away in. The slums of Sao Paolo look particularly amazing. It's a really amazing set piece and Rockstar has delivered a beautiful games in spades.Sound: The acting in the game is top notch, the characters all sound great, the action is intense, the music is cool and overall it's a strong showing.Multiplayer: The multiplayer is fast, intense and really cool. The various loadouts you get to use really make for a variety of ways to play. The updated Rockstar Social Club is great for setting up your crew and checking out your stats. The multiplayer modes vary a bit as well, making for some different, fun experiences. This will likely be where the majority of people spend their time.THE MIDDLE:Bullet Time: It's back and it's still as cool as you remember. For awhile. Once the nostalgia and novelty factor wear off you'll find that it's sometimes easier to do things in real time rather than diving all over the place. I don't know if it was just me but the enemies in this have some seriously pinpoint accuracy and if you dive out, you either hit everyone and kill them of you're screwed.Checkpoints: I found myself replaying a lot of areas after a stupid death because the checkpoints don't come as often as I'd like. I'm sure I'll get BETTER in time, but, it was still pretty annoying to do the same \"super cool jump through the window into the kitchen\" move three times.THE BAD:Repetitive: The game is a linear shooting gallery through various locations. If the story/graphics didn't fall under \"good\" this would be a major blow to the game. There isn't a ton of variety, but, the strength of the story, acting, sound and graphics carry it though.No Grenades: The bad guys get grenades. I want grenades.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2012"}

I like all the Resident Evil games, but these two Sci-Fi/Horror hybrids have taken things to a whole new level. The sound design alone, especially if you have your surround sound speakers cranked up, provides enough scares to have you calling for your mommy. I had just replayed the first Dead Space before starting this one and you'll notice right away the improved graphics, new weapons and creatures, along with a much larger and more interesting environment. Oh yeah, our hero Isaac Clarke talks this time around. I wasn't sure if this would be a good or bad thing, but we get more into his fractured psyche and it works surprisingly well.Mass Effect 2, God of War III and Red Dead Redemption are all great games that I'm currently playing, but if I had to pick only one PS3 to play for the rest of my life, Dead Space 2 would be it. It's truly rare when a sequel can outdo something as near perfect as its predecessor. Anyone giving this thing less than 4 stars should be sent to Titan and torn limb from limb by a horde of necromorphs.As of now, all PS3 versions are the Limited Edition and come with the prequel game, previously only available on the Wii, called Extraction. It's a shooter that utilizes the Playstation Move equipment that you have to buy separately. It can be played with a regular controller as well, but I doubt it would be as much fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2011"}

I have noticed that the blue paint slightly wears off after awhile. I am not a hardcore gamer and I probably use this controller only about 2-3 times a week, yet with light use there comes a heavy toll on the appearance of the controller. It would be fine if the controller was a solid cast of blue, yet the under coat is a pale blue plastic, which makes the chipping and fading look much worse. If you do not care if your controllers look nice, and you don't mind getting some flakes of blue on your hands every now and then, then get this controller, it is a really nice shade of blue and works perfectly.

Melvin","summary":"Comfortable and long lasting","reviewText":"I, like many of you, have gone through countless controllers from numerous versions of consoles over the years.  Buttons fail, batteries die, and the controller becomes unusable.Thankfully, this PS3 controller was built a bit better than those older controllers.  I've had these two controllers for well over 4 years now and everything still works fine.  Battery charge is still acceptable (I use the Energizer two-remote charger, also located here on Amazon) and doesn't seem to drain very fast.  The buttons and analog sticks are still tight and function as expected.  Add to the fact that this remote works through Bluetooth and you have a fairly nice package.  No wires to fuss with and nothing to fray (or gnawed on by your pet).The controller itself, however, isn't the most comfortable over long periods of time.  Yes, it is better than the big and bulky XBOX controller - sorry for you XBOX controller fans - that thing is the size of a brick.  This controller, however, slowly becomes uncomfortable as you hold it.  I find myself shaking one hand or the other out during gameplay as my fingers begin to tense up.  I'm not saying it is a bad design - just not ergonomic for the long gaming sessions.  I'm not sure how they could make it better - but I am holding out hope that the PS4 controller is better to hold for extended periods.Overall, I'd recommend this remote vs some of the cheaper 3rd party remotes, as it works and works well without any issue.  I've not always said that in the past for other gaming consoles (I have owned numerous 3rd party remotes, as the one released with the gaming console was inferior) but can say that Sony came up with a reliable and useful remote that isn't designed to fail after some use.  That being said - these are a bit more expensive than 3rd party remotes, but as the saying goes - you get what you pay for.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2013"}

That is the score I reserve for a game that is just so incredibly fun or enjoyable that it goes above and beyond my expectations. While Little big Planet 2 has flaws, it is also insanely fun.If your childhood was anything like mine, you made use of almost anything laying around when you were playing with your friends. A cardboard box that your family's refrigerator came in would become a space ship or a fort and soda cans & toilet paper rolls were used to outline a race track. You'll see a similar aesthetic in LBP2 as corrugated cardboard or bits of wood are used to create wondrous levels.In terms of gameplay mechanics, LBP2 offers very little that is new. You can run, jump, move between the foreground and background, grab onto certain objects and with the use of power-ups you can pick up objects, fire projectiles or swing around in a manner similar to Bionic Commando on the NES. While you get a nice variety of levels and challenges you have probably played something like this game before. The story is pretty forgettable and playing through the game by yourself is good but not original.So why am I giving this game 5 stars? The multi-player. A 4 player game is just insanely fun and some of the levels are designed where you need two, three or four players to access certain areas and score key items. Players can interact with each other in a variety of ways like grabbing each other, pulling each other around, latching on to each other in the middle of a jump or the always fun slap. My friends and I are very guilty of slapping each other for 20-30 minutes on end. More times than I can count my friends and I could not talk simply because we were so busy laughing while playing LBP2.The other strength of LBP2 is also it's Achilles Heel. The Community. Players can create their own levels and publish them for others to try out. You can search for new levels or search by highest rated levels or even levels picked by the game developers. Some of the community levels are truly brilliant and this effectively means that LBP2 has infinite replay value as there will always be new levels for you to play. With that said, not every person out there is a good level designer. Some people just copy other levels and publish them for a cheap trophy and other levels are just plain broken. Fortunately players can rate and leave reviews on levels so you can easily avoid levels that are just a waste of time.As it stands, Little Big Planet 2 is currently my favorite game for the PS3 and well worth picking up. In fact, it would be a shame to pass this game up without at least trying it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2011"}

Those who side with good will get to follow Frodo's journey through Middle-Earth, playing in battles inspired by both the books and the movies. Or join evil to find out what may have happened if Frodo had failed to destroy the One Ring, as you fight your way with Sauron back across the map in an attempt to destroy Rivendell, the Shire, and all that is good in the world.You can play as a warrior, scout, mage or archer.View larger.The online multiplayer mode allows for massive battles with up to 16 of your friends.View larger.Building off the model Pandemic used with Star Wars: Battlefront, Lord of the Rings: Conquest provides you with a first and/or third person shooter style of game that not only lets you command strategy, but also lets you control the players in the center of the action. Participate in the Battle of Isengard as an Ent or fight Saruman at Orthanc as Gandalf himself. Take on the Nazgul as Aragorn while still protecting Frodo, or battle at Pelennor as a Rohirrim cavalry soldier. And that is just for the good guys!In Conquest you will have to play many different characters in order to win. And it isn't always such a balanced match, as you will find yourself destroying towering siege engines and taking on hulking oliphaunts with your companions. You can choose to play all the heroes you love, or fight as a Nazgul tasked with killing Frodo and stretch your powerful wings as the Balrog himself in your battle for Moria.Pick Your Own Style of PlayIn the game, you'll be able to play as one of four different character classes. Choose the melee-based Warrior or Scout for up-close action, or pick the Archer or Mage to perform devastating ranged attacks. There is also talk of a 'special' class called the Guardian to give gamers a third choice. But don't worry about getting locked in, as you can actually change which character class you're playing on the fly, in the middle of the game's various objective-based missions.Each class of characters has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as unique special abilities. Playable units range from grunt soldiers, which are the weakest, to captains, which are the strongest AI units in the game other than the heroes. You also get to order in air strikes using either eagles or fellbeasts. Even better, players will be able to mount the occasional horse, unless they've chosen evil, in which case they will have to master the skill of riding a fearsome warg.Multiple Modes for Endless FunAs in Battlefront, Lord of the Rings: Conquest has enormous competitive multiplayer modes, including Conquest, Capture the Flag, and Hero Deathmatch. In addition to these classics, Conquest adds a Ring Bearer mode, in which one player tries to stay alive as Frodo against a host of ringwraiths, and Stronghold in which you fight on various maps in a Risk-style battle for territories. Fortunately, you won't be limited to roaming around with only your teammates, however, as battles occur in large scale with non-player combatants joining in the fray.Conquest allows online play with up to 16 players for massive battles with all your friends, or in two-player cooperative mode. Players can also play locally with up to four players competitively, or two-player co-op on a split screen. When in the game itself, fans will get the thrill of hearing Howard Shore's score for the films accompanying the action, and both good and evil campaigns are narrated by Hugo Weaving, who played Elrond in the movies.You can choose to play either good or evil, each with different endings.","reviewerName":"Saito Hajime \"My reviews are short and sweet....","summary":"What's with the good reviews?","reviewText":"This is one of the worst games I've ever played.

I consider Red Dead Redemption one of the greatest games ever made. And the PS2 era of GTA games revolutionized gaming and created an entire genre. Even their \"failures\" like LA Noire and GTA IV were still interesting and innovative. And now, they have taken all of the lessons they've learned from their previous games and made a masterpiece.Midnight Club racing games have helped improve the vehicle handling and driving. No more swinging wildly around the road or floaty handling. The cars have weight and mass. This isn't \"arcade\" handling, but it's fair and makes sense given the vehicle you are driving.The way the game plays and unfolds is very similar to Red Dead Redemption. Within the main story quests are tons of side missions and random events that are always fun to participate in.Shooting mechanics have taken a page from Max Payne 3, and are much more fun and challenging. Slow motion abilities give you the edge you need in intense firefights or chases.And the story and writing are comparable to anything you would find in a high end Hollywood production. The characters are multilayered, there's twists and turns that come organically, and the dialogue is often howlingly funny. It all culminates in multiple endings that all feel fitting to the story and not just tacked on to give the player choices.It's really just a great game. There's tons to do, and it's fun to play as the three different characters. This game, much more than GTA IV, feels like a true sequel to San Andreas and the other previous generation games. It builds on that frame work, and is the natural place for the series to go.

{"product_name":"B001D7798A","description":"Cryostasis: The Arctic Circle, 1968. Alexander Nesterov is a meteorologist sent to uncover the mystery of the abandoned ice-breaker ship, North Wind. This steel beast once fought for its country, but during a dangerous mission it drifted into an ice trap that slowly froze to death every living thing on board. A routine investigation quickly turns into a battle for survival against both the freezing elements and the terrifying evil that inhabits the lost ship.  Cryostasis takes players on a terrifying trip into the unknown as they explore the dark, frozen, claustrophobic corridors and unlock the shocking secrets of the North Wind.","reviewerName":"Christopher Deweese","summary":"This Is No Bioshock","reviewText":"There has been a lot of talk that Cryostasis is a spiritual successor to Bioshock, given all the water effects and feelings of being stranded in a deserted environment.  Well, that's pretty much where the similarities end in my opinion.  Cryostasis is essentially a survival-horror game that is very eery, has some innovative elements, and has some features that don't work so well.This game is a bit of a resource hog.  I tried turning everything up to high with AF and AA on, but the frame rate got so choppy it was barely playable.  With AF and AA off, things got better (specs: Q6600 @ 3.0ghz, 4gb ram, 8800gt, XP 32bit, 24 inch monitor 1920x1200).  Graphically, the game looks pretty nice.  You can see frost crystals littering the walls of the ship.  The water effects are pretty.  The game is fairly monochromatic, but you're in the arctic.  What do you expect?Game play involves your character investigating what happened on an ice breaker that became locked in the ice.  You traverse various corridors trying to find some answers.  You have what is called \"mental echo\" ability, which allows you to see what the dead experienced right before they bought the farm.  While in the \"echo state\" you can correct the mistakes that the dead made and hopefully release their spirit (or something like that).  This is probably the most innovative feature of the game.  Also, you have to watch your body temperature so you don't freeze to death.  Find light bulbs and torches to warm up with (which are littered throughout the ship) and you'll be fine.Combat isn't so great, especially melee.  It feels very imprecise and looks like you are basically punching air.  You never really feel as though you land any hits.  The \"zombies\" that attack you are dead crew members (pretty standard).  You get access to a few guns (no cross hairs, you have to use iron sights to aim).  This is where Cryostasis is a bit lacking.Overall, this title is still intriguing.  I would say more things work than don't work in terms of game play.  For the price, it's worth a ride around the arctic circle.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2009"}

Unlike other game environments that serve as nothing more than a visual backdrop, the devastating Helghan climate takes a notable toll. And, worst of all, the Helghans know exactly how to use the planet against you.The in-your-face perspective comes to life as you take aim with exotic new weapons and mainstays from the previous games, including the M82-G assault rifle.

{"product_name":"B00CAY50CW","description":"A group of terrorists calling themselves The Engineers have had enough of US military occupation all over the world and initiate a terror ultimatum called the Blacklist - a deadly countdown of escalating attacks on U.S. interests. When our nation is threatened, the president turns to one man and one man only: Sam Fisher. Armed with state-of-the-art technology, top-of-the-line-gadgets, deadly combat abilities and an elite team known as the 4th Echelon, Sam Fisher holds nothing back to get the job done through whatever means necessary to stop the Blacklist countdown before it reaches zero. Splinter Cell Blacklist offers enhanced gameplay options on the WiiU. The Gamepad replicates Sam&#x2019;s OpSat, allowing the player to operate gadgets such as tri-rotor drones and the sticky cam through touch and motion based inputs. The Wii U GamePad allows for faster reaction times, letting the player mark enemies, switch weapons, quick reload and choose gadgets to adapt to any situation, among other features.","reviewerName":"penduin","summary":"Superb stealth action","reviewText":"I'm a long-time Metal Gear fan, and this is my first Splinter Cell.  I was worried I'd be a bit lost, but have had no trouble diving in.  There are story elements I'd understand differently if I'd played the previous installments, but I never feel out of the loop.Nevermind the story though, gameplay is what matters!  Like Metal Gear, there are many approaches to any given situation, which is wonderful for someone like me who enjoys sneaking around and knocking people out but is pretty bad at combat.  The game celebrates different play styles and encourages replaying missions with different approaches.  I'm comfortable sticking with my &#34;ghost&#34; profile for now, (no kills, nobody spotting you) but once I finish the game, I'll have to try out &#34;panther&#34; (unseen, deadly) and &#34;assault&#34; (open combat) as well.  These are not settings you choose - they're rankings you earn based on your choices and actions.  My Metal Gear approach of knocking out or evading guards and then quickly slipping by tends to earn me mainly &#34;ghost&#34; scores, with a touch of &#34;panther&#34;.In Metal Gear terms, Blacklist is most similar to Peace Walker - replayable missions, customizable suit and loadout (actually much more deep and flexible in that area) and plenty of side-challenges apart from the main story, including online multiplayer.I can't speak for everyone, but I can say that any fan of Metal Gear will also be a fan of Blacklist.  There are many differences, some more obvious than others, but after a mission or two you'll be right at home, having a blast sneaking past terrorists and foiling their schemes.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002C0VNVG","reviewerName":"Adol A.","summary":"A good concept for an RPG, but set back by several unfair problems.","reviewText":"Originally, I gave this game a two star rating and talked about how annoying the game was. However, I haven't even finished one of the four chapters in the game. I decided I'd redo this review after I have at least beaten the game. Guess what? I did. My rating is still at a two though, and here's why.Pros:+Open world - There's a lot of places to explore in this game, and a lot of secrets to find. However this is set back later.+Several different things to do in the game - You can smith, do alchemy, learn magic, pick pockets, pick locks, gut animals, sneak, and so on.+Infinite capacity for carrying objects - For people like me, this is essential. I love to pick up everything I can get in a dungeon or cave and then just haul it back. I usually run out of room, having to sacrifice items to haul mine away then waste time to get the items I dropped. With this game, however, you can loot everything you want.+The sword, axe, and staff fighting abilities are pretty neat as you progress through the game - There aren't many RPGs where you can wield a two handed weapon with one hand, you know.+Several hours of gameplay - I shelled a large amount of hours of time onto this game, can't say how many exactly, but definitely at least 30+ on ONE save.Neutral:~Unique leveling system where you gain learning points to raise stats OR skills - Only problem I have with this is you can't raise both equally, they cost money, and if you want to max out everything you can, you have to take advantage of an exploit.~The loading time is a little lengthy when you're recovering from death or starting up the game, but when you're exploring the island naturally, there's almost no loading time.Cons:-Getting money is HARD, even if you do quests - You won't get much money, not to mention you need a large amount of money when it comes to boosting your stats and skills, which you need to do to survive in the beginning of the game! Not to mention, you need to accumulate a total of 300,000 gold for one of the achievements! Of course you don't have to have it all in your inventory though, and I think you could spread the 300k across multiple accounts, but even with my first character I didn't get the 100,000 achievement.-The difficulty is frustrating in the beginning of the game when you can't get anything stronger than your basic sword (which only does 15 damage and doesn't deal much damage to a majority of enemies in the game) and a crappy wooden shield - You will die a lot, even on EASY difficulty! This is one of those games similar to, example, Divinity II, where EASY difficulty is an average game's NORMAL+ difficulty, but at least in Divinity II they tell you what level your enemies are before attacking them so you can plan out. In this game you rush into an enemy and you're dead. You'll only win fights if you slash your sword once or twice (enemies tend to block often, by the way) and block until they hit you once or twice. It's monotonous and a time-consumer, and it repels lots of people away from trying to finish the game.-The loot is fixed - That's right. You know how in games like Oblivion, Divinity II, and even Two Worlds have the loot in the chests randomized? Well in this game, the loot is fixed, so you will always find that same large health potion and rusty sword in one chest no matter how many characters you make.-The best armor and weapon in the game is FIXED - In the final chapter, you have to find armor to fight the final boss. Once you find it, you realize it's better than any armor, shield, helmet, or weapon you have found in the past, and there will be no better weapon or armor. Normally in RPGs finding the best armor in the game is optional and a challenge. Here it's a challenge, all right, but it's forced on you, which doesn't make it worthwhile in the end. The only armor you can 'customize' are your rings and amulet.-Alchemy is basically forced on you if you want to increase your attributes past 100 (the maximum trainers can train you to) - Forcing a perk like this takes away the fun and customization of the game for player, but there is an exploit that erases this problem... sort of.-If you want to make the game easier at all or not frustrate yourself into 50+ deaths in the future, you have to do a sort of \"exploit\" in the bandit's camp on this one character who wants you to collect weeds for him - You give him the weed, get money and exp, knock him out with a weapon (make sure he's alone by the way), use a tell joke scroll on him, take your weed when he's down, and repeat. This is probably the only way you will get to 100,000+ gold in the game. No, scratch that, even 10,000! The experience is given to you too which you can use to level up and boost your skills or attributes without having to worry. Many people do this exploit, including myself, and I can't blame anybody for doing it in a game this infuriating.-You're forced to explore everywhere in the game eventually, detracting from what's optional and what's not.Okay, so yeah, there's a lot of problems with the game, and I can see why not many people are fond of it. I personally found the storyline pretty good, the environment interesting, and I did like exploring the ruins and caves. However, forcing alchemy, the best armor in the game, and exploration of everywhere in the game, dieing 50+ times because of unfair and unreasonable difficulty, and having to use an exploit to make the game somewhat playable is not what makes a good RPG. I'd say only get this if you're a hardcore open-world RPG fan, like myself. If you're not, I say just skip it or borrow it from somebody to see if you really want to play it.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2012"}

Mario?  Wait...Luigi?!  Again?  REALLY!?Yes, really.Luigi's back in the sequel to the GameCube's cult classic Luigi's Mansion.  I, for one, am kinda dumbfounded this game is even here.  The original game was a launch title for the GameCube that was not received all that well when it was released.  Its greatest sin is that it wasn&#8217;t a Mario platformer.  Over the years Luigi&#8217;s Mansion did strike a chord with a niche crowd who loved its charm and Ghostbusters-like mechanics.  I am one of those people.But we never heard about it again, until now&#8230;.Nintendo has released Luigi&#8217;s Mansion Dark Moon which has expanded upon the original&#8217;s premise.  The game is longer, now comprising multiple mansions and locales, and Luigi has more gadgets in his ghost-sucking vacuum cleaner, the Poltergust 5000.  Not to mention, he&#8217;s upgraded his Gameboy for a Nintendo DS.  Pretty cool.The game fleshes itself out like an adventure game.  The player will navigate Luigi through mansions and a nice and even pace solving puzzles, catching ghosts and eventually beating bosses for Dark Moon pieces.Graphics are on par with the original game and it controls very similarly.  Although I must credit the developer for its great implementation of accelerometer controls as found fine tuning my aim by merely tilting the 3DS quite handy.I had quite a bit of fun with this title and am very happy that Nintendo has decided to revisit Luigi&#8217;s Mansion&#8230;ghosts and all.

Jeanclerc \"Reader, Listener & Obsessive...","summary":"Active Fun for Kids (Who Won't Notice the Repetition)","reviewText":"Just Dance Kids 2 is a Kinect-enabled game for your Xbox 360.  Kids play along by mimicing the actions of the dancers on the screen.There is a variety of songs for all age levels - both our 4- and 8-year-old managed to find some familiar favorites (while also discovering some new ones).  The biggest hits were the ones from their favorite TV shows (\"Yo Gabba Gabba\"), movies (\"Despicable Me\") and silly classics (\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\").The dance routines themselves also vary in complexity and even dynamically shift based on how the player is doing - mess up enough and it ratchets down the difficulty on-the-fly.  This is great for younger kids because they get to wiggle and jump around and yet still see a good score with lots of stars at the end.  This not only reduces their frustration but also levels the playing field when playing with older siblings.  By the time you get to the full-complexity routines, Just Dance Kids 2 delivers quite a workout as well - it's a great energy spend on a rainy day.  Note that some moves take up more space than other Kinect games that we've tried, so plan accordingly (or suffer stubbed toes!).The presentation is very kid-friendly, from the fun on-screen graphics to the kid dancers themselves.  Maybe I'm just getting old-fashioned, but there were a couple of instances where I found that the hip moves were approaching the line of suggestive - more conservative parents may want to watch along with their kids and monitor/restrict certain songs or else risk seeing their little one learning to bust a move that's better suited to the teen years.  The game does have a playlist feature that facilitates parental control of the songs.My only concern was the relative brevity of the whole playlist.  While our kids didn't seem to mind, it didn't seem to take long before we were all repeating the same tracks and routines.All in all, this is a great Kinect game for kids.  It keeps them active, helps build coordination and motor skills, and keeps them entertained.  We found that it also was favored by kids of all ages, so the replay and overall value is high as well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2012"}

{"product_name":"B007W8S2MG","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Wonderful story wrapped in a simple, fun package","reviewText":"Persona 4 is one of those few games that defies easy pigeon holing: its part murder mystery, part personal drama, teen high-school romance, and a hack-n-slash RPG with micromanaging resource side games.You play the traditional silent protagonist, living with your uncle in a remote town, when murders start to occur, tied to a mystery world within TV's that reveals peoples darkest secrets and natures.First off, the cast is wonderful and almost fully voiced, and not a single character is one-dimensional. Characters are deep and felshed out over the course of multi-layered interactions where you grow to connect with them and help them overcome their personal strifes.The gameplay is simple and straightforwd, and once a healthy level is reached, you could feasibly grind through the randomized dungeons ad nauseum. Nestled into this is a Pokemon like hunt for the Personas, reflections of your personality based on mythological and religious figures that you can cycle through to adopt various powers and strengths, or pick the one you like and buff them up to maximum level, swapping and growing skills with a nice roulette style bonus system for winning fights in a strategic manner.But the combat is completely overshadowed by the complex web of personal development, dating games, and other side quests that challenge you to figure out how to best utilize your time: who do you spend time with and help hone their skills, or do you work at a job to get enough cash for new gear, or do you study and try to ace your midterms and impress all of your friends at once.And thats just within the game. Fans will love the TV olerlay which brings in a little quiz show about the setup, and references and movies from the previous games of the Persona series, all of which are amusing and at least worth a few extra points.While this is a rerelease of a title from the mid 2000's, it's been polished to a high mirror shine. A few nits are still present, but they are so few and far between as to be unmentionable.The difficulty curve is a little harsh to begin with, especially if you play on a higher difficulty, and the random chance of a TPK from a lucky enemy power is still possible, but apart from that increasingly rare occurance as you level and improve, this game is easily worth the 60-70 hours you can dump into even a single playthrough, all of it worth the effort and even the few tears this game can ellicit.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2012"}

{"product_name":"B007XYBUBE","description":"","reviewerName":"Thomas Riccardi","summary":"A fighting game with colorful characters","reviewText":"Fighting games have been very popular as of late as there has been a resurgence of brands such as Marvel Vs. Capcom, Tekken Tag and even Street Fighter. But there have been new games introduced to the mix as well and Sony is ready to take it's first steps into the fighting arena with their newest offering Playstation all stars battle royale. But will this be a game be a worthy contender or will it get knocked out in the first round?When you first look at this game you can't not think that Sony is ripping off Super Smash brothers. However there are some differences and one of those are a power meter that's across the bottom of the screen. Every time you are damaged (or by picking up orbs that are scattered around the stage) you will increase your meter. Once they are leveled up you can unleash a devastating attack that can turn the tide of the battle in your favor.Four opponents compete on various stages to see who will be the last one standing as you have a giant roster of fighters to pick from. From the impressive Big Daddy from bioshock to the nimble Sly from the Sly Cooper series you can use various strategies against your foes in the ring. The stages are also very unique as well as they reflect some of the games that have appeared on the Playstation in past years. Each stage is blended from two games so you will see a stage that is part uncharted and bioshock infinite and another that's part god of war and patapon.There are also items that drop during a battle that can give you an edge in combat and they are also themed from the various sony games as well. From the devastating hedgehog grenade from Resistance to the razor claws from Ratchet and Clank these items will give you a bit of an edge during these battles. You can also play this game in multiplayer as well as you have various types of matches that range from time limit matches, last standing or reaching a set number of kills to end the match.I have to say that this is a great game as it is going to be available not just on the PS3 but on the Vita as well and if you own both systems during a cross promotion that Sony is throwing if you buy one of the games you get the other for the system free!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}

I was eight years late to the PS2 party, but it's amazing how a single game can pull you in on the console and refuse to let you stop playing for long periods of time even if you've delayed owning the system. Personally I hope the PS2 never dies and Sony just kills the PS3 (Just kill it, there's no point in keeping it alive anymore). Shadow of the Colossus is absolutely fantastic and breathed new life into the stale adventure genre with a bang. This game may be tough as hell to beat, but it's totally worth the price of admission.WHAT THE GAME IS: It's an adventure game that feels somewhat like Zelda. A boy (name unknown) brings a dead girl's body to a temple and makes a deal with the spirits of the temple to bring the dead girl back to life by defeating 16 giant behemoth creatures called Colossus. So the boy and his horse Aggro travel across the land defeating these creatures, armed with a magical sword and a bow and arrow set.GRAPHICS: This game is one of the best looking titles to be released for the PS2, and it pushes the console to its limits. The environments are gorgeous, the creature designs are great, the character models are great, and everything seems alive around you. However, the PS2 is known for texture and lighting problems, and unfortunately this game suffers as well with some textures being blurry and the lighting seems to be a bit off. Also, the frame-rate chugs if the battles get too hectic.MUSIC: The music is sublime and magnificent. This musical score is among the best I've ever heard from in a game. It is nearly perfect and it fits the fantasy theme perfectly. Hell, it's good enough to be featured in a big-budget Hollywood flick. But I do wish that the music would play all the time, not just during cutscenes and the colossus battles. It doesn't play as you explore the vast land placed before you which is disappointing.SOUND: The acting was actually pretty good, and everything about the sound seemed alive and real and it fit perfectly into the fights. Props to Sony for the fantastic sound quality.GAMEPLAY: I'm just going to get the bad stuff out of the way. Your worst enemy in the game is not the colossus creatures, but the damn camera. The battles can get pretty intense, and unfortunately because of the this, the camera can become schizophrenic and can go out of control at times, causing some problems during the epic battles. This game can be really tough, especially when trying to get to the weak points of the creatures, because you have to climb onto them, and most of the colossus creatures require a special act you must perform to be able to climb them. Wandering the environments can be confusing at times, the sword's reflecting power that shows you where to go helps, but it can still be confusing. Controlling Aggro could be a pain at times especially when trying to navigate him in tight spaces. Horse riding works well, but it takes some getting used to. Your primary weapons as mentioned before are a sword and a bow and arrow set. The bow and arrow is mostly used to get the attention of the colossus you are facing, and cause little damage. The sword is the primary tool to killing these creatures, but you have to be on these giant behemoths to do this. Each of the colossus creatures have nice fur patches you cling onto and climb up onto them to get to their weak points. In order to reach the fur, the game requires you to do things like make the colossus shatter pieces of its armor or tip it over and then climb on and stab away. You do this by hitting the weak points that are marked on the bosses. Each colossus is different, Sony lovingly designed the game so that no Colossus battle was the same and they were all different. Some are walking giants, others can fly, others can swim, and others can burrow underground. Also, the locations you fight the colossus creatures in are never the same as well, another highlight and obvious sign of loving care. This game really gives you a nice sense of what it would be like to fall from great heights as well, because your character can only hold on for so long before letting go. Fighting such creatures feels real and you get a good idea what it would be like to climb creatures that are several feet tall, fight creatures in mid-air, or fight them in water. Overall, the gameplay is fantastic, though it could use some tweaks to make it better.OVERALL: If you own a PS2, buy this awesome game, you won't regret it.THE GOOD: Great gameplay, fantastic creature designs, great environmental designs, good graphics, sublime music, and a unique and interesting storyline.THE BAD: Schizophrenic camera, tough gameplay, texture and lighting problems, the music isn't always there.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2008"}

I particularly loved the 2099 and Noir sequences as these have never been explored in a video game before.

{"product_name":"B007CSF3GO","description":"","reviewerName":"Flea Returns: FF13","summary":"Interesting game but just overall an average experience","reviewText":"The Last Story is a fun game and a good game for the JRPG lover. However, there really isn't anything about it that stands out. As always my reviews will be split between story, gameplay, and characters with story having the most weight.Story: 6/10So the story is good enough to keep you interested but really that's about all you can say about it. It's a good story but nothing that is just going to blow your socks off. It really fealt like I was playing an old FF like FF 3 or 4 with updated graphics and gameplay. This is one area that I think the japanese writers have been surpassed by the western writers. The stories in JRPGs have just become lack luster and the Last Story is a perfect example of this. Don't get me wrong. The story was interesting and well written but overall just kind of bleh.You play as a mercenary trying to make a life for himself and his friends until one day you meet a beautiful girl on the run from the soldiers. You find out that she isn't just any girl but (stop me if you've heard this a million times) a PRINCESS. Woah didn't see that coming did you? But she's being married off by her evil uncle the count. One day you receive a special power and only you can stop the coming destruction....yeah yeah it's been done before. And this game's story is well done...but how many times are we going to rescue the land and the princess people. It was nice how they added a little sci fi in the story (not spoiling anything) which spiced it up a bit. Thus the 6/10 and not a 5.Another complaint is that the story is tooooo predictable. They pretty much slap you in the face over and over about who is going to be the surprise (if you can call it that) boss and who is behind all the evilness. I thought in this decade we had gotten past this kind of foreshadowing. Apparently not. Oh well. Like I said it's a story that was well written and still interesting enough to get you through but one that was overly predictable and one that has been done a million times over. With JRPGs that have great stories like Xenoblade and the FF13 series...there really is no excuse.  6/10Gameplay: 8.5/10Now here is the really charming part about this game. As unoriginal the story is the gameplay is not. A completely new system. Very much team and tactics oriented. Just a really fun system. The developers really came up with something fun that I have not seen before. You basically have two types of players, warriors and mages. And each play off each other to use different and unique tactics to win the fight. You can pause the game and issue commands based off of how much stamina you have. Mages can cast spells that leave a magic circle on the ground. Warriors can then use these circles to cast spells of their own like causing physical damage, healing the party, debuffing an enemy, or buffing the party. Each character learns a special skill. Warriors it's usually some sort of new attack, and mages it's a spell of some sort. Each player will also learn a &#34;Limit Break&#34; if you will that you have to build up spirit points to use.There is a ton of loot. And loot upgrading. You can collect weapons and armor and upgrade them with money at first and then special materials you gain along the way. You are constantly updating your gear which is always fun to me. And as you upgrade you can visually see the differences in the armor/weapon which is a very nice touch.  More RPG's should do this.Now for the bad. CAMERA ANGLES...oh geez. Seriously? We are still having camera angle issues in video games these days. Nothing more infuriating than being in a big fight and not being able to turn the camera around. Sure there is a button that turns you around automatically...but when you do that and you still can't position the camera correctly...it get's pretty maddening real quick.The only other negative are the sidequests. There aren't that many really...but at least there are some (here's looking at you FF13). But really the sidequests are really ridiculous time sucks like &#34;Go catch 3 frogs&#34; or &#34;I have hidden 10 coins in this city go look for them&#34;. And the sidequests give you little more than junk usually. Pretty much a waste of time. The arena was a nice touch but not enough to pull this part up. Overall though the gameplay is truly the best part of this game. 8.5/10Characters 5.5/10The characters are probably the worst part of this game, with a few shining exemptions. First the good.Ok. Lowell and Syrenne are the best characters in this game by far. Maybe some of the best supporting characters I have played in quite some time. They have more personality than your general RPG side characters and more personality and human nature than the rest of your party. Truly funny and truly gems among rocks in the characters of this gameNow for the rest. They are once again, your generic 1990's RPG characters. The main character plays the stoic warrior with little to say. The damsel in distress plays the shy girl with not much to say. Then you have some supporting characters that have daddy issues and another that was raised in the forest but still..doesn't have much to say. Then one more that plays the stoic warrior again.  The enemies offer little in personality as well.Overall the characters are just dull. They belong in an old 1980's or 1990's JRPG. I like the thought of capturing the nostalgia of the old days but one thing about the old days is...well it's old and we are looking for something with the same charm but a little more interesting. 5.5/10Overall 7/10All in all this is an average game with some really fun and unique gameplay. If it wasn't for the gameplay it would be a solid 5 or 6 maybe. The story is interesting but completely unoriginal and predictable. The gameplay is truly fun and unique while the characters are just dull and usual except for a couple more interesting additions. Overall this game should be played by huge fans of JRPG's but will fail to interest those that are just casual fans. Without the lush history like a Final Fantasy or a huge adventure with a completely unique story like Xenoblade, The Last Story comes off as a quaint charming game that really just screams mediocrity.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2014"}

The people of Haven City have grown to distrust Jak's dark powers, and as rumors boil of Jak's ties with Krew and Kor, the city blames Jak for its current woeful circumstances. When the palace is destroyed by a surprise Metal Head attack, even Ashelin cannot protect Jak as the High Council's power broker, Count Veger, forces Jak into banishment to the desolate Wasteland. Jak is flown to the harsh island and dumped. With Daxter and Pecker bravely by his side, the three begin their next adventure where the battle for the city has just begun.Five times the size of Haven City, the Wasteland is a desert environment with multiple areas including mines and a volcano. Given the enormity and variance in terrain, vehicles play a large role as off-road transportation is introduced, fueled by a true-to-life physics engine. With a rugged new look and suited with armor, Jak is also equipped with an arsenal of new weapons with upgradeable mods that enable players to increase their firepower and enjoy the freedom to strategize and activate their arsenal at any time.As Jak has been exposed to Light Eco, players can now experience Jak's magnificent transformation to Light Jak. With a glowing electric blue aura and a massive wing span, Light Jak introduces new move sets, including the ability to glide great distances, emit an energy to block enemy attack, and power up at anytime, all of which provide the player with a sense of being invincible. Dark Jak also returns with more capabilities, forcing Jak to find a balance between light and dark.Additionally, game developer Naughty Dog continues to push the genre forward with the introduction of new technology. For the first time in the franchise, enemies feature realistic ragdoll physics, which will allow gamers to witness a unique death for each enemy that is killed. Naughty Dog has also implemented independent cloth movement technology and enhanced the enemy artificial intelligence (AI) with wall climbing and smart formation capabilities.","reviewerName":"mom2twoboys \"Writer, Reader & Mage\"","summary":"If you have never played Jak and Daxter, get this one!","reviewText":"All of the Jak and Daxter games are awesome.

Fun, Scary, Smart","reviewText":"As a huge fan of the Silent Hill games I was disappointed to hear the bad reviews which gaming magazines and sites were giving Downpour. Luckily, they are mostly incorrect.This is a great Silent Hill game. The atmosphere is perfect. I was really surprised by the fresh stylish ambient music and clean dialogue. Yes it is a new game, but it follows the classic old-school style of the original Silent Hill games. The controls are simple and basic, yet tighter than Homecoming, which also was a decent Silent Hill game but good for only one play through.This is not a combat fighting game at all. You could go through the entire game without even killing a monster (which is a trophy). This game is about exploration and puzzle solving. Yes there are monsters and a few scares, however your characters story and his journey is the idea of the game. It is very fun and you can't wait to see what is around the next corner. There is a huge area to explore and a lot to do. There are side missions and plenty of other little things you can do. If you skip all the extra stuff and just focus on the main mission Silent Hill Downpour is about 10 hours (I finished in 10:45:19, HARD difficulty, 1 side mission complete, Ending A). If you take your time and play all the side missions and solve all the puzzles you're looking at a solid 15+ hour Silent Hill game. However unless you have a walkthrough you will spend most of your time searching for your next clue, keys or notes with passwords, locations, hints, and riddles.This game is a great mix of classic Silent Hill, Alan Wake, and the Saw games.PRO's+ Very atmospheric. Classic Silent Hill style.+ Amazing ambient style soundtrack, goes so very well with what is happening.+ Fun and scary, just what it should be.+ Decent controls and combat.+ Well put together maps. Not too complicated so you won't get lost, however gives you plenty of room to explore.+ Multiple endings, 5 total!+ Downpour begs to be replayed due to the open world style, trophies and side missions. I have played it 4 times so far.CON's- There is noticeable screen tearing often and an occasional lag/jolt as well, mostly when saving or receiving a trophy. Some texture popping/blur and lack of detail on some objects. Nothing to stop me from playing the game.- I wasn't crazy about all of the monsters. They sometimes seem like they don't belong in Silent Hill.As for complaints about only being able to carry one weapon and the weapons break, well there are things to pick up and use as weapons everywhere; bottles, chairs, rakes, axes, bricks, bars. So you don't need to stockpile 10 wrenches in your pockets, your flashlight and one weapon will be just fine. And again, you don't have to kill everything you see, just run away. You can store as many health kits as you can find though. In my 4 play through I think I have only broken 2 weapons. Everything is logged in your statistics page; how many kills, parentage done, how long you've been playing, searching, in the otherworld and so on. It's very informative and helps you know where you are with the game progress.The side missions are fun and there are plenty of them. They require you to find something, and then do something, so something else will happen. They are well thought out and you feel a proud relief wash over you when you complete them. Most times they are not just right there to complete, they take you all over Silent Hill and involve research, planning and puzzles.I played this game for the first time on HARD (just for the trophy). I must say the monsters did get a bit frustrating after a while, however even on hard, this game is not too difficult. After a play-through I couldn't wait to start another round of this game to find all the cases I missed the first time. It is a great Silent Hill game and worth a good 3 plays if you are a trophy junky like myself. There is so much to find and many side missions to solve plus multiple endings.Over-all I love this new addition to the Silent Hill series and I also recommend theSilent Hill HD Collection. Silent Hill 3 has always been my favorite.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00319DX4W","description":"Enslavedis a post-apocalyptic retelling of the classic 400-year old novel &lsquo;Journey to the West&rsquo;. Set 150 years from now, the world has been ruined by war and ecological disaster with only a handful of survivors remaining.End Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"One of the biggest surprises of the year!","reviewText":"I have now played through and beaten Enslaved, and I can confidently recommend this title to fans of platformers and third-person action games in general, since it combines the best elements of both genre. The game plays like a cross between Ratchet & Clank and Uncharted, with an engaging story and colorful characters that breathe life into a game that would otherwise be a standard objective-based action game.As the main character in the game, you step into the shoes of Monkey, an escapee from a slave ship who finds himself enslaved by Trip, a teenage girl who needs Monkey's help to get home and to survive in the post-apocalyptic terrain that was once New York. Monkey is reluctant to help her at first, however she has him under her control courtesy of a headband that will harm or even kill him if he disobeys, so he has no choice but to accompany her and protect her from the hordes of mechs that litter the landscape. Over the course of the game, a bond develops between them and this is the real meat of the story. The game is separated into 14 chapters, which consist of linear levels that you must navigate and fight through. The usual boss battles and switch-based puzzles are here, but neither provides a daunting challenge. Likewise, the enemies are not incredibly varied and you will find yourself fighting the same mechs over and over again. At your disposal, you have a staff that can act both as a melee weapon and a gun of sorts, in that it fires stun and blast ammo. These can be upgraded as the game progresses, as can your health, shield, and fighting combos. Fighting is consistently engaging because it requires you to use a combination of button combos, dodging, and use of cover. It may seem like a button-masher at first, but the fighting gets more intense as the waves of enemies get bigger, so more strategy is required. Overall, it's a satisfying mix of platforming and fighting that makes this game highly playable and thus highly enjoyable.The strength of the game is largely in the presentation. The lush scenery and overgrown terrain of New York looks gorgeous and is a welcome change from the bleak settings of other post-apocalyptic games like Fallout 3 and Metro 2033. The platforming elements will draw many comparisons to Uncharted, and like that game, it is incredibly linear. I know that gamers grip about not having freedom, but I would gladly trade that for the frustrating deaths that happen when you misjudge a jump or fall into oblivion. You can't die from the platforming here, since Monkey can't jump off a cliff even if you try to make him. I see this as a strength, as it allows me to enjoy the visuals and the story without getting overly frustrated. The addition of the Cloud, which is essentially a hover-board that allows you to zip across water, is fantastic as it provides some of the best action in the game.The weaknesses of the game are not crippling but rather serve as an annoyance at times. The camera is very quick to zoom in on Monkey during the fight segments, which sometimes leaves you open to cheap hits when surrounded by enemies. This is especially problematic if you run into a corner, since the enemies will often be off-screen. The other problem is the touchy and sometimes unresponsive platforming controls. I have often tried to jump across a platform or climb up or down, and Monkey would instead jump or roll forward in place. The linearity of the platforming is not a weakness per se, but the lack of exploration during the levels leaves something to be desired. The only collectibles are tech orbs and masks which are found throughout the levels, but you don't need to wander far to find them. More variety there would have been nice. Outside of that, some glitches and slowdowns do occur, but they are infrequent and not likely to cause frustrations.In the end, Enslaved is a fun adventure game with an above-average story and lush visuals. Once the 8 hour single-player campaign is beaten, there is not much replay value due to the lack of multiplayer and the current (at the time of this writing) lack of DLC, but it's still fun and engaging, and definitely worth checking out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2010"}

Sandoc \"sussarakhen\"","summary":"Hunter the Reckoning a fun and bloody good time","reviewText":"Hunter the Reckoning is the first console game to take the player into the dark and shadowy universe that is White Wolf's World of Darkness. The game itself doesn't deal with the Vampire: Masquerade or Werewolf: Rage part of the WoD, but it does deal with the story about the Hunters. Hunters being those loosely-affiliated individuals who know of the secret world of darkness that most people do not see or refuse to see. It is these Hunters who know of the danger hiding behind the disguise of humans and it is up to them to hunt them down.The game can be played by choosing one of four different hunters. There's Deuce the biker who works best with the heavy weapons whether they be bladed or heavy-caliber guns. Then there's Father Cortez whose advantage lies in his high Edge-level (this game's version of magic). The speed expert in this foursome is a young, raver chick named Kassandra whose attacks may not deal heavy damage, but who speed in attacks and dodging blows her way more than makes up for her lack of punch. Last, but no less deadly, is Samantha the ex-cop whose best skill is her range-fighting with pistols and rifles. It doesn't really matter which of the four characters one chooses to play. They all have their advantages and disadvantages. It's really up to the type of gamer to choose which of the four to pick. If one likes to play the big, slow but powerful attacker then they pick Deuce. For the speedster in a gamer then its Kassandra. And so on and so forth.The controls are ok enough, but nothing innovative. The best thing I can say about the controls for Hunter is that it won't distract with unusual control mapping of the buttons, triggers and bumpers. The game itself is pretty easy and quick to learn once the controller is picked up and thats a clear sign that the developers meant for the game to be easy to learn. The levels and stages of the game run from easy to medium in difficulty. The levels themselves dont become too frustrating as one goes through it to reach the stage boss. It's some of the bosses that the game becomes challenging.Overall, Hunter the Reckoning is a very good action-shooter with a darker edge to it. This game is definitely not for kids with the amount of violence and gore inflicted on the enemies. Some of the cutscenes involving civilians being killed, maimed and/or devoured by the monsters in this world of darkness gets pretty graphic and intense. The multiplayer option to play through the game with three other players (unfortunately not online co-op since Xbox Live still hadn't been implemented) was a good addition. Hunter the Reckoning is a very good and fun game that should tied one over until another action-shooter comes along.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2002"}

You play as Max Payne, former undercover cop who faces off against the mafia, the police, and anyone else who stands in his way.  The storyline of the game is your typical revenge thriller, and it is presented here via graphic novel pages complete with voice acting.  The voice acting isn't as bad as it is reputed to be, but the characterizations are so cliche and sometimes cheesy that you'll just want to skip past these parts.  The graphics are gritty looking and present the violent, gritty atmosphere of the game perfectly, and while this PS2 version of the game doesn't offer the best graphics as opposed to it's PC and XBox counterparts, they are very well done nonetheless.  The control is tight for the most part, although the jumping controls and analog stick can be a bit touchy for some.  The bullet-time feature adds a new dimension of strategy to the game allowing you to aim your weapon in real time while your enemies move extremely slow.  True, Max Payne is a very violent game, but compared to GTA 3, Vice City, or even State of Emergency, this game pales in comparison violence wise.

Limited supplies, lots of puzzles, item management, and zombies.  The limited items creates a tense atmosphere and there are plenty of jump scares.  If you liked any of the previous RE games, you'll probably enjoy the gameplay of this one.  Now, don't get me wrong, I love old school RE gameplay, there are just a few things about this one that are FAR more frustrating than they are fun.First of all, it has way more backtracking than I remember in any other Resident Evil game.  They all have backtracking, but they don't involve you going back and forth across a giant island multiple times.  You cross the island, only to get an item that unlocks a door two screens away from where you started.  I'm not a fan of the plot, which at times gets rather ridiculous.  There are also a lot of annoying enemies.  Bandersnatches are nearly impossible to dodge, as their arms can stretch across an area to smack you, and can jump from level to level.  Getting past them is a chore, and they show up early on in the game (at least it waits til the end to throw Hunters at you).  I recall a few puzzles where I was completely stumped, and upon looking up the solution in a walkthrough, would have NEVER figured it out.  I don't recall any puzzles like that in other RE games.  There is also a room full of moths that plant eggs on your back, which hatch and poison you.  Now, the moths are fairly easy to dispose of (one shot from anything kills them) and the room has an infinite supply of blue herbs, but once the eggs are laid, you can't get rid of them, and they'll hatch in inconvenient places.  Also, none of the bosses are ANY fun.  One boss involves you running down a hallway being chased, but unless you want to lose a powerful weapon for the rest of the game, it's impossible to get past without taking damage.  They also throw you in a room you can't backtrack out of, so unless you actually came prepared and have a relatively close save, you can get stuck.  Another boss has tons of little minion things that push you around and deal near-constant damage.  It makes the battle far too difficult, especially considering the amount of shots it takes to end it.  There are some other minor things, but I won't list themIf you want traditional survival horror gameplay, then this will provide that.  It is an earlier Resident Evil title, after all.  However, it's incredibly frustrating, in the unfair sort of way.  (Demon's Souls was a difficult game, but one that I thought was fair.  This isn't)  If you want a great Resident Evil experience, go for the Gamecube remake of the original.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2013"}

It's a fully 3D experience similar to the PS2 Grand Theft Autos. Amazing visuals, new lighting and shading models & real-time reflections brings you a new epic experience.","reviewerName":"drqshadow","summary":"The Seams are Starting to Show With the GTA Engine","reviewText":"The latest PS2 chapter of the Grand Theft Auto legacy arrived amidst startlingly slim fanfare this summer in the form of Liberty City Stories, a PSP original ported over to its immediate predecessor. Rockstar didn't make any bones about this release - realizing that not only were they releasing an old game on a new system, but that they were actually taking away functionality, rather than adding to it, LCS was introduced at an original price point of $19.99 amidst much rejoicing from the general public. Speaking personally, that move alone changed my \"wait and see\" attitude about the title into an immediate purchase on launch day. Kudos to Rockstar - you probably could've gotten away with releasing this thing at full price, no doubt to great profits considering the completely recycled gameplay engine, maps and vehicles contained within, but you took the more honorable route and delivered a midsummer gift to your hardcore fan base.Yep, aside from the storyline, the audio selections and a few very minor gameplay tweaks (the inclusion of motorcycles, for instance) this is an entirely recycled game. Top to bottom, it's the sights, streets and sensations of Grand Theft Auto III wrapped around a new set of missions, newly distributed hidden packages and a strangely familiar new protagonist. Toni Cipriani should be familiar to anyone who played through GTAIII - he's the momma's boy who handed out odd jobs from his family restaurant midway through the first section of the game, and Liberty City Stories is the tale of his short, deliberate rise to that small semblance of power. Seeing as how this is meant to be a direct prequel to GTAIII, you'll find dozens of little hints, nods and foreshadowing to the events that transpire in the series' first PS2 jaunt, which really made me ache to go back and play chapter three again.However, aside from a few recurring characters and (obviously) locations, the direct links to the activities in III are few and far between. In my eyes, that's a big missed opportunity - I would've loved to have seen not only the backstory and events leading up to that epic first story, but also some of the things that went on elsewhere in the city during the course of the game. How cool would it have been to bump into the nameless lead character from GTAIII, exchange a few words, and then hear about his successes elsewhere in the city while your own fortunes turned for the worse? LCS was in the unique position to not only deliver a solid standalone tale, but to also expand upon an earlier yarn, perhaps even casting it in a new light. Instead, its storytelling  wraps up several years before the explosive arrival of the nameless one, serving as only a traditional prequel with absolutely no overlap. Hopefully this is an area they can address in the future, as the teasers for Vice City Stories have already begun to circulate and one can only imagine that San Andreas Stories won't be far behind.Despite the outstanding source material and superb pre-existing characters it had to work with, the actual storytelling of Stories does stumble from time to time, which is something that had never been a problem for the series beforehand. Both the pacing and the personality of the story don't quite match up with what had come before, which isn't to say it's a bad story by any stretch of the imagination, just that it's not quite up to the level of the preceding stories. That trademarked unforgiving, sarcastic GTA world view seems tamer this time around, and I'm not sure if that's because I've grown used to the approach or because the tale is actually much thinner than those that came before.Those same comments could apply to the gameplay system in use with LCS. At its heart, it's the same old GTA - same free-roaming capabilities, same methods of transportation, same theme - but there's something missing that I can't really put my finger on. When I stole my first police car in GTAIII, hit R3 and went on my first vigilante search-and-destroy, it was an almost magical moment. The sky had truly become the limit. I didn't get that same sensation when I boarded a garbage truck and started collecting specially marked dumpsters.A few of the innovations and new gameplay mechanics from San Andreas are put to use here, specifically the non-numeric health indicator (it's been replaced by a standard life bar) and the ability to change your wardrobe. I was glad to see that some of the more ambitious mechanics had been removed, mostly because I wasn't a fan of the dance levels, long afternoons in the gym to build endurance, or dating levels of GTA:SA, but sorely missed the ability to swim and the inclusion of functional aircraft. Driving your car into a pond of knee-deep water and watching Toni slowly drown is twice as bitter now as it was in Vice City or GTAIII, because you know that the capability was there and it merely didn't make the cut for the handheld release.One area that I had a hard time coming to grips with was the graphics. I'm not sure if it's the limitations of the engine, the hardware, or the original target console, but the visuals of Liberty City Stories really don't look all that hot. It suffers from what I'd call Final Fantasy: Origins syndrome, in that they've delivered a precise translation of a game that was developed for a less visually intensive system. Origins would've been right at home on the SNES, but fell a little flat on the PSone. Likewise, I'm sure LCS looks outstanding on the PSP, but on the PS2 it's lacking. With that drawback, however, is something of a blessing: load times are significantly smaller in this chapter than they have been in the past. Where a three minute wait after loading a saved game wasn't a big deal for Vice City, you won't wait more than a minute to get into the action with Liberty City Stories. That's a nice tradeoff if you're looking to sit down and goof off for half an hour in between classes or on a lunch break, but if you're a serious player, I'd imagine you'll trade a longer initial load time for a better picture any day of the week.Hand in hand with the disappointing delivery of the graphics in LCS is the strikingly downgraded quality of its audio selections and radio stations. Liberty City's airwaves feature a substantially smaller selection of recognizable artists and tracks, which may or may not speak to the need to get it out onto store shelves shortly after the PSP's release. Where Vice City and San Andreas were watershed moments for the integration of great music and pop culture references within the confines of an elaborate video game, Liberty City Stories feels like a pale impersonation. Of the in-game radio's selections, only the rap and classical tunes seem to have been given any kind of real attention, and even those broadcasts seem much more shallow than in previous installments.Probably my biggest gripe about Liberty City Stories is the lack of multiplayer functionality that was built into the game's PSP release. Upon reading reviews of the title, I couldn't wait to try out these first forays into online play within the GTA universe... it sounded like Rockstar had covered all their bases, introduced a little something for everybody and, more importantly, hinted at what might be coming in GTAIV. One would think that continuing this functionality into the PS2 release, maybe even including cross-platform play between PSP owners and PS2 owners, would be a boon for both the portable system and for the in-home console's meager online offering. Instead, any kind of multiplayer functionality was completely removed from the game's home delivery, as developers claimed it \"wasn't in keeping with the spirit and story of Liberty City.\" Why it was included in the PSP version, then, is still a mystery... and the end result is a disappointment for gamers who know the functionality is there, merely commented out of the PS2 translation.It's that kind of \"wow\" factor that I think is missing from this entire package. It's a solid game, a continuation of a proven formula, but lacking in that one big punch, one big moment to push it over the top. This felt like a much more shallow, shorter game than Vice City or GTAIII did, when in actuality it took me exactly as long to finish 70% of Liberty City Stories as it did to break 90% on Vice City. I've got to attribute that perceived shortness and incompletion to that same lack of \"wow.\" Even the ending seems anticlimactic and lacking in punch, which was one area that I distinctly remember as being wholly satisfying and exhilarating with San Andreas. This is a really fun game, sufficiently lengthy, with plenty of replay value and some outstanding voice acting work. What it isn't, however, is great. And, considering the lineage that came before, that's a disappointment. It would appear that ongoing greatness, like all other things, is not eternal.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2006"}

For years, I stuck with Nintendo portables and recently decided to give Sony's handheld a try. A breakdown is below:Games: The market is there, but the games are not. Sony needs to expand and make more games available across a variety of genres.Movies: A fun diversion, but not really practical considering the short battery life of the system.Web and Internet: I haven't explored these options personally.Music: This depends. Do you want everything incorporated into one unit? I prefer my MP3 player, and it's a lot lighter, too (not to mention the price point).Pictures: I haven't explored this option, either, so I can't comment.Overall: Good graphics and enormous potential to be more than it currently is. Hopefully it won't get lost in the shuffle of Sony's recent release of their new PS3 console. If you're looking for a system that can do just about everything you'd imagine, then this might be a good option for you.

{"product_name":"B000EGELP0","reviewerName":"GamerGirl","summary":"Gets Boring After Awhile","reviewText":"This game is based on research that shows that we can keep our brains in good shape by exercising them for just a few minutes a day. The game therefore contains a number of exercises that the player is encouraged to perform at least once a day, including simple calculations, reading aloud, counting syllables, and counting the number of people going in and out of a house. You are also encouraged to test your \"brain age\" daily to see your progress. The test will include activities similar to the ones described above. The ideal brain age, according to research, is 20. The game also includes about 100 sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels to work on.Although I tried following the training program for about a week and a half, it quickly became boring and monotonous. As there isn't much motivation to play the game for more than about 10-15 minutes per day since the game will only save one score per day for each activity, it is easy to lose interest. And though the game teases you the first few days by rewarding your daily training by opening up new activities, after a few days you stop unlocking new things. So after playing for 10 straight days and still seeing activities on my screen yet to be unlocked, I was rather frustrated.In addition, there were a few frustrating glitches in the game. One of the tests for brain age requires you to speak into the DS's microphone and name the color of the words printed on the screen. While not a particularly difficulty activity, the DS had a great deal of difficulty recognizing when I said \"blue\" or \"black\" so I had to keep repeating it, sometimes costing me several valuable seconds. Even more frustrating was the fact that I found it very difficult to write the number 5 so that the computer would recognize it. So in calculations, I would write a correct answer, but the computer would think my 5 was a nine so I would get the wrong answer and lose huge points.The main redeeming quality of this game is the included sudoku. The system they used was practically perfect. You are able to put in up to 9 possible numbers in a space and then write a large number over them when you are sure of the correct number. And the fact that you can use the stylus to play it just like a regular pen and pencil puzzle without having to constantly erase numbers was nice.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2006"}

Supposedly the best,  but that is what the sheeple mainstream would have you think.  Ultimately I wasn't expecting much from this game from the skeleton crew of MW3, Sledgehammer games and their lack of FPS experience before hand and the fact that COD has become nothing more than a mindless run n gun with bad plots, forgettable characters, more explosions per frame than actual filler, not only this but BF3 blew me away.The campaign is about 3-5 hours long on normal and probably about 7 on veteran.  It's your standard COD campaign filled with explosions and cheesy voiceovers, the singleplayer feels more like a COD deleted scenes with BF3's multiplayer in it.  What I mean by that is they try to hype it up to be WW3 but there's only about 3 missions with actual huge intense battles.  Everything else is just shooting galleries and corridor shooting.I never tried specops in my 2 days playing this but I played MW2 so I think I get the gist of it.The multiplayer is the same thing as MW2.  The only difference is theater mode, a few perks, guns, and maps.  Back in the 90s a game like this would sell for 30 bucks and be called an expansion pack.  It's fun don't get me wrong but as a game this sucks.  They haven't changed anything at all.  Besides from the killstreaks and terrible community there isn't really anything special about this game, it's got almost nothing going for it.  The maps make it so going with a rifle or LMG is almost impossible and the maps are tailored specifically for crackheads hyped up on doritos and mountain dew running around with SMGs.  All it takes to do good anymore is just to spray n pray with an SMG.This is why Halo lost it's throne back in 2007.  It became a spray n pray.If you can enjoy slow paced games with depth, substance, replay value and more fun buy BF3 or Skyrim.  It's too bad if this sounds like fanboyism but I wasn't impressed.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2011"}

This helps keep dust out and is also nice from an aesthetic perspective. The new super-slim models use a sliding door mechanism where you manually insert the disc, and that door feels flimsy and cheap, and will be prone to letting in dust.- When reading discs, this model, like the originals, is nice and quiet. The new super-slims, due to the very thin door separating the disc from the outside, is relatively loud.- The new super slims are Sony's effort to increase their margins...i.e., they are overall cheaper to manufacture, but they are charging about the same price for them. Thus, with the original slims you are very likely getting higher-end build quality for the same price. This is just an assumption on my part, but the disc loader is one piece of hard evidence for this.- I just like the looks of it betterMost would argue that the bigger hard drive on the 250GB super slim justifies the equal/slightly higher price point, but a little research indicates that 250GB notebook drives are the same cost as 160GB notebook drives due to the funky market forces of computer hardware. This further fuels my skepticism of the super-slim's build quality, because the only seeming justification for its price point goes away.As for the 160GB slim model here, the fan is whisper quiet compared to my old PS3, and it generates less heat. It lacks the myriad of card readers my old one had, and lacks the PS2 compatibility, but it's also hundreds of dollars cheaper, so it's a fair trade off.No complaints...it's a quality piece of hardware.If you want one, hurry...obviously, with the release of the super-slim models, these will be off the shelves soon.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2012"}

The motion controller and nun-chuck was an innovative idea that attracted customers who had only ever been used to standard control pads. But with the release ofPlayStation Move Starter BundleandKinect Sensor with Kinect Adventures and Gunstringer Token Codethe Wii has lost its unique edge, and since it never offered anything like the PlayStation Trophies or Xbox Achievements the online features are limited to those stupid 'Miis' and the rather dull Wii Store.The console itself is sturdy but small, and feels more like a toy than something that belongs connected to your home entertainment system, thus making it more likely to be kept in a kid's bedroom. There is no separate audio out and the video connection is, at best, RGB. It has the ability to play GameCube games, which is a huge bonus as there are a lot of hidden gems out there for that system, but they are region-locked, so you can't import otherwise unavailable games from the other countries, ditto for the Wii games themselves. None of the downloadable features are really any good. If I want to load pictures onto a games console the PS3 is more appropriate, plus it also features the ability to save audio and video files, which the Wii doesn't. One of the better features is the aforementioned Wii store, which offers retro Nintendo and Sega games. But they hardly ever update it and the payment system feels like a con.I really do feel that the reign of the Wii is over. It's a Remora fish swimming in the wake of the bigger consoles. If you're going to invest in something for your kids or for your home theater then leave this be. It's great for a toy if you pick it up cheap, though it will never be a 'main' Xmas or birthday present again.

This isn't a complex war-simulator, this is a fun action/shooter.THE LONG: I'll begin by skipping any talk of re-living Star Wars battles and how accurate the scenarios are, etc. Yes I'm a Star Wars fan, you probably are too if you're reading this, and you don't need to worry, this game gets the feel down just fine.So how is the actual game itself?Very fun. I played the demo on a rented copy of the SW dvds since I just wanted to see them, having bought a bootleg of the original versions on dvd. Once I played the demo, I was hooked for hours on the one level offered. Getting the full game, I played for days on end and was happy to see that some finishing touches made the gameplay better than the demo with such things as seeing enemy troops on the map and more adjustable options.In this game, you pick from about 20 levels that range in terrain (forest of Endor, desert of Tattooine, ice planet Hoth, etc) and complexity (open levels, levels with trees and caves for cover, passageways, elevated positions, etc). You'll find several that you want to play over many times. Once you pick a level, you pick a side (Rebels or Empire for the old schoolers, or CIS robots and the Clone Troopers for the new trilogy). Sorry, no way to play the Rebels against the Clone Troopers and mixes like that, but with 4 sides to choose from in almost every battleground and 5 troop types per faction, you'll have a lot of fun messing around.The game is greatly set up for pick up and play-style action. Once you pick your stage and side, you begin. Just pick one of your bases to spawn your soldier, and you're good to go. Walk through the stage at your discretion, fighting how you want to. Jump into a melee and back up your brothers with blaster rifle blazing, throw projectiles from afar, or do some sniping. There's nothing more satisfying in this game than watching some Imperial drones (or Rebel scum if you prefer) run past your Endor tree and then jumping out behind them and capping a few, only to run back into the safety of the foliage while your comrades engage them.The controls are quick, easy and adjustable, and there's not much worry involved. Just have fun: When your energy bar runs out, pick a soldier again and hop back into the fray as much as you want until your side dies off or wins. Don't worry about ammo since you have a fair amound and it gets replenished with each respawning or with supply droids that you stand next to. Just fight, run, blast, die, then keep coming back and taking down as many troops as you can. But remember that you can always quietly snipe or jump into the continually respawning rides (Tauntauns, X-wings, AT-ATs) for a change of pace.The game is engineered for strategy too. On easy you can win a lot of battles with a quick trigger finger. But go up in difficulty and you'll find that quickly overtaking the sniper towers on Kashyyk gives you a huge advantage over just storming the beach Normandy style. You can always throw on \"Instant Action Heroes\" to spice things up too, giving each side an invincible lightsaber wielding toughie to deal with. Unfortunately no, you yourself cannot play as one of the main people such as Luke or Vader or wield your own lighsaber for that matter. At first, though I knew this was clearly a game more worried about the infantry battles in Star Wars, I still wished I could play as a Jedi. But believe me, the game is just right as it is- playing as a Jedi or using a lightsaber would make you pretty much unstoppable and take out the entire strategic and competitive core that makes this game so fun. A cool unlockable perhaps, but play this game for a day and you won't miss it.Lastly, aside from the quick play mode there's a story mode that basically follows the events of the films and lets you follow them, playing them as the series' history dictated. That's decent, as is the conquest mode which lets you try to win as many battles as you can until you conquer all of the planets, or lose and watch the opponent try to do the same to you, battle by battle. Unfortunately, these are all only slight variations on the same theme, and it never comes down to more than a different structure for participating in the same 20 battlegrounds. It's funner just to have a friend or go online for more human competition, but even without, the battles that stretch across all of the game modes are extremely fun and addicting nonetheless.With almost no badly designed or unexciting level designs and coupled with an addictive engine and lots of ways to fight any battle, to me this game is very well made and worthy of a purchase. Non Star Wars fans can probably enjoy it on the same level as a Dynasty Warriors title or similar constant-action game as well. It's a solid title that's easy to pick up and enjoy but deep enough to keep trying new strategies and setups. The negatives are that there isn't much variation on the battle-by-battle theme, and the unlockables are worthless (game design photos, etc). But for a fun action shooter, especially one that's so easy to get into, this one's solid.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000IMWK2G","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Changing How We Play Games","reviewText":"The Wii remote has already proven a success for Nintendo.  It truly adds to the gameplay of a game.  This remote can be used as a sword (Red Steel, Zelda) a gun (Red Steel, Call of Duty 3) or even just using the motion sensor to imitate motions is good enough (Wii Sports, Madden NFL 2007).  The remote itself cretes a more interactive feel for the game.  Imagine, if you will, that your character's action on screen depends upon your very own.  In other words, this isn't button mashing, this is real interface.  Nintendo scores here.The remote takes two AA batteries in order for you to get the ball rolling.  In games, it serves as your form of play.  On the Wii menu it serves as your pointer.  Almost like a mouse to a PC.  You'll be able to click on things, shop and start up Wii channels all from this remote.  Also, while in the middle of a game, the remote can be used to return to the Wii Menu at any time by simply pressing the home key.  The buttons, as well as the trigger are all quick and responsive.Aside from the motion sensor, there is more glitter and gold to the Wii remote.  For starters, it actually does work with some virtual console games.  For NES, Turbo Grafx-16 and Sega Genesis the Wii Remote actually does work to play these games.  While it makes more sense to use a Gamecube Controller or buy a Classic Controller for virtual download, it's nice that you are able to use the remote to play some of the more basic games. It can't be used for SNES or Nintendo 64 at all, though.When purchasing a Wii Remote, you may also want to consider getting a nunchuck attachment as well.  Most games work using the Wii remote and nunchuck.  There aren't that many out there that require just the remote.  So you'll always want a nunchuck as well, which attaches to the base of the wii remote.  Additional Wii remotes are also a must for multiplayer.  This does ramp up the price, however, as additional Nunchucks are twenty more dollars you'll have to spend.  In addition, buying a classic controller (which also attaches into the base of the wii remote) for the virtual console also costs an additional twenty dollars. It can be costly, but for the additonal multiplayer aspect it can indeed be a good investment.Perhaps the only thing that keeps the Wii Remote down is that for any avid or hardcore gamer, the battery life doesn't last long.  The batteries die out quite fast.  The default batteries that come with the remote die out in less than a week, and replacement batteries don't last long either.  It's far better to buy rechargable batteries for your Wii remote than it is to keep running to the store and buying batteries over and over.  Also, when playing, there's no warning that your batteries are low during gameplay.  You'll know when they've died of course, but it'd be nice to have a warning.It's a great controller, and as usual it's best to buy from Nintendo rather than third party controllers.  It can be costly if you figure in the nunchuck and/or virtual controller, and it drains batteries fast, but it's still a good controller.The Good+Changing the way we play games+Alert and responsive controls+Navigation through menus is really easy+Attachments are easy to connectThe Bad-Nunchuck is sold separately, and it's needed for many games... I've no problem buying the classic controller separately, but it's strange that Nintendo wouldn't sell the remote and nunchuck in a bundle-Drains battery life fast, but this can be remedied with rechargable batteries.Happy gaming!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2006"}

Wireless 360 controllers can burn through a set of batteries fairly quickly, and replacing them can really add up.  This is a great solution--it comes with a rechargeable battery and a cord that allows you to play while the battery is being charged.  And the cost will quickly be offset by the money you'll save in NOT having to replace AA batteries, believe me.If your battery runs out while you're playing, just hook the controller to your 360's USB port and you can continue gaming interrupted.  This doesn't seem to be the best solution for charging, however.  Instead I have my cord hooked up to a USB port on my computer, and whenever a battery gets low I switch to another controller and plug the one that needs charged into my computer.  The batteries charge pretty quickly and last a long time.If you've ever messed with changing batteries out on a Wii you'll see why this product is so great.  The cost of this battery is pretty minimal, and with the clutter you can save by using wireless controllers it's definitely worth it in my opinion.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2007"}

StoryTheGod of Warfranchise tells the tragic and violent story of the warrior Kratos and his dealings with the gods. The ancient world would eventually both praise and damn the infamous ?Ghost of Sparta? as the mortal who slayed a god, but long before his battle with Ares, Kratos sought absolution from his past sins by pledging himself as a champion to the gods. These brutal crusades in the name of Olympus became legendary, but would have far-reaching consequences. InChains of OlympusKratos is pushed to the edge as he is ordered by the gods to journey to the very depths of the underworld after the world plunges into darkness. There he must face the most feared creatures of Greek mythology and is forced to choose between his own personal redemption and saving the ancient world from certain destruction. It is a choice that will shake the immortals from their perches on Mt. Olympus.God of War'sEpic Gameplay Comes to the PSPPlayStation Portable has always been head and shoulders above its competitors in the handheld market when it comes to processing power, and inGod of War: Chains of Olympusthe PSP platform may just have reached its highest level to date. Packed with features like dramatic camera angles, epic set pieces, cinematic cut scenes, stirring audio and seamless fast action gameplay, formerly only available on console platformsChains of Olympusbinds players to the game?s epic adventure, regardless where they are when they join in the action.Combat Moves, Both Old and NewNearly as defining as the name of Kratos itself, the trademark sweeping attack moves of the ?Ghost of Sparta? using his weapon of choice the ?Blades of Chaos,? epitomizes allGod of Wargames andChains of Olympusis no exception.Although overall the PSP has fewer buttons than the PlayStation 2 controller, developer Ready at Dawn Studios has managed to incorporate nearly all of the attack moves and combination moves from previous games in the series into this new project. This continuity in gameplay not only provides a seamless intro into the game for veteran players, but a gentle learning curve for players new to the series. Add to this new brutal combat moves and an additional upgradable weapon and you have a combat system that will engage players at all levels.Exploration and Puzzle SolvingFrom the bright gates of Attica to the darkest dungeons of Tartarus, Kratos? journey and your own will take you through the dark and brutal world of Greek mythology. Here not only will your skill with the Blades of Chaos be tested, but your wits as well.As you explore the dangers of the ancient world, players must be prepared to use their navigational skills as they press on through labyrinths of challenging puzzles. Some may be simple tests at manipulating the game?s environment to your advantage, while others much more difficult also requiring precision timing of moves, but each will be different and test you in new ways.An Evolution in Franchise HistoryMore than just a missing piece in the history of theGod of Warfranchise,Chains of Olympusalso serves as an evolutionary link between the origins of theGod of Warfranchise and its future. Originally developed for PlayStation 2, the future of the franchise is slated to make its arrival on PlayStation 3 in the form of the highly anticipatedGod of War IIIin the not too distant future. Not only is PlayStation Portable designed to work in unison with PlayStation 3 in many ways, but both long-time fans and newcomers to the series who choose to watch and playChains of Olympuscarefully may very well pick up clues as to the direction the franchise will be heading in withGod of War III.Regardless, whether you find yourself playing for the current chapter in Kratos? saga or preparing yourself for the battles to come on the PlayStation 3,God of War: Chains of Olympusis a must have title for any current owner of a PSP or those considering getting in the handheld game with one.","reviewerName":"N8online","summary":"God Of War Zero For PSP","reviewText":"This game is definitely better than I expected.

You will always have a car available to enter an event, unlike Grand Turismo 5.  You get to choose from three different types of races at each event.+++EVENT LIST is awesome.+++VEHICLE TUNING/SETUP is second to none.  Forza gives you a detailed description of every aspect of every part that can be tuned/adjusted.  Not every tuning option is able to be adjusted on every car.  The more adjustable parts you install when you manually upgrade your car, the more areas of your car you can adjust/tune.  Tuning can make a big difference sometimes.  When a race is over, you car restart the race, then retune your car, and then re-race the race and do that over and over again.  For example, I kept losing this chase race in the Japanese mountain track where you catch, pass and beat the leader on a semi-crowded long, winding and narrow tack.  I tuned the car a couple times with a couple basic settings and kept losing.  I then adjusted other parts of the car that I was unfamiliar with, but became familiar with by reading the summary, made some adjustments and won easily.  You can also adjust the tire pressures.+++UPGRADING YOUR CAR IS SECOND TO NONE: You can upgrade virtually every part on you car with various upgrades from every probably every manufacturer on the planet.  You can then select the benchmark menu to see the final results of all your upgrades.  Again, the more adjustable parts you install, the more parts you can tune before races or re-tune when retrying races.+++TELEMETRY READINGS ARE AWESOME.  The manual undersells the telemetry setting. Press down on the D-pad or up to turn Telemetry on and off, and then click Right on the D-pad to toggle thru about 6 Telemetry screens. See the damage and percentage of damage from every aspect of your car, external and internal percentages, and internal, see the statistics from your tuning and every aspect of the car. You also can see the tire pressures and heat and much more.  When you turn Telemetry back on again, it will display the last screen you had on previously.  I usually turn on Telemetry and scroll over to the damage screen and then turn it off.  I'll then turn telemetry back on to check the status of the car after any collisions.+++DAMAGE is second to none, especially when enabled fully.  It really affects the game and the gives consequences when you bump other people.  Realistic damage and consequences.  The more damage, the more your car suffers in performance.  When you take damage, a damage indicator appears on the right hand side of the screen giving you a graphical representation of the health of your car, both internally and externall.  Look at the telemetry settings will give you a great indicator of all the areas of your car's damage and the percentage of damage to all areas of your car, external body and internal car parts.  The more damage your car takes, the more money gets deducted from your winnings/earnings. The damage looks great.  From a little bump to a big bump.+++Increasing or decreasing the assists.  The less assists you have, the more XP / Credits you get.+++Selecting the skill level of your opponents (but only in Quick Play and in the Events List, not in World Tour)+++User friendliness and convenience.  The easy of upgrading your car or removing upgrades or switching to another car.  Before an event, if your car needs to add or remove upgrades, they can be done automatically in literally a second (or you can do it manually). And you can always easily switch to a different car if you want.  If you have the wrong type of car, Forza will inform you and show you the long list of cars eligible for the event.+++Online has a plethora of different events to choose from.  There are races for all the different classes of vehicles where custom tuning is allowed, drag racing, races where everyone uses the same car and no tuning allowed, and the track is pre-selected.  There's some cute modes like tag, soccer, cat and mouse and drag racing too.+++Hot laps, ghost cars, rivals challenges, and on-line leaderboards.  The lesser amount of assists you use, the higher your ranking will be.+++YOUR AI OPPONENTS ARE JUST AS HUMAN AS YOU ARE. The will bump you soft and hard, crunch you in crowded environments and sometimes cause you to spin out. Sometimes they will go to fast into a turn and go off the road.  This is great for the following reason.  Turn off the driving line completey.  For examaple, when you are racing and have an opponent in front of you, I have the tendancy sometimes to try to catch up and pass the guy in front of me instead on concentrating on the layout of the track and the turns coming up.  Well that AI driver in front may be \"human\" and drive off the course and cause me to drive off the course too.  I've had this happen numerous times.  The AI driver in front of me drives too fast into a turn and turns too late and I end up doing the same thing because I was playing \"follow and pass the leader\" which caused me take my attention off the road.Some tips:*Drive with the racing line off and with damage fully enabled.  The damage really adds a new dimension to the game and the race.  Your car will suffer with any and all bumps and collisions.  Turn off all assists and fully enable the damage for the best challenge.  This is how I play.*If you race using the controller, remember that the left and right triggers and the sticks are analog.  Pull down on the right trigger all the way is the same as flooring the gas pedal, the same for the left trigger with braking.  The degree you pull down on the right trigger is the same as the degree you step on the gas pedal in a real car or when using the racing wheel with the gas and brake pedals.  Pushing the left stick fully to the right or left is the same as turing the stearing wheel full left or right. Pushing it a little is tantamount to turining the steering wheel a little.  I used to race all the time with my Microsoft steering wheel with the gas and brake pedals, then I got used to mastering the controller.*Using the right stick for viewing if using the controller.  You can use the right stick to pan over to the right and left (just as you would if you were turning your head to the right and left) by pressing the right stick forward and then rotating the stick to the right or left.  This is the same as \"Helmet Cam\" in Shift 2. Or you can just point the stick to the 10 or 11 O'clock position or 1 or 2 O'clock positon to get a diagonal view.  You can also get a diagonal to the rear view by pressing the right stick to the 5 O'clock and 7 O'clock positions.--I wish they had a rock n' roll / hard rock sound track.  I wish they had attractive women in the game.  I wished they had drag racing events in the events list (but drag racing events are available on-line and in the rivals challenges) like in Forza 3 and the downloadable content for Shift 2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2012"}

The garage offers three levels of upgrades for virtually every component on your vehicle, but it's up to you to craft the winning combination that will give you the edge on the competition.Exterior- For the Midnight Club, stunting is a habit and its clandestine Los Angeles garages have all the toys needed to ensure heads turn in this jaded town. From making sure your car is dripping in candy paint, to adding unique body kits and jaw dropping extras, the garage offers practically limitless possibilities to personalize your vehicle with aftermarket accessories and customizable options.Interior- Don't embarrass yourself by pulling up with an outrageously kitted-up car that has a 'me-too' factory interior. Not a good look! You're going to be spending a lot of time behind the wheel, so renovate and make yourself feel comfortable.Beware or Befriend the Local CompetitionThe street racing scene ofMidnight Clubis tough, but tight, meaning that everyone that you meet in expansiveLos Angelescould just as easily be an ally as an enemy. One thing is for certain though, they are all willing to throw down at the drop of a hat. Just a few of the faces you'll encounter out on the streets are:Karol, Age 45- A veteran of Moscow's underground street racing circuit, Karol moved to LA in the 1990's after the collapse of the Soviet Union. If you're looking for cars, he's your man. He owns two successful garages and claims to be able to get hold of any vehicle, no questions asked. He also sees himself as a philosopher and will bend your ear if you left him. He mostly races around Hollywood and the Beaches and his rides include a 1975 Datsun 280Z, 1969 Boss Mustang 302, 2006 Dodge Challenger and a 1971 Lamborghini Miura SV.Annie, Age 31- Annie has a rep as one of the fiercest drivers in the city. She detests posers and wannabes, is intelligent and sharp-tongued and pulls no punches when it comes to cutting the competition down to size. She has been spotted in everything from a 1983 VW Golf GTI, 2006 Pontiac Solstice, 2008 Chrysler 300C SRT-8, 2008 Audi RS4 and a 2004 Ford Shelby Cobra Concept and can usually be found hanging out near Pink's Hotdog Stand in Hollywood along with her crew.Rockstar Games Social Club: Join the CommunityBeing a Rockstar gameMidnight Club: Los Angelescomes with a huge commitment to the gaming community.

I have even tried to play it, but I cannot simply stand playing this insipid game.  I do now know why, but this simply is not a good game.  Perhaps it is particular tastes.  But I simply cannot stand this game.  The tracts are fairly imaginative.  One grating thing about it is say you hit a tree.  Well, instead of bouncing off like on many other racing games, you stay bashing into the tree.  It does have some interesting features, however.  The sheer volume of tracts (had it been any other game would have been a plus) shows ingenuity, the story line is interesting, but in execution the game just flails horribly.Why do I give it 2 stars?  The concept.  I love the concept.  Making an adventure out of a racing game, and the format they gave it is an excellent idea.  The sheer number of tracks is exhilarating.  And on some courses there are THREE (plane, hovercraft, kart) types of vehicles to use.  It is just a tragedy that in practice it doesn't come off at all.  It is nowhere near Super Mario Kart 64.  That game is fast-paced and loads of fun, the best racer to hit the N64.  Size wise, this dwarves Mario Kart 64.  If they could have had the execution on Mario Kart 64 and the concept of Diddy Kong Racing, we would have had one hell of a game.  Sadly, such a game does not exist (yet).  We have to settle with a badly executed game (Diddy Kong Racing) with another racing game that is superb in all manner of ways.  But, with a little engineering, we could have the best of both worlds.  Super Mario Kart 64 is the way to go, folks.  The multiplayer battle is really fun too, especially Block Fort.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Lost in translation","reviewText":"If you've been living under a rock since 2005, then you've never gotten wind of Resident Evil 4.  A departure in terms of gameplay and design for Capcom's long running survival horror franchise, Resident Evil 4 marked the best entry in the series, as well as the best survival horror game of all time when it was first released on the Gamecube.  Eventually the game would be released on the PS2 (and recently the excellent version that just came out for the Wii), and now it's finally on the PC.  Sadly though, so much of what made Resident Evil 4 so great on the consoles has been lost in translation in this port to the PC, making PC gamers wonder what all the fuss was about with Resident Evil 4 in the first place.  While the game still features it's ultra creepy atmoshphere and heart pounding moments of suspense, the fact that the game cannot be played with a mouse is pure blasphemy.  A controller is essential here because of that, and the fact that the keyboard controls are sloppy and annoying to boot.  Once you get over that hurdle, you'll find that despite the atmosphere of the game, the cut-scenes and even some other parts look incredibly blurry and stilted.  You can't play around with the visuals of Resident Evil 4 either, and considering how long this PC version of the game was in development, the overall package just feels rushed.  Not to mention that this PC port features no new exclusive content either.  All the negatives aside though, Resident Evil 4 for the PC is still pretty much the Resident Evil 4 we all know and love, and if you own a gamepad, there's plenty of excitement to be found here.  Combine that with the budget price tag, and you still get a solid survival horror game that is worth a look.  That is, if you don't own a console.  If you own one of the aforementioned console systems, pick Resident Evil 4 up for that system, but if you don't, well then, this PC version loses much of what made the console game so great in the first place.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2007"}

However, Final Fantasy devotee that I am, I can't help but whine about several &quot;sins&quot; that Squaresoft has commited with the making of this game.GRAPHICS: Instead of using adjectives, I'll just put it this way, sometimes you can't tell if you're watching an FMV or in-game graphics. They're that good. The FMV's themselves are almost as good as the graphics in the Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within movie. Note the detail in the eyes, hair, etc. One thing that I'd like to point out that will GREATLY increase your enjoyment of the game is that fact that FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A FINAL FANTASY GAME you can &quot;save&quot; almost all the FMV sequences so that you can watch them again! Search the city of Luca, south of the save point.SOUND: If your TV has really good sound (I have a Sony Trinitron flatscreen) then you'll be able to marvel at the realistic sound of grass crunching under Tidus' feet in the Calm Lands, etc.MUSIC: This is where I start to dislike Final Fantasy X. The music is nowhere near as good as 9, or 7, or even 8. And definitely nowhere near as good as 6. However, there are a COUPLE good songs: &quot;Otherland&quot; (imagine Ifrit trying to sing in a rock band), &quot;Suteki Da Ne&quot; (Japanese feel to it, better than &quot;Eyes on Me&quot;), and &quot;Summon Monster Battle&quot; (An excellent battle tune, but you only hear it once or twice). MANY times, I took out some of my other RPG soundtracks (Best of Ys, Elemental Gearbolt, FF7, FF6, FF Tactics), because their music is so much better. You can listen to the entire soundtrack in the same place where you purchase the FMV movies in Luca, another plus to this game.STORYLINE: The very first scene is slow and boring--not at all like the openings to FF7, 8 and 9. But the FMV where Sin attacks--WHEW! AMAZING! Unfortunately, I found that the storyline in this game was dreadfully linear (along the lines of: Go to temple, solve puzzle, get aeon, go down road, go to next temple, repeat). You can go forwards and backwards, and that's about it--until you get to the sidequests.BATTLE SYSTEM: Excellent. In previous FF's, certain characters got neglected because they were pointless to have in your party. In FF X, you can change characters in and out while in battle. In addition to this, FF X uses the Sphere Grid, which allows you to customize your characters the way YOU want to.TRANSPORTATION: DREADFUL! YOU GET THE AIRSHIP, ONLY TO FIND OUT YOU CAN'T FLY IT! Instead, this LIST comes up and you choose from this LIST where you want to go. In the background is a world map, showing where you are and where you're headed. But you can't see where you're headed, because the world keeps spinning and the text gets in the way. You can ride Chocobos, but NOTHING beats a good old fashioned AIRSHIP! Flying the airship is one of the parts that every FF gamer looks forward to. Also, the Airship theme--while flying it--is usually one of the best in the game.WHAT REALLY ANGERS ME: Playing the game for 60 hours, trying to get the Magus Sisters only to realize that you need Anima, but to get Anima you need a special item in this temple. But you can't GET to the temple (Bevelle). If you don't do it your first time, too bad. And the thing is, like Final Fantasy 8, you almost NEED THE most powerful summons to take out Braska's Final Aeon. Ultima, Flare, and Holy are not what they're supposed to be--they're rather weak and not much eye-candy. This game is VERY popular in the barracks where I live, but I know of MANY that have resorted to Cheat Codes.CHARACTERS: Tidus is whiny and annoying, Yuna is little miss goody two-shoes. Auron is a copy of Toshiro Mifune in the black and white, Japanese, Akira Kurasawa movies &quot;Sanjuro&quot; and &quot;Yojimbo&quot;--which is why he's so cool.This is the first FF to use voice, but I wish they hadn't. Part of FANTASY is using your IMAGINATION.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2002"}

{"product_name":"B0053BSNZU","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"Best MMA Game Available","reviewText":"This is definitely the best and most realistic MMA game on the market, however like graphics the uncanny valley comes into play, the closer it gets to a 1-1 simulation the more glaring the problems become. This game has an extremely detailed set of moves, with an incredibly steep learning curve, even after spending hours playing through the tutorial. After taking a character all the way through the career mode and feeling kind of like a bad ass,  when I tried the higher difficulties for some of the achievements it was extremely difficult. Ultimately the lower difficulties are where most people will have the most fun, and most of the problems aren't so obvious. When you try the higher levels, the AI is almost prescient to your moves, and the previously extensive move set seems too limited for what you need to beat the opponent. There is one thing that sucks on every difficulty level, and that's the new submission system. I don't know if there was something wrong with my controller or my co-ordination, but I could never get the hang of it, and I maybe succeeded with one submission, and got out of only a few. I would maybe be okay with the system if it accurately represented the submission game in real-life MMA, but it doesn't at all. I would feel safe to wager that the submission system will be completely revamped for UFC 4.For the Career Mode, I had a lot of fun with it, but I was disappointed to see very few changes from the previous games other than the addition of Pride rules (which were awesome at times). I would love to see more of a story added to this mode, and they could even use their Ultimate Fighter reality show as a great beginning to this mode. For the RPG stat increase system in career mode, there were a lot of problems. Personally I found some of the exercises to be fun and others to be incredibly annoying. However, the likeability of the exercises doesn't really determine which one's you'll use, as many of the exercises for some reason greatly decrease other stats (Equally or greater than the stats being improved!) so I really only stuck to two exercises especially towards the end of my career (the Heavy Bag and the Tire Flip). The create-a-fighter ratings were also screwed up, I think that I won the UFC belt before I broke the 80's, and I retired as the best fighter in history before I broke the 90's.In the end, if you still have the previous UFC games, there's really no reason to buy this game. However, if you don't own them and want to play an MMA fighting game, this is absolutely your best option, and I would highly recommend it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2012"}

As unusual as the Disney-meets-Final Fantasy concept is, the series has become one of the most popular modern RPG franchises. The latest entry in the series, Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance, is a challenging yet enjoyable game. The new flowmotion mechanic, dream spirits, and colorful worlds make Kingdom Hearts 3D the all-around best game in the series thus far!The story of Kingdom Hearts 3D picks up where the game Kingdom Hearts Re: Coded left off. The protagonist Sora and his friend Riku need to prove themselves as true masters of the keyblade, a key-like weapon that is used throughout the series. To do this, they must rescue worlds that are lost in slumber by unlocking the keyholes found in the worlds. The story is interesting, but it gets complex. There are some things that take place later in the story that I still don't fully understand. However, unlike many other games, you can actually understand most of this story without playing the other games in the series first (although I would recommend playing the others). This is because the game comes with a glossary that defines key elements in the series, and also with a section called Chronicles that tells the basic plots of the previous games in the series.The play style for this game is the best in the series. It maintains the elements that made the series so great, and adds more to it. As with the other games, you go to several worlds fighting enemies in real time battles. Fighting enemies gives you experience points which, when enough are gained, will allow you to level up. You also have deck commands, which let you do things like cast magic or do special attacks such as throwing the keyblade.In the game, you play both Sora's and Riku's stories. Both characters have a drop meter that depletes as you play. When the meter runs out, you switch to the other character's story. This is called \"dropping.\" You can also manually drop by pausing the game and tapping the drop button on the touch screen. The problem with dropping is that unless you manually drop regularly, you can end up dropping in the middle of a fight or boss battle. If you drop in the middle of a boss, you have to restart the battle when you drop again.The main element that makes Kingdom Hearts 3D so great is the new flowmotion mechanic. Flowmotion allows you to dash into a wall, a pole, or other object and perform either an extended dash or special attack to have your character interact with objects in unique ways. Some things this lets you do is grind on rails and spin around large enemies. When used in combat, the flowmotion mechanic creates very flashy battle sequences.Another new addition to the series are the dream spirits. Dream spirits replace your usual teammates of Donald Duck and Goofy, and they resemble animals such as dogs and bats. You can raise your dream spirits like pets by naming, petting, and painting them different colors. You can also put them in tournaments against other dream spirits. Depending on what kind of dream spirits are on your team, you can equip different upgrades to your character such as health upgrades and attack boosts. I honestly think that the dream spirits are a great improvement over Donald and Goofy.The final new feature that this game introduces is reality shifts. Reality shifts are special moves that either damage your enemies or help you get around in the worlds. These are activated when a purple icon appears on the enemy or obstacle, and you slide the stylus down on the touch screen. Another way to activate reality shifts is to press the X and A buttons at the same time. Reality shifts vary depending on the world you are in. Some include flinging objects like a catapult or making grind rails that allow you to reach other areas. Reality shifts range from average to really cool.The graphics to the game are true to the other Kingdom Hearts games. The 3DS' graphics capabilities enable the game to look just like the PS2 games.The worlds in this game look great! As with the previous Kingdom Hearts games, most of the worlds you visit are themed after Disney films. Aside from a world or two, all of the worlds are brand new. The worlds featured are colorful and unique.Also, the 3D in the game works really well. Menu screens pop out, and when you use flowmotion, things appear to be flying out of the screen. Unlike most 3DS games, I actually enjoy playing this game in 3D.The music in the game is excellent. Although some of the tracks are reused from previous games, there are still enough new songs to keep the soundtrack sounding fresh. The voices of the Kingdom Hearts exclusive characters, as well as all the other Disney characters, sound really expressive.The controls in the game are simple. You run with the slide pad, jump with the B button, attack with the A button, roll with the Y button, and activate deck commands with the X button. You can scroll through commands with the directional pads and move the camera with the L and R buttons.My criticisms for the game are few. My biggest complaint is that even though basic gameplay is challenging, boss battles get extremely frustrating sometimes. The flowmotion ability is usually the best strategy in these situations, but sometimes they cause you to die even more. When you level up enough, you can unlock an ability called \"Second Chance.\" This move allows you to keep at least one HP when you die, which makes these bosses easier. As mentioned earlier, unless you manually drop regularly, you will probably drop in the middle of a fight or boss battle, which can get really annoying. My final complaint is that the dialogue sometimes gets really odd. For example, the line, \"Well, I guess the rules of the worlds don't apply when your hearts are connected\" makes the infamous \"lamers\" line in Kingdom Hearts II look like poetry.Kingdom Hearts 3D is an incredible game and one of the best 3DS games out there. The gameplay is even better than the other Kingdom Hearts games, which is saying a lot because I loved the gameplay in the other games.  Because of the fast-paced flowmotion mechanic, the colorful new worlds, and the useful dream spirits, Kingdom Hearts 3D is to me the best game in the series.Final Score: 9.1/10For more details on games such as this one, visit [...]","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00004U1QY","description":"Nintendo certainly has added a quirky spin on the old English game withMario Tennis. With 16 classic Nintendo characters on hand, ranging from  Bowser to Baby Mario, the crux of the game is the standard game of tennis, with  its break points, deuces, and double faults, but also with the added bonus of  power-ups and special moves.The game revolves around the individual players, and, as in other Mario  adventures, the characters all have their own strengths and weaknesses. Bowser  is great for the sheer strength and his powerful smashes, while other characters  survive on speed and agility, rather like inMario KartorMario  Golf.With Exhibition, Tournament, and Multiplayer modes, the game does have a number  of options to keep you busy. The chance to play with up to three other players  makes this game great to play with your friends.With this game, Nintendo has done to tennis what it did to kart racing and golf,  by producing a fun spin on what's not usually the most fun in computer games.  This is how tennis should be: super smashes, special combos, and Mario running  around in circles.--Stuart Miles--Amazon.co.ukNintendo has incorporated characters from the Super Mario Brothers series into a tennis simulation game for up to 4 players.  Each player manipulates a selected character from the 13 in the series.  There are multiple levels of difficulty.  Players need to learn the types of strategies used in traditional tennis; each can choose how to hit the ball over the net by selecting from a wide range of moves, some of which may be unique to the character each has chosen.  Lobs, smashes, and cross-court shots are among the options.Mario Tennis 64 taps the controlled challenge of real-life tennis, and intertwines light-hearted graphics with good game play.  A 2000 Parents' Choice&#174; Approved winner.Reviewed by Jason R. Rich, Parents' Choice&#174; 2000--FromParents' Choice&#174;","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Amazing fun for all ages","reviewText":"I was very skeptical that a video tennis game could be at all interesting. It was only after a fair amount of discussion that we decided to give this one a try, and see what it was like.It was great fun!! You can choose from tons of players - Mario, Luigi, Shy Guy, Birdo, Paratroopa, and much more. Each has its own particular strengths and weaknesses. Gameplay brings back the addictive qualities of pong and other such games - try to put spin and lob on the ball to sneak past your opponents.You can play with up to four players, using the computer as substitutes for humans if you wish. There are different court types to add complexity to gameplay. There are also a series of fun games where you have to get the most rings, or use special items, or even play on a moving base.There are also competitions where you work your way progressively through your opponents until you emerge the victor.Definitely a great game for a group of people, and the game also is fun as solo-play to hone your reflexes. I'd gladly recommend this one to all ages!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2000"}
{"product_name":"B000R1A0L6","description":"Godzilla Unleashed - Everyone's favorite monster returns in a completely redesigned and updated massively destructive brawler! Play Godzilla as never before with non-linear story paths and all new Toho monsters.","reviewerName":"I'm hungry. feed me","summary":"I think it needs improvement","reviewText":"This game isn't bad but it isn't the best either. At first, it was great, then it became difficult. Later on in the game, the controls became difficult to use, the remaining unlock-able monsters became very hard to get and it took me hours to complete a certain task. The game is fun but very frustrating and time consuming at the same time. It is a big step up from the last Godzilla game :Godzilla: Save the Earthand is a lot better than theDS Edition. In All, I thinkGodzilla UnleashedforPlayStation 2is the better edition of the game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2008"}
{"product_name":"B004FUL9YW","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Hicks","summary":"Way better than I expected","reviewText":"I sort of liked the first one. I don't think I finished it, but this sequel seems more engaging.Looks good, no camera problems for me except that it will occasionally default back to uninverted views.The story is good, engaging and enhances the missions. This is a fairly standard wash, rinse, repeat semi-open world where you have to find and absorb someone to collect information, but there are occasional surprises and SNAFU s that occur along the way,The side missions are challenging, but are not terribly diverse. I don't know if I will bother with them more than a few times.It feels like I am slow to evolve - that may just be my gameplay.The saves are frequent and automatic. Golly I love when that's the case.It isn't a revolutionary game, but it feels completely worth the 30 bucks that it seems to be going for these days.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2012"}
