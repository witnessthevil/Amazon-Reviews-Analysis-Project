{"product_name":"B00020BV2E","reviewerName":"D. Mok","summary":"Fun and addictive, but incredibly frustrating.","reviewText":"I'll be the first to admit, modern games tend to be far too frustrating for me.  My reflexes probably aren't up to younger players of today, and I have far less patience for replaying a mission 20 times -- I tend to drop the ball.To be perfectly fair to Mercenaries, I haven't been as glued to a single game since Syphon Filter:  The Omega Strain, and Syphon Filter had a natural edge anyway because I'm a veteran of the first games in the series for the PlayStation.  Mercenaries was impressive to me because it seduced me enough to make me learn a whole new control scheme, get acquainted with the background and routines, and get past that initial awkward stage when you're just feeling things out.  This one definitely did the trick.  There are times, though, when I still feel like the game is unnecessarily hard.  Again, how many times are we supposed to play one mission until we get it?  I always feel like designers create these enormously difficult missions just to make us into game zombies, and Mercenaries definitely gives me that feeling.Good points:- Great comedic detail.  The sense of humour in this game, as well as the one-man-army setup, reminds me of the first Medal of Honor game (the orchestral score by Michael Giacchino, Medal of Honor's resident composer, doesn't hurt), which was a favourite of mine.- Very smooth driving engine.  I hate driving games, but this one was instantly accessible.- The game's background immerses you.  Driving through cities, with civilians and fighting personnel around you, it's a great simulation of what this kind of guerilla warfare is like.  Almost makes me feel like I'm living the John Woo film Bullet in the Head.- This game has the single most responsive camera control of any I've ever played.  This is how you do it -- give the player complete control, and don't blast the angles around in response to onscreen action, because that simply disorients us.  Somebody at Pandemic knows his game controls.- By and large good voice work.  Amy Lee (*not* Evanescence's singer, I presume) as your main communications person Fiona Taylor is the only dud, far too cutesy to be running a merc operation, but the underrated Bruce McGill (a regular of Michael Mann's) as CIA agent Buford is great, and the character Jennifer Mui is voiced by -- who else? -- Jennifer Hale, who has one of the sexiest English female voices in the biz and seems to have appeared in every single video game ever made.  And who plays Allied Colonel Garrett but Apollo Creed himself, Carl Weathers?- I'm very impressed by the diversity of the missions.  There's the usual number of blow-'em-up missions, but some of them are not only creative, but true to the background.  My favourite is the one where you have to deliver a journalist to certain key fighting areas just so he can get media footage of the war.- Fighting mechanics are good.  I had a hugely difficult time aiming with the right analog stick and moving with the left in Medal of Honor:  Frontline, but Mercenaries felt instantly comfortable.- For once, you have a game where your allies aren't complete idiots.  I was pleased with the amount of control you have -- board a vehicle with a top-mounted weapon, and you can honk your horn and make an ally mount the gun to give you covering fire.  You can also choose when an ally leaves your vehicle.  Ahhh, control.- Innovative system for shopping.  You call in a chopper to do a supply drop for you, and you can order different packages (for example, the Chinese supply drop gives you a rocket launcher and an AK-model assault rifle, but the Russians give you an SMG and a shotgun).  Feels very realistic and accessible.Bad points:- Limited number of weapons, only two or three of which are genuinely useful.  Enemy infantry take about 10 hits from a light machine gun before they die, and even more if you're using an M4 carbine.  What are they, Terminators?- The Russian \"faction\" controls the store, the only reliable source of weapons and health, which means you're practically stuck with being unable to take jobs that can offend the Russians.  The shop shouldn't be affected by what mission you take if you're really interested in giving players freedom to choose their allegiance.- Exaggerated collision.  Cars sometimes feel like tumbling dice.  Hit a tiny little rock at the wrong angle and the whole vehicle rolls over.  A mutha of a drag in what is otherwise a great driving engine.- I have nothing but contempt for games that obsessively track how many times you've saved your game and retried missions, as if to penalize you.  Game saves are an essential feature of any video game, and if you're going to punish the player for saving, you're just insulting the player populace.  Ever heard of power outages?  Game freezes?  Glitches?  And I can understand why you can't save your game during a major contract, but why is \"Load Game\" disabled as well?  Why give the player so much crap about saving and loading data?- There's a major imbalance in the game when it comes to explosive weapons.  RPG-wielding enemies can score a direct hit on you -- not just catch you in the rocket's explosion, but hit your body -- from 200 feet away, while you're running at full speed!  Each direct hit takes 80 per cent of your health, and if you're fighting multiple rocket-launching infantry, you can lose your entire health bar in a matter of three seconds.  Whereas if you use the exact same weapon, get a lock on a static target like an artillery battery, your rocket could go flying off into space rather than hit your intended target.  Not only is this unrealistic, it makes certain missions maddeningly infuriating.  These are the only points where I throw down the controller and give up.  I'm not about to jump through just any hoop the designers throw at me, if it's not reasonable.  Nearly every mission beyond the first five or six can include up to a dozen RPG troops you have to fight, and at a certain point, it's just unfair.- This game is extremely stingy with ammo.  A helicopter you pay $100,000 for comes only with two missiles, and many vehicles and enemy artillery take two shots before they die.  Same for an RPG if you find one -- you can only hold four shots, and tanks take at least two shots from you before dying.  This essentially leaves you defenseless while the enemies pump you full of lead and rockets without ever having to replenish.- The AI is sometimes so cheap that it messes up your mission through no fault of your own.  In certain locations with heavily concentrated enemies, they will try to run you over with their cars.  If you're caught by enough cars, you won't even get a chance to recover your control of your character before your health runs out.  You're supposed to capture these enemy officers -- \"Deck of 52\" -- alive, but the enemy vehicles, tanks and RPG soldiers will gleefully kill these officers themselves when you try to approach, often forcing you to replay the mission, through no fault of your own.  And one time, I called in a support chopper which then crashed itself -- costing me $25,000.  The worst kinds of game features are the ones that force the player to replay a mission because of computer mistakes; at a certain point, I just spat at the game screen and used cheat codes to make up for whenever the computer costs me money for things I can't control.- The game makes the whole screen red and puts you in slow-motion when you're near death, making aiming your weapon and dodging even more difficult.  That's just moronic.  So you're in trouble, and the game makes it even harder for you to survive?  Who cares if it \"looks cool\"?I'm frustrated by this game, but I also can't say I don't enjoy it.  Too bad they had to make it so freakin' hard.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2005"}

It's truly reminiscent of the detective games on PCs in the mid 90s before the FPS took over. However, instead of the crappy FMV in those games, this game has the best graphics of any game I've ever seen. The acting is amazing and the new motion capture technology Rockstar used is the real deal. It's hard to tell if you are watching a movie or a cutscene when they happen. I'm sure the action game community will not be impressed buy this kind of game because the drama lies in your ability to interrogate suspects, follow up leads and search crime scenes rather then finger twitching action. For those looking for a follow up to GTA or Red Dead, THIS IS NOT IT!!

It's important to note that you MUST have a Move system in order to play this game!The game is fairly basic, as you'd expect from a first game out with a new technology. It's there to give you a taste of how Move works and to encourage you to buy more games. There are a number of game areas for you to choose from - Disc Golf, Gladiator Duel, Beach Volleyball, Archery, Table Tennis and Bocce. None are particularly stunning, but they're all reasonably fun.You'll want to have a LOT of controllers to play this. Some of the games work best if a player has two Move wands, one in each hand. If you have two people playing against each other, that's a lot of wands! At the least you'd want to have one wand per person so they can play against each other.The games do help to demonstrate how the Move works. For example in Table Tennis the slightest twist of your wrist really does turn the paddle. You can tilt it up and down, left and right, forward and back, all with subtle hand movements.With sword fighting, the system knows if you're doing a quick, short attack or a broad, sweeping attack and your character reacts accordingly. Just be careful not to swing too wildly - you can end up hitting the person standing next to you by accident! Yes, I know from experience :)There are both quick-play options as well as a challenge mode. There are different locations for you to play in, a variety of male and female characters to choose from, and different outfits as well.The game is certainly a good one to start out with - it gives you a range of activities, gets you used to how the Move controllers work, and doesn't overwhelm you with complicated button sequences or confusing missions. Well recommended as a first game for your Move system to get your feet wet!Rating: 9/10We purchased Sports Champions PS3 with our own funds.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00006LEMX","description":"Looking for a new obsession to keep you up nights? Let me introduce you to Hotsuma, the main character inShinobi, the much anticipated new action-adventure game from Sega. Fans of the original 2-D game have been waiting seven years for the next installment, and won't be disappointed by this energetic 3-D game for PS2.The premise hasn't changed much--kill bad guys, kill more bad guys, kill a boss, move on to the next level. You, Hotsuma, are the leader of the Oboro clan. As your clansmen are destroyed, you set out to avenge their deaths by slashing hellspawn and enemy ninjas to death with your powerful sword, Akujiki. As you move through game levels, Akujiki comes alive with power, absorbing the souls of those you kill--and turning against you if you don't keep him well fed. The basic moves--run, jump, slash--are easy to learn, but with each level you must master difficult combos to defeat trickier enemies. Moving quickly and attacking instinctively is essential to killing fast and furiously--each kill gives your sword more power, while each moment of hesitation makes your weapon impatient for blood.Shinobi, at heart, is a souped-up arcade game with awesome graphics. The anime-style cutscenes woven around the slice-and-dice sequences provide an interesting story, but one that doesn't relate very directly with your job on the streets of postapocalyptic Tokyo. Your moves are cool though--spinning in midair to collect coins that will unlock secret levels, killing three ninjas with a flash of Akujiki, zipping around so fast that a shadow of your ghost remains. It's easy to get caught up in the exhilarating energy of the game. Serious gamers will enjoy confronting bosses, who may take several frustrating tries to kill. But when you finally defeat them, you will feel the power of centuries of samurai.--Maile BohlmannPros:Fantastic graphicsExcellent scripting and voicingFairly easy controls and maneuvers at outsetExciting fighting sequences with intense gameplayCons:Killing early bosses can be unusually difficultLong sequences with no save pointsStoryline frames fighting sequences, rather than interacting with them","reviewerName":"-- \"--\"","summary":"A Fine, But Flawed, Action Romp","reviewText":"\"Shinobi\" casts you as a rogue ninja out for vengeance against the sorcerer who slaughtered your clan in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo. The story unfolds throughout the game in beautifully rendered cut-scenes, but it never amounts to much in the end. That is fine, considering that \"Shinobi\" is best enjoyed as a frantic action game where the backstory is expendable in the face of some intense, and quite enjoyable, gameplay. Unfortunately, this very same action can become repetitive as the game endures, and without a gripping story to keep you involved, \"Shinobi\" certainly has its lulls. Still, fans of the original series will definitely want to give it a look, and newcomers will find a lot to like despite the game's failings.The Pros: Intense action and a slew of powerful ninja abilities keep things moving most of the time. Despite the fact that this is a hack-and-slash 3rd person action vehicle, and there are many such games on the market, you've probably never played anything quite like \"Shinobi\" when it comes to the abilities and magical attacks at your disposal. Similarities abound to various other games, but \"Shinobi\" still has a personality all its own. The rendered cut-scenes are gorgeous and well-animated, and despite the fact that they fail to tell a completely coherent story, you will be glued to the screen in any case. It's good, cinematic stuff, and the voice-acting and translation-from-Japanese are much better than you might expect. If you love a challenge, then \"Shinobi\" is calling out for you to give it a go. This game isn't a breeze, and the boss encounters will have your palms sweating for sure. You will die, and you will die often, before you finally overcome your enemies and come to the end.The Cons: The action, while generally fun, can get tedious and repetitive sometimes. Every level in the game pretty much feels like the level that came before it, and certain areas within a level are carbon copies of areas you just visited moments before. Sometimes you would swear you were going in circles. \"Shinobi\" only lets you save between levels, and given the difficulty of some of these levels, that is a large oversight. Imagine jumping puzzles that can kill you with one false step and a sword that drains your health if you linger in one place for too long without feeding enemy souls into its hungry blade, and then imagine dying near the exit of a lengthy mission only to start from scratch at the beginning. There aren't even any checkpoints. This makes things needlessly frustrating. This game comes complete with bland in-game graphics, some mostly atrocious music, and repetitive sound effects. None of these things make or break a good game, but they certainly don't add points either. A disappointing ending makes the experience feel a bit unsatisfying.Despite my niggles, I enjoyed \"Shinobi,\" after a fashion, but it's nothing to rave about, and there are certainly those who will become furious and never finish it because of its unforgiving save system. However, if you are patient, you will persevere, and you might even enjoy yourself in the process, and that's at the very core of a good game... but not a great one.Final Grade: C (or 3 stars on a curve)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2003"}

Over 120 plus hours of total combined gameplay, numerous additions and enhancements, and critically-acclaimed game and art design.","reviewerName":"Arch Stanton","summary":"Fiendishly Addictive","reviewText":"This game is horribly addictive. I didn't expect to like it, but I couldn't stop once I did. Actually, I think that this is the rarest of games: the kind that keeps you interested over a long period of time, but doesn't demand that you spend every waking hour on it. I found that about 2-3 hours a day was enough to satisfy my interest, while still keeping me eager to play it again the next day.This game can be pretty easily divided into two separate sections: the social gaming and the dungeon crawling. The social gaming is complicated so I'll cover it later. The dungeon crawling is pretty basic RPG fare. You run around Tartarus (a giant dungeon that takes the place of your school in the Dark Hour) and if you hit any of the little monsters running around you enter a turn-based battle mode. The combat system is fairly standard as well, although the ability to knock characters down and issue an all-out attack can be both a lifesaver and a massive nuisance. The biggest problem with it is that you can only control your character and not any of the others, which can lead to massive defeats that could be easily avoided since the death of your character results in a game over even if everyone else survives. Tartarus is divided into over 200 floors whose layouts are randomly generated each time you visit. This all becomes rather repetitive, but somehow the rest of the game can make up for it.The social gaming is the truly innovative part of this game. I understand that social games are popular in Japan, but they never took off over here so it feels completely fresh. You spend your day as a secondary school student in Gekkoukan High. You go to class, make friends, and attend societies. At night you can go to Tartarus and kill demons. The game takes place over most of a schoolyear so you have plenty of time to do all four. The day is divided into five main periods: early morning, morning, lunchtime, after school, and evening. Most of them are scripted (it is a school after all) but you have control over what you do in your afternoon and evening slot, as well as during your Sundays. You can choose to go out with friends, study, or do solo activities. You can even play a game within a game which I think kicks you down to the level with crumbling skyscrapers. As you make friends you establish things called \"Social Links\" which allow you to build better Personas (the main fighting mechanic) and have character development. Otherwise the social gaming would be fairly unconnected to the main quest.The control you have over your character's life is compelling. Depending on your decisions you can get a girlfriend, make friends, ace tests, bomb tests, etc. It really feels like leading a second life. I was surprised at how quickly I settled into the mode of a high school student. In some ways the dungeon crawling is actually a distraction. In other ways it is the glue that ties everything together. Without the supernatural element I'd probably have bored of the school life a lot quicker. And without the school life I'd have bored of the dungeon crawling in a heartbeat. It's quite strange how well the two work together.Two other aspects that must be discussed: story and characters. The story here is really good, even aside from the character-development scenes. The sense of impending doom is captured pretty well by the end, even though the repetitive attending of lessons does rather lesson its impact. The only real problem with the plot is that it is (by necessity) repetitive. My favorite events are the scripted ones like the beach holiday (mandated by Japanese law to appear in every Anime) and the school trip but generally you have complete control of your life except for once a month when the shadows arrive. Also, towards the end it seems to lose its focus, only to regain it in a slightly odd direction that doesn't seem to work as well. The characters are all strong, with Akihito, Junpei, Mitsuru, Ken, Yukari, and Aegis being the chief standouts. Err, I think that's pretty much all of them. At any rate, it feels great just hanging out for a year with these cool guys in their sweet dorm.This game has a few problems but they are minimal (the Sumerians were NOT writing in 4000 BC dammit! Stupid teachers and their innacurate questions. grumble grumble). The elements I worried I'd despise (such as the social gaming, the emo-looking protagonist, and the loud rock music during fight scenes) turned out to really help pull me in. The game as a whole is compelling and draws you into the life of a normal Japanese schoolboy in a way no other game can match (I assume fighting demons by night is normal for a Japanese schoolboy, right?). But really, anything bad I had to say about the game would be nitpicky. If you have any interest in RPGs at all then play this game.FES also includes an additional chapter entitled \"The Answer\" as opposed to \"The Question\", which is the title they give to the regular game. I cannot recommend playing it. Aside from the fact that it provides a few definitive answers that were better off left vague and teases a happy resolution when it can provide none, it also ramps the difficulty up to eleven. Atlus has a tendency to make impossibly hard games that can only be beaten by hardcore gamers (seeDevil Survivorfor a prime example). I don't understand that business model since not everyone is capable of beating the games on such difficulty. Surely offering challenging as an option is sufficient for the developers? Anyway, what makes this chapter so difficult is that it A. Reduces your characters back to level 25, B. Features some tough new enemies, and C. No longer allows you to buy back Personas that you've already made. This last one in particular means that you need to go online and find a fusion guide. I don't know how else you could do it. Without the social links it is merely a linear dungeon crawler, and not very interesting for the most part. While some of the character development is insightful, I was much happier where the original game ended. It was bittersweet, but fitting.Quick note: this game is available on the PSN, the only PS2 game on it that I know of. That's where I played it and it works well. There is a sequel calledShin Megami Tensei: Persona 4that continues with the social links system used here. I've played a bit of it and it doesn't seem as compelling as this game, although I appreciate the fact that you can control all of your party members during battle. It isn't available on the PSN so I'm unlikely to play it for quite a while, unless I get a Vita and play theVita remake. The first two games (oneandtwo) didn't have this and aren't so interesting as a result. There is also a port of this game to the PSP calledShin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 Portable. It gets rid of the awesome cutscenes and the world map, but adds the ability to play as a female character. It's a pretty good addition and worth checking out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2013"}

Boy was I wrong!  This is the best Batman game I have ever played and one of the best action games of the year so far.  I received this game on release day and have been playing it non-stop.  The graphics are top notch, from Batman's suit to his stubble, to the jokers face this game has a ton of detail.The action is composed of brawling, batarang throwing, grappling around certain areas and sneaking through the shadows.  The brawling is actually fun and does not feel repetitive to me.  At times when you go in for the last shot on an enemy the action slows down and becomes very cinematic.  The effect is super cool.  Using your grappling gun you can traverse areas that can't be reached on foot or grappling to higher areas so you can sneak up on enemies from behind.  There are 20 \"upgrades\" you can get as you progress through the game that allow you to upgrade your armour, gain the ability to throw multiple batarangs, etc.  There are also \"riddler puzzles\" throughout the game as well.  Just a lot of cool stuff in this game to keep you wanting to play.  One of the coolest features is detective mode which lets you analyze areas and see through structures to find out where enemies are, among other uses.Overall if you are a fan of action games or Batman games I think you will love this game!  The action in Arkham and on Arkham Island is a blast to play.  The only game I have played so far this year that has been remotely this fun is Infamous.  That should tell you the quality of this game.  I highly recommend this game1","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2009"}

There is just something about sumptuous imagery, action-packed gameplay, and spectacular level design that just soothes the nerves.God of War II improves the gameplay with more moves, more variety of gameplay syles and enemies, and of course improved graphics and grandiose bosses and environments. I'm not one to really care about stories in video games, but GOW was interesting enough that I actually wanted to watch the cut scenes. Anti-hero Kratos continues his bad-boy antics, butchering all those who get in his way or using them for his own selfish purposes. His raison d'etre is quite shallow; revenge upon the Gods who betrayed him, namely Zeus. But hey, it's a good enough excuse for some gory action. Just like with the first GOW, I've seen some reviews from people accusing this game of simply being an ultra-violent, mindless button-masher. They must not've played it all the way thru. Sure it utilizes those two factors to make for an interesting game, but there is so much more to this game. Play it on the highest difficulty especially and you'll find you will need to incorporate more strategic thinking. And with plenty of unlockables, it has a huge replay value. The only negative thing I can think of is that the difficulty is a bit lower than the first one.This is definitely a game to pick up if you haven't already. This is truly among the cream of the crop for the PS2.And to all those whiners and pansies who complain about games like this being \"too violent\" and having \"negative influences\" ; this is FANTANSY meant to be enjoyed by mature audiences who are able to distinguish reality from fiction.

The Pro Elite Wireless Controller is by no means a replica Xbox 360 controller, or even an Xbox 360 replacement for the PS3, but if you're a gamer who prefers the Xbox 360 controller layout, then this is definitely worth a look.  Here's my side by side observations of the Pro Elite vs the Dualshock vs the Xbox 360 controller:LOOK & FEEL:First to note is that the Pro Elite is larger than the Dualshock controller.  It is approximately the same size and shape as an Xbox 360 controller, but it is lighter in weight than the Xbox controller (about the same weight of a Dualshock), has textured handle grips, and orange glowing buttons.  I don't mind the grip except to say that it's a little rough on your hands after you've gripped it tightly for a few hours.  However, I find the Xbox-inspired ergonomic styling of the body easier and more comfortable to hold than the Dualshock controller.The Pro Elite's thumb stick placement is more in keeping with the Xbox controller rather than the Dualshock.  All the buttons glow orange and have the corresponding PS3 symbol on them.  If you are used to the Dualshock button placement, you won't have any trouble with them not being color-coded.The thumb sticks are about as 'firm' as the Dualshock, which is to say, a little softer than the Xbox controller.  I prefer the Xbox-style placement of these thumb sticks over that of the Dualshock.  I have not experienced any 'dead zone' -- I am not saying it's not there, as other reviewers have noted, just that I have not experienced it.  I mostly play games like \"Uncharted\" and \"Infamous\" and some puzzle games.The triggers are still Dualshock-style (ie: recessed backwards), but I added somePelican PS3 Dual L / R Triggers Controller Attachments for Playstation 3to them, which helps jut them forward.The dual rumble is very nice, and seems comparable with the Dualshock in intensity.SETUP:The Pro Elite Wireless Controller requires a receiver dongle to be plugged into the front of your PS3, and paired with the controller (synced) to use.  Once synced, it as a good wireless range for any room.  Although this version of the Pro Elite is wireless, it charges through this dongle via a cable, and while charging, I found the cord way too short to be able to charge and play comfortably.  Also, the dongle must remain plugged into the front of your PS3 at all times (when using the Pro Elite).CONCLUSION:Being a gamer who prefers the Xbox-style controller, I could not be happier with the Pro Elite Wireless Controller for my PS3.  It suits my play style and I'm glad I found it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000R0SRNU","description":"LucasArts LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga 33076 PC Games","reviewerName":"Jonathan","summary":"A thoroughly enjoyable, if not particularly deep, game","reviewText":"The game Lego Star Wars is just what it sounds: a kid's take on the classic sci-fi series using Lego stand-ins instead of rendered people. As such, you should expect this game to be simplistic, childish and somewhat repetitive (it is, after all, listed as a family game). Once you realize this, the game is a blast.Each of the six episodes is divided into six parts. At first the player only has access to Episode I Part 1, but once that is beat Part 1 of each of the other five episodes is unlocked. Beating Part 1 in an episode gives you access to Part 2, beating Part 2 unlocks Part 3, and so on.Each part takes between 15 and 30 minutes to beat, on average, so you can actually accomplish something if you only have a limited amount of time. The first play-through is always in \"Story\" mode, where your characters are pre-selected. Beating it on \"Story\" mode unlocks \"Free Play,\" where you get to choose a roster of characters. This effectively doubles the length of the game, because a lot of the bonus items are unattainable in story mode (for example, an item might be located behind a door accessible only by a stormtrooper, but story mode is played using Obi-Wan and an R2 droid). Most of the bonus items are actually pretty decent. There is also a HUGE cast of characters, about half of which unlock as you play through the game and half available for purchase, but they fall into a half-dozen or so categories, so there is not much of a learning curve. \"Death\" in the game consists of being penalized about 2,000 studs (the game's currency) and being almost instantly respawned, with one level excepted (see below). This makes the game much more accessible to younger players and gamers with less-than-lightning-quick reflexes.The game also comes with a healthy dose of humor - the \"I am your father\" scene is PRICELESS, in my opinion. This humor is a big part of keeping the adults interested.Now, a few cons from the game. There are a few levels where you pilot vehicles full-time. The perspective is a bit weird, the screen is quite busy, and controls handle clumsily. On top of that, the game tends to turn you around at weird points. I was actually glad when I reached the end of these levels, because they are decidedly less fun to play than the character levels. Speaking of character levels, there's a lot of places where you can fall to your death, but many of them are not obvious until you hit them. Finally, the last part of Episode III inexplicably changes the \"death\" mechanic from an instant respawn to a checkpoint restart (even on co-op and even if the other person is still alive). This is incredibly frustrating, as the level requires the most precise timing of the game - it involves jumping between platforms that are sinking into lava.Those relatively minor annoyances aside, this is a fun game. Yeah, it's simplistic, but it's entertaining, and that's what video games are supposed to be.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2010"}

Everything in this game is partially cell shaded much like the look of Borderlands, but with a little more anime flavored character models.  The second reason why I like this game was the method of traversing through each level.(+) The level design was made in such a way where you are fluidly moving from one part of the level to the next with little to no break in flow.(+) The storyline in this game universe was also the most compelling to me in the series and kept me interested until the end.  Speaking of the end, I almost feel like this particular universe could be expanded upon in another PoP game if they ever make another one.(-) My only gripe in this game is the minimal amount of enemies that you fight at once.  I don't mind how often battles would play out in the game, but many times I only had to fight one or two enemies off at the same time (and I know the prince can handle fighting much much more off at the same time if he needed too!).This game is an oldy but goody, I may still dust it off and go through it again one day!My score, 4/5 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2012"}

He must journey into Italy&rsquo;s greatest city, Rome, center of power, greed and corruption to strike at the heart of the enemy. Defeating the corrupt tyrants entrenched there will require not only strength, but leadership, as Ezio commands an entire brotherhood of assassins who will rally to his side. Only by working together can the assassins defeat their mortal enemies and prevent the extinction of their order.Multiple Ways to PlayExpanding on the game world woven across the first two games in the franchise,Assassin's Creed: Brotherhoodprovides players with multiple ways to play. In single player mode you take on an engrossing campaign playing as Ezio, the hero fromAssassin's Creed II, who has now risen to the level of Master Assassin. Here players scour the expansive environment of Renaissance-era Rome, tasked with ridding the Eternal City of the continuing stain of the Templars and in the process ensuring the survival of the guild of assassins. You are not in this alone though. Additional AI members of your guild are at your command, and can be summoned to your aid if need be. In addition to this, for the first time in theAssassin's Creedfranchise players can compete with other would-be assassins in multiplayer action. In multiplayer modes players choose from a range of Assassin characters, each with their own backstory, unique weapons and assassination techniques. Choose your assassin character, utilize the virtual reality capabilities of Abstergo Industries' Animus technology and match your skills against other assassins from around the world.

It builds upon the formula of Assassin's Creed II and is more polished.  There are a few more fighting animations for Ezio and new colors for his outfit.  What makes this game so good is the fact that you can take command of your own squad of Assassins that will help you upon your command during missions, and out in the world.  Leveling them up is a cinch as well, as you can send them on missions all over Europe to gain experience.  I would advise only sending them on missions with a 100 percent success rating.  Keeping them around in Rome is the best way to monitor their progress, and you can choose their colors.Rome is beautiful and very true to its Renaissance inspiration.  It's the only city in the game and it's huge. Players will have fun leaping across the rooftops.  The enemies in the game are very challenging and are a joy to fight. The story is everything you'd expect from the Assassins Creed franchise and is good.The multiplayer is fun and suspenseful, as you must maneuver through the crowds searching for and running from other players.All in all this game gets an 8.5/10 from me, and I recommend it especially before playing Assassin's Creed: Revelations.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2012"}

I am the type of gamer that loves the action.  I'm not into roll playing games that much anymore I want to be on the edge of my seat and not getting bored. I love most FPS's online with lots of action and fast pace not to fast because it can get ridiculous.But this game is a wide open relm to KickA$$ in....You have so many powers...You can't drive cars but you wouldn't want to anyway.  You can just throw them.  But you can drive tanks and heli's.  I could go on forever about this game.  Lets just say AWESOME!!!Bottom line is that everyone I have talked to, met, known, seen, or even watched me play it were not dissapointed.STORY:Ok so I admit the story can be a bit corny but I actually expected that.  I didn't believe the story would be that good but the gameplay makes up for it.  To be honest I think a good story line can definatly take a game up higher.  But if it has some good gameplay then I could care less about the story.  I have played many games where I had to sit through the LONG, DRY cut seens with a horrible corny story behind them just to play a game that has ridiculously awesome gameplay.GAMEPLAY:Lets just say this, mix GTA4, Resident Evil, and Crackdown together.  Mix it in a blender and add some KickA$$ and that is the gameplay.I would definantly say rent this game before you buy it but I say that on every game.  Nothing is worse then spending $60 on something worthless to you.  But I will tell you this, if you are really into games like GTA4 and crackdown I think you will find this game very enjoyable.

Being that this game was made in 2006, it certainly holds up very well. Both graphically and game play wise. There are things this game does very well, and things that may rub you the wrong way. I will detail both what I feel are the strengths and weaknesses of this title later. Within the first 15 minutes of the game you learn the following (spoiler free), you are an FBI agent who works serial killer cases, you are mid investigation with 2 other officers when the suspect drops on the scene. The 2 cops go one way, you go the other. The suspect then steals your gun and shoots down the other 2 cops. Because the murder was with your gun you are now a suspect on the run seeking to clear your name and bring the true killer to justice. As you play through the game there are sequences where you use various \"forensic tools/technology\" to gather clues, which advance the plot and the game. Don't worry you do not have to choose which tool to use, an icon appears on the screen, you hit a button and the proper tool pops up. Using the tools to find the clues does not offer much of a challenge, though it is an interesting way of advancing the story, and you do feel like you are a detective. You then upload these clues via cell phone to your trusted contact at FBI headquarters who gives you updates on what the clues mean, further advancing the story and your investigation. As you follow the trail of the suspect you fight various \"crazies\" along the way, from raging homeless to biker street gang types a' la \"Akira\" meets \"Road Warrior\". The publishers claim the game features a \"fully interactive environment\", what that really means is there are various objects you can use as weapons, from lead pipes and metal signs to pistols and shotguns. Ammo is non existent beyond what you find in a weapon, this game was not designed, nor is it meant to be played like a typical first person shooter. Which brings me to my major criticism with the game, which are the combat mechanics. The manner of engagement is swing/shoot your weapon or block. That's it. Now some might say that mastering the combat in this game requires finesse and attention to detail, though I feel as though it rather un-refined and somewhat counter intuitive as far as timing your strikes/blocks (you attack this way 90% of the time as firearms are rare). Now this is by no means a deal breaker, it is fun to bash some heads, though once again the combat system generally feels somewhat sloppy. Though once again this is not an \"action\" centric title, what will keep you playing (and what keeps me playing) is the well executed story, you really do feel like you are in the thick of solving the case. What I am talking about here is called true game immersion, most games are pick up and play, though this title really grabbed me as the story is at the center. And if I may say so this game is actually quite light on the gore/extreme content, granted I would not suggest anyone under the age of about 16 to play this game, though by no means is the content \"over the top\". So in summation the story gets five stars, the action gets three stars, for a 3.5 star average on the game (someone check my math please :).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2009"}

This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving.

With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"J.

{"product_name":"B000R3BNHE","reviewerName":"Antoinette Johnson \"Pooky\"","summary":"IN THE NIGHT!! DREAMS DELIGHT!! I WANT TO SEE YOU STANDING THERE!!","reviewText":"Man I've been having that song in my head alot latelyXD You have no idea how hard it was rating this game. On one hand there were aspects about this game I really hated (gameplay wise), but on the other there were things I really loved and found enjoyable.First off I knew nothing about this games history until the wiiveiwr on youtube reviewed it and I saw some Let's plays and videos of people who loved and hated this game. Apparently this game is the sequal to a old game that came out on the Sega Saturn. It recieved positive reviews from critics and for years fans have waited for a sequal. From what I've seen fans are mixed on this. I became curious about this series, so one day in gamestop (wish I would have looked on Amazon firstXD) saw this in there for 9 dollars and decided to see if its as good or bad as people claim. Heres what I think.Story: Im gonna try to explain best I can because my game didn't have a manual in it. Nights Journey of Dreams is about 2 children whos problems and fears manifest themselves into thier dreams. These problems mostly involve thier parents. With Will its the fear of his father leaving to another city for work and with Helen its a little more complicated because she chooses to spend more time with her friends instead of her mother. Both of them experience nightmares and are attacked by Nightmaren who chase them to Nightopia where they meet Owl and our genderless purple hero Nights who can dualize with children thus taking on thier strenths. Troubles brewing however because the evil god of the Nightmarens Wizemen is seeking to takeover the dream world with the help of his leading maren and Nights former friend, Reala.I actually find the concept very interesting, but can't help but wonder how things would be like if this game was darker or even T rated. It almost sound like some Silent Hill type danger where all the problems and fears you face in the real world manifest themselves into horrible nightmares that could have lasting affects on you when you wake up. Of the two stories Helens story is definately the more interesting of the two. Heck her opening cutscene even managed to scare meXD One thing that always got me and this isn't a spoiler either because its obvious from the start is everyones surprise when Reala reveal Nights as a nightmaren. I mean they have the same body structures. Its almost like how in Sonic the Hedgehog games people tend to mistake Silver and Shadow as SonicXD You have to be blind not to notice. Another thing I must mention is the whole gender debate. Seriously, I know Nights is genderless, but I still see her as a chick darnit! I mean come on! When she got annoyed at Will she put her hand on her hips, stuck a finger at him, and emphasized \"DU-AL-IZED\" with attitude! I can't think of any guy doing that. I think Realas a dude too which is no surprise.Voiceacting: Even though she has the more interesting story, everyone can agree that Helen has the worst voiceacting in this game. I'm not going into too much detail, but just look at some of the cutscenes shes in yourself. Will's voice acting is a little better, but more often than not he forgets hes supposed to British. Alot of people hate Nights voice, but I actually love her voice. I think it fits the character perfectly. Some say it makes her sound too much like a girl (you know genderless), but others say they've heard British boys who have high pitched voices like that. I say whatever floats your boat. Hands down the best voice actors are Wizeman and Reala. Reala sounds awesome. The voice really makes him sound evil and cynical. Wizeman sounds just as evil and one thing that makes him even more awesome is the fact that hes voiced by Roger L. Jackson who voiced Mojo Jojo from the powerpuff girls, Ghostface from Scream, and the Cheschire Cat from American Mcgees Alice! OMG! I would have never known!Gameplay: I have to go over this next because this is what will break this game for people. You can play this one of 3 ways:1. Wii remote. Don't even dare trying to play this with just the wii remote. The controls are horrendousXD Its some type of BS gimmick called the mindsight thats supposingly tricky. Let me just say theres a big difference between tricky and impossible. A star cursur appears on the screen and you hold down A to move Nights. Its so awkwardX_X2. Nunchuck and wiiremote. This works way better, but its still pretty difficult to control your flying.3. Classic Controller. This is most recommended. This is one of those games you need a classic controller on hand to play. Its still difficult though because once you build up speed negotiating through rings become harder because you'll often find yourself flying pass a bunch of them dispite how careful you move the analogue stick. I've been getting better at it, but it still feels strange and takes the fun out of the game a bit. You can also use a gamecube controller, but I don't own one.Besides flying theres also foot levels where you have to negotiate one of the 2 children you pick in this game. My problem isn't the fact that you don't get to fly, but somethingelse I'll explain later.Bosses: Every boss in this game is unique even though some of them borrow elements from bosses in the Saturn version and takes some form of stratagy to defeat. You fight each boss twice with the exception of the final boss and Reala under the first endings.Graphics and Music: OMG! I cannot stress how gorgeous this game looks expecially on a high definition flatscreen TV! It was like looking at a movie! I've heard people say it looks better than Super Mario Galxy and I couldn't agree more. This game just screams Blue Ray which makes me surprised it was never released for the PS3. This game screams IMax as well. I can almost imagine what it'll look in an IMax theatre. Its hands down one of the best looking wii games ever. When I popped this sucker in my wii I didn't expect it to be so breathtaking. The entire game from its cutscenes to its levels are breath taking. The music is fabulous. The best tracks are definately the Realas theme, Queen Bellas theme, and the games theme Dream Dream. I've listened to the music from the Saturn game as well and am kind of disappointed that the boss Jackle isn't in this game bacause he has an awesome theme song too and the character seems cool. Other than that this has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in a video game.Replayability: Theres is some replayability in this game. If you get a C rank in all missions you achieve the full ending to the game. Plus theres these objects called Dream Drops scattered throughout levels that unlock something special if you collect them all. I know what it is, but I'm not gonna tell anyone. This leads to my final gripe with this game; its all on rails and everythings got a time limit. With levels so gorgeous and a world so huge I can't help but wonder why after completing levels or anywhere in the game theres no option to freely explore levels without a time limit expesially given that dream drops are very hard to find in the colorful landscapes. I mentioned earlier the foot levels. I enjoy levels on foot because I love adventure games where theres many areas to roam (OKAMI!!!&lt;3), but it upsets me that you don't get the option to explore levels on foot more and once again theres time limits. I also wish the flying levels weren't completely on rails. The world is so huge and gorgeous! You mean sega team couldn't reward players with more free time to check out the scenerios. It felt like a waste just chasing down birds for keys, flying through rings, under a time limit, with all this gorgeous scenery going by so fast.Mydreams: This is actually an interesting feature. I've heard its similar to a feature in Sonic Adventure where you raise and breed chao except here you raise Nightopians and Nightmarens. In flying levels if you paraloop anything its sent to Mydreams. You can even breed a hybrid between a Nightmaren and Nightopian by ramming them into each other. You can even go online and visit other peoples Mydream. The landscape of Mydream changes depending on the time of year or date. Every month the Nightopians in Mydreams will even have a festival. So far its the thing I enjoy most in this game. Not to mention the awesome music that plays in this area.In conclusion I feel like Nights:JOD isn't a bad game, but it could have been better. I heard this game was originally gonna be put on the 360 and PS3, but near the last minute Sega of Japan told Sonic Team to move it to the wii, which explains alot of the problems in gameplay and why its not using full potential. Executive meddling and it was rushed a bit. The music and graphics are top notch and the concept is very promising, but the strange controls and on rails gameplay will turn many people off. For the cheep price tags I'm seeing it run for on Amazon I think its worth a buy to add to your wii collection and try out. Its really one of those games you either love or hate. I really hope they do make a sequal thats better controlled and allows some freeroaming. Its too gorgeous not to have any form of freeroaming.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2010"}

I played that game hours on end and never got tired of it's game-play.  About a year later, Ghost Recon 2 hit store shelves, a day I had been looking forward since it was announced.  I played the game no more than a week until I realized what a disappointment the game was in comparison to Island Thunder.  The graphics may have been better, but the core game-play from the first Ghost Recon games was lacking greatly.  Then, when Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter was announced for the Xbox 360, I thought I'd give the series another chance.  To my surprise, the game took me back to its roots.  It wasn't just another run and gun shooter like so many others on the market today, it played like a tactical shooter once again.  It might not always seem that way when playing over Xbox Live however, because some gamers new to the series just can't come to grasp the fact that the game isn't another Halo (not that there's anything wrong with that ? Halo 2 is one of my favorite games).  Overall, I am extremely pleased at how this game turned out.  Everything about this game screams \"Next Gen,\" from the game-play to the graphics and EVERYTHING in between.Presentation:The story of the game is extremely action packed, but still plays like a tactical shooter - perfect for fans of the original titles in the series.  The menus for the game are set up very nicely and are easy to use.Graphics:The extreme detail this game goes into really makes you believe the power that the Xbox 360 holds.  Things like individual sprigs of grass swaying in the wind, leaves moving with the wind, lighting, and reflections on windows make the game seem very realistic.  People keep saying that the game doesn't look as good in multiplayer as it does in single player, but, in my opinion, the multiplayer maps are what 360 games should look like (especially this early in the systems release) and the single player are just WAY over the top.Sound:Another thing that really sets the mood in this game is the sound.  When you go by a certain building or area, and you start to hear enemies talking in the background, it really gives you the feel of being in the game itself.  Not only can you also hear bullets flying out of your gun, but you can hear the shells falling and hitting the ground.  This was another nice touch and adds to a truly realistic feeling.Game-play:This game, as I've said before, plays very closely to the original ones in the series!  This is one of the main things that keeps me excited and entertained every time I turn on this game.Lasting Appeal:The true test with games these days is how the multiplayer portion of the game is and this game doesn't lack in it at all.  I find myself playing on Xbox Live for hours on end with no intention of quitting anytime soon.  The 10 maps available right now are each great in there own respects and there is great diversity between them.  I have a feeling the multiplayer aspect will keep this game fresh and exciting all the way through to the end of this year and into 2007.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2006"}

{"product_name":"B0050SY5BM","description":"","reviewerName":"Gearhead Mania","summary":"Short and easy campaign, but still fun and the story was interesting","reviewText":"Medal of Honor Warfighter Xbox 360I found the campaign to be quite short, which isn't very different from the 2010 release of Medal of Honor. However, this time around there are some nice variations of driving vehicles. In Hot Pursuit and Hello and Dubai, the player gets to drive a vehicle almost like \"Need for Speed\" but in a linear map. The campaign is definitely linear without any doubt. Even on the \"Hard\" difficulty level, I found the game to be relatively simple with a few situations where it was difficult. The breach shoots can be frustrating at times because with more enemies, it is crucial to hit the right targets in sequence otherwise you run out of slow-motion time and die. The last breach in Shut it Down took me about 20 tries primarily because I'm not that great with using the controller for a first-person shooter. It just doesn't feel as intuitive as a mouse.I like the lean/peek mode because it reminds me of Rainbow Six 3, and the dual optic mode (aka Combat Toggle) is an innovative and realistic usage of some of the optics. For example, in Shore Leave, the player has an Aimpoint (what appears to be a T-1) with a canted magnifier. Default zooming uses the T-1 red dot, but clicking Combat Toggle enables the magnifier which makes it essentially a 3-4x magnified optic. In other maps, the player has a Trijicon ACOG 4x32 RCO with a Trijicon RMR back-up red dot on the top. The Combat Toggle swaps between the 4x ACOG and the non-magnified red dot.The game somewhat picks up after the 2010 Medal of Honor game, and the single-player campaign and story is actually interesting. The weapons are repetitive, the enemies all use some form of AK (AK-103, AK-74SU, with/without Kobra red dot) or Remington 870, or a PKP light machine gun. I saw several different weapons in the single player campaign used by the player, my favorites were the automatic shotgun and the FN SCAR MK 17.Overall: 4/5 stars, cool single-player story, great graphics and although linear - the campaign is still interesting.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2013"}

As he enters his cell block, he briefly meets his fellow inmates, before soemthing goes terribly wrong. The lights go out, and a horrific clicking noise fills the cells, followed by blood curdled screams, and then just plain blood, and now the action starts.The suffereing really isn't one genre for sure, it's several. At one moment it takes the form of a great sction shooter, then the ambience takes over and puts you in mind of a survival horror title. Then you find out you can switch to first person shooter, and it becomes an FPS! That really is the charm of the suffering, its not one thing its many. Its packed with extras, action, and just plain ol' shooting fun.As for the controls, they are what is to be expected from an action title, with primary use of the analog sticks and shoulder buttons. I did, however, find that doing a 180 degree turn was somewhat difficult, and often resulted in losing some health. When the game changes to an FPS, the transition is done so very well, with just one tap of the buton, you have changed your action title into a first person shooter, a great innovation that would be a welcome addition to many games these days.The storyline is excellent since its outcome heavily relies on what you as player do. If your the type that loves to kill to get a laugh ina video game, then don't count on getting the good ending. This game has several situation in which you have the chance to help someone. Whether you help that person or not is up to you, but just keep in mind that whether you are good or bad will ultimately decide in the end whether you killed you wife and son or not!The greatest part of this game that sets it apart from many others is the great ambience. The sound is great (especially if you have your system hooked up through a set of stereo speakers.) The graphics are amazong, and add that much more to the eerie setting.In conclusion, the suffering is a very wel thought out game, but is a bit on the simple side. I am a fan of all survival horror genres, Resident evil, Silent hill, Fatal frame, it doesn't matter. While this game follows the framework of a survival horror game in no way shape or form, itstill manages to get that scare factor across quite well. If you feel like a change from the usual survival horror action, but still want to be scared in the same way, rent it, believe me thats all the time you'll need to beat it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2004"}

This is where I've found that there are three camps of Final Fantasy fans (although it applies to most RPGs, but I'm sticking with this series for right now.).Camp 1: The Old School Die Hard---these fans tend to love the originals because of their nostalgic value, medieval setting, and more majestic storylines.Camp 2: The Next Generation Die Hard---these fans tend to love the later entries because of their showcasing of technology, dark/bleak setting (a la Blade Runner), and innovative systems like limit breaks and materia.Camp 3: The Die Hard Final Fantasy Fan (what'd ya think I was going to say?)---these fans tend to respect and love all the games, and maybe dislike just one or two but whose reasons have no relation to Camps 1 and 2.Obviously, Camp 1 will often claim Final Fantasy 6 or 9 as the best entry (maybe even 4), while Camp 2 will very, very likely claim that 7 is the best. Camp 3 is mixed, although I've found a few of those happen to like the third game the best.As much as I respect and enjoy Final Fantasy 7, I gravitate towards the first camp because that's the style that I grew up on. I like swords, sorcery, and high stakes. I keep an open mind, but a game like Final Fantasy 4 or Chrono Trigger is like a soldier returning home for me. Anyways, without further explanation, here's my review for Final Fantasy 6.This game has a very complex plot and despite its totally separate storyline from 7, it is a wonderful lead-in for that game. The world has previously gone through a horrific \"War of the Magi\" in which the Espers' powers were misused and brought great destruction (Espers are Summons, essentially). The Espers were given free will but their powers were sealed, never again to be used by man. The main character, essentially, is Terra (or Tina, depending on the translation you're playing), a half-Esper/half-human that went through excruciating circumstances before taking control of her life. There's a slew of characters you meet in the entire game; Locke is a treasure hunter with the Steal technique. Edgar is the king of Figaro, an engineer, and twin brother of Sabin. Sabin had forsaken his royal heritage to study Martial Arts. Celes is a former imperial soldier who also has Esper powers due to their experiments on her (and can absorb magic through her swords). Cyan was the king of Doma, a kingdom of Samurai, and he seeks revenge on Kefka. There's also Shadow, a ninja with a mysterious past and has a dog named Interceptor that aids him when he needs it. There are other memorable characters that include Setzer (a gambler) and a feral child named Gau, but I'll leave you to discover the others (preferably by playing the game, but I suppose I can't stop you from Wikipedia-ing it).Although it appears Emperor Gestahl is the main villain in the beginning, our main antagonist is Kefka. While other villains like Sephiroth (7) and Kuja (9) have interesting motives, Kefka has my stamp of approval for being the absolute best villain in the series. I've got three reasons why.1. He is the most ruthless villain in the series. He wipes out the entire kingdom of Doma by poisoning the water (including Cyan's family), captures the Esper god statues and unleashes terror, and shows unconditional contempt for the good qualities in humanity. He turns on his emperor in the blink of an eye, hungry for the power of the Espers.2. He is one of the goofiest tyrants I've ever seen in a video game. Before he marches off to Figaro, he orders his soldiers to wipe the sand from and off his boots (Figaro is in the desert). He also torments Cyan for his misfortune, repeatedly laughing in his face. When the heroes confront him before the final battle, he says HATE HATE HATE over and over and over again, shaking his fists in an anime-sort of way. He also has that funny laugh that makes its way into Chrono Trigger.3. He has one of the coolest boss themes in any video game, period.The game takes on a late industrial/western feel to it, largely in part to the artists and Nobou Uematsu's variant score. Uematsu hit a bullseye in scoring this puppy; from Terra's slow, journeyman-like theme to Shadow's spaghetti western-style theme, to some of the catchiest battle music you've ever heard in your life, to the ragtime/opera suites in the more artsy sections of the game...the music score overall is perhaps Uematsu's most diverse music that I've ever heard in a video game. There are majestic moments that will remind you of Final Fantasies 4 or 9, but here is where the two camps merge into one. Magic is dying out in the storyline, and the music reflects that.Awesome music, adventorous map (there's two \"worlds\" by the way, play and find out...), complex plot, interesting characters (ALL of them having a unique skill) and the ability to have up to four fighting at once, innovative battle systems (there's three points in the game where you split your characters into two or three teams, depending on where you are in the game, and you can switch between them and fight a lot of battles), gameplay longevity without ever getting boring...I have not found any fault in this game, and while I do find it to be a long game, it does have a replay value to it.So who do I recommend this to? Because of its difficulty level (which isn't impossible, but it may be troublesome if you've never played an RPG before), I might suggest trying Final Fantasies 4 or 7 first, but if you happen to be in the third camp that loves both of those games, I guarantee that you will enjoy this game. It is the perfect lead-in to Final Fantasy 7 by aesthetics and setting alone, and I can't think of a better way to intrigue both the medieval Fantasy fans and the more modern Fantasy fans. I also guarantee that you will love the characters and love their backstories.Saddle up, turn on the nostalgic dial, grab your weapon of choice, and march into battle for one of the greatest adventures that Squaresoft (er, Square Enix...) has to offer. I see no reason why you would dislike this game. Perhaps the best Final Fantasy game in existence, with FF4 and FF9 in close proximity and FF7 following those.Recommendations:1. Chrono Trigger (classic SNES game)2. Super Mario RPG (SNES, the perfect beginner's RPG)3. Final Fantasy 4 (worthy RPG for the first-time fan)4. Castlevania Symphony of the Night (a combination of classic RPG elements and Super Metroid-style gameplay)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-23-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000AB603U","description":"It's the dawn of a new age in real-time strategy (RTS) games. A brave New World is rising--a hostile yet beautiful world, filled with innovative gameplay, new strategic scenarios, eye-searing graphics and much more. Welcome to a world calledAge of Empires III.CampaignIn this action adventure tale of historical fiction, players take on the role of Morgan Black and his family, struggling against the hostile wilderness and a mysterious cult that's crept in from Europe.In a series of 24 scenarios divided into three acts, Morgan Black and his descendants help the Aztecs resist conquest by Spanish conquistadors, pit the French against the British in the French and Indian War and help Simon Bolivar lead revolutions in South America.MultiplayerWhether you're searching for a quick game or hoping to talk strategy with friends online,Age of Empires III's Multiplayer site is your community destination.Here, you can play with persistent Home Cities that gain power and strategic options the more games you play, compete for a spot on dozens of ladders, help organize your clan or chat after a game -- all without leaving the multiplayer portal.Fans ofAge of Mythology's Quick Search can still look for games swiftly, while players looking for something specific can browse game lists to find the set of options that matches their tastes.New Feature--Home CitiesThis revolutionary new feature to the RTS landscape is incorporated into all aspects ofAge of Empires III-- from Campaign to Multiplayer -- and is unlike anything you've experienced before.Much like the persistent character from a role-playing game that encourages you to keep playing, your Home City is an important support system to your efforts in the New World. During a game, your Home City can regularly send you supplies or military reinforcements.You are the leader of your colony, but your success brings glory back to Mother Europe. The more games you play, and the better you do, the more powerful your Home City will become. Every few games, you gain the ability to both upgrade and customize your Home City:Upgrade your city by unlocking new types of soldiers or buildings, or improving those you already have.Broaden your tech tree in whatever direction most fits your play style--invest in warships, native alliances, cavalry, artillery or economy.Customize your Home City by changing the appearance of buildings, the weather or even the types of people who walk, work and perform in its streets.Throughout a game, as well as in between games, you can visit your Home City to watch its citizens go about their lives, get an opinion on how you're doing, plot your next move or just marvel at the beautiful sunset.Full 3-D Graphics, Destructible Environments and MoreWe first set out to reproduce the rich detail ofAge of Empires II: Age of Kings. As we strove to make the fascinatingAge of Empires IIItime period come alive, that goal quickly evolved: We at Ensemble Studios wanted to create the best-looking game ever. From the stunning water effects to the hundreds of units battling on-screen, you'll feel like you're a part of the action in the New World.Tone mapping--This photo imaging technique balances the colors in a scene on the fly. The end result is a rich, warm game where bright colors are vibrantly rendered alongside darker counterparts, such as shadows.Lighting and shadows--The sun is always shining inAge of Empires, so it's important that lighting and shadows be an awe-inspiring experience. Units and buildings cast shadows according to a real sun position, and even cast shadows on each other. High Dynamic Range rendering allows us to represent the shiny glints of sunlight that bounce off highly reflective surfaces.Bump and specular mapping--Water glistens like water. Metal shines like metal. These advanced techniques serve to provide an extra level of rendering detail heretofore unseen in real-time strategy (RTS) gaming.Water--We felt that portraying stunning, realistic water effects in the game was so important that we devoted a programmer to it full-time. You'll find the water rich with details like foam near the shore, accurately modeled water motion, flotsam in rivers and realistic water colors. Plus, reflections change with the viewing angle, the angle of sunlight and the motion of the water. The overall effect is breathtaking.Cliffs and Riverbeds--Instead of just stretching terrain, we built a system to attach geometry to the terrain map to allow for realistic overhangs and steep cliffs, from areas like the American Southwest. This effect is supported on random maps too.CivilizationsBritishQuick access to Settlers gives the British one of the strongest economies in the game. The ability to upgrade two key units -- the Musketeer and Hussar -- make the British military formidable in the late game. The British Home City emphasizes improvements to technology and naval warfare.DutchAlthough Dutch Settlers are limited and costly, their civilization makes up for this economic disadvantage by building Banks and generating coin automatically. The Dutch Home City emphasizes upgrades to defense and economy.FrenchAlthough the French economy starts slowly, the Coureur unit, a Villager with strong fighting skills, makes the French difficult to attack early. The French also have the strongest cavalry unit in the game -- the Cuirassier. Plus, the French are experts at allying with the Native Americans.GermanThe Germans have fewer Settlers and therefore a slower economy. Fortunately, both the Settler Wagon and Uhlan cavalry spawn for free from the German Town Center. Plus, the Germans start with the ability to send Mercenaries from their Home City (long before other civilizations can).Native AmericanEuropean civilizations can learn new technologies and gain troops by forging alliances with the Native Americans. A British player who allies with the Iroquois is essentially playing as two civilizations: the British and the Iroquois.OttomanFor the Ottomans, Settlers spawn automatically from the Town Center. Building a Mosque and conducting research help keep that Settler production steady. Befitting their position straddling Europe and Asia, the Ottomans have more unique units than any other civilization.PortugueseStarting the game with two Town Centers, the Portuguese can quickly produce Settlers, control territory or support their allies. The Spyglass ability allows the Portuguese to easily spy on the enemy. The Portuguese also have a strong navy, strong light infantry and the best Dragoons in the game.RussianStarting the game with extra resources but fewer Settlers gives the Russians the flexibility of focusing on economy or an early raid. Russian infantry, individually weak, are trained in blocks at a faster rate, providing the Russians with the opportunity to overwhelm their enemy with greater numbers.SpanishThe Spanish have a strong military, with both hand infantry and cavalry. Flexibility in early shipments from the Home City give the Spanish the option to attack early or set up for a strong, late economy. Spanish Home City improvements benefit soldiers, buildings and naval units.&nbsp;CombatAge of Empires IIIgives players an amazing amount of control over their side of the battlefield.More to command -- Not only are you in command of large and diverse armies of infantry, cavalry and artillery, but also Native American warriors, mercenaries and tall ships.Multiple formations -- You can assign different formations to your army for different strengths and weaknesses, or have the game automatically choose the most appropriate formation. Examples include:Volley -- ranged infantry, like musketeers, take turns firing at enemies ahead of them.Charge -- your soldiers walk, then run into combat. Cavalry wield sabers, and musketeers fix bayonets. This formation does tremendous damage but makes your soldiers more prone to injury.Bombard -- your soldiers protect the cannons, while the cannons shell enemy ranks. Available only when you have artillery in your army.Battles are easier to follow -- You can still command individual units. But when the units fight in formation, you'll be able to tell exactly who is winning the fight.Real-time physics -- Infantry struck by cannon fire will be thrown like rag dolls, perhaps even over a cliff and into the water. Cannonballs bounce and ricochet.Detailed destructions -- Shingles, shutters and whole towers may fly off a building and interact with the terrain, such as crashing into nearby water. This next generation effect is done on the fly so that each building always has a unique destruction, no matter how many times you see it.Unique animations -- With hundreds of unique combat animations, you'll never see the same battle twice.","reviewerName":"A.

What follows is his review of the game. My only edits were fixing a couple of misspellings and adding a comma or 2.He's been playing on a Sony VAIO laptop with Vista.____________________________________Age of Empire is about conquering certain parts of what is known today as the United States. You can select a home town and use their unique abilities and fight for the land.The game has a very good story mode. It gives you instant action in some levels and in others it is a slow advancing game. It has a very good mix of the two along with the little movies in some levels.The game's graphics are very good if you have good graphics hardware. If not you will have to do with low graphics and deal with it if you don't like lag. It is not much of a loss if you just want to play the game. If you get into a ship battle not even low graphics can save you and a lag attack is unavoidable.Multi player is a great addition to the game and It is a great way to level up your home city if you know which people to verse. If you just go and fight anyone it is very easy to get frustrated and loose many times against the same person.The game play is very good if you like a game where you can explore. In the beginning of each match you have an adventurer and he can explore all the land on the map you're on and encounter many surprises. Battle mode can be a little unrealistic because you see a person surviving when a cannon hits him or he gets shot three times.All in all Age of Empire is a very good game and is easy to adapt to. It is also easy to make friends on multi player and also great enemies.-- A_____ was here","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2009"}

I have never played any of the other Assassin's Creed games. Jumping right into the story will certainly make you confused and not sure what is happening. There is probably a deep and meaningful plot here, but unless you played the other games you won't be able to enjoy it that much. Get use to watching cut scenes if you play this game because there is a lot of them and most of the cut scenes are full dialog only. However, the voice acting and writing is top notch so don't get me wrong, I appreciate the effort put into them, but there is a very large amount of it. There is such large amount of them that it can take away from the fun factor of the game. The graphics are excellent as well is the sound. The controls are hit and miss. During more intense gameplay I find myself just hitting all the buttons because it's more affective then actually trying. Combat controls suffer the most in my opinion. Fighting enemies can be a circus act of chaos. Expect to get hit often and become frustrated. Running through the town is fun itself and fairly fluent. That part of the game is done very well. Personally, I would either get the game cheap or rent it first and see if you like the gameplay. I don't regret getting it for only $40 but I wouldn't pay much more.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2013"}

I love puzzle collections, and I love Level-5 games like the Dark Cloud series for PS2.  Despite my high expectations, this game exceeded them all but one.I won't bother describing the game, other reviews and this web page can do that.  Instead I'll just say that it's truly excellent.  Wonderful art, both graphics and music, excellent finishing touches (such as the ability to mark puzzles as favorites for easy access later), an engaging plot replete with colorful characters, all to serve as an excellent backdrop to a variety collection of puzzles.  The game also has many secrets and meta-puzzles to unlock, as well as extra puzzles which can be downloaded wirelessly every week.  Exhibit A:  I've owned my DS Lite for many years, but had never felt interested in going online, especially given the DS Lite's inability to support modern wireless security protocols.  This game was so compelling that I set up a 2nd wireless network at home, firewalled off from the rest of my network, just so I could play the extra puzzles online.But even after solving every puzzle the game has, after unlocking every secret and solving every meta puzzle, and even after downloading all the extra content and playing that, too, I've only spent 15 hours on this game, most of that over a single weekend.  By contrast, I enjoyed Dark Cloud 2 (by the same company) for 250 hours.  Worse, the game is simply not replayable in any way; once you solve the puzzles you're done.I considered dropping it to 4 stars because of this, but decided that the small size really wasn't that big a deal.  It's a perfect gem of a game, and if you consume it too fast, give it to a friend.  I'm a lifelong gamer, and I've played many puzzle collections.  This one makes my top-5 list of all-time favorite puzzle collections, up there with 1988's award-winning \"The Fool's Errand\" and the obscure but excellent \"Heaven and Earth\".","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2008"}

Featuring detailed environments and complicated new battle mechanisms, this game demands a different kind of perspective than the first-person shooters from the original Halo series. You'll need to uncover the hidden strengths and weaknesses of each unit and play them to your tactical advantage, and that's just the beginning.UNSC: Be Part of a Legendary ConflictThe story opens with UNSC forces retaking the planet Harvest from the Covenant. At your disposal -- should you choose to take command of UNSC forces -- will be everything from a corps of highly-trained Marines to the Warthogs, Scorpions, and Hornets you'll need for air and land attacks. You'll take stock of the map and decide between holding your ground or advancing on enemy strongholds, all while trying to navigate the local terrain and outsmart Covenant forces. And when you need something extra to tip the tide in your favor, UNSC leaders can provide you with the ability to mobilize highly specialized units or call the Spirit of Fire vessel for support from above.Covenant: A Capable, Playable Enemy FactionThat's right, Covenant is playable in this corner of the Halo universe. This alliance of alien species has manipulated advanced technology, firepower, and tactical prowess into a powerful force that is engaged in a Genocidal war against human race, having branded humans as heretics. With the ability to play as these tough, alien fighters, you'll have advanced shield technology, the modular Citadel at the heart of Covenant's colonizing power, and, of course, the iconic Scarab attack vehicle at your disposal, adding a whole new dimension to your strategic warfare. The Scarab is a terrifying military vehicle crafted from heavy mining equipment. And with a mining laser that delivers massive damage across battlefields large and small, turrets for taking on air attacks, and the ability to clamber over any terrain, what's not to love about commanding Scarabs instead of fighting against them?Developed Exclusively for Xbox 360Most console RTS games are adapted from existing PC games, which can make their controls bulky or awkward, butHalo Warshas been developed for Xbox 360 from the ground up. This means the controls are sensitive, intuitive, and easy-to-operate in the midst of battle. And the UI is just as intuitive, so whether you're managing a unit of marines or a deadly machine, you can focus on creating a battle strategy instead of worrying about how to overcome a clumsy controller.No matter which faction you choose to play as, you can test your skills against those of other players in online skirmishes that allow up to six players with the New Xbox Experience through Xbox LIVE.","reviewerName":"Poshu Oshu","summary":"mediocre starcraft rip off","reviewText":"it's not bad. its a much simpler rts than anything before this. works for the console interface but i have to say if it wasn't co-op i wouldn't have bothered. even so it's only mildly entertaining for that. i'd say it's definitly something you should rent to see if it's your kind of game but you'll know imediatly if you like it or not so don't buy it till you've tried it once or twice.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0009WPZMW","description":"Burnout Revenge X360","reviewerName":"OrangeCrush \"Still shooting with Film!\"","summary":"One of the Most Entertaining Racing Games in Years!!!","reviewText":"I actually purchased this game and played it in its entirety when it was first released but just recently I picked it up again and just like the first time, I haven't been able to put it down. There is just so much to love about this game and ultimetaly it really is one of the most entertaining racing games I have ever played.One of the most distinctive aspects to this game is the \"checking traffic\". Instead of dodging same way traffic, your supposed to hit them and thus \"check\" them out of the way. When you check a car it sends it flying a couple hundred feet ahead and ultimately its a great way of taking an opponent down, if you can time it right. I admit, like others on here have, that initially it was very difficult to hit the cars. I have been playing racing games for as long as they have been making them and I would instinctively dodge the cars even tho I was purposely trying to hit them. It definitely took some getting used to but, once you do, it adds a whole new element to this series. There is an event specifically aimed at checking called \"Traffic Attack\". You have to cause a specific amount of damage by checking cars. You have a 30 second timer and checking traffic adds time back onto the timer. These were some of the more difficult events in Burnout Revenge.Another new event is the \"Crashbreaker\". When you get taken out you can detonate your car and take out any cars still near you. Detonating your car takes away all of your stored up turbo boost and this is what really makes the \"cashbreaker\" events so great cause if you detonate and miss, your going to be struggling to catch back up. If you detonate and take out an opponents car, it rewards you by recharging your turbo boost and immediately putting your car right back into the race at high speed. Usually when you crash you have to wait a few seconds before you can start up again and you start up at a very slow speed. The crashbreaker events are easily some of the most entertaining events in this game.Some other events include Crash events (try to cause as much damage to specific settings as possible), Burning Lap (basic timed race), Eliminator (race where the last place position gets taken out every 30 seconds), and of course the classic road rage which you have to take out a specific number of opponents in a given time. IMO this is the best set of events we have seen yet from this series and ultimately the diversity of the race events is really one of the strongest aspects to this game.My only complaint with this game lies with the cars. There are no brand name cars in this game. They are all generic cars with very generic names. You will find yourself winning cars and not really remembering, or caring for that matter, which cars you won or have at your disposal. They all kind of just blend together. Most of the time you will just pick the car that the program recommends. Basically it just makes you not care about whats in your garage. I understand that it would have cost a significant amount of money to have real brand name cars in this game so its a problem that is easily forgiven. Some companies don't even allow their cars to be used in games that have damage.Bottom line - Burnout Revenge is not only one of the best games in the series, its also one of the best arcade style racers ever made. If your a fan of this style racing game and you haven't played this yet then you should immediately run out and buy it, especially given the fact that you can now pick it up for 20 bucks or less.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2010"}

Okami is proof that one of the most important thing in game design is not the graphical processing power of the game console, but the power of the designer's imagination. With the video game market being constantly flooded with games featuring indestructable looking guys with helmmets, masks, swords, and guns, and the message comming from these games basicly saying, \"shoot first & ask questions later,\" it's nice to see a game such as Okami that doesn't follow in this kind of pattern, stands on it's own as totally unique, and in my opinion, \"the game to beat.\" It's a very satisfying adventure with memorable characters, intuitive play mechanics, wonderful music, and an astonishing visual presentation. Simply put, it's a ton of fun to play. It's a sad state of affairs within the gaming community nowadays when games as wonderful and perfectly constructed as Okami are ignored, and world-class development studios such as Clover (which developed Okami) find themselves closed down after poor sales of their critically acclaimed titles, simply because their games don't feature enough violence, blood, and guns. However, although Clover Studios is gone, im sure that the people who created Okami are still out there working within the game industry. So i'm looking forward to their next game. Im sure that with the unique talent that they have, it won't be hard to recgonize their work in the next video game that they create. Kudo's to the team who put this game together. Well done.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2011"}

Wright","summary":"Not an improvement over Sims 2","reviewText":"I was hopeful when this game was released, but my hopes have been severely dashed.  If this is the level of game that EA can provide, no thanks.  The Sims 3 is the perfect example of why EA has a reputation for bad quality games and it is also no wonder why EA is one of the few gaming companies not making money during a gaming boom.  I digress.The most fun I had with this game was the Sim creator (outfitting and creating the sim).  This is the exact same argument I had with Spore as well.After that, the problems with the Sims 3 are many and numerous:1) The time progression in 'Live Mode' is far too fast.  For example, you are lucky if you can get one task completed in 1 sim hour.  So, if you need your sim to shower, pee and eat breakfast before work, it's not going to happen in 1 sim hour.  You better wake your sim up at least 2 hours early.  Which means that the 1-hour-before-work alarm clock they've designed is useless.2) On the other hand, when your sim is sleeping or working, the 'turbo' mode is so slow that it makes watching paint dry seem fun by comparison.  Why EA didn't create cut scenes for sleeping and working is beyond me. That would have been an improvement! But, sitting and watching your sim do absolutely nothing for at least 10-30 real minutes says game failure in my book.3) Repetition gets tiresome really fast.  Most of the time you spend making your sim eat, shower, sleep, work, clean and fix broken things (we'll come to that next).  Chores that after you've done it a few times, you quickly realize you would like to skip it.  After you spend all of that wasteful time doing the stupid little chores, your sim has basically no time (or energy) left to socialize or actually do something fun in the game.  The tedium of these boring activities becomes readily apparent after an hour of play.  It also heavily outweighs the the fun aspects of the sims.  But, the same can be said of the Sims 2 and which should have been fixed in the Sims 3.4) For whatever reason, EA has increased the frequency of home disasters.  In the first 4 hours I played the Sims 3, I had two broken sinks, a broken TV, a broken shower (twice), a broken toilet, a broken computer and two house fires.  Yes, this is in 4 real hours of playing.  The house fires were probably because I had to cut the sim short during cooking, but still.  I do not remember this many home disasters in the Sims 2.  Note that fixing things consumes vast amounts of time, energy and hygiene.  So, you might as well spend the time to call a repairman.5) Life stages are pointless for anything beyond starting your sim as a child.  Don't even bother to begin the Sims 3 with your sim as an adult.  There is only one more stage after adult and that's elderly.  Once you progress to that, it's likely impossible to complete your life goals.  If you leave the defaults for aging turned on, you should start your sim as a kid.  Otherwise, to play as an adult you must turn off aging or extend number of days per stage to maximum.6) Dead time.  Any game designer worth his or her weight in salt would realize dead time in a game is the kiss of death for a title.  You never want your game to come to a complete standstill for minutes at a time!  But, that's exactly what the Sims 3 does during work and sleep time when you only have one sim in play.  For this reason alone, this title won't win any awards.  Boredom fast ensues as a result.  They really should have started you off with two sims to control and that wouldn't have been an issue.There are many other issues with this game from the Desperate Housewives ripoff soundtrack to the horrible 3D graphic quality of the game to the fact that your very own created sims can leave the neighborhood and be deleted from the game.  There are also the silly cars that literally drive through one another to the lack of being able to interact with the natural environments to the fact that sims still can't pay bills with their own free will!This game is, plain and simple, an expansion of Sims 2 with only minor improvements (the best improvement being that the entire play map seemingly loads in its entirety).  Ignoring dead time (a major problem), the minutiae of the 'repetitive chores' quickly gets in the way of game play and leads to boredom very rapidly.  By the third time, these issues should have been completely eliminated from the Sims 3.Overall, if you own and like the Sims 2, then stick with and play the Sims 2.  If you do not own Sims 2 at all, then this might work for you.  But, know that there are definitely issues. Again, the Sims 3 is not a major improvement over Sims 2 and has no expansion packs as yet (i.e., no pets, must buy things from EA store).  Perhaps EA can fix this game with some patches, but it will take an awful lot of patching to make this game playable.  Perhaps EA can make the Sims 3 playable eventually, but you should probably wait until that happens or rent it... or, alternatively, play the Sims 2 instead since you can pick upThe Sims 2 Deluxe (Sims 2 and Sims Nightlife Expansion)for between $10-25.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2009"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Excellent use of DS features, take it or leave it for everything else","reviewText":"For those who found enjoyment with the recent release of the excellent Hotel Dusk: Room 215, this older title should be checked out just to see how far Nintendo's dual screened system has come in a relatively short time in delivering original and innovative adventure games.  Trace Memory is from the same crew who would create Hotel Dusk, and was one of the first games to make real and excellent use out of the various features of the DS.  On a mysterious island, you play as young Ashley, who is trying to uncover lots of secrets, including some buried in her past.  As the story unfolds, Ashley meets a ghostly cohort that has a few secrets as well; all lying within the confines of a sprawling mansion on the island.  The puzzle elements of Trace Memory is what make it so interesting to get into; whether it's using the stylus and touchscreen to move objects to the microphone to help solve secrets.  The game is presented in gorgeous animated 2-D elements that help advance the story, as well as typical 3-D elements for exploration.  What really stops Trace Memory from being something really special is that the game is incredibly short to get through.  Despite an excellent and engaging story, as well as intriguing and challenging puzzles (along with some puzzles that are the opposite of that), Trace Memory winds up being shorter than one could imagine.  Not to mention that once you do get through it, there's not really much reason to go back.  There are some unclockable easter eggs as well, but that's it.  All in all, Trace Memory isn't bad at all and is an interesting game while it lasts, but it can be safe to say that this game was and is a taste of things to come for Nintendo's innovative system.  If you never played it but enjoyed Hotel Dusk, Trace Memory is worth a look regardless.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2007"}

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

We all live in different states, so multiplayer games with great co-op campaigns are our favorites.  When Dungeon Siege 3 came up for pre-order a few months ago, we jumped on it.  How great would it be to loot crawl and smash demons and whatnot with cool/unique characters?Dungeon Siege 3 not only failed to deliver as a co-op game, it crashed and burned even as a single player games.  First the co-op: IT IS NON-EXISTANT.  Only the host player makes story progress. Only the Host game saves progress, loot, experience, etc. This multiplayer decision is absolutely disasterous. When my brother leaves my game, he does not take anything with him. WORSE STILL if some one else joins my game, they can drop/sell all the loot my brother found.This said, Dungeon Siege could have been ok. I enjoyed the single player games Dragon Age and Oblivion.  Unfortunately, Dungeon Siege 3 is LESS customizable than the very weak Dragon Age 2.  You are one of 4 pre-set characters. Their class abilities are pretty much established. You just dutifully level them up.  The loot is a joke. None of the equipment you find is especially unique or powerful.  Just stick with your charcter abilities. Beyond this lack of customization, Dungeon Siege 3 has mediocre graphics (forgivable) and wonky camera angles (less forgivable).The only redeeming factor for Dungeon Siege 3 are some face-paced action/hack-n-slash play. There are plenty of enemies to fight and they keep coming.I made the mistake of running out and buying Dragon Age 2 based on Dragon Age 1.  The Dungeon Siege franchise has a great history, but I learned my lesson and rented first this time.  Dungeon Siege 3 is an absolute disaster.Any game developers out there who are listening: the niche is WIDE OPEN for a great fantasy/magic RPG (like Oblivion) with a solid multiplayer (like Borderlands).

Well, let me just say that the game started off brilliantly.  The battle with Poseidon is by far my favorite boss battle in the entire God of War series.  The graphics are really top-notch, except I did detect a tiny slow-down in the frame rate during the first section of the game.  I guess they were just trying to push the PS3's limits a little too far.I really can't say much for the game play, since it's just more of the same from the previous two GoW titles.  I absolutely loved the increased amount of gore and bloody finishers for the bosses.  On a side note, I really don't like the voice acting on Kratos' character.  It sounds like a black guy is speaking the voice of somebody who isn't black.  Very strange and odd if you ask me.But besides all that, what I severely find fault with is the storyline.  Plain and simple, Kratos is seeking revenge on all the gods.  That's it.  Kill Zeus is his goal, and that's what he does.  Nothing wrong with that, since it seems to fit the overall plot of the entire trilogy.  However, the game really went downhill as soon as Pandora entered into the equation.  What an ANNOYING brat!  Why didn't Kratos kill her as well?  He turned his back on the Titans, mutilated the gods...why not also kill a helpless \"child\"?Where things really got annoying was with the final boss battle with Zeus, particularly when you have to face him and his clones inside Gaia.  I'm very happy to admit that I never finished this game out of extreme rage and frustration during that part of the battle.  After the twenty-fifth try (YES, twenty-fifth!), I just said \"to **** with this game!\" and let it go.  I deleted the saved games from my system and everything.  Never in my life have I found ANY boss battle so tedious (and this was on NORMAL difficulty!).  The developers clearly committed some grave error during the battle with Zeus.  Twenty-five times, and STILL you can't beat him?  Is this some sick joke to actually turn the player himself INTO Kratos???  Perhaps so, but regardless, I got sick of all the BUTTON-MASHING during that part of the battle, since that's all you could do.To sum everything up, God of War III felt like a drug that puts you into severe withdrawal:  a consistent high for quite some time, and then a sudden depression sets in.  This game should definitely not get any Game of the Year awards whatsoever.  If it does, I'd be very surprised.UPDATE:  I have beaten this game since this review was originally published, and I'm giving it an extra two stars (so three total, instead of the original one star I gave it).  This game is still by no means a 5-star title.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2010"}

{"product_name":"B002BSA3EM","reviewerName":"PT Cruiser","summary":"Get up off the couch and Wii!","reviewText":"Wii Fit Plus, that is! I couldn't wait to try this because I enjoy the other Wii games so much and find it's a great way to get some exercise without leaving your living room. I also thought the balance games would be fun and maybe help me be a little more graceful.  I actually do find myself being more aware of balance after playing with it for a while.There are lots of nice new features with this Wii Fit Plus. I always wished I could set up routines instead of having to move from one menu to the next after each exercise, or that there were ready made routines that I could follow involving several exercises. With the Plus this is possible. You start in the locker room and select from Wii Fit Plus Routines, My Routine, or the Favorites menu. You go to another screen to decide what parts of your body or what type of goals you want to pursue and the difficulty level and length of time. Then the system will set up a routine designed just for you and your goals. I think it's much more efficient to go through exercises this way. You can also compare how you did each day and how much you're improving. There's a multiplayer mode so that more than one person can play, but you do have to take turns. Still, it's nice to not have to 'log out' each time a different person wants to play.Another new feature is that you can add babies or pets to the Plus. I have a big fat long haired 'mini' dachshund that was too embarrassed to be weighed today, but that pupper is going to get weighed tomorrow! They don't get to do body tests or play any games, but you can keep track of their weight and record it in their stats. Useful? Well, maybe not so much but big points for the cuteness factor.I love the games because it's such a great way to get exercise without even realizing it and the 15 new ones in this title are just as good as the old if not better than the first edition. Want to learn to walk and chew gum at the same time? One of these games will have you balancing on a big red and white striped ball (your Wii Fit board) while juggling smaller balls thrown to you by your assistants. Or how about Rhythm Parade where you march and raise and lower your hands on cue and in time with the music? Tilt City has you using your Wiimote turned sideways and the balance board to maneuver dropping balls into one of three color coordinated pails. It's easy at first, but when several different colored balls start dropping at once, it's a challenge. I love the balance games and if you're a fan of the balance board game with the little balls in the first game, there's one here that uses some different colored slots to \"pop\" the balls up over small obstacles and into the hole. You control their movement by leaning in different directions on the balance board.There are also 3 new yoga activities and 3 new strength training activities. That's not to say that some of the games don't improve strength and muscles. There is one game where you flap your arms like wings to fly from one target post to another over water to get points on each one. This is one where you want to draw all the curtains because you'll look completely ridiculous standing there on your balance board wildly flapping your arms like some kind of a crazy bird. But you won't believe how tired your arm muscles feel afterward and you don't even notice while you're busy flying from one target to another. There's another game, Island Cycling, where you step on the balance board to simulate pedaling a bike, trying to pass Wii flags where you accumulate points. You steer with the Wiimote held sideways. I was surprised how sore my calves were afterward, trying to control the speed of the bike.When you can get exercise while doing something that's challenging and fun without even realizing that you're exercising, that's a successful game. That's why I bought the Wii to begin with and this game takes full advantage of the balance board and all the interactive features. Can I walk and chew gum at the same time after playing these games? Well, maybe not yet but I can bust big blue and white balloons by running into them with my Segway on a beach and get almost halfway through the course inside a big ol' bubble in Balance Bubble Plus. Great job, Nintendo! Two thumbs up!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2010"}

It is no doubt that Skyrim is a promising candidate of the game of the year, among other nominees such as Uncharted 3, Gears of War 3, Batman, Zelda, as well as Portal 2. in case you didn't know, Spike's VGA 2011 has already awarded Skyrim as the game of the year. But how the hell, did they also award Bethesda, the developer of the year? These people have been so ignorant and irresponsible ever since the problem was spotted over a month ago. Their response to the public has been so vague as if they didn't even know whether they will have a solution in the future. Skyrim is a great game, but the PS3 version is messed up and it deserves a mass recall and those customers who are affected by this problem should have the right to claim a full refund. Sadly, nothing has been done since then by the developer.IGN has created a dedicated page to keep track of the outrageous lagging issue, quote:Public response to the issues has been predictably heated. On December 5, 2011, IGN's Colin Campbell wrote the article titled \"Skyrim Lag: How The Hell Did This Happen?\". IGN reached out to Bethesda for a statement but as of the publishing of the article, Bethesda did not respond. Colin concluded his thusly: \"Bethesda owes the world a full explanation, the sooner, the better.\"Suggestions from the developer for temporary improvement:Disable auto-saves(Sorry, but I think I am too used to this feature as 99.9% of the games have it enabled!)Keep the file size low(How the hell am I supposed to do this? Playing the game backwards?)Turn off the PlayStation 3(Yeah right)I am very pleased with the game itself when it was not lagging, but I am extremely disappointed by the developer.

To provide larger storage capacity and faster access rates--PlayStation2 cards transfer data 200 times faster than cards for the original PlayStation--PlayStation2 developers have upgraded the technology for the new memory card. The 8 MB Memory Card uses Flash Memory, the storage technology that's revolutionizing handheld computers, digital cameras, and MP3 players. In contrast, the 128 KB memory cards that were designed for the original PlayStation use memory blocks.

I'm not a huge racing game fan, but this one is well balanced and manages to be fun and realistic at the same time. Other racers can't maintain the balance between fun and realism.

The sound is unbelievable. When you combine the two it makes for a heart pounding, adrenaline filled, edge of your seat race. There are many little nuances that also make this game great. You can tell that they actually spent time and effort in producing this game. You can also adjust the physics and difficulty of Dirt 3 to custom tailor your racing experience. I highly recommend buying this one asap. Oh, by the way, don't listen to Termina.

{"product_name":"B0050SWVIQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Creepy Survival Horror, but not Dead Space","reviewText":"*SPOILERS*This review will contain 2-ish major spoilers for the story. I can not express how saddened I was by DS 3, given how excited I was by the runup, the fact that I really enjoyed the DS 2 cliffhanger and the story elements that were introduced. The trailers were spectacular, and there were already rumors about an epilogue DLC and a possible bridge to DS 4. What followed was a journey like Mass Effect 3. The joy was instantaneous, then slowly turned to ashes.Environment (8/10)Environments in Dead Space were the saving grace of this game. You feel cold playing it. The characters behave properly, the scenes and vistas are spectacular, and the open-space gameplay was some of the most riveting I've had a chance to experience. I think that movies in space have changed forever because of how creepy perfectly silent space scenes can be.Gameplay (6/10)Gameplay was cookie-cutter from the previosu installment. This wouldn't be a bad thing but for the forced injection of EA microtransactions. FB games have turned into a stream of sweet, sweet gold and EA is looking to cash in at every opportunity. DS 3 was NOT one of those opportunities, and the game-breaking armor and weapons that you almost have no choice but to accidentally swallow were aggravating.The puzzles were toelrable, and there wasn't exactly many surprises.Combat was another hallmark. While nothing has managed to hold up to the initial game which was like being inside a rock tumbler with a cast character out of a HP Lovecraft novel, certain combat sequences were simply incredible.Story (Starts at 7, drops to 5, then 3/10)Now the story. Again, SPOILERS! Dead Space prided itself, once, on having a story that may not have been fully explained, but at least made sense. DS 3 broke that trend in such a way that the pieces may never be put back together again.Long story short, there is no sense. The prologue opens up a wonderful arc of exploring the fall of the original Tau Volantis base, which apprently collapsed for no reason whatsoever. There are of course the obligatory indications of another outbreak, but apparently no attempt to contain it, and the entirety of the base personnel had enoguh time to have tearful goodbyes before comitting mass suicide.While more good plot elements are introduced, they are never fully explored, and sort of wither on the vine.Later, in an attempt to save his lady love, Isaac Clarke decides its better to sacrifice the entirety of the human race in order to keep her alive, if at least for another few hours.The story simply falls apart.DLC (-5/10)What really crushes the plot is the epilogue DLC. Hoping it would salvage the rather lame plot and ending of the main game, I picked this up hoping to take out one of the newly awakened Bretheren Moons. However, after escaping Tau Voltantis and returning to Earth, you find that allowing the destruction of the human race probably wasn't a good idea.You Lose! Good Day Sir!Overall (3/10)Nothing is more crippling than getting to the end of a story and finding out its a tragedy. While thats tolerable for a movie, when its a game that you pour yourself into for 12+ hours, actually forming a connection with the characters and empathising with their heartaches and their victories, simply fiding out the Earth was destroyed and human is being devoured, and that it's quite literally all your fault is something I'll be hard rpessed to forgive EA for.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2013"}

Indications that enemies have noticed you provide important help, weather conditions provide real cover, and the AI feels very intelligent. Aiming and firing weapons feel signifcantly better to the previous MGS installment, feeling more like a &#34;real&#34; 3rd person tactical shooter. Some quirks include pushing up against a wall, using the touch pad for menus, and how looking at the iDroid is real time (it is realistic, but it isn't the best - the iDroid took about three minutes to load up a dossier on a character, three minutes of real-time waiting and possible exposure). The game is not open world, but it feels like an open world in that you aren't riding on rails like the previous titles: you have room to explore, take different routes, go in guns blazing or simply drive around.The graphics are fantastic, but not as good as Killzone (not jaw dropping, which again is shocking for an MGS title). The game runs smooth, but little things like poor water textures and physics, physics bugs, and odd crawling mechanics/weapon switching/weapon picking up mechanics provide some annoyance, especially when previous titles go these items right (except for water).Sutherland voicing Snake is bit jarring at first, simply because he sounds like an old sissy; however, the limited dialog opportunities here don't provide proper volume to critique the voice acting, as it isn't a significant part of the game (game-play, not cut-scenes, drive this title -- which is odd for an MGS game).Though the main quest is short, side quests provide more opportunity to explore and additional challenges (daylight sneaking, which harder than night time in the rain sneaking), difficulty, and collectibles in field.This is a great game, a game with replay value because it is fun, and a taste of what I expect MGSV Phantom Pain to be like.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2014"}

The colors become washed out, the gameplay becomes much more boring, and in many ways, they just plain svck...Enter \"Dragon Quest VIII\" from Enix, the 6th game of the series to be released over here. I have only played for a couple of days, but I must confess that I am quite pleased at the result of adding a new dimension to the gameplay.For starters, the environment (including the \"overworld\" is now fully interactive. There are set roads the player may travel, but one may also branch off of these roads to find new caves, treasure chests and secrets galore. Hence, it trumps FFX in this regard (although the playable demo of FFXII included in the game already has me salivating!). Furthermore, some walls contain secret passages, etc., and in general the game offers full movement in the world and secrets which are only made possible in the 3-D setting.As for the gameplay (and here may be a bit of fanboy-itis, I'll admit), the game is much more fun than its predecessor. Gone is the cumbersome class system of DWVII (which I personally liked, but many hated), and in its place is a very easy to learn skill system. Each party member has five skills which they can raise any way they like. Skill points are awarded at level ups, and as skills gain more points (and the point distribution is entirely up to the player), the party member will gain battle spells and \"traits\", which are essentially bonuses to attack, defense, etc. The game is quite linear at the front, but I know of a few sidequests later in the game which will give the player more freedom to choose his path.As for the graphics, well, they don't stand up next to the might of the FFXII demo packaged alongside, but the cel-shading seems perfect to bring out the charm of Akira Toriyama's character and monster designs. However, I am surprised that the female character can manage to keep her incredibly-revealing top on!In any case, this is a worthy addition to the \"Dragon Warrior\" legacy, and a fine game in its own right. And I particularly like the translators' decision to use British persons for the voices of the characters - it just comes off better, it seems to me...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2005"}

The first truly next-gen Spidey title is a can't-miss experience for fans of Marvel's web swinging, crime-busting hero. Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, PS2, DS, PC, Activision, T.","reviewerName":"trashcanman","summary":"All the web-slinging fun a gamer could ask for.","reviewText":"\"Spider-Man: Web of Shadows\" is the best comic book game I've played in a very long time.  Most of them are based off of films and spend all of the budget on hiring the cast to do the voices, obtaining the movie license, and packing cutscenes from the movie into the game.  The end result is typically a cute little souvenir for fans for the movie and a distraction for the kids.  It comes and goes to the bargain bin in a matter of months.  But this time there is no tie-in, just a story to be told featuring your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man and some of his best friends and foes.  It's not the least bit groundbreaking as there have been many iterations of the webslinger since the Playstation classic that have used many of the same mechanics, but it is a damn good time for comic fans.The story begins with Spidey in battle with his nemesis Venom and getting tagged when a piece of the symbiote separates from the psychotic villain.  So the black suit is back in Peter Parker's life and MJ is less then pleased.  But Spidey sems to believe that this symbiote is different from it's parent and holds off on ridding himself of it immediately.  This leads to one of the primary attractions of the game.  The player is invited to switch freely between the classic Spidey and his symbiote alter-ego throughout thye course of the game.  As you progress, each costume earns new powers.  The classic outfit is great for agility-based combo attacks and incapacitating foes with webshooters while the black costume is more destructive and is spectacular in it's ability to engage and destroy multiple enemies.  But there's a catch.  The more time you spend in each costume, the more your alignment is affected.  Using the symbiote's powers will eventually lead you to a darker alignment that can change your in-game alliances  and lead to a different ending for your character.  You are also invited to freely choose which path to take at certain points of the game.  Ever wished Spidey would just say yes to a night with Black Cat?  Well, MJ is kind of a bitch in this game.....Go for it!  Should you save the foes you've been fighting or kid rid of 'em?  Whatever you want.  But rest assured Luke Cage will not be pleased if you allow his neighborhood gangs to kill each other while he is attempting to broker a peace deal.  Anyways, the story escalates from stopping local hooligans to full scale symbiote invasion over the course of the game.Along the way, you will meet friends and foes that can be summoned to help you in combat.  Which ones are available depends on your alignment.  Having Vultureback you up is pretty sweet and riding Rhino around playing bad-guy bowling is fun but they won't show if you've been goody-goody.  Wolverine and Black Cat are pretty tolerant around the grey area, but Cage and Moon Knight are only there for you if you're way in the red.  Having familiar faces back you up is really cool, but the absence of  many of New York's finest is pretty inexplicable.  Iron Man and the Fantastic Four are explained away, but what about the X-Men?  There are too many of them too account for all of them being gonme except for Logan.  And when I went to Hell's Kitchen I was bummed when Daredevil didn't show.  Did they really think I'd rather have Moon Knight on my side?  There are just a ton of classic characters mysteriously MIA in this game.  You'd think Carnage would take an interest or play a part as well.  Oh well.The best part of this game by far is the web-slinging.  The physics in this game are rock-solid and give you amazing control as you swing over the streets of NYC.  There are tons of little pick-ups scattered that allow you to advance in level and let you really work out the swinging and climbing mechanics as you try to catch 'em all.  The combat starts out really simple, but as you advance in level the options that unfold are pretty amazing.  In addition to normal combat, there are aerial mechanics and different move sets for vertical wall fighting as well.  Cool. This is also the only Spider-Man game I've played where you can use your webs on the bosses.  Thank you!  It's pretty cool that most of the characters you encounter get captured at some point in the story and the symbiotes manage to duplicate their powers and mass-produce soldiers based on them.  Electro and Vulture symbiotes? Believe it.  And the fact that so many factions are fighting each other at the end really adds to the chaos even as you swing around the city and see the New York skyline marred by smoke and fire.  Kingpin's tech soldiers battling symbiotes battling SHIELD?  Why not sit back and see who wins?  There are plenty of side missions as well such as rescuing civilians in conjunction with Black Widow's SHIELD troops or helping test their weaponry.  No shortage of things to do.This isn't going down in history as the greatest comic game ever, but it's still a ton of fun.  The dialogue and voice-acting is uneven but the quips work more often then not and the characters are mostly well served.  One of my favorite moments involves Cage ragging on Spidey's outfit and Parker coming back with \" This coming from a guy who was running around with a tiara in his afro?\"  Classic.  Wolvie making fun of emo kids (likely a swipe at the third film) and Spidey attempting to call the heavy-duty superhroes in on his cell phone and getting automated answer systems was hilarious too.  The battle for New York is really fun to play and fighting alongside classic heroes and villains is a big plus.  Then there's the whole \"does everything a spider can\" thing.  There are few characters better adapted to fun gaming then Spidey is.  Most of the elements of this game are spot-on and considering I picked this up for a mere $19.99, \"Spider-Man: Web of Shadows\" was a hell of a buy.  Marvel fans, this is your stop.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2009"}

It was encompassing, awe inspiring, it had varied levels, it was pretty non-linear, the levels were lengthy yet doable.  It was basically a fun all around game.  So Jak 2 comes out, and they made a lot of changes, all for the worse.First off, I guess the marketing folks told the developers to emulate Grand Theft Auto 3.  Let me tell you, this does not work.  GTA had a living-breathing city that fit into the environment.  What does Jak 2 have?  It was a non-descript closed off city with hardly anything in it.  The worst is the movement throughout the city.  To go to a different a different part of the city, you need take this horrible \"hover vehicle\" that apparently can't hover beyond \"up\" or \"down\".  The movements of this vehicle are sluggish, slow, and uncontrollable, and the vehicle itself doesn't possess any subtlety.  Couple this with the fact that all the missions are clear cross the city, and the alleyways are small, and you've got one boring, annoying game.  I passed maybe 10 levels, and most of my time was spent hovering between those levels.Secondly, in GTA fashion, they decided to make it \"gritty\".  Oh geez, give me a break.  Who was begging for a cartoon platformer to be gritty?  Why does Jak need to cuss?  I don't mind it, but it serves no other purpose other than to alienate a chunk of potential gamers.  The \"gritty\" factor might have been an excuse as to why they could not re-produce the lush, varied environments that really made the first game.  Every level I played looked the same, either an indoor level or an outdoor level.Okay, so the environment and movement is no good, what about the missions you say?  Well, these missions are tedious missions and designed to be repeated over and over again.  Some of the missions are easy, but you basically go through the same jumps and enemies over and over again.  Many are difficult, made so that you have to die a few times, repeat what you just accomplished, just to die a little bit later.  While not hard, but if the missions were any fun, it wouldn't be so bad.Finally, the first game required you to reach a certain number of spheres for you to pass.  Whatever way you wanted to get them, you could.  This meant that if a mission was boring, not fun, or out of the way, you could skip and try something else.  This game pretty much is linear.  It's sort of de-evolution of video gaming right here.So, in short, what was once an original, fun, lush platform game now spawned a sequel which is no more than a badly designed conglomeration or random gaming ideas.Pros:Uhmm, I can't think of any.Cons:Pretty much linear.City is mundane.Environments unvaried, stale.Repetitive, tedious levels.Adult for no reason.Hover system is mind boggling bad.Difficulty: MediumFrustration Level: HighHours to complete (my estimate): 25 Hours","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2003"}

ORThe smaller, compact DS that costs a little over 120 dollars?Well if you chose the first one, then I'd recommend keeping your receipt, because you will most likely be taking it back.Pros:The DS Lite is so much better than the older DSes for numerous reasons.1) The screen is brighter.Yes while you might not notice it at first, the DS Lite can illuminate a dark room while the older DS barely illuminates the area around it.2) It is smallerDS Lite will fit in your pocketOlder DS needs to be lugged around3) The hinge is sturdier.So you are sitting at home one day playing your old DS, until Sparky puts his paw down on the top of the screen. After shooing him away, you realize that your precious DS has been snapped in half.If you notice, the older DSes have 2 cheap hinges.The DS Lites have one large hinge that is thick.HOWEVER, I would not recommend trying to push it back all the time, because not all DSes are perfect.3) The stylus is in the side.You might be asking me why this is positive.Well if you are one of those people who uses the stylus frequently in games, you might want to have easy access to grab it.The old DS has it located in the back, so you tend to have to look up from your precious game to find it. In the DS Lites, you do not have to take your eye's off the screen.Well with every game, there will be some cons:1) Battery dies twice as fastI know, great gameboy should have great battery life.Well unfortunately, a brighter screen takes more power.So if you are an avid gamer, I'd recommend keeping your charger handy, because you could be charging twice a day.2a) Gameboy advance games stick out.Wait, WHAT?! you might be asking.Well unfortunately since it is twice as small as the old ones, certain games will not fit all the way. Cheesy I know.2b) Ganeboy color games will not WORK!Do NOT try and force those old games into your DS Lite, they will not fit.It does not matter what way you try and cram it in, they just simply will not fit.So I would recommend keeping your SP if you ever needed to play a gameboy color game again. (Though with a DS, you shouldn't have to since the games are really good).Overall I would give this an 8.5/10, because this is not a perfect console. However, it is much better than it's parent DS, the bulky one.My recommendation:If you are waiting for the price to drop below 100 dollars for this DS, then I'd wait until the next form of this DS comes out, because this one is too good to drop that low.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2007"}

This game seems like it suffers from, \"Ok, Modern Warfare 2 was great, what can we do to continue that success?...Uh...\"  The story, compared to the first two Modern Warfare games is garbage, not engrossing, and, after playing for three hours, I turned it off and went back to playing Akham City.  In comparison to the previous games, the weapons, graphic, sounds, control mechanic, and characters are the same (minus those killed off).  The storyline is less stellar, the soundtrack is not as phenomenal, and the voice acting, while decent, can't match upto the likes of Keith David from the last game.

Trying to give Gran Turismo 5: Prologue a complete review is like trying to count the grains of sand on the beach in Ashikita, but I'll do my best.Whether you are a new player of Gran Turismo or a long-time fan like myself, the only place to truly start is choosing the Gran Turismo TV option and watch the video \"Beyond The Apex\". I watched this video at least 4 times before I even started playing the game.We get to meet Kazunori Yamauchi, Gran Turismo's creator. This man loved cars by age 8, and his love has developed into a lifelong dream of providing video gamers the perfect balance between car beauty, and car functionality.But this is no easy task - for example, his development team took great pains to take 20-30,000 pictures of just ONE racetrack over a 2 month timeframe! Why? To make us feel like we're racing on the real thing.Every curve in the road, every tire mark on the track, every dip of the car frame with acceleration and shifting is designed to give us all the sensations we would feel driving a car in the real world.The game gets glowing reviews from Tanner Foust, a professional drifter and Rally car driver. It's one thing for a person like me who's never been on a racetrack, it's quite another when a professional driver says this is the type of game that encourages people to go out and buy a rear wheel drive car and try it for real!Okay, so let's get on to the gameplay.The online PS3 players can use the functions of News, Online Racing, and Online Rankings. The only thing sweeter than hosting a race with players from across the globe and winning a three lap race by a hair's breath, is seeing YOUR name at the top of the online rankings.There are 71 cars to choose from, more than enough to whet our appetites until the full version of Gran Turismo 5 is released. This game gives us a lot of creative freedom: we can alter the AI difficulty, the active steering, the driving physics, braking, traction control, tires, and much more.The graphics are, for lack of a better word, flawless. During the intro movie, a car is shown driving on a road with sunlight reflecting off the rear panels - the light is shown as patchwork through leaves on a passing tree. That level of detail is also in the gameplay itself.There are 4 different viewpoints for driving the car: a player with the top-of-the-line racing wheel can choose three camera angles inside the car, while other players can choose the exterior camera to get a better overall view of the car's physics. As far as the controller options, we can choose the button setup ourselves. I was very impressed to see the controller schematic for not just one, but FIVE driving wheel simulators to choose from.On the racetrack, we have a blue line to direct us on the best path to victory, which we can either follow or alter at our own risk. The path also shows us the optimal brake times, which is a fantastic feature for the novice and expert alike. We have rules to follow - The days of cutting across patches of sand to get ahead of our opponents are gone. There are penalties for hitting other cars, ramming cars off the track, using shortcuts and any boundary collisions.So what are the shortcomings?Well, the online portion does have limits. If the host player of a race has a slower internet connection, the race can end prematurely or the picture quality/gameplay is sacrified. Some players are extremely courteous, other players may resort to cheap schoolyard tactics which can ruin the overall racing experience.The AI can be a little cruel on the racing circuit. We can't hit other cars, but if we're in the line of another car that drifts into us, we get penalized.The emphasis on drifting is more prevalent in this iteration of Gran Turismo, and the art of drifting is not easy to master. The more casual player might find this aspect of racing very frustrating.Younger gamers might get frustrated with the realism of the game's physics....this isn't Twisted Metal, after all. But hey, if Kazunori Yamauchi could love cars at age 8, then I guess anything is possible.But the biggest shortcoming? This is only a prologue....the finished product will most likely not be released before 2009.Anyone with a passionate love of cars probably has this game in their library already. The casual player can definitely give this game a rent, much as I did. Be prepared, though: Once you appreciate the fine art of drifting and racing with the precision of a heart surgeon, you won't be returning this rental on time. You'll be saving your pennies for aDualshock Wireless Controlleror aGran Turismo Racing Wheel.Gran Turismo has truly earned the title of \"The Real Driving Simulator\".","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2008"}

You start out by picking an animal mask that you have unlocked, then you go in and try to clear the stages without dying. One hit and you're dead in this game, let me make that very clear. You get a split second window to kill someone before they kill you whether they are facing you or not. If you are behind them you get an extra split second, but you won't clear a hallway before they shoot you. Enemies who have melee weapons are easier because they have to come towards you. The strategy is to see where the enemies are placed in each room and clear the stage accordingly.It starts out simple, but you will see how addictive and fun it is when your character slices open a neck, smashes a head into a carpet, or blows someone's brains out. The second genius thing with this game is that you are punished for using guns which makes the game very easy. Shoot someone and every enemy in the level comes after you. You are to clear the rooms quickly, not quietly, which is the key here. There are a few different types of enemies like dogs which are really fast, and big fat guys with scarfs that can only be killed with gunfire. Save these guys last so the entire level doesn't come after you. A good strategy is to step out of a corner and hide again and just stick out enough to you can whack anyone who walks by. This is another key strategy to winning the game.The boss fights are really tough and require thinking outside the box to beat. One enemy has two wild cats that come after you, a female ninja, then he has two uzis that will pulverize you. You have to eliminate each one in sequence without dying. Remember, one hit and you're dead. The trial and error is very rewarding because it just feels good to clear a whole level without alerting anyone. The game is very fast paced so a level can be cleared in less than a minute or just seconds. Learning the strategy of each level allows you to get better scores.You need to use combos to rack up scores, and gunfire is frowned upon in this game. Switch up weapons, use doors to knock enemies down, be bold and lure enemies around corners, kill several enemies at once, it is all based on skill and not luck. This game just feels so good to play and I couldn't put it down. There are 18 chapters in this game, and at the end I wanted more (hopefully DLC will follow).There are some major issues that keep this game from scoring higher though. When the game was released it was nearly unplayable. Even now the controller layout sucks, before there wasn't even controller support and the keyboard and mouse controls are terrible. There are game breaking bug and glitches that don't let you progress in the game, and while the music is pretty original, it repeats way too often and you end up muting your speakers. The game should have just gone through some more testing or a couple more months of development time before being released. Even now there was a bug that kept me from advancing past chapter 16. I finally tried it one more time and I passed it, no idea how or why.Hotline Miami is a fast paced action game that has genius level and strategy design. The graphics work very well for the setting, and the mechanics are just extremely solid. I just wish it was more stable and had better controller support. People with Alienware computers will get AlienFX support here which is unheard of in an indie game. As it stands, this is one of the best games of the year.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0002EJ8FC","description":"TAKE A BLAST INTO THE PAST WITH INCREDIBLE SONIC VALUE! Seven classic Sonic Genesis games PLUS Six additional Sonic Game Gear titles  Unlockable games and secrets  Re-design interface and extra bonus material","reviewerName":"Female Spy","summary":"The \"Old-Fashioned\" Sonic, Some May Say (by Laura)","reviewText":"Ah, yes.  Where would any videogame star be without his beginning games?  That's exactly what your getting here; the beginning adventures of the famous character known as Sonic the Hedgehog.  Other characters like Robotnik (a.k.a. Eggman), Miles \"Tails\" Prower, and Knuckles the Echidna also have their introductions in this series.  Before I say anything else, I want to let you know: the characters I have already mentioned are the only actual Sonic characters that are playable and/or make an appearance (I'm not including some of Eggman's robots like Scratch, Grounder, and Coconuts; who never appeared again after Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine).  If you're looking for the playability or participation of characters like Amy Rose, Bean the Dynamite, Tails Doll, or anyone else of the like YOU HAVE THE WRONG GAME.  Purchase Sonic Gems Collection if you're looking for stuff like Sonic CD (where Amy plays a role).  Even if you're here for the correct reasons, it's advisable that you check Sonic Gems Collection out anyway; it practically goes hand in hand with this game.  With that out of the way, I would like to mention I'm not comparing this game with any of the newer games.  Obviously, the graphics aren't going to be quite up to par on Genesis and Game Gear (which is where these games originally came and were preserved from) as they are on the Wii/Playstation 3/Xbox 360/Whatever newest system you own.  Also, if you're an old hat on Sonic's newer games (Sonic Advances 1-3, Sonic Heroes, Sonic Adventures 1 and 2, etc.) then much of the music (no matter how good it is) may be heard of and/or may sound out of date or even glitched to you (the remixes of the music from the newer games hold more differentiation from the older games than the Mario series, however).  One more thing; I'm not rating this as one game.  I'll give you information on all the little games you get in this box separately.  Since I'm not doing comparison, graphics, or music, I'll simply tell you the storylines (if there are any), and whether or not it plays well.  I'm strictly commenting on how fun these games are to play, and may drop an interesting tidbit of information if I have it, as well as the basic controls, and type of game it actually is.  The games are listed like the main game has them listed.The Genesis games:Sonic The Hedgehog: Dr. Ivo Robotnik (AKA Dr. Eggman), the mad scientist, is snatching innocent animals and turning them into evil robots!  Help our hero to fight enemies, rescue the helpless animals, and stop Dr. Robotnik from succeeding with his evil plot.*This storyline is a quote from the manual.I guess what newbies might call interesting, is that Sonic didn't always have to collect 7 chaos emeralds.  Indeed, this game only has 6 emeralds.  That doesn't make the game that much easier, though.  This is as old school as you can get; not even the character Tails (the two tailed fox) existed yet in this game.  This is a good classic Sonic game (not to mention probably the first Sonic game ever), but it's relatively boring to those interested in more characters and storyline.  The controls are simple: X, Circle, or Square to jump, down (on control pad or left analog stick) X, Circle or Square to prepare a spindash.  Watch out for spikes.Sonic The Hedgehog 2: Ever since Miles was a little fox he always wanted to be like Sonic.  Know to the forest animal as Tails, for his two tails, he always tried to keep up with his hero.  Sometimes, Sonic would let Tails keep up with him; other times, he teased him and sped away (not out of malice, or meanness, just playfulness).  One night, when Sonic was performing, Tails couldn't help showing off.  Using his two tails as a propeller, he increased in speed to where he could even keep up with Sonic.  Later, the same animals that had watched them were disappearing, and evil robots were taking their place.  Upon further inspection, Eggman was behind it; and your job is to collect the chaos emeralds to keep him from completing his ultimate weapon; the \"Death Egg.\"*This storyline is partially from the game and partially from the manual.  Obviously, this is the first game where Tails is introduced.  He's a great character; he can also fly like a helicopter with those two tails.  He's also the reason I really fell in love with the Sonic series.  It's a great variety of play between only two characters.  This may not interest you, but the first time I played this game was when I was a little girl; I got to play it in a small game room at a dentist office (the waiting room).  It was one of the many games you could play; and I found the special stage to be a lot of fun.  What will interest you is: if you're controlling Sonic, and the CPU is controlling Tails, a SECOND player can take control of Tails with another remote.  Furthermore, Tails is invincible as a partner; so it offers great two player capabilities.  The controls are the same; if you want to fly with Tails just press the jump button repeatedly to make him rise.  Again, watch out for spikes; and be warned that Tails will get tired, and must land after some time in the air.Sonic The Hedgehog 3: Continuing from the previous game, Eggman's \"Death Egg\" has crashed on floating island and is unable to fly.  In order to fix his ship, he calls on the guardian of the floating island, an echidna known as Knuckles, to gather the chaos emeralds necessary for repair.  Eggman doesn't stop there, he also deceives the guardian into thinking Sonic and Tails are the villains...*Main idea from the guide, slightly re-wordedFirstly, for those who are new, Knuckles isn't evil; he's gullible (meaning easy to fool).  It's a huge difference, even if it doesn't seem like it for the time being.  Fun facts time!  Did you know an echidna is actually a type of Australian anteater?  Oddly enough, many sources peg Knuckles to like fruit \"especially grapes.\"  Strange, huh?  Either way, even though you still only control Sonic and Tails, Knuckles makes his first, and very prevalent, appearances here.  He'll show up often to activate traps and laugh at you (fun, huh?).  The controls are the same for Sonic and Tails.  As always, watch out for spikes.  You may want to be watchful for squishy deaths too (you know, like getting crushed?).Sonic & Knuckles: Continuing from the last game, Sonic destroyed the \"Death Egg\"...again.  This time, he is looking to find all of the emeralds hidden in the Floating Island for safety's sake.  Knuckle's, however, still thinks he's a villain; and wants to keep the emerald's away from him by all means available.  But while Sonic and Knuckles argue, who's going to stop Robotnik?*The main plot idea is taken from the manual.Time for more fun facts.  Did you know that this game along with Sonic 3 was intended to be one game?  However, not only was it really difficult to pull off (and the release date put off a couple of times in production), but fans were demanding it; one diehard fan even hurt production by hacking into the corporation and stealing a rough level design for the Hidden Palace Zone.  The combination of all these things caused it to become two separate games.  Anyway, this is the first game that allows you to control Knuckles, a pretty cool character; but it comes at a couple of prices.  The first price is the game becomes more difficult; the second price is that you won't get as many, if any, cutscenes.  What makes Knuckle's cool, however, is he can use his dreadlocks to glide.  Press the jump button twice to initiate a flight that slowly descends you to the ground.  If you bump into a wall, you can climb it by pressing up on the d-pad/analog stick.  Press down to climb down, and a jump button to get off.  Cool, huh?  Sonic's controls are still the same.Blue Sphere (Not Available from the Start): There isn't really a plot unless you use the ones from Sonic 3 and/or Sonic and Knuckles.  This game is the special stages from those games.  They're fun, but can get tiresome.  If you don't want to start at level one every time, then either write down the numbered passwords as you progress, or find codes for all the levels at various game websites.  As mentioned, this isn't a game that comes out of the box; you must unlock it first.Knuckles in Sonic 2 (Not Available from the Start): Do you like Sonic 2?  Do you like Knuckles?  Well, here they are together...  That's really all there is to it.  No plot mentioned or anything.  Personally, I think controlling Knuckles makes this game hard for some reason...  Again, you need to unlock this game first.Sonic 3 & Knuckles (Not Available from the Start): This is just like it sounds.  It's Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles combined.  Obviously you can control Knuckles in the Sonic 3 levels now.  I'm not sure if this is how the two games were supposed to be one, originally, but something like this was most likely the original plan (see Sonic & Knuckles if you're lost); you can see how and where the two stories fit together (if you last that long).  It's quite impressive.  This is also the first time the super emeralds come into play.Sonic 3D Blast: Sonic goes to Flicky island only to find that Eggman has turned the mysterious birds known as Flickies (kind of a duh), into, guess what, vicious robots!  Help Sonic rescue the Flickies and foil the evil doctor's plan.*Main plot idea from the manualAs the title suggests, this game is in 3D.  The D stands for dimensional in case you didn't know, and were looking for a fun fact (the same truth pertains to 2D, etc.).  Controlling Sonic is still the same; but the new perspective in this game makes it difficult to judge distance and move correctly.Sonic Spinball: Once again, Eggman is turning animals into robots (seriously, will they lock this guy up, or something?); and this time he is using his Veg-O-Fortress (basically, a giant pinball machine minus the ball) to do so.  Only Sonic can penetrate the pinball defense system, free the animals, and collect the chaos emerald to put an end to the evil doctor's scheme.*Main Plot idea from the manualThe controls are the same for Sonic as always on regular ground; but that isn't often this time.  This is almost exactly like a pinball game.  The square button controls the left flipper, X controls the right, and Circle controls both.  You can use any mentioned buttons to shake the bonus round boards.  While I applaud Sega for their original idea of using a hedgehog as a pinball, I've had a enough doses of the pinball phase from when I was little.  I was never that good either...Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine: Dr. Robotnik is changing the jolly folk of Beanville into devious little robots that will help rid Planet Mobius of music and fun forever.  Group the beans together to help them escape while working your way up to the wilier henchbots.*The plot is quoted word for word from the instruction manual.  I'm not kidding.Actually, Sonic doesn't really make an appearance in this game.  It truly is up to you.  This is a fun little puzzle game and, unlike previous Sonic games, Eggman's robots have been given personalities.  These personalities were shown by the cutscenes before the level (where they say a sentence or two toward you) and during the level (when you're winning or losing).  It makes some of them endearing (like Coconuts), and others annoying (like Grounder); but it was actually a great concept.  I wonder why it disappeared in later games...  Either way, you play by trying to get four or more beans, of the same color, together; but there are some strategies to it.  You use the d-pad/analog stick to move the beans as they fall, use square/circle to rotate them clockwise, and X to rotate counterclockwise.  That's it.Flicky (Not Available from the Start): I don't know why this is here, unless it's because Flickies are in Sonic 3D.  Either way, it's here when you unlock it.  It's basically about a blue Flicky who's trying to save yellow chick-like birds called Chirps, while avoiding Tigers and Iggys (think Iguanas).  A Flicky controls just like Sonic, save for being able to double jump using it's wings.  If you find a pot plant (or another object) use the jump button to throw it.  Get as many Chirps to the door as possible for the highest score.  Don't let Tigers and Iggys touch them, or they'll wander away from you.Ristar (Not Available from the Start): This is probably the cream of the crop of the non-Sonic games here.  This game alone is worth getting the entire collection for.  Unfortunately, it'll be the hardest game to unlock, and the last game you'll get; so patience will be required.  The story is simple, but entails a cool intro.  A villain known as Greedy conquers all of the planets by taking control of their leaders.  A legendary hero rises to defeat them, but gets captured himself by this villain.  The last hope is his son, Ristar, who gets called into action during one of his peaceful aquatic naps.  It's up to you to help Ristar save the day.*Plot roughly from the game, maybe a bit from the in-game manual.I finally have more interesting facts for you.  Firstly, in this country's game's intro, it's a light that calls Ristar into saving his dad; but originally, it was Ristar's mom, who apparently was a well-known goddess.  The pagan deity was taken out to avoid offending people.  Here's something else: Ristar's sprite was originally always smiling.  Ours has a more serious look but if you pause RIGHT after he lands, you'll see the original smile that he had.  Finally, even though this is a great game, it was one of the last ones to be produced before the Genesis system went extinct.  Because of this, it probably didn't get it's deserved fame; thus, no sequels were ever made and this game fell into almost obscurity (some still talk about it, but not many).  This apparently made it into the collection because some of Ristar's designs were originally supposed to belong to Sonic; but it didn't work out, and those qualities became part of completely different character.  Ristar moves exactly like Sonic with two differences.  One, he can't spindash.  Two, instead of Square being another jump button, it uses Ristar's grab ability; which makes the game more various then you think.  If I didn't stress it enough, great game!  You must look into it.The Ooze (Not Available from the Start): The plot is more complicated than most.  A wonderful and brilliant scientist (or so says the in-game manual) known as Caine does research for a corporation; but one day, he suspects a scandal being planned behind his back.  So, he hacks into a computer to learn that the corporation is hiding a deadly hybrid plague that could wipe out humanity in just a few days.  The corporation itself has the only known cure and is planning to release the disease into water supplies everywhere; thus, infecting the entire planet, and forcing governments to pay them billions for said cure.  During Caine's research, the director barges in with a goon on each side and Caine is discovered.  The goons hold him down while the director takes out a huge syringe full of hideous green goo and injects it in Caine's arm.  The director's intent was to kill Caine, but something went wrong and Caine survived; instead of dying, he became the Ooze, a green liquid monster.  With the only traces of his humanity being his head and a fist, Caine swore revenge on the corporation.*Plot mostly from the detailed in-game manual.Aside from the detailed story, there really isn't anything I like about this game.  It's completely disgusting as you're a green blob that burps every time you defeat something mutant (like rats).  You move around toxic dumps, and go through toilet pipes... Eww!  Whether this game is easy to unlock or not depends on whether or not you have a Sonic Heroes save file.  If you do, it should already be unlocked (if not the first time, exit the game list and enter again).  If not, it'll be a little harder to unlock.  I had a Sonic Heroes file, so I'm unsure of how hard it is to unlock without it.  If you need help, there are plenty of ways to get it online.  You make the Ooze punch with the Square button (maybe X too, I don't know that could also be for spitting), spit with the Circle button, and move him with the d-pad/analog stick.Comix Zone (Not Available from the Start): This is a great game, but it's hard.  It's about a comic book creator named Turner, who gets trapped into his own comic book world by means of a villain (that he created) who somehow escaped that world.  Now, it's a fight to the finish.  Will Turner escaped and teach his own villain a lesson?  Or will his villain finish him off; leaving Turner trapped in his own comic book adventure forever?*Some of this information may be from the in-game manual; if not, it came from the actual game.I don't really do the story justice.  It'll be a lot better and climatic when you see it for yourself.  The in-game manual has the storyline like a comic book, and the game is like a comic itself (hence the title).  It's really awesome.  I wish I could tell you what the controls are from memory; but, for just a few buttons, this game has complicated controls.  You'll be better off learning from the manual, or trial and error, than me telling you wrong.Game Gear Games:Sonic The Hedgehog: Uh, same plot as the one from Genesis.  It's pretty different in gameplay from it's counterpart, though.  No special stages (the emeralds are out in the open), and cheerier music.  The controls are the same.  I still like it better for some reason...Sonic Labyrinth: Eggman was thinking one night, \"Why does Sonic always beat me?\"  He thought and he thought.  \"Why does he always speed past me?\"  That's when it came to him: Sonic's speed and jumping abilities!  \"Yes!  I'll develop shoes that'll slow him down AND keep him from jumping!  It's brilliant!\"  Next morning, Sonic woke up and put on his shoes, as usual, but noticed they weighed him down considerably; and he couldn't get them off!  On top of all of that, he was caught in the evil doctor's newest trap: a labyrinth.  Can he escape with just his spindash ability remaining?*Plot mostly from the in-game guide.This isn't a very good game.  Your goal is to find the three keys needed to exit the level within the time limit.  You control Sonic a lot like you do in Sonic 3D Blast.  The only difference is the buttons activate your spindash instead making you jump (you can't jump, remember?).  Apparently, you hit those buttons again to make him stop.  This is a bad game because not only do you have that bad perspective from Sonic Blast 3D, but Sonic moves really slow; and you don't have that much time.  Some time can be gained by defeating enemies and finding keys, so that helps.  But your spindash is hard to control, and normally does more harm than good.  This game is hard to say the least.Sonic Drift: Sonic and his friends seek even greater speed on the race circuit.  Aim to become the winner of the Chaos Grand Prix with your high speed race machines.*Plot quoted directly from the manualThat's all I really have on it.  They don't even have an English manual available in the game (it's all in Japanese).  Each character slows his/her rivals down in his/her own way.  Use the d-pad/analog stick to steer, Circle to accelerate, and X/Square to break.  Combine these controls to do Drift Turns.  This isn't a high quality racing game; in fact, Sonic Drift 2 (from Sonic Gems Collection) is better.Sonic Chaos: Sonic's sidekick Tails made his first appearance on Game Gear in Sonic Chaos.  Choose Sonic or Tails-two playable characters means, double the fun!!!*Plot is quoted word for word from the manual (it's not really a plot, though)If you want something interesting, I learned from the main game itself that this game was originally going to be Sonic and Tails.  The controls on both characters are the same as Sonic 2.  This game is fun.  That's it.Sonic Blast: Knuckle's made his first appearance on the Game Gear in Sonic Blast.  Anyway, Eggman built an island just like the Floating island in order to harness the Master Emerald's power.  Now, Sonic and Knuckle's are teaming up to collect the chaos emeralds and destroy the fake island.*First line from the manual.  The rest of the plot is mostly from the in-game manual.You control Sonic and Knuckles just like you do in the game Sonic & Knuckles.  It just looks different.  With different music.  It's still fun.Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine: The plot's pretty much the same.  This game doesn't sell the personality of Eggman's robots nearly as much as it's counterpart, nor does it look anywhere near as good; but it gives you the benefit of a \"Puzzle Book\" for beginners.  The Puzzle Book (for robot's only, it says) gives you special situations in it's \"Lessons\" that you have to solve with specific moves; this can help you strategize better.  Other than the Puzzle Book, however, you're better off playing the counterpart.  Go to this one if you need to brush up on your skills.Conclusion:Whew, *massages wrist* that was the last game.  I hope rating each game individually helps you decide if the overall collection is right for you.  Sure, there are some bad apples; but there are really good ones in here, too.  One more important thing before I close: a couple of the Sonic Genesis ones can get boring, especially if you can't get past a certain level; if you want some real fun, search online for level select and debug mode codes.  It's fun because then you can control Super Sonic on Green Hill, or warp to Lava Reef where you fight Knuckles; really cool stuff that you can't do in today's games.  Don't worry if you find tricks only for the Genesis version of these games; they'll work here too.  Just replace A, B, and C with Square, X, and Circle.  That'll be all.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2008"}

I have played every NA FF release since then so buying this game was a no-brainer for me even though i knew it was a rhythm game.  The characters are super cute, the music is just the way i remember them and they bring back so many memories of years gone by like when i would stay up late at night trying to beat golbez back in 1992.There is so much to do in this game with all 13 FF games to play through and challenges to complete, unlocking extra characters and music,movies and pictures.  The game is great for playing through long periods of time or even in short 20 min bursts, there is always something to do and collect. The rpg element is a nice touch with gathering items and materias to raise stats and help you during the songs and challenges.  There is also a MP aspect but i have not messed with it yet.I'm loving the game and it's one of my top 5 3ds games of all times now and the bonus stylus and sticker sheet was just a bonus for me.

{"product_name":"B001AWBYNE","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"That familiar yet awesome feeling","reviewText":"Like a lot of people, the idea of going back to World War II didn't seem as exciting and this idea was further made problematic when developing team Treyarch (the maligned Call of Duty 3) was doing it as opposed to Infinity Ward who made the immensely-popular Modern Warfare. While I thought it was an intense shooter, it was also infuriating at times and certain parts were not fun at all though the experience as a whole was awesome. Taking that same engine and bringing it to the past has the game maintain that sense of intensity but it's still not up to the standards that IV brought. As such, World at War is a fun shooter, it's exciting and worth the trip but it's possibly not the next Call of Duty experience you were hoping for.Story: Like Modern Warfare, you play as 2 soldiers (thankfully not one of them nicknamed something as ridiculous as \"Soap\") Pvt. Miller of the Unites States Army going through the jungles of Japan during the Pacific Theater whereas Pvt. Petrenko, a Red Army soldier is part of the Russian forces storming their way into Berlin. The problem really with going back to World War II is that we know the outcomes or at least the general idea of the different battles and while we're thankfully not doing D-Day again, there's still a feeling like there's no real sense of plot progression like the hunt for the terrorist in Modern Warfare, we're just going somewhere until the game says \"okay, stop\".Graphics: One thing that always bugged me in a lot of war shooters is that the environments tended to be mainly bombed out cities, thick jungles or fields surrounded by the occasional barn and house. While World at War doesn't shift away from this tradition entirely, it's a bit more immersive and the linear and obvious routes are overshadowed by the real sense of scale and activity in a level. Character models are a bit more improved, destructible environments (some anyway) and some changes from a tank mission to manning a turret firing at enemy ships and fighters, it may not blow the roof off but it's certainly impressive.Sound/Music: Just as awesome as with any war shooter is the sound mix from the explosions and gunfire to barking commanders issuing orders, it certainly does feel like we're in a warzone. Also contributing is Kiefer Sutherland and Gary Oldman who act as your Cpt. Price role for this game and both of them are just perfect with their loud and \"animated\" line readings. What might be a bit of a problem is the music which can shift from choirs and synths to straight up rock guitars and while I will admit it's strange hearing modern music in a WWII shooter, there was a couple of times where I have to say it added to the whole scene.Gameplay: The controls are still the same from grenade throwing to carrying 2 weapons at once and throwing back grenades when the prompt comes up but there's not really much else that has changed. Weaponry is not as fast-firing as before, reloading is a bit more slower and for the Russian sections, smoke grenades and flash bangs have been replaced with molotov cocktails. However, this naturally means that enemies also have access to these and they seem to know how to use them better than you since they'll frequently \"cook\" the grenade (keeping it in your hand than throwing so it explodes seconds after being tossed) resulting in quick deaths and in the most irritating of programming, they seem to throw grenades just as you spawn in the checkpoint and you die literally seconds after starting. While they're not as frequent, I just had to laugh when it did, chuckling at the hilarity of it then curse them out.Then of course there's the enemies having better accuracy and I'll frequently be aiming for that one fraction of an enemy body that's in view but not get a single shot in whereas if I poke my head around the corner, the red circle and fading colors already start appearing. But when life gives you lemons, you broil those buggers thanks to your flamethrower. While it doesn't pop up frequently, being able to wave your nozzle around and fry any enemy in your path has a depraved awesomeness. Melee attacks are also not instant kills as pressing R3 before the enemy stabs you and you grab it, grab your knife and plunge it into their neck. Speaking of which, this is a bit more gorier than Modern Warfare and while I didn't run into a lot of \"Saving Private Ryan\"-type moments of nastiness, it's there and makes it a bit more impactful.The multiplayer is pretty much the same except the maps are huuuuge and the shift seems to be more about sneaking up on players or snipering people from a distance as opposed to the quicker-paced firefights of most FPS multiplayers. Where the fun comes is \"Zombie Mode\" which is unlocked after beating the main campaign (sorry co-op players, have to unlock it solo campaign) and the premise is basically you and up to 3 others acting in an Alamo-esque manner has you defend against wave after wave of zombie nazis that get tougher the more you go. While this feels like the PS3's answer to \"Gears of War 2\" and it's Horde mode, it's a blast to play and I bet many people will gravitate towards this one.Recommending World at War is a tricky business since on one hand, Modern Warfare did things a bit better yet this game isn't an embarassment or just some uninspired rehash. Yes it's World War 2 again, it's Nazis and it feels like IV brought back a good 60 years...but it's so fun that honestly I didn't mind.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2008"}

{"product_name":"B003O6EDSM","reviewerName":"Grimes","summary":"One of the Best Sci-Fi Trilogies To Date","reviewText":"The Mass Effect universe is rich and exciting. It's full of twists, turns and compels the player throughout it's endless hours of game play and story. Over the course of playing the games, I found myself attached to the characters. More so, I felt attached to Shepherd. This was the Shepherd as I envisioned. I made the choices. I chose the words. She was me but she was also something else entirely. She was hero of the universe that I had come to love. I felt like I simply nudged her in certain directions.This feeling is particularly present in Mass Effect 2. While the first Mass Effect is great on its own, Mass Effect 2 let Shepherd have a bit of her own personality outside of dialogue choices the player made. I think this was the biggest improvement aside from certain game play mechanic changes. I chose Liara as my romantic partner (and stayed true to her throughout the series). By the end of the game, I had become very attached. The emotional attachment this game can create with its characters cannot be overstated.There is real strength in the writing. That carries the series most of the way. The RPG elements are great (ME3 improved on them the best in my opinion) and the third person combat is fluid. Yet, in the end the Universe that has been created is monumental in and of itself. I do not share the belief that my choices were pointless or that the ending of the series was disappointing. That might be partly because I didn't set out on my journey believing that choice set A-Z would bring me endings A-Z. The more pragmatic gamer is inclined to appreciate the presence of choice. It's a tool to shape the experience more than the ultimate outcome. In that, the game succeeds and does it very well. Do we need an ending where Shepherd and his crew arrive home victorious? Do we need to see Shepherd and his love running in a park with children? Do we need to see the Normandy crew laughing at a barbecue? Of course not yet I imagine the anguish over the ending would have been considerably less. Despite the detractors (hardly an overwhelming number), Mass Effect stands as an experience that little other game series can offer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00D8S4GNS","description":"","reviewerName":"ashertopia \"@gmail .com\"","summary":"Great Party Game (w/ a Couple Drawbacks)","reviewText":"Xbox Kinect dance games come down to two options every year: Just Dance and Dance Central. Which one you should buy is based on what you want out of it. Just Dance is a party game (up to four players after unlocks) while Dance Central is more technically accurate dancing. As for me, I like them both. And I dislike them both. This is a review for Just Dance so let me tell you about this game.The game is fun, has a lot of current (2013) and classic songs, has vibrant visuals, and is easier to play. Pick up and play on Just Dance is a blast and great for a group of adult players to spend a game night. The music has songs that have topped the charts over the last year including Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Robin Thick, Rihanna, One Direction and dance house fav Daft Punk. The dancers (remember in Just Dance you see dancers not you on the screen) are colorful and energetic. The game is well made and Kinect picks up on your moves well.A couple things I didn't like: I've never been a fan of the dancers on the screen instead of the players. Seeing the dancers makes you feel you are doing better than you are, but at parties I want to see the hilariously bad dancing on the screen - it's part of the fun! Also, I'm not a fan of having to unlock party modes through playing. I want a party game that is ready to go out of the box. In fact, one the best parts of the game is that some songs allow 3 or 4 dancers in it (Xbox One is supposed to allow 6!) and the dancers do off the wall stuff like carrying another dancer on their back or stacking. That's the stuff I want to get to right away with a party game; not having to wait until we unlock it. Minor issues, but something that holds the game back.Overall, this is a very good game that plays well and makes for a great party game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Axel","summary":"Mario returns with the power of the cube","reviewText":"Mario, such a popular name in the world of gaming, and he doesn't disappoint in his games, never has probably never will, and this game doesn't disappoint either.  If you like Mario 64 you'll love this definate purchase for any 'cube owner.  Now, graphics run at a steady 30FPS (Frames Per Second), which isn't bad, and should have been at 60, but it isn't what the critics wanted, trust me this game does not look like Mario 64 like some of the fanboys have been saying, it runs smooth and is pretty to look at.  Yes, Nintendo could have done better as far as texture surfaces go, they do become a bit pixel like, but I don't complain about it, I'm enjoying every second of this game, and I don't want to stop until I have every single Shine.  Gameplay, 5 stars, good solid and fun.  Controls, well I will say since I haven't played Mario 64 in a while I was out of practice and fell to my death a few times, but with a little time I was up to par and figured my way around everything.  The device on his back, FLUDD, really threw me for a loop at first, I found myself shooting the opposite ways of enemies and got frustrating, but soon I got the hang of it.  All in all, soild game and Mr. Miyamoto doesn't disappoint with his masterpiece, can't wait for the next one, keep up the fantastic work Nintendo!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2002"}

Johnson","summary":"Campaign is great; Online is great too...if you like lag and an idiotic spawn system","reviewText":"Overall, I was disappointed with Modern Warfare 2 in both single player and multiplayer modes.  Single player campaign was nothing more than a your typical Hollywood action flick with all action all the time.  Needless to say, it got old very quick and the story was impossible to follow with your typical unbelievable ending.  Multiplayer while better than single player suffered from lame perks that people abused and required no skill to use.  Commando/lightweight (i.e. teleport) was possibly the cheapest perk combo in that game.  The game also suffered from bullets curving around the corner a horrible spawn system that just turned this game into a camp fest.  I really didn't mind the camping because I understood why people did it.  I mean who wants to have someone spawn right behind and shoot them in the back every 3 seconds?Enter Call of Duty Black Ops, a game that looked good on TV but based on my previous experience, I was not sure about the game and after having this game for about a week, I can honestly say my apprehensions about this game were valid but not in the areas I expected.The goodCampaign mode is much improved this time around.  While it seemed like it would end up just being a non-stop action fest during the first few missions, things really started getting good after getting to the Vietnam missions.  The story is written better and is easier to follow for the most part, but the flashbacks can be a little distracting.  But I can say for a fact that I really got addicted to the single player mode.Online play has many improvements; first of all many of the lame and cheap perks from MW2 are GONE!  This means no more commando/lightweight users, no excessive noob tube damage, and no impossible kills from all the way across the screen.  In addition there is no more stacking of kill streaks, meaning any kills you get from your kill streak rewards will NOT count towards your kill streak.  Because of this you can no longer sit back and let your kill streaks do all the work if you want to get your higher rewards.  I was guilty of this in MW2 but I welcome this change in BO and should help to cut down on camping.  This also ensures that the more powerful kill streaks rewards (11 is the highest you can get now) will be a rare occurrence which makes for good balance.  The spawning system has little improvement but still people will spawn right behind you, but from what I experienced this game is not as bad as MW2. (ummm, scratch this, see my update at the end of this review)New system for weapon upgrades.  Instead of having to get 6 million headshots to get a new camo for your gun or attachment, you now have to buy your upgrades with money you earn during your matches.  I love this change as in MW2 I became too caught up on completing challenges to get weapon upgrades which in turn forced me to use a particular weapon for all of my matches and it became more of a chore than anything.  There are many ways to earn money, but I won't go into them here.Combat training mode is an excellent way for you to practice multiplayer with computer controlled opponents and teammates with customizable game options like time limit and score. You can select the difficulty level and compete in either TDM or FFA on all online maps. In addition you earn upgrades, ranking promotions just like you would online except they don't carry over to online play.  I didn't think this mode would be much fun, but it is and is also a good way to try out and practice all the kill streak rewards (if you stay alive long enough) without the pressure or frustration online.The badWith all the improvements in both single player and multiplayer mode the negatives greatly hurt the overall quality of this game.The graphics and sound are a noticeable huge step back from MW2 and even COD4.  This does not look like a current gen game, and people who both like and dislike this game all agree the graphics are not up to par with what is currently out on the next gen systems.  Many times I have found myself comparing this game's visuals to the graphics of my XBOX (the first one) wondering which one was better.  Sound also takes a step back from the previous COD titles, as I have said in many of my comments, all explosive devices sound exactly the same, and the guns themselves just sound a little bit underpowered.  While the graphics and sound issues didn't bother me too much on single player they did distract me on online play when it was coupled with the number 1 problem with this game.....ONLINE LAG.While MW2 had MANY problems with online play, LAG was rarely an issue I encountered, this is no longer the cause with BO.  Out of all the time I had this game, I only had two or three matches that lag was minimal and this was at 2 in the morning.  The rest of my many matches suffered debilitating lag so much that many times I would just quit the game in frustration because it's impossible to kill someone when they are teleporting all over the screen.  Even the menu to get to online play is quirky; many times I had to press the \"Playstation Network\" option on the multiplayer screen multiple times JUST to get into the lobby.  Then when I get there the only thing that is guaranteed is a laggy online experience.  After the second day of putting up with this, I gave up online play altogether and played Combat training, because I just found online play well....unplayable.  All of the great improvements to multiplayer are completely ruined by the lag which is a shame.Single player is much improved but multi-player overall is a huge step back even with the improvements that were implemented.  I am glad I rented this game, because multiplayer is what makes games like these worth the cost.  But when I can't even play multi-player why would I pay full price for it?  I may end up getting this game eventually, but not until the price comes down considerably because unless they find a fix for their online mode, there is no way I'm playing this game online.My suggestion RENT before you buy.UPDATE 11/30/2010:  (Regarding the spawn system)While I originally stated that the spawn system is slightly improved over MW2, after playing more games online (360 version, since the PS3 version is unplayable online).  I can now say definitively that the spawn system is actually WORSE than MW2 and that is saying a lot.  Never before have I experienced so many instant random deaths right after I kill someone due to an enemy somehow magically appearing right behind me in the area I just left 1 second earlier.  It is absolutely ridiculous and frustrating. But hey, if you like mindless chaos and instant deaths, you will be right at home with this game.  It got so bad in fact that I decided to try my hand and hardcore since spawns take longer, but the obvious trade off is weapons are more powerful which is good in itself, until, yep! you guessed it someone spawns behind you, or spawn camps and kills you as soon as you spawn.  So while Hardcore does limit the occurrence of enemies appearing behind you, it still does not fix the obviously flawed and untested spawn system.  I hear arguments that the spawn system is like this to eliminate camping, but if this is the case, then their bass ackward plan backfired, because all this does is encourage MORE CAMPING and who can really blame players for doing so?  I find it hard to believe that the QA department at Treyarch (provided they even have one) honestly could look at this game and say the spawn system was fine.  But I guess these days, quality takes a back seat to profits.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2010"}

Although the PlayStation is no longer the fastest machine on the market, it does boast the broadest selection of software. Some of the hottest console games available today are created exclusively for the PlayStation, including several modern-day video gaming classics (Metal Gear SolidandCrash Bandicootto name a few).The Sony PlayStation truly shines with 3D-rendered action games, such asTomb RaiderandSyphon Filter. These and other 3D-based titles place players in the middle of elaborate gaming environments that take full advantage of the system's ability to render up to 360,000 polygons per second. The PlayStation also has the capability to display 16.8 million colors simultaneously and can support full-frame video playback at 30 frames per second. In addition to impressive graphics, the PlayStation also offers CD-quality sound. Each PlayStation disc has the capacity to store up to 650 MB of data--significantly more information than can be stored on cartridge-based games. As an added bonus, the PlayStation will even play your favorite music CDs (accompanied by a selection of cool graphics).Additionally, the PlayStation now comes packed with Sony's impressive dual shock controller, which allows players to feel every punch, kick, and rumble during gameplay. The controller features dual-analog thumb joysticks and round rubber grips for improved game control and comfort. Separate accessories that could enhance the PlayStation experience include an additional controller--allowing two-player action--and a memory card so players can save their progress in a game.--Brett Atwood","reviewerName":"Mr. T \"Randall\"","summary":"The Playstation has all the best RPG's","reviewText":"After giving it some thought, I recently bought a PSX Dualshock system.  Having played the N64, it got boring for me due to lack of RPG's. There is  not one decent true RPG title for the N64. Quest 64 was a total piece of  garbage and Zelda for me is just a over hyped, ho hum game.With the PSX,  there is the FF series, various Square Soft RPG's, upcoming Dragon Quest  VII, and many more titlesavailable. I got frustrated with the lack of RPG's  for the N64 and hearing about all the awesome ones for the PSX. RPG's has  always been my favorite type of game to play. The first RPG I ever played  was Dragon Warrior on the NES. That game really got me hooked on  RPG&quot;s. Everybody that I know has a PSXand they really it a lot. The  fact that the games are on CD's, hold more memory than cartridge, really  swayed me towards the PSX. The only drawback is that you need to buy memory  cards for Adventure &amp; RPG's. I like the design of the PSX, it can also  play your favorite cd's. The N64 may have better graphics and sound, but  that alone can't make a fun game. Don't get me wrong, N64 is a good system  and so is the Playstation. PSX has a lot of the Mature games. Something the  N64 has very few of anyway. The PSX Dual shock controller does not need  batteries, unlike the N64's. I haven't bought a decent game for the N64 in  a while and maybe won't for a while. There is no hope for the N64, not in  my mind anyway. Maybe there will be RPG's for the Starcube(Nintendo's new  system) but who knows? Nintendo has gone out of their way to make more  mature games and that's a good thing.Myself, I'm in my 30's and I like to  see more mature graphic scenes and four letter words. In closing, I would  like to say that I'm sure glad I bought a PSX. The library of games is  immense and there are loads of RPG's!But I have not given up on the N64,  maybe they or somebody else will make a decent RPG.(Yeah right!)

I'm a dad, and I have a 5-year old daughter. I have been playing my own garden and have been helping my daughter with her's. This game is generally kid-friendly.Open-ended games can sometimes get boring, but so far, after countless hours of playing since Christmas, I'm not tired of this game yet, and I still have a lot to discover and explore.  The game has sufficient guidance -- meaning that the characters will guide you through some of the gameplay, and there is a journal that contains a wealth of information.  If you need to look anything up, the information is readily available...and the information is only specific to your current game.Graphics are great -- it's very three-dimensional and realistic, and the various pinatas all have their own personalities.  They do the things you expect that kind of animal to do.  In terms of \"real-time\" play, the game engine does a great job of tracking multiple things...pinatas \"romancing\", plants growing, other pinatas visiting...etc.  There's a lot going on in this game, and at times, it can seem quite overwhelming.  But that is part of the challenge.In terms of challenges, there are a lot of \"achievements\" to reach.  It takes quite some time to reach some of them, but this extends the playability of the game. The randomness is good -- you can create different gardens and handle them differently, and you get different results. This was evident with my daughter's garden, when she attracted Pinatas that I had not attracted to my garden.  Different combinations and different variables yield different results.There are some bugs in the game, and at times they can be quite annoying.  Pinatas sometimes get stuck between items, things get in the way of other things, etc. I'm also not happy with the \"transitions\" between opening menus, but I guess this is \"eye candy\" added so that the system can load data in the background.  Sometimes I just wish it would run \"faster\".There are a lot of things to try, and a lot of things to find. Overall it is a great game with great long-term playing potential.  It's not perfect, though, and I find it odd that some of the problems that so many other people report made it through their quality testing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2007"}

Zulli \"Tazz\"","summary":"Do you have game","reviewText":"Madden NFL is back for the 2010-2011 season and well it has made some major changes. First its simpler. You dont have to go through a ton of plays to pick one in 40 seconds. Now the computer will pick the best play for you. But if you like old fashion, you can still select plays..which you'll do more often then you think.Also the animations on the field are stunning. No more ordinary boring catches and tackles. Not every play looks the same. Also there are more sideline animations to make it feel more like a football game on tv.Now some have complained this is almost like last year, same features, same exact franchise mode...different.Also what is new is the ability to play 3 on 3 online or co-op. Meaning if you can get 5 other players, you can actually play a team game. A downside to online is you have to pay a fee and to play it you need a 1 time only code (comes with the game). Once its used it cant be used again, so if you buy a used game..forget about playing online.Overall great game.Pros:-Graphics-Gameplay-Animations-Sideline animations-3 on 3 online playCons:-If you bought last year's...it probably will feel the same-Nothing new to franchise mode-Paying a fee to play online-One time use code to play online. If you buy a used..forget playing online","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2010"}

There's just no other way to say it. After finishing the game, I came to the realization that the game had me on edge the entire time I was playing. This game really succeeds at sustaining an atmosphere that keeps you on the edge of your seat with the certainty that just around the next corner is something particularly vicious waiting to sink its teeth into your flesh. You are never given a moment's rest and they really amp the tension up way past what would probably be considered healthy levels.I'm not one to ruin stories and I'm not making any exceptions here, except to say that this game would appeal to anyone with an appreciation for horror and sci-fi flicks, especially movies that combine the two genres like Aliens, Event Horizon and John Carpenter's version of The Thing. This game proudly wears its influences on its sleeve and manages to produce something genuinely great out of its many forefathers. The creative team behind this title did their homework and it shows. From the very beginning, I was pretty much glued to the controller.GRAPHICS: Astounding. One of the things that make this game such an incredible experience is the sheer scale and design of the levels. It has the fusing of metal and flesh aspects of Doom 3, the lighting of Bioshock and levels with large areas like something you'd see in Ninja Gaiden 2.  Certain portions of the game have moments where you just have to stop, look around and take it all in because you can just \"feel\" how large your surroundings are. I don't know if that makes any sense but I'm sure when you play the game, you'll know what I mean. The design on the monsters owes a lot to the nasty, tentacle ridden horror flicks of the early 80's and these critters enjoy popping out of nowhere, screaming and growling. I thought the creatures were really impressive and definitely serve as formidable obstacles in your path to finding out what the hell is going on in the overrun ship the story takes place in.SOUND: Wow. I may have to go on record as saying that the sound in this game is probably the best I have heard in ANY game to date. If you have surround sound and have been feeling like your speakers haven't been very active lately, don't worry because this will probably be your new demo disc when showing off your sound system to any of your pals. This is the kind of game that uses sound mixing and design to make the game even better, creating an incredible atmosphere of fear and tension that like I said before, just doesn't let up. Whispers, dripping water, wet, squishy sounds coming from the air vent above you, faraway screams, babies and adults crying, chanting, inhuman grunting, moaning, laughter.... all sorts of things that you DON'T want to hear in the dark corridors of a monster infested ship. The weapons sound nice and loud. I honestly believe that the sound in this game is its best and strongest point. Seriously, it would most likely be an injustice to the sound designers to not play this game with a proper surround setup and the volume high up.GAMEPLAY: Great and fluid controls. Only become a very minor problem when you get crowded by monsters as the close quarters combat isn't the greatest. Still, not too much to whine about.  The inventory and map interface is great, coming up as a digital hologram in real time. Cool moments like bouncing around the walls while in zero-G and being in vacuums add to the game. You upgrade your weapons with power nodes which are very valuable and scattered across the levels. Creatures are dispatched easily when you shoot off their limbs but usually take a lot of hits if you're just aiming for the body so it lends a whole strategic kind of thing to the mayhem.  All of which happens in nice, gory detail.Bottom line: If you have any desire to feel terror and dread for a good respectable stretch of playtime, look no further. This one pulled no punches and left me freaked out and jumpy on many an occasion. I have absolutely no regrets on picking this up as it earns its \"M\" rating by delivering a truly scary experience. I have a feeling that this one is gonna be a sleeper hit.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYV70","description":"","reviewerName":"J.S. Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"A Last-Minute Savior for 2012!","reviewText":"It's been another let-down year for gamers in 2012.  Sure, a couple of good titles - the CoD guys are happy as usual.  What'd you guys get - 3 new games this year?  And how much per-pop?  $60 bucks huh?  Wow...  Of course there were delays again - some of us were hoping for GTA V by now.  A little while longer won't kill us I guess...And then Far Cry 3.  I approached with caution...  Poked the disc with a stick a few times...  Is this one going to bite my a$$ like the last one did?  I mean, Far Cry 2 was technically impressive.  Gorgeous graphics, a ton of content, but oh my GOD - driving from location to location and constantly getting stuck in little camps with enemies that respawned the moment you were out of eye-sight...  It was a good idea on paper, but the game itself frustrated you long before you could finish it.  What bad ideas would carry over into the third installment??Short answer:  None.Your character no longer suffers from a useless illness that requires medicine every hour of play while adding no actual gameplay elements.  There are enemy installments, but you can actually clear them out - PERMANENTLY - and gain a new place to swap weapons, load up on ammo, and even FAST TRAVEL TO (Hallelujia...)  And...  Oh yeah - you can fast travel!Far Cry 3 is one of those games that for the one or two Amazon customers who might have read my other reviews, will know that I love because it causes players to ask themselves, \"What do I want to do next?\"  You literally have to strategize in this game - and not just as far as \"How do I want to kill this particular bad guy?\" or \"How do I beat this mission?\"  For example, in my previous play session, I needed to hunt an animal because I needed it's skin to craft a new ammo pouch...  However, the hunting ground for those animals was currently in enemy territory.  I couldn't really take out the enemy camp because I couldn't carry enough ammo, and thus had to really carefully pre-plan before leaving my current base.  Once I managed my inventory and filled my ammo, I went to the hunting grounds.  I managed to gnab two boars before hostiles arrived, only for us all to learn that a tiger had made his way into the area...  The hostiles started throwing molotov cocktails at it, setting the entire hunting ground ablaze, and I had to haul a$$ out of there!  My escape route of course lead me right into the enemy camp, and the resulting gun fight was quite chaotic!  As my friendly rebels raised their native flag at the newly commandeered camp, the camera panned around to show the smoldering grass and trees surrounding the area.  Gotta admit, that was just cool.Far Cry 3 is a bit of a challenge for the single player.  It's more than just running-and-gunning.  You have to craft materials to carry more weapons, ammo, etc.  Some of this can be a bit frustrating.  For example, I maxxed out my potential cash-supply because my wallet couldn't hold more than $2000.  Really?  I think I could find a place to cram some bills...  It can also be frustrating when you come across a much-needed plant or animal skin, only to learn that you have no more room in your lootsack, and have to stand there in a pause menu cleaning house just to pick up something else.On the goodside, it's still not nearly as time-consuming or demanding as - just for comparison - Skyrim.  Despite numerous plants which you can harvest (for the purpose of making medicine, or other injectible potions such as hunter's awareness, fireproofing, etc) they are actually just organized by color.  It doesn't matter WHICH \"red\" plant you grab - just as long as it's red.  Also, most items are relatively easy to come by, with the only exception perhaps being predatory animal skins.  Actually, it's not that they're hard to come by...  They're just hard to get without being viciously slaughtered in the process...The most phenomenal aspect of FC3 however is it's map.  After several hours of gameplay I assumed I had explored much of the map, and most likely only had a few more strongholds and radio towers to \"liberate\" - which was disappointing because both are pretty fun.  I brought up the map and zoomed out, only to realize that I had only uncovered 1/4th or so of the play area...  Then I realized that the entire map didn't even display when fully zoomed out, and I had in fact barely uncovered 10% of the play area.  I finally had to pull up an online image of the map on my laptop, and was absolutely bewildered at the size of Far Cry 3.This is no 10-hour game, folks.  This title is well worth the $60 admission price.  And for gamers like me who enjoy shooters but not the 12-year-old kids we always get saddled with online, rest assured that there is AMPLE single-player content to enjoy here.  I haven't even registered my online \"code\" yet, and I suspect I never will.Expect some crazy events to take place, expect some simulated hallucinations and some frantic game play, and even expect a laugh or two...  I was lining up the head-shot on a guard some 100 yards away when the tiger suddenly tore into my a$$...  I died, but I had to laugh about it.And expect none of the nuances that made Far Cry 2 \"almost great.\"  This time, they got it just right.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0038TT8QM","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Boeshaar","summary":"So dumbed down your grandmother could play it","reviewText":"I've been playing Civilization since the 1st on DOS, when I had a computer that had no sound card so I had to imagine what it sounded like in my head. Yes that's how oldschool I am in terms of Civ. AND LET ME MAKE CLEAR THAT I HAVE PLAYED WELL OVER +100 HOURS FOR CIVILIZATION 5, I have tried my absolute best to try and love this game but I am sorry to announce that I have FAILED MISERABLY.Okay here are two different reviews:1) YOU HAVE NEVER PLAYED A CIV GAME BEFOREGame is pretty cool, a lot to do and discover in the world of civilization. Graphics are somewhat up to date and it's a fun learning experience. Not the best strategy game you've ever played most likely, but a solid outing nonetheless.GRADE: B-2) YOU HAVE PLAYED OTHER CIVS AND ARE POSSIBLY A CIV FANATIC LIKE MYSELFIf you've played any other Civilization game to date, you will almost instantly notice that the game has been dumbed down SOOOO much it possibly brings tears to your eyes.- You can no longer manage your economy, taxes, luxuries, culture, religion, research, espionage, or just about anything else. The only things you can manage are your cities and units.- Diplomacy has been dumbed down as well. You can no longer trade techs or maps, and there is very little reason to conduct diplomacy besides trading luxury resources to keep your empire happiness.- MANIFEST DESTINY? THINK AGAIN. Oh how unhappy the happiness in this game will make you. Happiness is not city based anymore, rather it is now on a universal +/- scale for your ENTIRE EMPIRE. On any difficulty above Prince (I usually play on Emperor/Immortal) your happiness cap will SEVERELY LIMIT your ability to expand around the world. You will most likely be stuck to a handful of cities for a long time and you will have to carefully and painfully slowly expand so that your precious happiness doesn't drop.THE RESULT? Somewhere around 40-60% of the world map will be unsettled depending on your map type. ON IMMORTAL DIFFICULTY, EVEN THE AI WHO IS CHEATING THROUGH HIS NOSE STRUGGLES TO EXPAND ACROSS THE MAP.- WANT TO MAKE A BUSTLING DEMOCRACY THEN SWITCH TO FASCISM LATER IN THE INDUSTRIAL AGE? I THINK NOT BISMARCK. Once you pick your Civics you're stuck with them until the end of time... literally. And it's not like civics are easy to get, late game with large empires it takes 100s of turns to get enough culture.- Single Unit tiles is good and bad depending on your perspective. Ultimately though, it makes it very difficult to position your 8 units every single time you want to move across the map and makes invading other empires/cities more of a chore than fun.- A LOT OF FUN.... for until you're in the middle ages. Then the game drags and drags and dragssssssssssss like no tomorrow. WITH SO MUCH OF THE MICROMANAGEMENT STRIPPED FROM THE GAME, there is almost nothing to do besides choose what buildings to make in your cities. If you're not constantly declaring war on your neighbors then expect to spend most of your turns STARING AT YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN HOPING SOMETHING INTERESTING HAPPENS. USUALLY DOESN'T UNLESS YOUR HOUSE CATCHES FIRE.- WANT A CULTURE VICTORY? TOO BAD GANDHI, THAT 4TH CITY IS GONNA COST YA... the game. Different victory types in Civilization have almost always been choose what you want to do early/mid way through the game and stick with it. But with this civilization, you damn better well have a strategy set if you want to win. This makes the game oh so much more boring that it was before.- Despite it being the year 2011 now, the AI of Civilization is still almost as woefully bad as it was in CIVILIZATION I ON DOS. The AI is AMAZINGLY STUPID, and all ramping up the difficulty does is MAKE THEM CHEAT LIKE NO TOMORROW. AIs will outresearch you, make far larger armies in less time, build wonders in half the time you do, and YOU WILL STILL ALMOST ALWAYS STOMP THEM. A travesty for modern gaming. Don't even get me started about diplomacy, the majority of the AI leaders are schizophrenic on their best days when taking their medication.GRADE: D-I'm sorry but this ISN'T CIVLIZATION. Empire Total War has far more depth than this current outing and that REALLY PAINS ME TO SAY THIS because I've always far preferred Civilization to the Total War series. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE THINKING WITH THIS GAME, it's more suited to be played with on an arcade stick much less on a PC.WILL EXPANSIONS SAVE THIS DISASTER OF A GAME? It could, but it's going to need something absolutely BRILLIANT, and judging by how bad this game is I have my doubts. Fingers crossed though....BOTTOM LINE: I REALLY DON'T RECOMMEND THIS GAME IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORMSINCERELY: AMAZINGLY DISAPPOINTED LONG TIME CIV FANATIC :(","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2011"}
{"product_name":"B004NRN5EO","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"ickytips","summary":"An Acquired Taste...","reviewText":"I'll tell you what: when I first played this game, I thought it was a joke; I played for approximately sixty minutes and then gave up after I kept getting killed by the Asylum Demon at the very start of the game. I just didn't think it was at all fun, and thought it to be too hard. Plus, I'm not a huge RPG fan, so that was another turn off.Several months went by, and I played through myriad other PS3 titles, and had run out of games to play. As I was sifting through my collection of games to find something fresh to play, I came across Dark Souls. I thought to myself, \"Ah, what the hell... I'll give it another try.\" And, that I did.Now, over 150 hours into the game, I AM HOOKED. I can't stop playing this game. Normally, prior to Dark Souls, I'd sit down and play videogames for three or four hours per day; now, I sit down and play ten to twelve hours per day, without so much as getting up to use the restroom (even if I have to do so).I can only say that Dark Souls is THE most fascinatingly captivating game I've EVER played (and I've played a lot of games). Not only is it fun, it's extremely challenging (beyond challenging, actually), thought provoking, awe inspiring, frustrating (in a good way), and, in many instances, extremely frightening.I recommend this game to ANYONE, but especially those who like to become fully immersed in their gaming experience. This isn't just a game where you go from start to finish in a linear fashion; this is a universe of its own, with vast landscapes and beautifully crafted worlds and characters and weapons and spells and dialogue and narrative. You could play through this game a thousand times and never have the same experience. Things are constantly evolving, and with such multi-faceted quest-lines, the number of different character builds and tools available to each player, the replay value is HUGE.I really recommend that you visit the Wiki and follow a walkthrough so that you can get the most out of each level; it'll make things a lot less frustrating also. I mean, you'll still die regardless, walkthrough or no walkthrough, and you'll die a lot, but at least you'll know what to expect (kinda).If I could, I'd rate this game 10 out of 5 stars.Absolutely love it. But it's not really something for the \"passive,\" or \"average\" gamer. You've really got to devote yourself, your time and your energy to this game.Enjoy!********UPDATE********I wanted to check back in now that I've logged nearly 300 hours of time in this game, and am halfway through NG++ (third playthrough).Not only have I NOT become bored with the game, but, rather, the opposite has occurred; I've become more intrigued and even more immersed in the game than I was prior. Not many games can do that (except, of course, for the one-and-only \"Metal Gear Solid: Guns of the Patriots\").If someone like myself, who lacked a penchant for role-playing games, could become this involved in, and fall in love with, a role-playing game such as Dark Souls, then think of the possibilities for those of you who eat, sleep and breathe RPG.I simply CANNOT wait for the follow-up to Dark Souls. I also have Dark Souls to thank for reintroducing me to a genre of gaming that I thought I'd lost any and all interest in; this game has rekindled my interest and love for RPG/Fantasy titles, and I'm glad to be able to expand my horizons instead of having nothing to look forward to except another FPS.But, I digress... My main point is that this game is epic and beyond standard definition; terms such as \"fun\" and \"amazing\" don't come close to grasping this game's potential, its playability and its addictiveness. This is the first game I've achieved Platinum trophy status; no other game gave me a reason to try and achieve Platinum status (except, again, \"MGS: GotP,\" however, trophies weren't present in said game; had they been, I'd have done everything possible to obtain each and every one).So please... BUY IT, PLAY IT, BEAT IT... Then, start all over.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0000DJX7I","description":"Praised for brilliant scripts and open-ended gameplay, vilified for unapologetic violence and mature themes,Grand Theft Autohas deservedly become one of the most popular game franchises in history. This double pack contains the full versions of bothGrand Theft Auto IIIandGrand Theft Auto III: Vice City, enhanced for Xbox. Xbox gamers can rejoice that the grand king of video games--The Sopranoswith a gamepad--is finally available on the big black box.Grand Theft AutoWithGrand Theft Auto IIIRockstar proves that not all developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games. This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking more structure can embark on dozens of missions driven by a genuinely interesting crime-story plot or steal cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and you can go on vigilante missions. Grab a cab and you can play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi. Take a fire truck and you can earn money putting out fires. The minigames are a good way to unwind after a particularly difficult mission. With so much to do, the game just never gets boring.As you'd expect, there are consequences for criminality. As your random acts of mayhem mount up the police start hounding you, eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic, pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing. Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerGrand Theft Auto III: Vice CityHow big is this game? Even publicists for other games end up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto IIInever dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action. InVice Citythis is--to use a clich&#xE9; that is for once apropos--taken to a whole new level.--David StoeszPros:Open-ended gameplay; player can chose to be relatively law-abiding or engage in wanton virtual destructionVaried missionsBrilliant scripts with Hollywood voice actingRocking sound track (also available in our Music store)Xbox-enhanced graphicsCons:As theThe Sopranosof games,GTA 3draws unwanted attention from overzealous legislatorsNo multiplayer","reviewerName":"Dubyac99 \"Dubyac99\"","summary":"How can you not give it 5 stars?","reviewText":"What a fantastic package this set is!  Great gameplay, great storylines, great missions, and great just about everything else.This is beginning to become the videogame version of a blockbuster hit.  When you hear the name \"Grand Theft Auto\" you know it will be great!  And while the franchise has moved to many different systems (GBA, PSP, and could DS be too far off in the distance?) it really is strongest on its original console system.  And while this franchise originated on the Playstation system, that system's prior topdown view seems almost antiquated, when compared to the GTA III 3D style of gameplay.And it is this system that ever successful version has been put out on.  Most of us prefer the 3D mode.  I personally hated the top down mode version of the original Playstation and Dreamcast versions, in GTA 1 and 2.Graphics are tremendous, and gameplay action and mission stories are wonderful.  I love how they use famous actors and actresses to voice the characters, giving it that life-like feel.  And at the same time giving \"has-been\" actors such as Phillip Michael Thomas (of Miami Vice fame) some work. (He voices Lance Vance in the Miami Vice game.)  Seeing how his old singing career didn't exactly take off.I really can't see how anyone could give this less than 3 stars.  If you are against videogame violence, or really don't like the open and free style gameplay of this genre, than steer clear.  All others, help take a bite out of crime, and gobble this one up!

{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Michigoon \"tech geek\"","summary":"This generation's Daikatana? Worse- Daikatana wasn't a sequel.","reviewText":"Let me preface this review by stating that I'm sure the the first and second Mass Effect games would be in my list of the Top 100 Games of All-Time, and probably nearer to the top. Mass Effect 1 was an incredible blend of old-school sci-fi noir and modern gameplay mechanics. Mass Effect 2 was a darker spin on that universe with a \"Dirty Dozen\" vibe of team-building. Mass Effect 3 is, for someone who enjoyed the first two games, a slap in the face. I will try to avoid spoilers for ME3 as much as possible, with minor spoilers for ME1 and ME2.What went wrong?-Not My Character. The entire point of this trilogy is that a player could create a custom character in the first game, and their decisions can be imported across both sequels so that everything in the third game is customized based on past decisions across both prequels. Sounds great, right? Well, Bioware admitted they didn't actually have anyone test this for the third game, and it turns out if you imported the same character from ME1 to ME2 and want to cross over to ME3, your save file is unreadable and you will be forced to play a default character instead. Bioware claim they're looking at implementing a fix now that they've been told about this, but launching the game without this feature is inexcusable. (Technical note: Your save data will only work if you made changes to your character's face during the import from ME1 to ME2, but this was not stated at the time, and why would you do that if you bothered to import your character in the first place?)-Not My Decisions. Again, a major marketing point of the trilogy was the ability for your decisions to have impact across all three games. In the end however, you will be given a choice between three mostly prefabricated endings, and the biggest difference between those is a color change. Red, Blue, or Green. That's all your decision-making across three games has mattered, swapping some colors. Throughout Mass Effect 3 (and, to a lesser extent, ME2) your decisions don't really have major effects anyway. Let a character die, and they'll be replaced in the next game by a similarly-named character with nearly identical looks and dialog. Or worse, you just won't be presented with a certain quest option, and thus have no clue at all what you missed. There really aren't any penalties for any decisions you have made or will make, and the fate of the galaxy depends more on playing multiplayer than anything else you do.-Not My Ending. Okay, I'll admit, I wanted a happy ending to the series. But I had good reason to hope for this. The entire point of ME1 and ME2 is that Shepard is the lone hero, the only force in the galaxy that can overcome insurmountable odds to win the day and save the galaxy. Shepard literally returned from the dead during the second game, yet during the third we are presented with a true no-win situation. Not to spoil any specifics, but all three endings involve crushing defeat. You as a player have control over neither of these story options (Shepard's death in 2 and all endings in 3 are almost entirely pre-scripted). So which is it Bioware- is Shepard an unstoppable juggernaut of hope, or the tragically fated hero? You can't have both.-Not My Galactic Readiness- Or is it EMS? Supposedly in ME3, the fate of the galaxy depends on the galactic readiness, which measures all the assets you've prepared to fight the bad guys. Only there are actually two statistics, and you're not really told which is which, so you might look at the wrong one for most of the game (You actually want Effective Military Strength, because Galactic Readiness only boosts EMS, even though Galactic Readiness seems like the important-sounding one). It also turns out Galactic Readiness can only be improved by playing multiplayer or the iOS app for mobile devices, while EMS can only be improved in singleplayer- which you probably won't pick up in-game. So you cannot change Galactic Readiness at all in the singleplayer game, and this doesn't seem to be stated clearly in the game itself. And although Bioware promise there's enough stuff in singleplayer to boost EMS to the necessary levels, most people report getting one of the \"bad\" endings despite completing what they thought was 100% of the game. Got that? I didn't. It's a mess.There are a lot of other reasons to hate ME3. Savvy internet folk have noticed that major elements of ME3 have been ripped off of internet resources, including major aspects of the game being based off of years-old stock photographs that the developers spruced up in Photoshop. Publishers Electronic Arts are still trying to bilk people's wallets by selling Cerberus Network passes to people who don't buy the game new, which also requires signing up for EA services just to unlock the features. There's been heavy hinting that the lackluster ending of ME3 will be patched up in future Downloadable Content- which you can bet you'll have to pay for (especially if you don't want to pony up for Cerberus Network by handing your personal information to EA). The forces that be stopped so low as to charge money for new character clothing in the last game, and you can bet they'll bring that back for this game.In the end, there are a few moments in this game that are absolutely praiseworthy (Mordin's storyline in particular is brought to an incredible climax), but it's just not worth it. If you played ME1 and ME2 with the hopes of seeing your same character in the third game, odds are you literally can't do that unless the game has been patched in the meantime, so just go with the story you made up in your head and be happy with it. Don't let Bioware and EA ruin the good memories you forged in the first two games.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0001ADAME","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution. With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well. As if the technical edge wasn't enough of a reason to invest in the Xbox version, it's also Live Aware, and comes packaged with an exclusive multiplayer level (the Coliseum). Without the slightest hint of doubt, the Xbox version gets The Edge.Concept:Clean up the west as a merciless cowboy in this heavily influenced spaghetti western gameGraphics:The character models are not the most detailed, but the environments look nice and I love the cameraworkSound:A remarkable soundtrack lures players into the vibe of the westPlayability:Unnaturally short levels and satisfactory run and gun actionEntertainment:The stages should have been longer, but replay is abundant in the number of unlockables and enjoyableReplay:ModerateRated:8 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:Buck up, cowpokes. All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"SideshowBob","summary":"Draw!!!","reviewText":"Red Dead Revolver is an awesome spaghetti-western type of game,that never really got the love that it deserved.Sure,it's not as good as Red Dead Redemption is,but it still has a great story,exciting gameplay and an awesome soundtrack to go along with it.The graphics are not the best,but hey...graphics don't make a great video game.I personally thought that Red Harlow was a cooler character than John Marston..but that's just my personal opinion.Overall,if you love Rockstar games and/or western games,then you will love this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2014"}

Then came the mediocre reviews from critics and players so I paid it no mind. Then I played the demo at a local Gamestop and quickly my opinion changed so I decided why not and bought the game.I can determine very easily that a lot of the reviews that are trashing the game are mostly likely because of the first two chapters which more or less are your training period to get acclimated with the game play mechanics. Then you get to the 3rd chapter and the game really starts to open up and from there it's just amazing!This is what a good game is, challenging but easy to understand the controls. It's what made classics of games like Super Mario Bros, Crash Bandicoot, Megaman. This game is a stellar platformer and instant classic in it's own right. Designed by the same guy who designed Crash Bandicoot which was the Playstations answer to Nintendos Super Mario so no surprise why it works so well.Again hitting a homerun Knack knocks it out of the park creating the sweaty palms missing from most games now, and offering just enough challenge that you don't want to throw the controller but feel compelled to keep going to see what lays ahead. This is old school platforming at it's finest.As far as if this is next gen graphically or not, that's the other area where this game shines and it's very clever in how it does so because at first glance you may be wondering &#34;where are those next gen graphics?&#34;. After you have played Knack for a few chapters switch over to a PS3 game and it will become clear where the next gen fits in with Knack. Incredible smooth frame rate and fine details with an explosive color palette, especially on Knack himself when he's at full power. The level of detail happening on the screen would not be possible on the PS3 and look that good and smooth. Knack is a great showcase of what's to come.The campaign is no slouch either, over 10 hours of gameplay on first run with a fantastic replay value if you want to go back and find every secret item. Add to that a wonderful co-op and IMO this is the best launch title on the PS4 and one of the best launch titles for a console I've seen and I've been playing video games since 2600.Nice job Sony!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2014"}

I traded my PS3 at my local Gamestop and saw that Knack was on sale for 40 bucks, and being that I had all the other PS4 games I wanted, I figured would take a chance and try the game. Boy am I glad I did. If I could ask all these reviewers one thing it would be this: What exactly were you expecting Knack to be??!! Mark Cerny (the creative director of Knack as well as the PS4's lead architect) said repeatedly in interviews what he and his team were trying to accomplish with Knack. A retro style platformer that hearkens back to PS1 classics such as Crash Bandicoot. That it would rely on a very simple control set, a simple story and pixar like graphics. Knack delivers this all in spades. The gameplay is insanely fun. it's all about learning different enemies moves and timing things right. It's got great platforming sections and really cool environments. If all you want to play are bloody FPS shooters ( I enjoy those too btw) then you will not like Knack. However I strongly recommend you do not dismiss Knack as just some kiddy game that got bad reviews, If you played Spyro, or Crash, or you like games like Rayman, you will enjoy Knack.

{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"gimli1357","summary":"Halo 4, Halo Excellence","reviewText":"To start off, I've been a huge fan of the Halo series since Halo: Combat Evolved. And I must say that Halo 4 takes everything far beyond what I expected.********Campaign (NO spoilers)********To start don't worry I'm NOT going to spoil a single thing from the campaign. I have been waiting to write a review until I finished the campaign, and have just done so. I must say that before getting Halo 4 I was very skeptical because of how much seemed to have changed from previous Halos. However, immediately into the game it feels just like Halo. Greatly improved yes, but you definitely feel like your playing a Halo game. In my opinion, more so than even Halo: Reach. There were parts of the campaign where I started to feel nostalgia of Halo 3 (Partially due to the fact that many of Halo 3's weapons return, but also because gameplay feels similar even with armor abilities). And there was so much mystery and serious suspense throughout the whole game that really could draw me into the story. I love every Halo game ever made (Halo Wars included), though the story for most of them seemed rather obvious where you could guess the beginning from half way through. In Halo 4 it was not until the last 15 minutes of the last mission where I realized where this was going, and even then I could not tell it's direct route it was going to take. I would 100%, hands down, say that Halo 4's campaign is my absolute favorite of all of the Halo games to date. (told you there were no spoilers)***********War Games (Multiplayer)***********A quick note I would like to make is that you are REQUIRED to install disk 2, about 3 gigabytes, to play the multiplayer. Once it is installed you play every part of the game on disk 1 and never have to touch disk 2 again. Now the multiplayer is so large and customization heavy that I won't go in to every detail, just highlight my personal favorites. There is actually kind of story to the multiplayer now in the fact that it is a set of \"War Games\" for Spartan training on UNSC Infinity. I though it was kind of interesting of 343 to try and give a reason to the multiplayer other than just kill each other for no reason. The new armor system is kind of a mix of Halo 3's and Halo: Reach's. You must rank up higher levels to get new armor and load out options. Load Out options must then be bought with \"Spartan Points\". Emblems now also require ranking up to unlock different ones. The multiplayer is very balanced and very fun to play. Without writing a twenty page essay on all the details of the multiplayer, it is truly amazing.*****Forge*****Forge quickly became one of my favorite modes in Halo 3, when it was first introduced. Halo 4 does not fail to improve upon everything. It is so much quicker and simpler to make an amazing map with the new features. My top three of the new features would be: Dynamic lighting, Duplicate, Magnets.Dynamic Lighting is part of the new engine that now make forged objects cast and receive shadows from everything else. Instead of having the whole side of an object with the same shading, the shadows are rendered dynamically. Duplicate allows you to simply press DOWN on the D-pad to make an exact copy of an object with the same settings as the original. If you want to make a large bridge colored green, for example, you could make one bridge piece turn it green and duplicate the whole way down to make all the pieces match. Magnets allow forged objects to stick to each other at certain points. Going back to the bridge example, you would have to use coordinates or a lot of time to get the pieces of the bridge perfectly aligned, the magnets would make the ends of the bridge pieces stick together. There are a lot of other things that are improved in Halo 4's forge, but I don't want this review to be too long.So to wrap this up; I would most definitely encourage you to get Halo 4. If your worrying that maybe 343 Industries screwed up the Halo universe, don't because they didn't.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2012"}

I love the way Batman and WB changed the way characters fight in many games.  Spiderman and Sleeping Dogs are two of the games I played recently that use the same fight mechanics as Batman and I loved those games.  This game is bogged down by ineffectual combos and poor dodging ability.  The story is fun but that is about it.  The gameplay is really unfulfilling and I found the length of the game is way below average.  Each area only takes about an hour and a half to beat which means that the game has a max playthrough time of twelve hours.  I've gotten more out of 1200 point games on Live Arcade.  The music and story are the only reason I gave this three stars.  I actually think it deserves 2.5 stars but that is not an option and 2 stars is too low.  If you can get together with a couple of friends and all chip in together on this you will be much better off.  Buying new has no bonus over used either.  The game comes with a disc only so used or new doesn't matter you get exactly the same content.  Be wary of this game, it is a fun diversion but nothing more.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2012"}

It had it's fun in Arcades with such games like Gauntlet.  It was popular in the Nintendo world with Ikari Warriors and other hack and slash games as well.  Socom is probably the best multiplayer cooperative, but requires online play, and really isn't fun when two players are in the same room.  Games such as Desert Conflict 2 could have been perfect if they got the level design and save points correctly, but the genre never reached that pivotal point until now.Granted it's not perfect, but it sure is fun and mesmerizing while it lasts.  First off, the atmosphere is amazing.  It really feels like you're in the jungle with all these enemies in camouflage attacking you.  There is a bit of strategy involved as you have to discuss who goes where and who gets health.  The game only ends when both players die, so sometimes you have stay back to let the other one take the hits.  Really fun.  Most levels require trekking through a jungle, fighting enemies, and completing objectives.  The graphics and scenery are not only fitting, but play well with the level design perfectly.Yes, there is also a single person  mode, but from what I hear, it's nothing compared to Medal of Honor: Frontline.Here's the bad though: The gun controls (I use a standard PS2 controller), are jerky, and the player's movements are a bit too slow.  The first level consists of you walking up a ship and then firing lots of gun fire from stationary guns.  While the atmosphere is beyond impressive, it gets old after a while.  There are about 5-6 missions total, and unfortunately, a friend and I finished it just 5 hours on the normal setting.There is also online play, which is somewhat cool in that exists.  The online play, however, only consists or Quake like deathmatch and team deathmatches.  No cooperative level game play like Socom.  Unfortunately, the people who do play are not that fun to talk to, and are quite the First Person Shooter Nerds who will kill you as soon as you turn a corner.  It really only works when you can get enough people for a private room.All in all, it's a great game with great atmosphere, but way too short.Pros:Great atmosphereSuperb two player cooperative modeAt least has some type of online playLevels are intuitiveCons:Way Too shortFirst two missions are pointlessSave points have to be found, cannot save anywhereJerky gun controlsOnline play is boring, ruined by FPS nerdsHours to Complete (Cooperative): 5 hours (normal setting)Difficulty Level: EasyFrustration Level: Non-existent","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2004"}

It'll definitely be one of those you'll pick up to kill 30 minutes, then realize the sun is coming over the horizon. Very few things detract from quality, excepting if you buy the Xbox version, which has a lot of meat cut out of it, and is very fun. The only problem is the storyline has little in the way of originality, and while being retconned well, should've been more about the protagonist rather than follow the plot of The Godfather almost part for part.Graphics: 8/10: Definitions are good, and the buildings, vehicles, and characters are well rendered. The fires are a little fake, but not obviously so. The character creation screen has great versatility, allowing for very good likenesses of whomever you wish, within reason.Sound: 10/10: Voice acting is stupendous. Until I read otherwise, I'd thought Marlon Brando had done the voice acting for Vito, which he had, but was later replaced. Other character voices are easily recognized and spot on. The background music is well done, and the sound effects during combat are realistic.Gameplay: 7/10: Some slight stumbles don't interrupt an otherwise smooth and almost intuitive fighting system. Hand-to-hand tries to emulate Fight Night, a lofty goal, but partially succeeds. Ranged combat is automated but still requires skill to make difficult shots. Relying on the computer is a sure path to defeat. Skill advancement is progressive and challenging without being overly hard to understand. The side missions and storyline missions are put together well, as each is a mini-tutorial for a particular skill set, rather than one monstrous training mission.Story: 3/10: See above. While being the Don's right hand man is fun in its own right, I'd have liked to have had a more original storyline to follow, interacting with the Godfather story rather than being hammered into it.Overall: 8/10. A solid piece, with great replay value. Something you can pick up and play over and over for the missions and sidequests. Just don't get the regular Xbox version, which was gutted like a fish.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2007"}

I only saw posters at Blockbuster so I walked in and I looked at the game case and wondered what it was about.  How the game-play is and weapons.  So I rented the game and started on the hardest setting since I enjoy the challenge and I loved the game from start to finish.  My one week rental turned into 2 weeks and about 28 hours of game-play before I had to turn it in.  Yea it was late but I could not stop playing.  My wife is upset due to the late charges but I don't care and now with the price drops, it seems worth it to buy for my daughter to play it and me to finish up the last 10 achievements.The game play is awesome and it did remind me of Zelda but I never played God of War.  Every dungeon you unlock a new weapon that you can use and along the way you can purchase upgrades and extra combo moves.  The gun is weak but fun to shoot while on my horse.  Demon mode rocks but a little slow to swing my sword.

It seems that they make these games harder and harder than they should be and Code Veronica is no exception.  It's not the simplistic puzzles that make the game difficult, rather, it's the lack of ammo and healing items that make what what should be easy battles far more difficult than they should be.Why do some zombies take more bullets than others?  Why do zombies respawn in some areas?  What's up with all the backtracking in this game?  You're still forced to use the stupid typewriter ribbons to SAVE?  These are some of the questions you'll ask yourself when you play the Code Veronica.  Has the series evolved?  If you get past the improved graphics, the answer is NO.  The control is just as sloppy as it was in RE1, albeit with a quick turnaround feature and a new two-handed gun mode (you burn through bullets faster this way).  A great deal of prior planning and trial and error is required, which may have been good back when the series was young, but it has simply gotten to be tedious today.Even the soundtrack is pretty forgettable!  The game has a rather cartoonish look to it...could have looked more realistic but then again, the Dreamcast isn't exactly a graphics powerhouse.  My suggestion...don't buy it.  Granted, I've owned this game for quite some time and those who are new to DC may have heard great things about CV, but trust me, this is a BORING game!

Daneker","summary":"An improvement over Prime, but I want to see Samus again!!!","reviewText":"First, what don't I like:I can't tell you how much I hate first person shooter. First of all, did you notice the aspect of the game, really, Samus is about 3 feet tall. I feel like I'm walking on my knees, everything is at ground level and it drives me nuts. Next, I love morphing into a ball because it's the only time I can actually see what's going on! Remember about 20 years ago race car games in arcades started to give you the option of four or five aspects, everything from the windshield view, to just the front of the car to then entire vehicle. Why? Why? Can't they do that with metroid???I also miss the jumping! Samus is supposed to jump high and use the screw attack, this Samus barely gets off the ground, it's like a fat-person playing hopscotch. You jump slow, you come down hard (CLANK!!!) so your three-feet tall, you weigh a thousand pounds and you're saving the planet from some threat that might possibly come someday....Now, what did I like:Huge improvement in control over first Metroid Prime. Firing is more accurate and movement is cleaner, jumping is much more forgiving and not so tedious. I like the graphics, but some contrast would have been nice, each area seems to be all shades of  one color and that's kind of boring. Some real 5.1 sound would be good, but the dolby digital is impressive (try a high-def tv and 5.1 system with bass up in a dark room if you want full effect.) This game is not a mind numbingly hard as the first. I can actually fight enemies in this one without screaming. I do hate that you die and have to do entire areas over and over just to get back to the boss enemy. Also, we are still on cons here, I don't like the \"let you open a few doors at a time\" crap. If these idiot aliens want me to save the freaking universe then they should give me the keys to all the damned doors strait away.This game is very, very liner compared to Prime 1, a pro that it's less frustrating, a con in that you are limited to completing each task as they come.Oddly enough I still really enjoy it, it has more of a feel like the original and GBA games (play the GBA games, they are much more fun!) and the emersion into the alien world feels complete, if limited.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2006"}

Xbox One is also a great media hub being integrated into my media center, controlling the TV and my set top box. While, it has great media integration, it is not without its quirks and bugs. After owning the Xbox for little over a month, the HDMI memory gets &#34;clogged&#34; up and the images coming from my Set top box to the TV hang and are non-responsive. After searching various forums for the issues, I noticed it was a common occurrence and what helped me was unplugging the Xbox and plugging it back in, essentially, &#34;wiping&#34; its cache and starting fresh and that works. Hopefully M$ will come out with a permanent solution in its March 2014 and/or subsequent updates. I should note that I own a PS3 and it dominated my gaming arena until the current gen arrived. It is still early in the game and while the Xbox One has nice interface and media integration at the end of the day, it comes down to games. Since it is still early into the generation - we will see who comes out on top once more games come out later this year and beyond.

For example, Mario's archrival, Wario he's looking good on the Game Boy Advance, but he's still the same money-crazed hooligan who starred in some of the greatest handheld platformers of all time. This time around, the story of a golden pyramid is enough to send the big blowhard racing off to the nearest jungle. Sure enough he finds the big brick triangle, but before he can collect the loot he'll have to undergo a brain- and body-bending series of challenges. Four guardians stand jealously over the four sections of the pyramid. Wario will either have to defeat each guardian or activate a switch and escape before time runs out.

Wario will have to undergo even more dramatic transformations before the big showdown with the head honcho of the golden pyramid.","reviewerName":"Jeff Johnson \"Jeff Johnson\"","summary":"A whole new M(W)arior World, more like a puzzle challenge","reviewText":"This game is amazing, especially to me, because I did not like Wario Land and the Mario games have been done to death. Wario, who is a bigger bullying version of Mario offers a whole new game to play. Rather than Mario who jumps on enemies, leaps to punch blocks above him and collects mushrooms and fire flowers to power-up; Wario uses the direct method, ramming straight through enemies, blocks and collects hearts for energy. You can even pick up enemies to throw them. So what makes this game different than a Mario game? Because a Mario game was simple, where you go right and find the end of a level. With Wario's land, each level is a miniature maze, where you enter a level through a portal where you must then find four pieces of a stone, which are scattered in the level, then you must find the key. They key is unique, because they key is a bird who's beak is the key and it actually flies behind you and bigger enemies can steal the key and hold it hostage. You can leave the level, but the key is needed to get to the next level. To top it all off, you can't just finish a level, you must find and activate a bomb! The bomb then sets a timer at the top of the screen for you to exit the level by. Each level is very detailed and the graphics are completely different, such as a Desert, a Haunted House, a Lake, a Raining Swamp, Paradise, and a Sunflower Field to name a few. To make sure you don't get bored, there are coins, jewels and gold to collect, in which with all of this cash, you can pay to play mini games, like Roulette, Homerun Derby and Wario Hop.

I started playing the series when Modern Warfare 2 came out and was hooked. I really like MW2, Black Ops 1 and Modern Warfare 3, so I had high hopes for Black Ops 2. Like many other people, I skipped playing the campaign and went straight to multi-player.~The good (what little there is):~The new points system for kill-streaks is interesting. It's not just about how many people you can kill anymore. You're rewarded with points for kills your teammates get while your UAV is in the air, points for capturing flags, etc. So there's ways to get points towards your kill streaks that don't involve camping somewhere in the back and picking people off without making any effort towards the games objective.Customizing your classes now lets you tweak things you couldn't before. You can drop items like secondary weapons or something similar and pick up an additional item/perk instead.A few of the old favorites have been revived. The crossbow and the dogs (K9 Unit) are back again. However the ballistic arrow might as well just be a plain arrow, since unless it's stuck into an enemies body, it doesn't do hardly any damage to them, even if it blows up right right beside them.~The not-so-good:~Just about everything else.Maps are small, especially when playing Ground War. This adds to the feeling of a messed up spawn system. Having some small maps are fun, but not every single one of them.It seems like you can get 5 hit-markers on a guy and he can take you down with a sneeze.The game just doesn't look or feel like Call of Duty any more.

The internet bandwagon haters went into a tizzy screaming \"downgrade\" like a bunch of children, going off on incessant temper tantrums, causing us sane gamers to just sigh at their behavior.Anyways, were they right? In one word: No. In two words: Heck no.Now with that said, it's certainly true that the graphics do not look as good as the 2012 E3 debut, but it's also true that Ubisoft said that that version was an unfinished build running on PC hardware, so they weren't lying to anyone, and I'm certainly not an Ubisoft apologist seeing as how I find most of their games disappointing. But even then, while it doesn't look that good, it still looks pretty great most of the time, especially at night. It's true that daytime is less impressive, but it still looks rather good overall. I would recommend turning down the brightness a good bit in-game for the best results.As for the game itself, I'm surprised how much I'm enjoying it since like I said earlier, I'm not a huge fan of many Ubisoft games, so I entered this game with a healthy dose of skepticism. That said, I was blown away by what I experienced. First mission starts, it's stealth, and not only is the stealth really fun, the mood and setting totally sell the mission and opening of the game. Once you get out, you're introduced to the open world that Watch Dogs offers, and it's quite beautiful the first time you see it. Both the driving and gun combat are incredibly solid, but I'm more of a stealth guy when it comes to games, and Watch Dogs has delivered on that front. There's also a lot to see and do in the world, including hacking conversations, into bank accounts, seeing personal information of civilians, tons of side content, etc. It just offers so much.I must say that I'm also really enjoying the soundtrack. It has a lot more recent music recorded after 2000 like Spitalfield and Alkaline Trio, to name a few.In addition to all of the single player offerings, Watch Dogs has a very fun online component, and it's an absolute hoot. Granted, I haven't played all that much of it yet, but what I have played I have thoroughly enjoyed.It's a shame that the \"downgrade\" in graphics has caused too many to rage on internet forums, on Amazon, on Metacritic, etc., and trying to tarnish the hard work of the people who dedicated years of their lives to create this game.

The story goes that after the revival of Wonderland, Alice fell on hard times and has ended up as an orphan under the guidance of a therapist/hypnotist mentor.  As Alice slips into Wonderland the story unfolds as the truth begins to slowly reveal itself.  While the first adventure was twisted, this time around the store tells a much darker, more mature tale.What makes Alice so stunning and fun is its art direction and source material.  As was the case the first time around, American McGee and his team have crafted a truly beautiful, terrifying, and satisfying Wonderland to explore.  Alice is now able to peer into the depths of Wonderland's oceans, climb to it's highest peak, and revisit the now ruined Queensland.  The inclusion of gameplay in Alice's \"real life\" was a surprising addition that added a great element to the game.  In the real world, Alice's look and feel are much more mundane which plays as an excellent foil to her Wonderland adventures.  With the added power of the Xbox (and current \"next-gen\" systems) McGee is able to fully realize the insanity that creeps inside of Alice.  The cut-scenes are done with exquisite 2-D \"cut-outs\" with the music (much like the original) adding the right amount of tension and drama to the game.  The voice acting is also wonderfully done and top notch.  The dialogue is sharp (witty and completely in character) and delivered with aplomb by the actors.  The story, as mentioned, is a bit darker and certainly adds a layer of depth to the story and adventures of Alice.Also added to the mix is Alice's new wardrobe and much more functional weaponry.  As you play through the game, new dressed are unlocked for Alice to wear if you so choose.  While some add to her powers, others may provide a higher level of difficulty if you so desire.  Combined with the added DLC content; added dresses and weapons (more powerful, fantastical versions of her normal arsenal), it's easy to replay the game to catch collectibles you may have missed the first time or just to play around with a new look.One of the game's most glaring faults is, which is something that plagues many games of this genre, the camera.  Taking a page from PC gaming;  the player is able to swirl, twirl, and twist the camera around as needed.  Since the camera relies on the player to adjust it accordingly, this makes quick actions like jumping and attacking somewhat of a challenge (especially in the heat of the moment).  The level design, while beautifully presented, can be very repetitive leading players to easily be frustrated with the recycled elements. And the inclusion of mini-games is fun but, again, very repetitive and irritating at times.In the end, \"Alice:  Madness Returns\" is a wonderfully exciting adventure that is sure to please fans of the original.  Not without its faults, \"Madness Returns\" will hopefully find its audience much like the original adventure did over 10 years ago.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2012"}

I don't even know if it could be considered a great game.  However, it's fun.  The game is full of references to the comics, mainly X-Men making fun of, some movies and even TV shows.  It's crude and rude.  Vulgar and violent.  It's amazing!  My friend was in an Xbox Party with me when I was playing through the first hour or two of the game and just by me laughing so much to the game, he literally went out and bought it as I've never had that reaction to a video game.  There is a decent story, but the focus of this game is just having fun BEING Deadpool.  The way he breaks the fourth wall (talking to you) is something that is welcoming and works well.  I was so worried this game would become childish humor and something that I, almost 30, wouldn't find as funny as someone half my age.  This game isn't for the easily offended.  Some people aren't buying this game because they're not familiar with Deadpool either through comics, prior games or even when Ryan Reynolds played him in an X-Men movie.  You don't need to know about the character.  It sums it up for us in the beginning and you learn as you go.  I think it's a great spotlight on a character who isn't a top billed Marvel character, but one who has potential to be one of the most memorable.

Multiplayer works with a split screen and the refresh rate of the game doesn't cause any lag in play.The adapter for the controller is definitely a necessary thing to feel more realism.  I purchased a 3rd party adapter for the other controller but the controller was not as responsive.An internet challenge is another option, which I have been bold enough to try to invite someone to play with me - with no success.

Max Payne 3 was a lot of fun, It starts off a bit slow and the cut scenes/ shoot/ cut scenes gets a bit tiresome. I'd say around chapter IV the game begins to take shape. The story begins to really come together. The shooting is second to none and \"bullet time\"...what!, that is the best. When your shooting the bad guys you want to see them really suffer and also see the fruits of your labor...lol (like getting paid). I love how the bullets spin in slow motion and hit the bad guys (mostly head shots) gruesome and squrting blood everywhere and looks so foreal.There are XIV chapters in roman numerals...pretty cool and the game is broken down into 3 parts I, II, & III so every V chapters is one part. I also find that acheivements are a little harder to come by. The campaign can be finished in 12 to 14 hours...Once you really get into the story you don't want the game to end. I find it to be rather short for all of the hype and also to be a Rstar title. I would recommend the game to everyone that likes a good solid shooter. I'm not really into multiplayer games so I cannot comment on that part, but I heard that it's pretty solid.I gave this game a 4/5 stars but really 7/10, the bullet time makes this a very solid shooter.

{"product_name":"B00004SVV8","reviewerName":"Robert Kiehn \"TheForthcoming1\"","summary":"An all time classic!","reviewText":"Shigeru Miyamoto created a masterpiece when he createdthe Mario Bros. series and this game is no exception.I first played Mario Bros. 2 during the late 1980's orearly 1990's and it was much better then Mario Bros.,it had better graphics, sound, gameplay and the enemiesand bosses as well as levels were much more interestingand trippy this time around.You could also play as either Mario, Luigi, Peach or Toad.I give this game 5/5 stars and thanks goes to my Mom for buyingthis game for me as well as my NES in the first place!;)Here is an excellent and detailed review which best sums upthis great game which I have edited and left SMB All Stars out.From:[...]There is only one way to describe Super Mario Bros. 2 . . . . And that word is: Odd.As the second game in the series, Mario Bros. 2 does exactly everything that you WOULDN'T expect from a sequel to the first game. It takes the characters in the Mario universe, adds them to a strange and quirky world, and then takes the gameplay of the first game and absolutely tips it on it's head.There are several design changes that factor in to making Super Mario Bros. 2 so different from the first game in the way it plays. First off is the elimination of the timer. Since there is no timer on any of the levels, you are no longer racing to try and finish the game as fast as you can. The second difference is the fact that you can go backwards in a level. In the original game, when the level scrolled, you could no longer go back in that direction (which made sense in Mario 1 because you are always racing to reach the end of the level before the timer runs out and you die, so there is no reason to go back).Thirdly . . . while Super Mario Bros. 1 popularized the aspect of a side-scrolling game, meaning that the screen scrolls to reveal a bigger playfield (instead of being confined to a single-screen as in games like Pac-Man or Galaga) it was still a game that was confined in the sense that you could only go forwards, you were forced to go forwards (even though you scrolled the screen yourself). Super Mario Bros. 2 changed all that by letting the scrolling of the level, either forwards or backwards, be completely up to the player.However the biggest change did not come from the aforementioned improvements, but rather from another improvement . . . one that you didn't really see much of in the first Super Mario Bros. This sequel let the player explore the world in a whole new way . . . a new dimension. And that dimension was vertically. Mario 2 opens up the whole notion of vertical gameplay to the player. Whether it's jumping onto platform after platform that are suspended in the air, or climbing vines or ladders, Super Mario Bros. 2 sends the player vertically just as often as you scroll left or right, which is a dramatic change.The combination of the lack of a timer, the ability to go backwards and the insistence of the levels in pushing you upwards, gives Super Mario Bros. 2 a COMPLETELY different feel as far as level design goes. And that vertical aspect comes into play as soon as you start the game and are immediately dropped from a door in the sky to the ground below you.Believe it or not, these are not the only changes that separate Super Mario Bros. 2 from it's prequel.But I'm getting ahead of myself here. First a look at some history. Although many do not know it, one reason that Super Mario Bros. 2 is so different from all the other games in the series is because it originally was not a Mario game at all! What we know in America as Super Mario Bros. 2 was actually a game that was only released in Japan. This game was developed by Nintendo and called Doki Doki Panic. Actually the full title is Yume Kj: Doki Doki Panikku which translates to Dream Factory: Doki Doki Panic.This quirky NES game was Mario-ized and brought to America and other regions as Super Mario Bros. 2. The Mario version was also later released in Japan as Super Mario USA.The real sequel to Super Mario Bros. was actually a game that was strikingly similar to the first game. Matter of fact it was really just a remixed version. It was much more difficult than the original and allowed you to play single-player as either Mario or Luigi, with both characters having different abilities (Luigi jumped higher but was harder to stop once he took off running). It also added the new Poisonous Mushroom (identified by their purple color) to the equation. If you grabbed a Poisonous Mushroom it'd harm you rather than help you.Nintendo of Japan however had a hard time deciding whether or not to release Super Mario Bros. 2 (Jap) in the US, fearing that it would be too difficult for American players (it was common in the Japanese video game world at that time to underestimate the abilities of American and European players, even though we had no problem with supremely tough games like Metroid or Contra).So they decided to take another game that they thought was easier (which is quite ironic, cause it's definitely not an easy game) and modify the game, making it into a Mario title to release in the US as Super Mario Bros. 2. The game was developed in cooperation with Fuji Television (who licensed the characters for Nintendo to use) to promote their Yume Kj '87 event in Japan, which showcased several of Fuji TV's latest TV shows and other products at the time. Doki Doki Panic featured the mascots of the Yume Kj festival (an Arabian family consisting of siblings Imajin and Lina and their parents, Papa and Mama) as its main characters and the rest of the characters, including the main villain, Mamu (Renamed Wart for the modified American version), were all original creations by Nintendo for the game.Doki Doki Panic takes place within a book with this Arabian or Indian setting (which explains the desert landscapes and Arabian-style sounding music) where all four characters are sucked into it's world. They are all playable as well, and the game is not completed until the player plays through the game as all four of them, unlike in the American remake.For the modified US version of Doki Doki Panic, Mario corresponds to the Imajin character, Princess Toadstool (or Peach as she's known now) corresponds to Lina, Luigi corresponds to Mama and the stout Papa corresponds to Toad.So Nintendo did all this modifying (leaving most of the game exactly the same, including the enemies and bosses and most of the music and sound effects) thinking that no American player would know the difference. And they were right. Unless you worked in the video game industry or for gaming publications and were in the know, then you'd never realize that what you were playing was not a \"true\" Mario game.Super Mario Bros. 2 (US) was widely accepted by the people that played it despite it's oddball flavor, and it become so popular and infamous for it's uniqueness that it actually became considered by Nintendo as the real Super Mario Bros. 2 and took it's place alongside the other core games in the Mario saga (Super Mario Bros. 1, 2, and 3, Super Mario World, Super Mario 64, etc.).And the elements of Super Mario Bros. 2 (US) that weren't originally Mario but Doki, such as the enemies like Bob-Ombs, Birdo and Shy Guy`s (who were unchanged from their Doki Doki Panic origins), actually became part of the Mario universe.Nowadays Birdo has developed more into a full-fledged Mario mascot character and taken his place alongside Yoshi; as is evidenced by her appearance as a Yoshi team-up character in Mario Kart: Double Dash on GameCube and in some Mario sports titles.Had Nintendo never converted Doki Doki Panic into a Mario game and released it as such in the US, then many of the beloved characters that people now love would never have existed. And that would definitely be a shame.So I for one am glad that we got this Nintendo game instead of the \"real\" Super Mario Bros. 2 [Jap] since it is much more unique and original than what we would have gotten, and the new enemies that came along for the ride ended up being great additions to the Mario family (The Japanese Super Mario Bros. 2 btw would later hit America for the Super Nintendo as part of the Super Mario All-Stars compilation, in which it was included as Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels)So . . . now getting back to the differences in gameplay between Super Mario Bros. 1 and this Super Mario Bros. 2 (US). Whereas the main form of attack in the original game is jumping on the heads of the various enemies, this game changed all that by allowing every enemy in the game (virtually) to be picked up and thrown. Matter of fact, there are no enemies in the game that can be destroyed by jumping on their heads! Your form of attack is now exclusively picking up and throwing. And it's not just enemies that you can pick up and throw at other enemies, but lots of other things as well. For example, the game is also littered with . . . . VEGETABLES! Veggies can be pulled out of the ground and hurled to kill enemies (All enemies in the game die with one hit outside of bosses) and you will find that they play a prominent role throughout the game. They appear in both small and large varieties.Super Mario Bros. 2 was also the first Mario game to introduce other playable characters, which was a huge change from the first game. In Super Mario Bros. 2 you can play as not only Mario and Luigi, but also the Princess and Toad. While both of the latter characters did appear in the first Super Mario Bros., it was really Super Mario Bros. 2 that popularized them and made legions of fans of those characters since it was our first shot at actually being able to play as them. And even though they were simply character swaps for the Doki characters, most people, like me, didn't know that as kids and took a personal liking to the Toad and Princess characters. I have always loved Toad ever since I played Super Mario Bros. 2 when I was about 5 years old. I thought the little guy was great (and I'm still holding out hope that he'll get his own spot as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl).Each character has their own abilities that make them useful in different situations. The speed at which they run or the height of their jump when holding an item, the speed at which they lift items, and the height of their jump all differs between characters.Mario (typical nowadays) is the \"average\" character, he doesn't really excel at any one ability. Luigi is the character with the highest jump, he's also the tallest character. Toad is the shortest of the bunch and also the quickest at running and lifting, but he also has the lowest jump. Princess on the other hand is the slowest lifter, but she has an ability that's completely unique to her character (and one she inherited for her debut in Super Smash Bros. Melee) . . . if you hold the jump button, she can FLOAT for a short time! This almost makes her a kind of unfair character as she really is a great choice no matter what level you are on cause you can almost always benefit from her floating ability.As for the other features of Mario, such as coins and items, everything in Super Mario Bros. 2 has been changed up or altered from the first game. Although the way you progress from level to level is still largely the same, as there are a number of worlds and each world has 3 levels, and it uses the same dash system, so world 2-2 would mean the second level on the second world. Pipes though, a major feature of the first Super Mario Bros. have been replaced with these objects that look like vases, some of which can be entered by pressing down, leading inside the vase, much like a pipe in the first game.You now have a life bar made up of hearts on the left side of the screen. If you lose all your hearts by getting hit, then the containers will empty and you will die. If you only have one heart then you are small. You start with two containers, and can get up to four in any one level (containers do not carry on to the next level).If you are small, then getting another heart or a Mushroom will make you grow. Mushrooms are the only way you can get another heart container, and you only find Mushrooms in what is known as \"sub-con\", which is basically another dimension of the world. Throughout the levels are a certain number of these red potions. You will pull them up from the ground like a vegetable. If you throw the potion, it will create a door. Enter that door and whatever is on the screen will turn dark to signify that you are in another dimension, in \"sub-con\".Sub-con is a big part of the game. Mushrooms, as well as coins, only appear in sub-con. But Mushrooms only appear in a specific spot. So to get that Mushroom, you are required to throw the door at the place where you think a Mushroom may be. While it's true that Mushrooms theoretically can appear anywhere in a level, they will generally appear in some obvious places, usually where you find many vegetables or something else to give you a hint. Vegetables in Sub-Con turn into coins (one veggie counts as one coin). Coins count towards how many tries you will have at the slot machine in between stages, where you can earn extra lives (and it is the only way to earn extra lives outside of some uncommon 1-Up Mushrooms that you will occasionally pull from the ground).The last big piece of the Super Mario Bros. 2 world are cherries. Cherries kind of take the place of coins in the previous Super Mario Bros., that is, while outside Sub-Con you will see cherries just floating in the air, as coins did in the previous game (actually, they aren't so much floating as nailed, literally, to the air). Grabbing enough cherries will summon a Starman, which works just as in Super Mario Bros. and will give you invincibility for a short amount of time.Super Mario Bros. 2 keeps a nice balance in the way the various game mechanics come into play. For example, unlike most games, the only way to heal yourself (outside a Mushroom) is by killing enemies, which will summon a heart to come floating onto the screen from below, collect it to fill a heart container. This helps in giving you a reason to actually kill enemies instead of simply running past them. You will also occasionally come across other items that you will pull from the ground. These include Shells, which you throw and jump on top of as they slide across the ground, killing any enemies in their path, Stop Watches, which you will pull from the ground once you've pulled 5 big vegetables. Stop Watches will freeze time for a short period. You will also occasionally come across \"POW\" blocks. These big black boxes will shake the screen once thrown and destroy any enemy that's touching the ground. POW's are still a really cool part of the Mario universe, although they haven't shown up as prominently since Super Mario Bros. 2. But they did make a cameo appearence in the first Super Smash Bros. on the Classic Mushroom Kingdom stage and they occasionally will pop-up in different Mario titles.The last real item you'll come across are bombs. Similar to in the Zelda series, you will come across bricks which can be blown up by using bombs. Bombs will explode a bit after you pick them up and you pull them from the ground like you would vegetables. Bombs will always appear near where they need to be used.And speaking of bombs, this segues into the almost puzzle like aspects of Super Mario Bros. 2. There are many points in the game where you will have to bomb walls or bricks in a certain way. For example, there may be a platform above a lower one, with breaks and walls that can be bombed, blocking the middle of the bottom platform. And if you go into sub-con a Mushroom will appear, but you may only be able to get that Mushroom if you have bombed the right spots.Early on you will come to a secret where you need to drop a bomb down a skinny area where a bombable wall is blocking the door. But it's only wide enough for your character and if you fall or climb down you don't have enough room to throw the bomb. So you gotta drop it from above, and the key is to wait for the bomb to flash and time your throw so that it blows up at the right time, destroying at least two blocks, which will give you enough room to fit in through the gap. And these types of little bombing areas are numerous.Unlike the original Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2 is a lot more non-linear. You can pretty much complete the levels as slow or as quick as you want, for the reasons mentioned above, but also the world itself is also a lot more complex.The world in Super Mario Bros. 2 is full of doors. All the doors can be entered and exited by pressing the Up Button. And there is almost no point where you can not re-enter a door, leaving the player free to explore the world pretty much at their leisure. Doors can lead to all kinds of places, and some levels will have over ten doors (or much less . . . or more), leading in and out of various areas. You will also find many places that are populated with vines, ladders (leading to higher or lower levels) and vases, some of which can be entered. Making the world of Super Mario Bros. 2 a lot larger with various areas and environments within one level. Which is a big improvement over the original game.Super Mario Bros. 2 has great variety in the design of it's levels. Some worlds are themed to a degree as well. You will come across desert landscapes, ice and snow levels, and more green, tropical style levels (complete with Palm Trees), which generally come with a lot of waterfalls. The first time you see a desert stage though, or even the initial level with it's waterfalls, you will realize how big of an improvement the game is graphically over the original Mario Bros.Stages have their own quirks too that make them different. Desert stages for example will have pyramids that you can enter. Once you're inside you will find that you will need to press the B Button to dig through the soft sand. Digging will have the character pull out that space of dirt right below them . . . . and there is lots of dirt! Generally you will have to dig about 5 or more screens before you reach the bottom, encountering enemies and cherries along the way. This mechanic still feels really cool and I can't even think of another game that's similar in the digging department.You will also encounter locked doors in Super Mario Bros. 2, and they will require a key that you will have to pick up and carry from one location (generally far away) to the location of the door that is locked. Picking up a key will summon these faces/masks called Phanto`s, that are on the wall and will chase after you. If you throw the key they will go away until you pick it up again, and they can't be killed.A lot of these locked doors will be found inside these kind of construction/warehouse type environments (though like the first game, much of Super Mario Bros. 2 is only black backgrounds), where you will find chains you can climb, Mushroom Blocks you can pick up, stack and throw, and various hazards ranging from Sparky enemies that will encircle platforms and harm you if you touch them, to spikes or even pits where you will die or be damaged if you fall.The non-linear nature of Super Mario Bros. 2 really comes into play throughout the game. You will come to find that lots of levels actually have multiple paths you can take. Or at least two paths. And many of them feature secrets that will lead to \"backdoors\", these doors will take you directly to the boss of the level, or to our pal Birdo.Birdo is a strange dinosaur-like creature who spits eggs out at you and serves as a boss, mini-boss and all around common enemy throughout the game. You will fight different varieties of Birdo in different environments. The main form of attack Birdo has is spitting out eggs, which you jump on top of and throw back at him (her? In the new games it's a girl) to kill it. You will also encounter Birdo's that spit fire. At the end of nearly every stage will be a Birdo fight. So learn to enjoy them!The end of the level, generally after a Birdo fight will lead you to a pearl that when picked up will open this \"Bird Door\" that will lead to the next level. The Bird Door only helps to give the game it's dreamy, otherwordly kind of feel.While Super Mario Bros. 2 is easily one of the best games from my childhood and thus it has a lot of nostalgic value, playing through it again has made me realize how many memorable moments the game has. And that I believe is it's biggest difference from the first Super Mario Bros. game. The stages are SOO unique. And there really are too many cool moments to name.One level for example has a giant waterfall. You start about half-way, and there are clouds leading upward, which is the direction to go if you want to proceed through the level. If, however, you jump down, you will fall and in the middle at the bottom of the waterfall is a little island (if you miss the island you fall to your doom). There is a door on the lil' isle, go inside and you will find a room packed full of veggies. And somewhere in there is a potion, if you can find it all those veggies (or as much as you can pull, if you haven't pulled them up before entering Sub-Con) will of course be coins. And you get the Mushroom as well.Another level has a huge uncrossable gap. The only way to cross it is to use Birdo! He'll shoot an egg and you can actually jump on top of that egg and it will sail you across to the other side. Don't forget to take the potion with you! Another waterfall level has you crossing the waterfalls by jumping on top of fish which will jump up from below. But you have to be careful because if you fall you'll die. Still another level has you sailing on top of a bird! With no ground beneath! Another stage features whales. These whales will shoot water out of their blow holes which you can stand on to get to the higher platforms.And that is just the tip of the iceberg! The levels in Super Mario Bros. 2 easily and single-handedly eclipse anything in the original Super Mario Bros. From the digging to the ice worlds to the secrets to the backdoors and multiple paths to the various environments to the warp pipes to the bosses, Super Mario Bros. 2 is one diverse game.And you really get better the more you play too. As in the example above of the room with a ton of vegetables demonstrates (you will encounter a lot of similar rooms), the player will benefit from actually knowing the layout of the stages and knowing where Mushrooms, Potions and whatnot are located.And did I mention the bosses? This game has some really cool boss fights. Such as Mouser, a mouse who will hurl bombs at you. You have to catch the bombs and toss or set them up on his platform, timing them right so that they explode and hit him as he gets close to them. Or Fry Guy, a big flame-head that will fly around the room dropping little fires. You have to use the Mushroom Blocks in the room to hit him three times (which is the sweet spot for most bosses) by using the platforms above where he flies, after which he'll burst into four little flames that must be extinguished before he is completely defeated.A cool element of the Fry Guy fight is the fact that, while the fight takes place on one-screen, you can keep going through the edge of the screen at which point you'll pop-out on the other side. In fact, if you go half-way, then half of you will be on one-side and the other half will be on the other side! You can even hurl a Mushroom Block at the edge of the screen and, naturally, watch it sail onto the other side, hopefully hitting Fry Guy in the process.This kind of effect is really neat and a far cry from anything you see in the first Super Mario Bros. And there are other levels where this effect will come into play as well. One stage in particular has you hopping on platforms to reach the top of the screen, where-in it will scroll up one, until you reach the top of the environment. But while on a single screen and hopping on the platforms leading up, there are platforms on the edges which you can stand on and if you keep going to the edge of the screen you'll pop-up on the platform on the opposite side. So while you are going up you'll encounter plants that will be coming down . .. this plant will shoot fire that will fall both on the left and right of the plant. The only way to avoid it is to run across the platforms at the edge to pop out on the other side of the screen if the fire is coming your way. It's hard to describe but in the actual game it happens seemlessly and is a cool gameplay effect.And it's this type of unique gameplay that makes the game really imaginative and fun. You really haven't seen anything like it, and even today it is unique among 2D 8-bit platformers. It's also interesting that you actually seem to do a lot more platforming and jumping in Super Mario Bros. 2 than you do in the original, which is ironic considering how the original is all about jumping. The world in Super Mario Bors. 2 is HUGE too compared to the original Super Mario Bros., and the game, if played straight through, is much longer, at least twice if not three times as long.Super Mario Bros. 2 also contains an incredible amount of secrets. You will find many pathways which will lead off the beaten path. Generally they will either take you to an area full of coins, or they will lead to a backdoor that will quickly take you past the level and directly to the boss. The first time you find one of these and you find yourself entering the boss stage by jumping down from the dirt roof at the top it will hit you that this is one unique game (the roof area is just a straight wall leading to the top of the screen and naturally there is no way to get up there from the other side).And secrets like the one mentioned above litter the levels. And many of these are really memorable moments that will probably stick with you after you have completed the game. And for those that have played Super Mario Bros. 2 before it will be really gratifying encountering these nostalgic scenes again. I know for me it brought many fond memories flooding back into my brain.I mean who doesn't remember throwing Mushroom Blocks on top of clouds so that you could stand on them and cross the gap? (even though Princess can simply float across). Or letting the quicksand in one level take you UNDER the starting wall . . . which leads to a backdoor to the boss? If you haven't encountered these secerts then you really owe it to yourself to experience it.The game even contains some well hidden warp pipes (er . . . warp vases?), which will transport you to another world. The warp pipes are cool to find as they can only be found/discovered in Sub-Con, and you will only know it's a warp pipe by entering it. Can you find them all?The game is also surprisingly difficult. Yet it's rarely frustrating, which is a nice balance. It can be easy to die and you will die quite a bit, but you will always feel that it was your own mistake that killed you, not anything cheap. And due to the slot machine in between levels and how many coins you find, you will generally have lots of extra lives, so getting \"Game Over\" is pretty hard to do unless you are super reckless.Graphic-wise, the game is really colorful in comparison to Super Mario Bros. 1, which has a really dull color pallet, although the NES version of Super Mario Bros. 2 isn't nearly as colorful as the All-Stars version, which also has characters that are much, much improved. And obviously the environments are a lot more diverse, with desert landscapes, ice, waterfalls, frozen places, and more. It really gives the game a lot of variety and you will never get bored with the levels.All the tunes in the game are good and if you played the game back in the day then they will definitely bring back some extremely nostalgic memories and feelings. The music is nice, happy and upbeat, except for the inside/warehouse type tune, which is perfectly fitting. While the music is pretty great overall, there really are only a few tunes which play throughout the whole game which can get old.Super Mario Bros. 2 actually has quite a lot of replay value. I played the game start to finish three times for this review. The first time I used warp pipes (skipping some worlds entirely), the second time I followed secrets and back doors (skipping large parts of some levels) and the third time I played straight through without using any secrets or back doors. So the game contains a lot of replay value for a game of it's age.All in all, Super Mario Bros. 2 is a phenomenal platformer by anyone's standards. It holds up to the test of time extremely well and is no less fun nowadays. And if you've never played the game before then you surely are in for a great time. There are tons of secrets to discover and it's very likely that you will play the game several times if you want to see the entire game. The gameplay is so unique that I can't even think of a modern game (or classic one for that matter), that comes close to mimicking what is on display in Super Mario Bros. 2. And even if it did, Super Mario Bros. 2 definitely does it best. The gameplay is so refined that it's practically perfect. Any complaints I have are so minimal they aren't even worth mentioning.Super Mario Bros. 2 is a definite classic that all gamers should have in their library.Should I buy Super Mario Bros. 2 for the Wii?As the most unique and different Mario game in the series, there is no reason why you shouldn't purchase this $5 NES title on the Wii. Whether you have played it before or not, it's probably still worth purchasing due to the sheer amount of replay value it has for an 8-bit pre Super Mario Bros. 3 title.Even if you have played it extensively, it's still a fun game and there is surely some parts of the game you haven't seen. So why not add it to your collection? And the Wii will make it much easier to get the game for those that don't want to play it on a portable system and don't feel like tracking it down for one of their older consoles (SNES and NES) and having to deal with cartridge problems.FUN FACTOR: 8.0With it's pick-up-and-throw gameplay, bevy of secrets and really unique worlds, the gameplay stays fun throughout the 7 worlds of the game, with lots to see; requiring a few play-throughs before you will see it all.Graphics: 8.5The game looks great . . . for an NES title. While it is very colorful compared to Super Mario Bros., it still looks dull today, especially the characters, and especially in comparison to the SNES All-Stars version. The unique environments make up for the graphical detail though.Ingenuity: 9.0This is by far, with the exception of perhaps Yoshi's Island, the most unique game in the 2D Super Mario Bros. series. No other game involves picking up and throwing things in the way Mario 2 does, and while it's not mind-blowing nowdays, it was for the time. And even now it still feels highly original and the gameplay is refined to near perfection. The idea of Sub-Con is also really neat and was highly original for the time as well.Replay Value: 8.5Due to multiple paths, lots of secrets, hidden warp pipes and back doors, Super Mario Bros. 2 is not a game where you can see everything your first play-through. It will take a few play-throughs to see all that it has to offer, and the game stays pretty fun throughout even though you are simply hurtling things beginning to end. Most people who want to see all the games has to offer will want to play more than once, which is pretty good for this type of game since there are no difficulties, no extra modes and no 2-player.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

We had a NES growing up, and by the time I was old enough to work, I bought a SNES & later a Nintendo 64. I gave up video games for a while and then my wife bought this for me as a birthday gift in 2005. I was thrilled. I believe a game system is only as good as the games, or there wouldn't be any point to buying a game console. I probably purchased about 30 games over the first 5 years I had this. Now over the past year, I have bought over 120 more games for the GameCube. Some of the games are going cheap and some are as much if not more than when they came out. I would recommend anyone who missed the GameCube era to pick one up cheap and dive in. Still one of the best out there. Here is a rundown of the features.Controllers and other devices: 4 controller ports and loads of 4 player games out there. The controller is a great design and still one of my favorites. Go with a Nintendo brand wired, or if you want wireless, wavebird (also Nintendo brand)is the way to go. They even have frequency switches so you can use 4 wavebirds if you want. Some other devices you can plug in include: Microphones (for Mario Party 6-7, Odama, Karaoke, etc.), Dance Pads, Bongos (for DK Bongo games), and Gameboy Player (attaches on bottom) for a few compatible gameboy games like Zelda 4 Swords.Graphics: Depends on the game, but you get traditional Nintendo graphics that are even comparable to the Wii on some games and some that rivaled Xbox and PS2.Games: Here is where the GameCube shines. There are over 600 games released, but the total North America released stands around 555. I am going to run down a top 25 list by IGN, then tell you what you shouldn't miss. This is the top 25 games of all time for the GameCube by IGN, created after the GameCube was discontinued. I would recommend all of these games if you are going to get the full experience on the GameCube.1. Metroid Prime, 2. Resident evil 4, 3. Super Smash Bros Melee, 4. Zelda: Wind Waker, 5. Eternal Darkness: Sanity's requiem, 6. Pikmin 2, 7. F Zero GX, 8. Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, 9. Super Mario Sunshine, 10. Waverace: Blue Storm, 11. Animal Crossing, 12. Beyond Good & Evil, 13. Resident Evil, 14. Soul Calibur 2, 15. Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, 16. Paper Mario & 1,000 year door, 17. Viewtiful Joe, 18. Star Wars Rogue Squadron II, 19. Time Splitters 2, 20. Killer 7, 21. Super Monkey Ball 2, 22. Battalion Wars, 23. Baten Kaitos, 24. DK Jungle Beat, 25. Metal Gear Solid: Twin Snakes.My library includes over 150 games, so here are a few more you shouldn't miss. Skies of Arcadia: Legends, Cubivore, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, Final Fantasy Tactics, Harvest Moon (all 3), Resident Evil (all 5), Prince of Persia (all 3), Evolution Worlds, Ikaruga, all Zelda games including Collector's edition that has Zelda 1 & 2 on it, Mario Party if you have young ones (great 4 player games), Mario Kart (must have), Starfox Assault, Tales of Symphonia (80 hour JRPG), Wario World, Luigi's Mansion, Zapper, XIII, and loads of others including Spyro, Spider-man, Star Wars, 6 Sonic games, Sims, Pokemon, etc. I just have to say that Eternal Darkness (IGN's # 5) was one of my all-time favorite for GameCube. Crazy game.Exclusive: The GameCube boasts over 100 Exclusive titles. Ones not to miss include: Nintendo brand (Mario, Luigi, Wario, etc), Eternal Darkness, Cubivore, Pokemon, Yugioh, Pikmin, Megaman, Lost Kingdoms, Kirby, Darkened Skye, Phantasy Star Online, and loads more.Other points: Every game is 100% backward compatible (b/c) with the Wii. Something Nintendo should be proud of. Microsoft could only get a handful of their games b/c from Xbox to 360 and Sony originally had it right with full b/c support for PS2 games on the PS3 but then they phased it out of the newer models and is now very hard to find ones that do and very expensive. Nintendo gets a A+ here.I have to admit, of those 150+ games, I still have loads I haven't tried. I am excited to continue playing these treasures, and in a few years, my kids will get to enjoy them as well. We have a Wii, and I am glad I can grab a game from downstairs and a few controllers and bring it up to the Wii and play when we have people over.Don't miss this especially if you have kids. This system has loads of games for kids including Yugioh, Kirby, Pokemon, Tak, Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, Teen Titans, Sea World, Sponge Bob, Mickey Mouse, Winnie the pooh and Piglet, Scooby-Doo, Fairly OddParents, Nickelodeon, etc. and tons of games based on kid movies like cars, Shrek, Shark Tale, Ratatouille, Over the Hedge, Open Season, Incredibles, Madagascar, etc.Don't get me wrong in that this is not just for kids. There are loads of adult games that will appeal to every gamer. They have loads of sports games (You name it, they have it), war games like Medal of Honor, Call of Duty, Tom Clancy's Ghost, Rainbow, and Splinter Cell games, Fighting games like Mortal Kombat and Soul Calibur, and other appeasing games such as James Bond, Pac-Man, Tomb Raider, etc. It also has arcade classics from Midway and Namco. My favorite types of games are the RPGs. It has a decent amount including Fire Emblem, Baldur's Gate, Tales of Symphonia, Baten Kaitos, etc.Update 8/01/11I just purchased DK Jungle Beat, Donka Konga 1 & 2, and 4 sets of Bongo Drums. The Donka Konga games are great 1-4 player games and provide a lot of entertainment. Similar to guitar hero, you have a scrolling music bar that shows what notes you need to play. The notes are colored so you know what action to perform. It can be a left bongo, right bongo, both bongos, or a clap (there is a mic between the bongos). You even have some continuous notes. DK jungle beat can be a 1 or 2 player game (even though it says 1 player). If you have 2 sets of bongos, you can both control DK.Bottom line, if you are thinking about getting one, do it fast as some rare games are going up in price and value and it's getting harder to track down good games in good condition with cases and manuals.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2011"}

If you're a skilled gamer, especially where Shooters are concerned, I'd suggest renting the game.  I had it for a week and worked my way through the normal and challenge mode after 3 days.  Challenge mode is great because you collect numerous bolts which enables you to buy the really cool, expensive weapons you couldn't afford the first time through.  However, with weapons like the RHYNO II and the Ultra Weapon upgrades, Challenge Mode becomes something of a misnomer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2004"}

Those who side with good will get to follow Frodo's journey through Middle-Earth, playing in battles inspired by both the books and the movies. Or join evil to find out what may have happened if Frodo had failed to destroy the One Ring, as you fight your way with Sauron back across the map in an attempt to destroy Rivendell, the Shire, and all that is good in the world.You can play as a warrior, scout, mage or archer.View larger.The online multiplayer mode allows for massive battles with up to 16 of your friends.View larger.Building off the model Pandemic used with Star Wars: Battlefront, Lord of the Rings: Conquest provides you with a first and/or third person shooter style of game that not only lets you command strategy, but also lets you control the players in the center of the action. Participate in the Battle of Isengard as an Ent or fight Saruman at Orthanc as Gandalf himself. Take on the Nazgul as Aragorn while still protecting Frodo, or battle at Pelennor as a Rohirrim cavalry soldier. And that is just for the good guys!In Conquest you will have to play many different characters in order to win. And it isn't always such a balanced match, as you will find yourself destroying towering siege engines and taking on hulking oliphaunts with your companions. You can choose to play all the heroes you love, or fight as a Nazgul tasked with killing Frodo and stretch your powerful wings as the Balrog himself in your battle for Moria.Pick Your Own Style of PlayIn the game, you'll be able to play as one of four different character classes. Choose the melee-based Warrior or Scout for up-close action, or pick the Archer or Mage to perform devastating ranged attacks. There is also talk of a 'special' class called the Guardian to give gamers a third choice. But don't worry about getting locked in, as you can actually change which character class you're playing on the fly, in the middle of the game's various objective-based missions.Each class of characters has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as unique special abilities. Playable units range from grunt soldiers, which are the weakest, to captains, which are the strongest AI units in the game other than the heroes. You also get to order in air strikes using either eagles or fellbeasts. Even better, players will be able to mount the occasional horse, unless they've chosen evil, in which case they will have to master the skill of riding a fearsome warg.Multiple Modes for Endless FunAs in Battlefront, Lord of the Rings: Conquest has enormous competitive multiplayer modes, including Conquest, Capture the Flag, and Hero Deathmatch. In addition to these classics, Conquest adds a Ring Bearer mode, in which one player tries to stay alive as Frodo against a host of ringwraiths, and Stronghold in which you fight on various maps in a Risk-style battle for territories. Fortunately, you won't be limited to roaming around with only your teammates, however, as battles occur in large scale with non-player combatants joining in the fray.Conquest allows online play with up to 16 players for massive battles with all your friends, or in two-player cooperative mode. Players can also play locally with up to four players competitively, or two-player co-op on a split screen. When in the game itself, fans will get the thrill of hearing Howard Shore's score for the films accompanying the action, and both good and evil campaigns are narrated by Hugo Weaving, who played Elrond in the movies.You can choose to play either good or evil, each with different endings.","reviewerName":"austin","summary":"Its fun","reviewText":"I thought the game was kinda fun.

{"product_name":"B000Z9A95M","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"A modern classic revisited","reviewText":"It frequently happens when a game or a movie comes out that everyone seems to love yet nobody even bothers to go see it. Sometimes they have the good sense to know when something is awful so they avoid but then on other occasions they don't support it enough even though the general attitude is how incredible it was. When Okami was coming out for the PS2, it became one of those anticipated titles thanks to its unique and utterly beautiful visual style but despite the acclaim and awards, it wasn't a success and the studio, Clover Studios, had to close down. But fans kept speculating that the unique gameplay involving the brush could work well on the Wii or DS and pretty soon a Wii-port was announced. With some enhances features, the game is just as good on any system.Story: The people of Kamiki Village used to live in fear of the 8-headed demon Orochi, who demanded a sacrifice from one of the village maidens during their festival. But the swordsman Nagi, who secretly loved the maiden chosen, had enough and decided to fight him off but couldn't damage him in anyway until Shiranui, a mystical white wolf, appeared and together, they banished Orochi away but Shiranui succumbed to his injuries. 100 years later, Orochi seems to be resurrected so the wolf, reincarnated as Amaterasu, is brought forth to restore beauty and peace to the land.Graphics: A lot of times sayings like \"work of art\" when it comes down to graphics is usually because of how shiny and sharp it is but when you say Okami is like a painting come to life, it's literally the case. Done in Japanese watercolor style, the game is filled with beautiful moments and rarely does the game ever get boring to look at. With the progressive scan on and the game running in 16:9, this is bound to be one of the more gorgeous games in your collection.Sound/Music: Another successful feature of the game was its soundtrack which seems to marry traditional Japanese instruments and melodies with more grandiose arrangements and using synthesizers and it's one of the more memorable soundtracks on the PS2 and the Wii. Unfortunately, rather than using just text or voice acting for the dialogue, they opted for a more \"Animal Crossing\"-type vibe where it's gibberish which you can't turn off and while scenes can be skipped the story goes with it so you have to suffer through that chipmunk chatter in order to get the story and listen to the music.Gameplay: It's hard not to compare Okami with the 3D installments of the Zelda series and indeed memories might flood in of playing as the wolf from Twilight Princess. But the game is so immersive that you don't even bother noticing. With puzzles to complete, sidequests, praise to get (do a good service and you can get points to level up certain attributes) and even animals to feed, there's lots to do and that's not even including the main quest. Only thing that might turn gamers off is that first initial hour or so which feels slightly sluggish but once you start beating bosses, exploring and restoring the land, it's very easy to get into.What made Okami so unique was the idea of the \"Celestial Brush\" where the screen would turn into a canvas and drawing certain shapes could bring special events. Draw a circle during nighttime and it transforms instantly to day, do the same to a dead tree and it magically comes to life. Others such as drawing a straight line either to cut enemies and things in the environment or swirls to represent wind are just some of the special techniques you can do with the brush. Thanks to the Wii-controls, it's also more accurate and quicker and not sluggish like the PS2; however it's very easy to have a drawing fail and it actually took me a couple tries to draw a line through an enemy so even if it is more accurate, it can also be a bit picky.The other slight nitpick people might have is during combat where instead of button presses, shaking the Wii-mote has you attack and it takes a bit of getting used to and timing tends to count for a lot this time. It's kind of a weird situation when the accuracy in the drawing is better in one version but the combat mechanics were better in the other. Go figure. Oh and also: slight nitpick though it's not as serious but there was a slight paper effect on the screen on the PS2 so that it really made it look like the game came to life on paper but here it's not as pronounced but the game looks incredible anyway so complaining about a paper effect seems kind of trivial.While I really doubt Okami will have the success of Brawl or Twilight Princess, this game really should be in the hands of a lot more gamers than it'll probably get.

{"product_name":"B003O6E620","description":"","reviewerName":"maninblue \"maninblue\"","summary":"A dissapointing entry to a flawless series","reviewText":"Traditional Ratchet and Clank games feature exploration, crazy weaponry, wacky humor, tons of stuff to blow up, crazy boss battles, and returns to previous areas for secrets and hidden gold bolts.  It almost seems All 4 One is was made by a different developer.  Older entries in the series delighted fans with space battles, races, vehicles, and branching paths in the level design.  All 4 One serious lacks these and the linearity of the level design is the most disappointing aspect of this game.  While it is fun to blast a single path through this arcade-style adventure with a buddy, this game cant hold a candle to any of the others in the series.While I appreciate the attempt at trying to add co-co gameplay to the series, too many sacrifices counter the fun the co-op element is supposed to add. On top of that, the co-op isnt perfect either. The main caveat is that the game handcuffs you if you want to jump into an ongoing online game by removing your weapons.  This is a horrible design decision that Im surprised they didn't work out before release.  Say you have only played the single player game with Ratchet and decide to join an online game to replay some of the areas you enjoyed.  If Ratchet is in use by another player and you pick a character you've never used, you are stuck with nothing to play with rather than the game using what your profile has already earned.  Inability to skip cutscenes, especially during a four-player co-op session is a strange oversight from the developers.  This, in conjunction with the weird save system, impacts the replayability of the game because you always start at the beginning of a level and are forced to watch a lengthy (although well made) cutscene over and over again.The game holds your hand from start to finish, from the AI bot who always revives you if you go down to the formerly super secret gold bolts from previous games now sitting right out in the open for you.  Even Boss battles all require the same tactic of holding the auto-aim button and firing at some huge monster or giant robot straight in front of you with the only strategy being the option to do additional damage by selecting the same weapon as your teammate.I should add that this game does retain some of what we love from the other games such as the lovable characters, lots of enemies to blow away, humor, (Quark's Vibrating Platypus remarks, anyone?) and guns that all feel unique and fun to use (although some are more useful than others). It's a combination of all these things along with the once again beautiful (albeit extremely linear) worlds that makes this game familiar to long time fans.Anyone expecting this game to be on par with the others in the series with an added bonus of playing with a friend will be entertained for a rental, but otherwise left sadly waiting for the next game. Not worthy to be added to the collection of Ratchet & Clank titles I am proud to own.  I am disappointed that they decided to leave out the following crucial gameplay elements that made the other games stand out:Arena battleshidden areasBranching paths or large free-roaming areas in the level designChallenging Puzzlesraces","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2011"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E6NE","description":"","reviewerName":"GarionOrb","summary":"A new benchmark in video game storytelling...","reviewText":"It's common knowledge that the original Bioshock is one of the best games this generation.  Its atmosphere was unforgettable, and gamers everywhere will remember the world of Rapture for years and years to come.  Irrational Games has undertaken the daunting task of surpassing such a landmark title, and now we have Bioshock Infinite.  This game not only surpasses the first Bioshock, but does it so completely and immaculately that it makes that game seem insignificant by comparison.Irrational has taken such great care to make sure everything in Infinite fits together.  The story and the gameplay are practically perfect.  I don't say that lightly.  The game does such a fantastic job of presenting itself...nothing is rushed.  Every part you come across unfolds another piece of the story at precisely the right time.  And between the shoot-em-up sections where you're exploring the many nooks and crannies around, the game keeps you simply enthralled.Like the first Bioshock, you start out in a lighthouse that dramatically transports you to a grand \"utopia\".  In this case, it's a floating city called Columbia.  You are Booker DeWitt, and the driving force in your quest is a simple command: \"Bring back the girl, and wipe away the debt.\"  You are to find Elizabeth, and bring her back to New York.  How and why are not explained, and in the course of the game's 40 or so chapters, those reasons are revealed to be more amazing than you could ever imagine.  Simply put, this game has perfected the art of video game storytelling.  When the game starts, most people will immediately assume that they can predict the story.  And it's almost constructed to lull the player into this frame of mind.  But I will assure you, the plot twists will keep coming, and they WILL shock you.  Just when you think you've got it figured out, something entirely new happens that you never saw coming.  And the game continues this pattern right until the end credits.  I have never played a game that did this so expertly.The combat in this game is phenomenal, and never gets stale. At its heart, it's a shooter.  You have an arsenal of weapons throughout the game, but you can only hold two at a time.  Also at your disposal, you have Vigors (analogous to Plasmids from the first Bioshock) that keep the combat crazy and make you feel ultra-powerful.  Blasting enemies with a wide range of weapons, and then using Vigors to enhance your attacks is so much fun I can't even describe.  Add in the skylines where you can fly through the battlefield while taking out foes, and this is one of the best combat systems ever.  Later on, Elizabeth can open up rifts in space-time and summon things like cover, or weapons, or ammo, or even auto-turrets to help you.  Simply put, playing this game will never get tired.When you're not fighting enemies, you're free to explore Columbia.  And there is so much to find.  To rush through the game would be to miss the story entirely.  Seek out the Voxophones that expand the story.  Look at all the posters and propaganda throughout the game.  All of this serves to flesh out the experience, and you're meant to take your time.If the game has a weak point, at least it's the aspect that least matters in a gaming experience...and that's the graphics.  The game is surely beautiful to behold, but it's also not up to par with how a AAA game should look in 2013.  I would compare it to the first Bioshock.  As you go through the game, the sights will be glorious.  But if you walk close to the walls or want to take a look at a flower, you'll see completely blurry textures and low-quality renders.  Of course, this also means that the game runs very well with nary a hiccup.  And while the outdated graphics are a little disappointing, believe me when I say that it makes little difference in how absolutely perfect this game is in every other way.Rarely have I played a game that gets so much right so frequently.  If you liked the first Bioshock, you MUST play this game.  If you're new to the series, well good news...you don't need to play Bioshock to enjoy and understand this (though there is one tiny part where playing either Bioshock or Bioshock 2 will provide a brief \"a-ha\" moment).  If you're tired of the same ol' Call of Duty shooter, don't pass this game up just because it's a first-person shooter.  This is unlike any game you've ever played.  A true highlight of this generation, and one of the best experiences in gaming.  Ever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00C7103JI","description":"Warner Bros. Batman: Arkham Origins 1000381344 PC Games","reviewerName":"eternal now \"roejoerrer\"","summary":"More of what we love","reviewText":"Let's be honest; you cannot expect every video game to re-invent the wheel, especially if the established baseline is exceptional. Batman: Arkham Origins brings nothing new to the Arkham trilogy. It quite literally is more of the same, albeit with a much better story than Arkham City and Arkahm Asylum, and for PC gamers, a more stable port.It's Christmas eve, and a nefarious villain known as The Black Mask has put a hit out on Batman's head. As you can imagine, the call is answered by over-the-top villains in ridiculous outfits sporting ridiculous names. Being Batman for only two years, you're still a little rough around the edges. The cops hate you, and the populace fears you. While this isn't so much an Origin story, it does lay down some of the backstory for the other two games in the trilogy. The story is phenomenal, the villains exceptional, and the voice acting is top notch.As far as the gameplay goes, its an open world with various side quests, collectibles, as well as a main storyline to follow. In addition to the sprawling, gothic city of Gotham to explore, you can fast travel to the Batcave, where you can converse with your butler Alfred, undertake challenges, and acquire new gear. The series' staple of free flowing combat is still intact and as fun as ever, and Batman sports gadgets a-plenty. You'll even pick up new gadgets along the way.Crime scene investigations are a little more involved and are much longer than in Arkham City, however the game still holds your hand through them. It would have been nice to see the investigations a little more fleshed out, with the option to completely blunder them if you miss clues.Origin's Gotham is a darker, more mature setting, caked in snow and teeming with henchmen to pummel. Unlike the previous titles in the series, which portrayed a Batman more akin to the cartoon series, Origins gives us a darker take on Batman, still a rookie to crime-fighting, very similar to Christian Bale's take in Batman Begins. He's more ruthless and brutal than ever, though still following his 'no kill' rule. I won't spoil anything, but expect to see lots of villains from the DC Universe, some of them with a few unique surprises.Regarding the PC port it is much more stable this time around. Batman: Arkham City was a disaster with its unstable Directx 11 infusion, wonky frame rate and stutters galore. This time around Tessellation is actually utilized, in the form of Batman's highly detailed cape, and the realistic looking and moving snow that covers the city.  Physx is also much more prevalent, with signs, banners, papers, and other trash blowing freely without clipping into the scenery. You can even whip your cape around and see papers fly; always a nice immersion touch. I run a Geforce 660ti, not a new graphics card by any stretch, but I managed a 60fps with all the settings cranked to max.There is a lot of outcry against Arkham Origins because it brings nothing new to the table mechanics wise. You even visit the same section of the city that Arkham City takes place in. I don't see these as bad things. Batman Arkham Origins is a legit game, and I think you should give it a chance before blowing it off, if only for the amazing combat and deep atmosphere and story.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2013"}

Many bands and group from the era; ranging from hair metal smashes like Poison and Ratt to legendary metal pioneers Iron Maiden and Anthrax, are featured here, along with songs from Asia, Twisted Sister, the Dead Kennedys, and Skid Row to boot.  While many of the songs are incredibly fun to play, Guitar Hero Encore suffers from the fact that there isn't anything here that you haven't seen before.  Combine this with the fact that the game is selling for the full list price and only features thirty songs with basically nothing else new, and you get one disappointing overall package.

That's equivalent to twenty dollars, and you'll need it to be able to download virtual console games and other wii-ware (if they so charge you for it).I'll be the first to admit that I probably wouldn't buy a Wii Points card right off the bat simply because I'm comfortable buying points directly from the network and charging the to my card.  This brings up the question as to why ANYONE would spend money to buy a wii points card at all.  Don't be shocked when you see people doing it.  There are a couple of good reasons.Firstly: There's sales tax.  In certain states when you charge to your credit card, you're paying more than twenty dollars to purchase wii points.  With the Wii Points card, there are no taxes.  EVER.  Not even when you buy it in the store.  So some people save an extra buck or two by buying the card as opposed to charging to their credit card.Second: They make fantastic gift cards, especially if you happen to know someone who can't get enough of classic gaming!  If you really know someone who loves classic games, you can help this person out by just giving them a Wii Points card.Third: Maybe for some reason (be that you hate them or whatever) you don't have a credit card.  How then, is one supposed to purchase Wii Points without a credit card?  So you can do the next best thing, just simply get a Wii Points card.So while it isn't necessary, if you're someone who goes nuts with the virtual console, then you might want to consider using a Wii Points Card from time to time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2007"}

Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide.

This is NOT the kind of family entertainment I went in expecting.It does contain a LOT of variety so that's why I'm giving Wii Party an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars, but you see most of these games are intended for children.  I really mean it too- it's very very obvious.Chopping down a tree is mind-numbingly simple, and that's not even including the \"run past the sheep\" or \"jump over the moving logs\" games that are all pathetically simple and abundant.  A good portion of the 80 games are dominated with this kind of idiotic simplicity.This is the kind of collection of games that you wouldn't even look at twice if such pointlessly simple games were available at a pub or outside a grocery store or *definitely* at an arcade.  To further prove this collection of mini games was intended for little kids, check out the \"time bomb\" and especially the \"count the number of flying fruit\" games.  These two are incredibly insulting to anyone over the age of 10.  I highly recommend avoiding it.Bingo was probably my favorite game because it had some decent tension and excitement waiting anxiously for your number (or rather, \"face\") to be called.The board games are at least a bit more creative, but unfortuantely they get pretty boring after about 10 minutes.

I don't want to say too much because honestly, if you are even considering this game then you need to witness it yourself.The only real \"con\" I can say about this game is that it's campaign is short for the price tag. However, if you felt it was justified to pay ~$50 for Call of Duty 4 despite how short it was, then expect the same quality (if not better) with Portal 2. It's a short campaign, but it is absolutely amazing.Many people have been complaining about the DLCs and other strange things so let me be the first to clarify this for you. Portal 2 has an in-game shop, not unlike Mannconomy from Team Fortress 2. What you can buy are little customizations for your co-op robots, things like skins or gestures. There are about 60+ negative Metacritic reviews complaining about this, saying it should have been included in the game. I honestly do not understand it. This content has nothing to do with the single-player campaign as far as I am concerned, and I really do not care about them. They are just little trinkets that make your robots pretty. I really...don't understand the enormous criticism over it. PC players (which is what I am) have complained about the \"Please do not turn off your console\" dialog as well, which shows up when you are saving the game. I can assure you that other than this, the entire game feels exactly as well tuned for PC as with every other Valve game. I can hardly understand why they are complaining about this so much when there are games like Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 or Assassin's Creed II that have significantly screwed PC player over on a magnitude far greater than this.There will be many naysayers that will criticize some very trivial things about the game, and they are doing themselves a great injustice by not enjoying the single-player campaign without any false politics and drama about DLCs or what-not. If you enjoyed the first Portal, you will definitely enjoy this second installment, most likely more than the first. If you're worried about it being too short, wait a while and pick it up when it's $5 on Steam (which you know it will be eventually), or perhaps when it is even free. Either way, you deserve to play this game. Period.P.S. I ran this almost perfectly on my netbook with a Atom 330/nVidia ION on full res and medium textures. My netbook can't even run L4D2 or Team Fortress 2, so Portal 2 can definitely run very well on many computers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2011"}

It's complicated enough to keep your brain active, without endless, mindless fighting as in Kingdom Hearts--which my wife loves, but I only see as one unending battle scene and inappropriate for the children it's aimed at.Whoever thought up the concept of Lego Star Wars is just plain brilliant, and it's great to see that they didn't just make up the novelty and stop there, but made an actual challenging and enjoyable game.  I haven't played other Star Wars games, but I think they'd have a hard time matching this.Even by comparison to my favorite games--which have an element of action and figuring out complicated puzzles to get through levels--such as Tomb Raider, Tenchu Shinobu Gaisen, and Metal Gear, this is really the tops.Greatest thing about it is that it's not so hard that you actually feel stressed while playing, but it's not easy or mindless either.  Really, just perfect.Oh, and it's a two player!  The second player can join right in at any point and choose to be one of the characters currently in play on the screen.  As this is a game that is playable and fun for young and old alike, I could see a parent and child playing this together without one feeling they're just entertaining the other.Bottom Line: I bought this just as Lego Star Wars II was coming out, and thought it would probably be underdeveloped.  It wasn't, and I'm very pleased with this game even as I'm not any kind of big time gamer.  If you haven't played this version and are thinking of going ahead with Lego Star Wars II, I recommend that you buy this one first because you wont be disappointed (and the price is bound to drop on the other one in the meanwhile).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2006"}

{"product_name":"B004QEV0MI","description":"","reviewerName":"Marvin Powell","summary":"A Big Disappointment...","reviewText":"As a huge Saint's Row fan, I've been looking forward to this game ever since Saints Row 2 came out, which was amazing! This game... not so much.It's like, they actually downgraded everything in it! Saint's Row 2 was almost perfect. It's only real problem was that it was far too short of a game and far too easy, even on Hardcore difficulty. Saint's Row the Third basically is not that good because it seems like they tried to make everything in it exactly like GTA IV, which is exactly WHY Saint's Two was so good. Because it was everything GTA IV wasn't, including fun!Like I said, everything in this game, from the over-reliance of cell phone calls making you drop everything to do something you don't want to do, to the lack of a feel of freeplay and sandbox exploration, everything just feels so tight and restrictive. It's like you have no breathing room for anything.GAMEPLAY: The controls seem to be the biggest nuisance. They not only feel sluggish, EXACTLY like GTA IV, but your character even moves and hops like Niko Bellic does. All the actions, except for a few cartoony ones, have been made to look as \"realistic\" as possible. I can honestly say I've never played such a... well, I guess \"hypocritical\" game, before. Everything advertised has been made to promote the game as being over-the-top and wacky, and yet, the gameplay is mostly as bland and realistic as Saint's Row's main competition. You do a few \"over-the-top\" things like dive into cars window first, or toss people several feet effortlessly, but the gameplay where it matters, in gunfights and shooting, is what I really mean. And because every weapon now needs Upgrades, even trying to kill someone takes forever, just like that other game. Assault Rifles and Semi-Automatics are useless; you're better off just Head-Shotting with a pistol throughout the entire game. The storylines and cutscenes have actually been pushed down and scaled back as far as the last game goes, but they still manage to \"try\" to have that Saint's feel to them. The actual gameplay, though, is just awful and semi-realistic.The worst thing is that they've completely eliminated both food/health items AND Forgive and Forgets in the game! HOW could they do this?!? It seems as though many games nowadays are trying to emulate \"Call of Duty\" and have the whole 'get hit, take cover, and recover' health method and eliminating health restore items, altogether. The problem is, not only is this game not made for realistic gunfights, but there IS no cover system in this game! Your only substitute is crouching down and hiding behind boxes, though it's not really wall hugging anything or shooting from around a corner. Not to mention, outside a realistic first-person shooter, I personally LOATHE the Call of Duty system. I hated it when Mass Effect dumbed themselves down for it in the sequel in order to have \"more gunfights and explosions\" and multiple near-deaths, and I hate that other, non-realistic games are doing this, too. Since Saint's Row was never designed to be a realistic third-person shooter, the decision of getting rid of recovery items just seems to be awful and will lead to tons of frustrating deaths, especially since gangs now have super-steroid clones in them that are virtually unstoppable. Like I said, it seems like they're trying to emulate GTA IV, as they even replaced their own notoriety system with the GTA Wanted Stars system. The old one was somewhat based on that too, but here, it's completely like that, now. Including having to flee and hide in your home to lower the level, rather than use an open place to just wipe your slate clean. It makes the game not only boring and \"more realistic\", but painfully frustrating, too. And all the new gangs are far more aggressive than before and have helicopter-riding sharp-shooters and eight foot tall muscle freaks on you, all the time. This is a case of upping the difficulty WAY too much, while also lowering the fun level, because the big problem with this is that the notoriety level can't just drop in Star Levels after you've killed everyone in the vincinity, which may have made it work. It's non-stop, just like always, until you can go hide in one of your homes. Really? The legendary Saint's boss having to go run and hide in his house from a bunch of computer and gaming nerds??? Again, not the least bit fun, because like I said, the gangs are too aggressive and since there's no longer health items in the game, you can die very easily, even after upgrading. Though, some people may like that level of challenge. When you attack a gang, it's basically suicide. No recovery items, no Forgive and Forgets, and extremely aggressive gangs. Better just hope you're near a crib and have plenty of grenades.I don't get it. Why change something that worked so well? And if you *were* going to change it, AT LEAST give us a Cover system so we just don't get shot to death on anything above Casual difficulty! This alone makes the game a chore to play and not very fun. At least, to me. I really don't like getting killed several times in a few minutes.4/10VISUALS: The city of Steelport is just DULL. And depressing. Like some kind of modern-day dystopia. I get that it's supposed to be a slum town based on Detroit, but does everything have to be so gray? It's like you're stuck in a world of Black and White. Everything is just so dreary and makes you want to yawn. The ONLY colors I've noticed in this game come from the trees and electronic billboards and signs downtown. Everything else is just smoky-looking. I get it's probably intentional, but it sure is ugly to look at. Oh, and the lighting and motions are in that GTA \"blur effect\" style now, too. I don't know what it's called, I'm not a camera, lighting and film expert.4/10CONTROLS: Again, just like GTA IV! (Sorry for keep comparing this to that other game, but the feeling just can't be avoided.) They've made the controls insanely complicated! Seriously. No joke. On foot, they can be learned and picked up eventually, but when driving, you now have to use the triggers. Again, like the \"realistic\" shooters that try to imitiate a gas pedal. But you also now have to shoot with the shoulder buttons, too! Now, imagine that for a second. Drive with the back triggers, and shoot with the shoulder buttons. While also using the control sticks to move and keep the camera steady. You're operating four to six things at once, just to drive and shoot! And that's facing forward; try doing that while holding X to shoot pursuing enemies behind you! How insanely difficult is that? This is one of the things I hate most about this downgraded game; the needlessly over-complicated new controls! When on foot, almost EVERY thing you do outside of shooting is with Y. This makes the game get confused or not do with you intended on doing. Like, getting into a car when you're trying to grab a human shield nearby. Or going into Buy Mode when you're trying to just open the door to exit the shop! Or accidentally betraying your ally by using them as a human shield when all you're trying to do is open the car door! Everything is like this! EVERYTHING! To mention, the new way you even grab Human Shields. You not only can't tap the button to toss them anymore, essentially eliminating that feature now, but it takes forever just to grab one and leaves you very vulnerable in trying to position them the way a person would in real life. This WOULD be the only way you could really protect yourself against bullets since there is no Cover system in 'Saints Row the Third,' but just trying to grab one is more trouble than it's worth and leaves your enemies ample time to just run behind you and shoot you from the back. Even if you have one, you can still die as they now leave your head unprotected from human shields, which can help you save innocent pedestrians against enemies using them, but also leaves you easy to die, too. You're better off making an attempt for cover than using that whole entire mess. Unless you're having a gunfight in a narrow hallway. So yeah, basically that whole Human Shield thing is 100% useless, now.The controls in this game are just overly-complicated when they do work, or they just don't work as intended, at all. The shooting controls seem to mostly be the same, at least, so that's good. But everything else has issues with it, and *really* makes you miss the Saint's Row 2 control scheme.2/10DESIGN PROBLEMS/GLITCHES: Just thought I should note these in here too, considering it's a sixty-to-seventy dollar game and all. Trying to get into a car never seems to work all the way unless you window-smash your way through it. It's because you don't hit the button to just open the car door, you hit the button to trigger your character to move to the car, open the door, and get it in. So it really triggers an animation rather than just opening a door. The problem is, the AI that does the animation is spotty, so if say, your car door is near a wall or street object, it gets confused, leaving you open to get shot to death or run over by a drunk driver. It's like they made the 'Bo Duke' window dive the priority way to get it and left the old 'just open the door' way glitched and buggy. (To be fair, SR2 worked this way as well, but at least it worked without less AI confusion. You also could just 'warp' into your car if you're on the roof or can't open the doors, but that's gone now, for reasons unknown and foolish.) Jumping into the car works well when in a heated gunfight, but you really don't want to do it all the time. But now, it's the only way to ensure you'll get into a car without fail. Of course, you may end up diving in the wrong car on several occasions, but at least your character won't get confused in trying to find the car door or get in.There are tons of bugs and problems in the game and many of them are minor, but some are noticeable, like objects and people getting stuck in the floor or wall. Or your skydiving parachute constantly showing up in your saved clothing outfits. I think it's always supposed to be there, only invisible, because you automatically have it when falling big distances. But now there's a bug where it keeps becoming visible.There's also no in-game clock now, either, so the day and weather just changes randomly. I'm sure most people won't seem to care about it, though, but I hate the inconsistency of the random day-and-night cycle and it's very irritating. I think it's day the majority of the time, but like I said, it's 100% random, now. It may have something to do with them not wanting to have standard hours so you can get paid \"hourly\" from the businesses you own.STORY MISSIONS/ACTIVITIES/GAME FEATURES: The story seems to... not really even be here, honestly. The storyline's supposed to be that the Saints made a huge criminal organization angry and now, they have to fight against them. That's as deep as it goes. There really are no story missions, as like, almost all of your freakin' missions are just Activity tutorials! All you seem to do is go on activities for characters and you really don't even have any story progression, outside a few minor ones. You also now have to call on your phone in order to start them; you can't go there and begin. The over-dependency of the cell phone is staggering. I won't get into how much I think they ruin society in general, but here, it makes you feel like you're constantly at work, and not in a good way. You can't explore anything or do anything without getting a call every ten minutes for some dumb Survival mission crap. None of them are really that useful and all of them are totally random. Not in the same way as the Pushbacks were in Saint's two, but just totally random. You also now have to find Gang bases and kill all of them, along with buying properties, in order to take over the city. They're hard to survive, but do-able. So in that regard, the storyline missions are kind of useless. Especially since all of them are just doing activities for people, anyway.Speaking of which, almost all of the activities have been eliminated. I'm guessing they did this for space, but it sure doesn't make the game any more fun. The best ones were FUZZ, Fight Club, Crowd Control & Trail Blazing. And now, all but the last one are gone. Instead, they left behind the worst possible (and probably easiest to program) activities: Escort, Snatch & Trafficking. Heli Assault and Mayhem are still around, and they were always okay. The thing that really sucks though is that you only have three instances of most of them. So we've gone down from a total of 24 rounds (3x8), 12 rounds (2x6), and now 3 rounds (3x1) per Activity from the first game to the third. At least, there is a new one out of the few left. The Japanese shooting obstacle course/survival game show, Professor Genki's Super Ethical Reality Climax. That one is fun, at least. There's also a bonus game outside of the campaign, Whored Mode, the evolution of 'Zombie Uprising.' Whored Mode is fun and probably more so than anything in the actual campaign. But it's short.Most of your Respect in the game's campaign will now come from doing things you already do, like taking human shields and taunting enemy gangs. You have a set goal in each of these, and those are now your source of Respect income. All the unlockable bonuses you used to be able to get you'll now have to buy with Respect points. While I do think it's good they gave more emphasis on the Respect system, as well as giving you more of a use for your money you earn, at least half of everything you have to unlock now came standard in the first two games. Plus, they're expensive, so you have to really work for them. And the activities not giving you anything except a small amount of money leaves them utterly pointless. So why bother doing the annoying Snatch and Escort activities now if they don't offer you anything?One of the most enjoyable things about the game is the character customization. While those who have online access will get far more than those without, it's still pretty good here, and the number of clothes, hairstyles, and taunts really help to bring your Saint to life. You can make almost anyone fairly well, and it's probably the best game feature, here.6/10MUSIC & VOICES: The music in this is even less good than the first game. While none of them have really had any major artists in them, at least Saint's two had much better music. And the first game just had really underground stuff in it. The music they got for this just seems like whatever they could afford. So the really-cheap-to-get Classical and 80's Hits, return. But nothing modern that is even remotely good, is here. With the exception of the game's Theme Song, \"Power\" by Kanye West. The music in this is sooo bad! Songs now also play during your (real) missions, so it helps to liven and enhance the experience, as opposed to playing in silence, like before. Too bad there's no good music here outside Kanye West, however.I'm sure I'm not the first one disappointed that Eliza Dushku couldn't come back as Shaundi, but the New Shaundi just seems unlikable in every way. I can't tell whether it's her voice or her overall makeover, but she just comes off as a nagging, uptight shrew now than the relaxed and likable character from the second game. It would've been nice to know whether this was because of the voice change or her character development. Either way, she's a completely different person now, and not for the better. Pierce is back too, so that's... great. But half of the new Boss' voices are pretty sucky. I think three may (or may not) be the same voice actor reprising their roles from Saint's Row 2. The Caucasian and Hispanic female sound the same as the second game, and the Cockney Jason-Statham-sound-alike may be the same voice. But the other two male voices are just horrible. And not really a plus or a minus, but they've replaced the African American female voice with a Russian woman (who makes the most stereotypical Russian remarks, so probably isn't a real accent/voice). Oh, and they added a Zombie voice for whatever reason. They love zombies. The actual dialogue flow in the game sounds unchanged, and the best parts of it come from the inbetween-missions parts, like getting your female Saint to rap along to a full song on the radio with Pierce while driving to a location. That was really fun.6/10OVERALL: Saint's Row The Third manages to be the next in the line of the games, but really feels much more like a step back than anything. Almost everything in the game feels downgraded (maybe because you're forced to upgrade everything back up to 'default setting') and the actual gameplay feels like a forced imitation Grand Theft Auto IV, from the controls, to the lighting and motion effects, to the motion capture, to the real-life weapons' sounds, motions and effects, to the 'realism.' The game just isn't fun anymore, even though they promote it like it really is. You're supposed to be shooting up rival gangs and having a blast, but instead, it just feels like you're just trying to survive and make it to another day in the country's most dangerous city. The gameplay speaks for itself. Still over-the-top in some ways (certainly not most of the time, anymore) but no longer actually \"fun.\" Why would they try to 'evolve' into a more realistic gaming experience when the thing that broke them out of the GTA-wannabe mold was their level of fun and absurdity?I'm about 30% through the game and at Respect level 20 at the time of writing this review, so maybe it'll pick up later, towards the end after everything has been Upgraded. But I truly feel like I don't even want to keep playing. This is one of those \"chore\" games, like Crackdown or Assassins Creed, where you have to do more menial work and 'building up an establishment' than just getting to play and have fun. This is the first and only Saints game where I haven't had to limit myself to stop playing so that I don't burn through it all in one week. When I stay up all Sunday night and play Saint's Row 2, I have to stop myself in the morning so that I can go to work in an hour. But with this, I'd rather cut the game off at midnight, go to sleep and not play it again until the weekend. That's the kind of feel and vibe this third Saint's game gives off. Saint's Row 2 would be a game you'd want to play forever if you didn't run out of stuff to do. But with this, you'd want to rent it and just play it for the Achievements. Then never play it again. It's so \"blah\" in that way. I guess it's still a (somewhat)good game, but a major downgrade from Saint's Row 2.22/50 (2.27 out of 5 Stars). Upgrading it to 3/5 stars is just generosity.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0002BJQDY","description":"Guild Warstakes the best elements of today's massively multiplayer online games and combines them with a new mission-based design that eliminates the tedium of those games. You can meet new friends in towns or outposts, form a party, and then go tackle a quest together. Your party always has its own unique copy of the quest map, so camping, kill-stealing, and long lines to complete quests are all things of the past. Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder.You don't have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don't have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you've previously unlocked. You'll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn't allow bad decisions to ruin a character. And you'll never meet new players only to discover that you can't play with them or compete against them because their characters are on a different server than yours; in Guild Wars, all characters live in one seamless world.Built for CompetitionAfter learning the game and building up your first character, you may choose to test your skills in head-to-head competition or guild warfare. The game is designed to reward player skill and teamwork, not time spent playing, so you won't need to spend hundreds of hours leveling up your character to compete.The game includes integrated support for guilds, with guild banners and halls, chat rooms and forums. Guilds can challenge other guilds to battle, compete for control of key parts of the world, and be ranked on a worldwide ladder.Unique Streaming TechnologyArenaNet's unique streaming technology forever eliminates the concept of patching a game. You don't have to wait a month for the next big patch to experience new content. Instead, the game constantly and intelligently streams new content to your computer in the background while you play.

{"product_name":"B005VKRGXI","description":"","reviewerName":"Subject7","summary":"The Almost Amazing Spiderman","reviewText":"As with most Spiderman games, you get quite a bit of unlockables in the form of costumes, comic book covers and art work. Web Rush is a welcomed addition and I love that there are so many indoor stages in an open world game, though I wish there were fewer sewer levels (I hate sewer levels). Spiderman himself looks amazing and the city of New York looks amazing. Swinging looks amazing, combat looks amazing and the stealth segments look amazing.And that's the problem, everything looks amazing but little of it actually feels amazing. Never in my entire play-through did I truly feel in control of what was happening on screen. Web swinging looks incredible but lacks the finesse that was prevalent in Ultimate Spiderman (I've never played Spiderman 2 or Web of Shadows so I can't vouch for them). Movement is quick but feels too loose and combat is flashy but lack substance. Spiderman executes showy multi-hit combos with little input from me, all while inflicting only meager damage to even the weakest of human foes. Meanwhile enemy attacks hit like sledgehammers with some magnetizing towards you even if you dodged. I saw the load screen a lot more than actual gameplay.The story is unspectacular, the acting painful at times, the characters unlikable save a few and the camera angles during dialogue cutscenes just plain dumb. Finishing this game was a chore that I forced on myself simply to make this a legitimate review. I chose this over Web of Shadows and I'm starting to regret that decision. I don't mean to sound so harsh because the game is really not that bad, but I got so little pleasure from playing it. I constantly lamented non existing game elements that existed in older Spiderman games.

{"product_name":"B000QY9C90","reviewerName":"Christopher R","summary":"Not enough maps.","reviewText":"I have been playing this game all weekend, and I can say with certainty that this game is an absolute blast.  It is nearly everything that I had hoped for.  The action is quick, fierce and brutal; the game is structured in such a way that teamwork is essential; strategy and coordination is a high priority.  I don't even worry about the settings.  I simply choose quick match and drop in on a campaign.Versus mode needs some improvement.  When playing as the infected, your \"boss\" character can be killed with one shotgun blast.  Even with coordination between the four members of your team, it is difficult to stay alive very long.  The only real strategy is to pin or disable a survivor and hope that the horde can finish the job.  This can be quite frustrating.  Fortunately, the games are structured in turns so that you're not stuck playing as the infected for long periods of time.Other than that minor complaint regarding versus mode, the only other complaint that I have is regarding the maps.  While they are fun, there are not nearly enough.  Four maps are not enough.  I suppose that if you count each component of a campaign set as a map onto itself, the number would increase.  That strategy is a bit of deception.  There are four campaign maps to go through--period.  The fact that they are linear means that you will never experience the map in a different way.  Sure, boss infected may come from different places in the map, but the layout is so constrained and limited that this does not offer much variation in successive rounds.On the whole, this game is a load of fun.  So far I haven't really been able to stop playing.  Facing horde after horde of zombies in such an entertaining first person shooter is something that I have looked forward to for a long time.  My only fear is that the limited number of maps will lead me to boredom sometime in the near future.  Hopefully Valve can publish some updates in order to keep this game fresh.Should you buy it?  I am a zombie fan, so it was not really a difficult decision.  Dead Rising was a bit of a disappointment.  This is the game that I have been waiting for.  If you're not a fan of the genre, you'll love it.  If you are a fan of first person shooters, but not zombie stuff, you probably ought to skip this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2008"}

Application is aided by a cutout layer that overlays over the action buttons and right stick, although it pays to read the separately included tip sheet before you try. No lint-free cloth is included, though, so I had to use my 3DS microfiber cloth. After I made sure there was absolutely no fingerprint or dust on my PSV's screen, I peeled off the backing film with the white label first; I found it easier to peel it off completely first. I then aligned the cutout per instructions and pressed the protector onto the screen, then peeled off the light green cutout sheet. There were a lot of bubbles but it was easy for me to get rid of them by rubbing on each one and pushing it towards the edge! Now there's not a single bubble and the film is invisible and it does not affect the touch sensitivity whatsoever! And it's perfectly aligned! The film is slightly bigger than the PSV's screen; this is a thoughtful design because it gives you a little margin of error when you align the film to the screen. I love this protector film, just wish they'd included a small piece of cleaning cloth.I also recommend Bluecell crystal hard case with stand for Sony playstation PS Vita PSV + Free cleaning Cloth which is a case with built-in kickstand and comes with a lint-free cloth!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2012"}

Oftentimes, said concept becomes wasted on otherwise lackluster game design, and they you have to wonder how it went so horribly wrong. While Timeshift isn't necessarily horrible, it takes a great \"time manipulation\" gameplay mechanic (oh no, a grenade...I'll just rewind time so I'm ready for it), and then fumbles it thanks to the ho-hum remainder of the game.An FPS really doesn't have to have a great story, but Timeshift's is notably weak. That wouldn't be so bad if it was backed-up by some particularly gratifying gameplay, but other than the timeshifting, the rest of the game plays like a hundred other FPS titles you've played before. The levels are extremely linear, and the level objectives are of the \"search and find the switch that opens the next level\" variety.Graphics really aren't the game's strong-suit either. It doesn't look awful, and some of the explosions are particularly nice to look at, but the engine stutters along in places where it really shouldn't. This is obviously a game that could have used a bit more time to tweak the engine on the PS3, because we're all aware of the fact that the PS3 can push a lot more onscreen than is happening in this game.All-in-all, Timeshift really isn't a bad game, just a dissapointing one. The online play is pretty good, and the campaign isn't awful, it's just that you know they could have done a lot more with the \"timeshifting\" abilities than they did.

That's not to say that I don't like Doom III.  But graphics and sound aside, it takes me back about 10 years.On my \"old\" P4 3.06, 1G RAM, GeForce 4 Ti, and Audigy 2, the game runs smoothly at 800x600, normal settings.  Raising the resolution or turning up the detail had little noticeable impact until the action increased, and then the game resembled a slide-show.Even at \"normal\" detail, the characters are very realistic (I caused a NPC to squint when I shined the flashlight in his face).  The sound is top-notch, and the mood of the game is established immediately thanks to the music (work of Trent Reznor?).The introduction of the PDA into the game is a fun twist.  Reading other people's e-mails via their PDA's will unlock in-game secret areas, which is pretty original.  If you have another computer in the house that has access to the internet while you're playing, you can visit game-mentioned websites for clues.As far as whether or not the game is scary... I jumped once.  That might not sound like much, but I don't scare easily.  I tried to be on the look-out, but they got me good - once.That was worth a star.  Based on that, the game went from 3 to 4 stars.From what I've seen, I'll appreciate and enjoy Half-Life 2 more than this game, but I'm sure I'll come back to Doom III after I buy a new machine in a year.  Please note, I'm not comparing the two, because they are two very different games.  When you're in the mood to take your time and work with other characters in a game, play Half-Life 2.

What could have been one of the most amazing, atmospheric games became instead an amazing graphical tour-de-force marred by repetitive gameplay.The GOOD:  Graphics are top notch, the sound is terrific and scary as anything, and the general mechanics of the game (move, shoot, etc) are well done.  The idea for the story is also fun and creepy, and this game is quite atmospheric and effective in its scare tactics.The BAD: This game is incredibly repetitive.  Run around post-industrial levels looking for a key to move on to the next area.  The levels are fun at first, but when you realize that you'll never go out on the Martian Landscape or even see a room bigger than a closet, you start to get bored.  The idea of making the game essentially pitch-black must have sounded good in development, but is incredibly frustrating and not fun in its implementation.  You can only hold a flashlight OR a weapon, meaning that you can either see the enemy and die, or shoot around in the dark and die.  Mmmmmmm... fun.  Thankfully the mod community has created a mod based on the assumption that duct tape still exists in the future, and thus allows you to tape the light to your guns.I would have hoped for more varied levels, more wide open areas (see Doom 1 & 2) and frankly, better gameplay.

This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak.

C3 is easier than both C1 and C2 at the same difficulty setting, primarily due to the battery lasting much longer, which allows you to cloak or deploy armor for longer period of time. Also, the bow is a lot of fun and gives you the ability to do one-shot kills and remain cloaked after the shot. You can also reclaim the arrow so you don't need to worry about running out.Positives+ Great visuals and level design. The graphics are not quite as polished as Far Cry 3, but still outstanding, and definitely superior to C1 and C2.+ Versatile bow with multiple types of arrows is totally fun!+ Ability to customize the armor using skill points is great.+ Map levels are humongous and allows you to choose your own strategy/approach. The various paths are NOT explicit displayed to you as in C2, which can be considered a positive or negative. Personally I thought this made things more realistic and more fun to explore and find your way instead of picking from one of the prescribed paths.+ Armor customization can now be saved as 'packages' which can be set any time during the game to allow you the ability to apply specific armor configuration for the situation you are in.+ Weapons feel and sound great!+ Musical score and sound effects are very good.Negatives- Enemy AI still has amazing aim, and hardly miss, which means you almost always have to either user armor or cloak.- Enemies detect you from a long way away.- Plot isn't any better than the other Crysis games, but I doubt most people care much about this.- Some mission objective markers do NOT show text popup when you are near them, which can be confusing. Not a deal-breaker by any means.Total playtime for campaign mode was about 8 hours for me, which is just fine.

Patches usually will occur throughout the season to fix major gameplay issues. Nothing really bad enough for me to take this game back or complain about it like many are doing. Everything else feels great, the passing, the running game, great atmosphere. My only major nitpick is the commentary. It's pretty bad. Seems rushed and unpolished. They also got rid of the classic NFL Films music. This is a major bummer for nostalgic purposes and was great to hear that music on the past Maddens.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2011"}

I don't mean the smoothies where they try to pass a powder off for the real thing, more like a fresh fruit yummy and tasty one. This game does borrow many elements from other games and in turn makes them its own. For example the numerous cut scenes in between the action (Uncharted 2: Among Thieves), the button mashing (God of War) and the dead soldier exploration (X-Men Origins: Wolverine) just to name a few. All of which are great games in their own respects and honestly who could blame anyone for looking to those titles for inspiration. Throw them in a blender with some Castlevania, mix well and when all is said and done you have Lords of Shadow. Now with that being said there is a pit in this smoothie, which is mainly the camera. The camera is not the worse I've ever seen but it can get frustrating at times, but truthfully it's not to the point where you would be deprived of an enjoyable experience with this game. Great action, fun puzzles, epic boss battles, incredible visuals and of course it's Castlevania, what more do I have to say.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2010"}

{"product_name":"B004FS8LYK","description":"","reviewerName":"Shawn Bird","summary":"My Tomb Raider Review","reviewText":"I have never played any of the previous Tomb Raider games. I have seen some of the first couple played from time to time, but nothing about them caught my interest at all. So I can not do any comparing really from those to the new rebooted Tomb Raider that has given birth to a new Lara Croft. Crystal Dynamics did what I think a lot of developers wish they could do with big budget well known game series. Not only did they go out on a limb to reboot Lara Croft and the Tomb Raider franchise, but they did it with great success as well.All of have ever known about Lara Croft is she is rich, raids tombs and loves adventure. With this reboot it basically shows us the start of Lara's addiction to adventure. She has set out to make her mark as an archeologist on a ship with a crew that is looking to create a reality TV show. The set piece is the lost island kingdom of Yamatai. However things go sideways as the ship crashes them onto the island and Lara is quickly separated from her friends. From there Lara learns quickly that she must do anything necessary to survive.Crystal Dynamics said before the launch of this Tomb Raider that they wanted to make players feel like they had to protect Lara as they played through the game. That isn't the case at all. In fact playing as Lara is no different then playing almost any character in similar situations and actually goes a bit farther than that. I personally don't like playing females in video games; simply because I am not one, but playing as Lara Croft was the closest to a female protagonist I have felt since Jill Valentine in Resident Evil 3. Lara Croft came across to me as a very independent and strong character, which did not need anyone taking care of her.Lara Croft is quickly thrown into an environment were she has to do anything to survive and she does by all means necessary. Tomb Raider does a great job of blurring the lines of adventure and stealth. One minute you will be running around the area and the next you will be sneaking up on your enemies to take them out quietly. Or you can if you choose run in guns blazing, but the bow Lara gets quickly in the game makes the stealth quiet way of doing things most fulfilling. If that is not your style Lara gets her hands on a few other weapons in the game in line of a pistol, rifle, climbing ax and a shot gun. All of which can be upgraded throughout the game. None of them are as fun and again fulfilling as the bow, especially the shot gun. A shot gun should not take around four shots to kill someone up close. When Lara is not in battle she gets around usually by climbing rock sides and others with ropes to slide down or climb up. You will also unlock different tools and such to use with the weapons to also help you get around. This enhances the game play allowing you to go back through to get collectables that you before could not get.Outside of the main story of Lara trying to get her friends and herself off this island alive, there is also tombs to be... well, raided of course. These tombs do give a break in the main game play, but they are all very short lived however. They all usually take all of five minutes to complete with one or maybe to puzzles total in each. Not only is there not a lot of puzzle solving, but they are easy to solve on top of it. The tomb raiding does seem like they are very tacked on at best and most of the focus in the game went to the main story and adventure that lies there. Of course being I have not played a Tomb Raider game before I can not at all compare tombs of before to the ones in this game, but I can assume there was much more to the tombs in old Tomb Raider games, simply because these are so simple and watered down.Tomb Raider is a pretty linear game, but it is well masked with the ability to go back to old locations and that most locations are open for you to play around in after the baddies are all dead to search for salvage, complete challenges and find hidden things such as GPS caches. This also helps break up some of the repetitiveness of killing bad guys and also if you find fun to swinging and climbing around this will add to the length of the game. It also gives you the opportunity to just simply look around you. Tomb Raider has arguably the best graphics of any console game to date and looking around the environment is absolutely breath taking to say the least. Even during cut scenes the game at times almost looks real to life. It is like you really are watching a movie.The only thing that feels more tacked on in Tomb Raider than the raiding of tombs is the multiplayer. I would have given it more time, but I didn't have to. It is by far probably the worst multiplayer I have played in a long time. The controls don't feel as smooth as the single player causing your character to clunk around while running or aiming down opponents. The lag is horrific and completely game breaking more times than not. There was even an instant that right as a game was starting someone came from behind and killed me, within seconds of the match starting. This wasn't me coming into a game late and not paying attention. This was I was in the lobby and then the match started. There is a short count down as you look at your character before each match starts. So either the game is that bad to have someone kill me so quickly or someone glitched, either way it is a problem with the multiplayer and should have been addressed. There is no excuse this day in age to have a multiplayer be this broken.The multiplayer might be a nightmare, but it is not at all the reason to play this game. I am sure hardcore fans of Tomb Raider games and of Lara Croft will find issues with the new tone for her and where this new series is going, but it is amazing nonetheless. Lara Croft is never crying or whining, she strong and takes all that comes at her in stride. Some might say this is dark compared to the other games, but Crystal Dynamics humanized Lara Croft and put her through the wringer making her one of the greatest adventures I have ever seen. I love what this game is and can not wait to see what is next for Lara Croft. This is a must have for anyone that loves action and adventure in their video games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2013"}

A bit more variety in these areas that seem open would be nice. Still they get the job done and nothing is boring, just not as good as it could have been. But this is honestly the games weakest spot.Combat is actually one of this game's high points. Nilin is athletic and agile, maneuvering around the field to keep herself two steps ahead of the baddies. However she's not a powerhouse who can simply slug it out with people who have an obvious advantage in strength. She has to use her speed to overcome them while keeping aware of the field around her. The enemies also do not fight \"fair\" they will do their best to box you in and deny you your greatest asset which is mobility, making for a quick reload to last save point. Some have complained about the combat not being intuitive enough. Frankly they are wrong. The combo's are as intuitive as you the player make them. Three main combinations that you can customize for various effects in a fight. If you want a long chain of large damage strikes go for it. If you want to mix it up with health regeneration and stamina for her special attacks, you can do that.Bugs. I always make a blurb about bugs on games since they can be game breakers.

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"bixodoido","summary":"My \"family\" console","reviewText":"I have long been a Nintendo fan but was, I confess, a bit turned off by the Gamecube.  The games were so limited, it seemed everything cool was coming out for either the PS2, the Xbox, or both (and not the Gamecube), and the proprietary titles (Mario Kart, Zelda, etc), great as they were, were not enough to keep me enthralled with the console.That having been said, my Wii has rekindled my interest in console gaming.  The unique techology of the controllers, the family-style games, and the virtual console were just appealing to me--so I took the plunge.  And already this thing is well worth the price (and it is the cheapest of this generation of consoles).Most of the great Wii games I've encountered so far are more appealing to either a multiplayer or a more casual audience.  I consider myself a hardcore gamer but do most of my gaming on the PC, so this console is perfect when I just want to relax and enjoy a nice, enjoyable game with my family.  My wife, my kids, my parents and friends--almost everyone I know enjoys playing the Wii.  I don't know that this would be my first choice if I were exclusively a console gamer, but as it is it serves my purposes very well.  And it's got many of the non-gamers I know hooked.One of the great features the Wii offers is the \"virtual console\"--the ability to download (for pretty cheap) many older games from Nintendo's earlier consoles, the Sega Genesis, and the TG 16.  This, to me, is a great feature.  While many of these games are not as enjoyable as they once were the nostalgia factor is incredible, and there's nothing quite like downloading the original Zelda for a pittance and spending a few hours messing around with it and just remembering \"the good ol' days.\"  And with new titles being released every week or so this is sure to continue to be a great feature of the Wii.In short: someone looking into this gaming console with the express desire to play very intense, \"hardcore\" games will probably be served better by the XBox 360.  But for anyone who wants an enjoyable gaming experience with high playability and loads of fun I highly recommend the Wii.  The innovative design and enjoyable games will provide countless hours of casual entertainment.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2007"}

I've played Zelda, sports, and wario ware, and all of them are great fun and entirely fresh gaming experiences.  The remote is truly awesome, and swinging Link's sword or my baseball bat or golf club are all really sensitive and rewarding.My wife, who only enjoys puzzle games, can play wii sports for hours at a time and truly enjoys Zelda!  Indeed, I suspect that a great many \"non-gamers\" are going to get addicted to the game play here.  My friend played boxing so long, he broke a sweat and his arms hurt the next day.  No more couch potato gaming with wii sports.  There are more fun titles at launch then there were for the 360 or the PS3, and its price point can't be beat.A lot of the \"channels\" and online stuff are great fun, too.  The beta version of the web browser bring a farily functinal net browser to my HDTV (I watched youtube videos on it for about an hour the other day).  I've had nothing but trouble getting my 360 to work with my router, but the Wii has been trouble free.  The online weather and news channels are great.  The photo channel is cool and can even play .mov videos.  The Mii channel is kind of fun because as you create little \"Mii\" characters, they begin to populate the games you play.  It's just a nice touch.Also, I have to rave for a second about their true backwards compatability with the Game Cube (memory cards, disks, even joysticks).  I'm visiting Resident Evil 4 in high def now.  If you never had a cube, this is a great way to explore the library.  I also have to thank Nintendo for using a standard scan disk memory card for the memory.  You can pull one out of your pda, phone, or camera and save $50 for a system-only memory card.The one downside I have is that you have to upgrade to high def and buy a component cable on your own.  Then again, anyone shopping for graphics should look at the other two systems and get over it.  (If you do buy a component cable, but the mad catz, it's only $20 on Amazon, and it works great!)I'm not going to go in to any great depth here (there are plenty of lengthy reviews abounding about the wii, just scroll down).  I just want to add my 5 star rating to the mob. If you can find one, this is a superb system.  It's small, it doesn't overheat, and you're going to have some truly unique gaming experiences with this one (and Mario isn't even out yet!).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2007"}

I was excited to play another stealth action game that were fairly limited at the time. To put it simply, I was very let down by assassins creed. It was incredibly easy due to the idiotic enemies that attacked you and died one by one(wait for one to attack, counter, instant kill, repeat). It was incredibly repetitive as well. Every assassination boiled down to the same step by step formula EVERY single time and the steps were boring(sit on a bench for 5 minutes and listen to uninteresting info. Seriously?) I could only bear going through a few of these cycle before I just got bored to tears. That's not to say that the game didn't have anything going for it. The sound was great and the visuals were very well done. The world was pretty and big. And the story was unique. I just couldn't get past the AI and the repetitiveness. Fortunately, the developers listened to complaints similar to mine and made the necessary changes to release a fantastic sequel.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2012"}

It truly is in every sense of the word. The music helps pull you into the game, the scenery is amazing, and once you've climbed a few of the towers you'll notice the city and general countryside is as well.The thing is once you've climbed one tower you generally have a pretty decent idea of how beautiful it is and climbing nine others is pointless. However, climbing towers and assisting men and women being beaten up in the streets seems to be the majority of the game. There are also mini missions revolving around pick pocketing, listening in on conversations, and beating up people for information but they too get repetitive quickly.Combat is enjoyable but once you get the hang of it really easy, especially with the parrying ability. I remember attacking a swarm (10 or so) guards all at once. I managed to easily kill all of them which seems a bit strange because despite how skilled a man is I don't think he could take a small platoon down himself. Especially if you consider the nature of this game it would make more sense if you were more skilled but if in situations such as that you wouldn't be so overpowered. Your role is to hide in the shadows not act as a hooded fashionably challenged Zoro.In general it's a nice concept and interesting to play but it's nothing to get too excited about. The greatest part of this game has to be just playing through town with no set goal killing off someone and hiding. While it sounds like something an adolescent would enjoy it's fun to just see how people respond.All that said, it was a fun game off and on. I enjoyed the beginning, got tired of it, continued playing, and got even more tired of it. It could have been made better but it does reach out into an area that formerly was not really well defined so for that purpose it at least opens the door to future games of this type which hopefully will be more enjoyable.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2008"}

The combat is fluid, the graphics are beautiful, and the sound is really well done.  The story is your typical betrayal/revenge deal, but the main point of the game is to massacre everything from point A to point B for about 8 hours.  Stringing together combos and using the environment to kill your enemies is fun for a while, and there are a wide variety of ways to do this, but I eventually just kept using the same simple combos over and over.  Those who are offended by harsh language and exploding/maimed/dismembered bodies need not apply, as the game contains a lot of both.  I didn't get a chance to play the multiplayer/co-op so those modes did not hurt or help my score of the game.

PowerA was one of the first ones out of the gate with their Moga series of controllers. This is the mobile version that holds your phone while you play. It's Bluetooth so there are no cords tethered to your device. The controller is very well designed and sturdy, it doesn't feel cheap at all.I love the ergonomics of this controller. The middle of the controller has a flip up phone holder. It can hold up to 6&#8243; phones, so everything up to the Samsung Note II. The top and bottom of the clip has rubber grips so your phone doesn't slip out, and it keeps it from getting scratched. Getting the controller to connect is a breeze. The initial setup is done with the Moga Pivot app, it also scans your device for games that can be played with the controller. You can also navigate and launch these apps with the controller. The controller sits well in your hands, and is powered by 2 AA batteries, each is housed in either side of the controller. PowerA went for minimalism with this controller and they nailed it.The only issue with the controller is that it feels too rigid. The buttons aren't very soft and make a loud clicking sound. The thumbstick nubs are a bit stiff and there's no D-pad. I like the L and R triggers which feel great for shooting games and racing. I wish the controller had analog sticks rather than nubs. It's really hard to adjust to these in a shooter, I had to turn the sensitivity way down in the game to make it feel somewhat normal. The controller is also lacking bumpers which could have fit just fine. So there's a bit of a learning curve with this controller.At least is comes with two free games, Pac-Man and Sonic CD. It also includes a really nice leather case to hold your controller in. The biggest issue of all is that there aren't many games that support this thing. There is a free universal driver app to use in emulators which is probably the main reason why someone would buy this. I was able to play a GBA, SNES, PS1, and Genesis emulator with no issues. Other than this, this is well worth the $40 for anyone looking for a controller without having to buy special cables, rooting, or buying expensive apps.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00000DMB2","reviewerName":"Patrick L. Randall","summary":"Quintessential Star Wars game for the N64","reviewText":"When the N64 system first kicked off, one of its first titles was \"Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire\".  \"Shadows...\" was a very entertaining version of novel it was based on.  It had challenging, yet rewarding, levels and overall solid gameplay.  However, it had two marks against it.  The first was that graphics had not fully realized the potential of the N64 and resembled SuperNES games on certain boards.  The second is that, except for the sheer enjoyment of the playing the game again, \"Shadows...\" lacks any real replay value.  The introduction of \"Star Wars: Rogue Squadron\" (based on a series of very successful novels) to the N64 environment corrected these problems and set a whole new standard for action/adventure games on ANY platform.\"Rogue Squadron\" focuses on the missions of the famed Rogue Squadron, thought to be the most dangerous and lethal fighter pilot unit in the entire galaxy.  Led by the legendary Wedge Antilles, the squadron fights 16 regular missions (and 3 bonus missions) ranging from defending the homestead on the deserts of Tatooine to rescuing prisoners from the spice mines of Kessel to battling the terrifying 'World Devastators' on Mon Calamari.  That just barely scratches the surface of the exotic locales where missions take place.  The graphic environment is much more advanced this time around.  No more static matte backgrounds.  Everything is fluid and moves with the player.  The gameplay has also been enhanced.  Greater control is afforded to the joystick button on the control pad when it comes to manipulating the ships.  Overall, it makes for a spectacular gaming experience.\"Rogue Squadron\" also adds a new twist that dramatically enhances its replay ability.  It awards medals (bronze, silver, gold) for defeating a level with increasing degrees of efficiency.  Achieving all of a certain kind of medal on all the regular missions also unlocks bonus missions.  This creates a greater challenge and a greater sense of accomplishment once the challenge has been met.There is only one minor quibble about \"Rogue Squadron\".  In the game designers' quest to make a very demanding game, they make some of the levels almost too hard to defeat even with the highest level of skill.  The most glaring example of this is the level 'Raid on Sullust'.  Flying as a (supposedly) heavily armored Y-Wing, one is supposed to be able to fly skillfully and defeat the mission.  However, the board is heavily populated with missile turrets that defend each of the 12-15 targets that must be hit.  With skillful flying, it may be possible to knockout 3 or 4 of those targets and corresponding guns and turrets before dying, but on the life, it's likely the next ship could be destroyed in less than 10 seconds.  With only 3 ships per mission, it's impossible to defeat that mission without using the 'unlimited lives' cheat code (which will NOT be revealed here).  However, there's no shame in using that code, and it is necessary if one intends to achieve the silver or gold medals.  So, it's a minor annoyance.\"Rogue Squadron\" raised the bar to an exceptionally high level for action/adventure games that other platforms have repeatedly shown a failure to meet.  Nintendo still gets it, though, as it followed this game with the even more successful \"Rogue Leader\" for GameCube.  \"Rogue Squadron\" is a must have for any serious gamer's library.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2002"}
