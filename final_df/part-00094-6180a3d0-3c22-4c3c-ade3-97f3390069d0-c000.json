In fact, it isn't even worth the price listed currently.  Try to get it for less.  This could have been a great game except for a number of factors.  It has an complex and interesting combat system that sort of works.  The timing of the button mashing must be precise or the game doesn't respond to the attacks you want unless you use the special charm and then it does whatever it wants to do.  This is fine and dandy until you get into the portals and find that that doesn't work quite right either in certain portals.  The game does have replay value but the game has a simply mind-numbing story line and endless cut scenes that interfere with your battles and are aimed to bring your scores down.  There is even one cut scene that goes on and on for about 10 minutes that will put you to sleep it is so boring to listen to. The battle for that one is quite easy on all levels and is over in less than 2 minutes except for the annoying end where you have to guide you lipstick bullet past shards of glass without hitting one of them and ruining your score.  There is one battle that is not part of the main story line against a fallen angel named Rodin that is next to impossible to win unless you have the charm you are supposed to get from beating him that you can fortunately get through a cheat code if you fail in you attempts without it.  The game can be quite stunning to look at but it can be also annoying to play for many of the factors I mentioned.  It is an okay game I guess and can be enjoyable but it could have been so much better had the storyline not be so stupid and the battles so interfered with by the endless cutscenes.  Many of the battles also seem repetitive and many of the boss battles are by the numbers battling bosses that are hard to get at.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2011"}

With a never before seen sense of movement and perspective, you will be drawn into Faith&#x2019;s world. A world that is visceral, immediate, and very dangerous. Live or die? Soar or plummet? One thing is certain, in this city, you will learn how to run.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"3.5;","reviewText":"Back when I first bought a Playstation 3, I played a game called Assassin's Creed which everyone before its release was hailing as a true next-gen action title. Only when it came out, people found it very repetitive, glitchy and even chore-like where you felt compelled to finish it but not necessarily falling in love with it either. Mirror's Edge is not quite there but it's still one of those titles where the more I want to love, the more the gameplay annoys me, the story is just uninteresting or certain mechanics don't feel well as it should. It's like other games where the \"uniqueness\" of the whole experience overshadows any faults the game has and while I do feel like I want to play it when it's not on, the more the faults just keep coming.Story: In a totalitarian future, the world isn't dark, grey and dingey Blade Runner-esque but rather it's lifeless, sterile and looks almost boring. With the government controlling information flow and with its own degree of corruption, found along the city's rooftops are \"runners\", messengers/couriers with vital information and packages that they hand off to other runners. But when runner Faith finds her twin sister accused of a murder she didn't commit and a clue is found at the scene, Faith has to get to the bottom of it all, and running like hell.Graphics: Whatever your thoughts on the game, there's no denying the game does have a sense of style. Largely in whites with the occasional bit of colour, it's definately a feat to have bland look great. The entire game is from Faith's point of view so unlike Gordon Freeman who seemed to float up ladders, Faith's entire body will be seen such as when you drop kick, climb ladders, do rolls and whatnot. It really helps the immersion factor and makes the game stand out on its own visually. What might turn people off is the cutscenes which look like a cross between the cutscenes from \"Killer 7\" and a more rounded version of \"Samurai Jack\". While they look fine, the tone of realism and cartoony might seem a bit too disconnected.Sound/Music: The game's anchored by \"Still Alive\" (no not Glados' song from Portal) and that sets the tone for the rest of the music, a kind of electronical ambience. That is when there's actual music since most of it is actually just the city itself from car horns to engine sounds, the sound and music work quite well. Ditto for the voice acting with roles that aren't really standouts but the line readings aren't cheesy or melodramatic and it's nice to actually see a main character in an FPS do more than say a one-liner now and then (Master Chief, anyone?)Gameplay: The game is a unique FP...um, there is shooting elements but it's more of a first-person platformer with Faith jumping over fences and low obstacles or sliding under them baseball-style with the feet right in front of her, which is perfect for low kicks on enemies. Controls take some getting used to but essentially it's up controls such as jumping or climbing up ledges (L1), down controls such as rolling from long falls or sliding under obstacles (L2), a quick turn-around uses for quick getaways or doing wall-runs to higher places (R1) and R2 which handles your kicking and punching. While it's different than X being jump, square being attack etc, it's remarkably intuitive.But then comes the crux of the game's problems: interacting with the world itself. I will say this: when the game's on, it's ON with Faith doing so much acrobatic manuevers, you'd be hard-pressed not to look back and what you did and go \"holy crap, I actually pulled all that off?\" However this also comes with more frequent moments of missed jumps, ledges that should've been grabbed but Faith's hands just stay at their sides or trying to do one move only she doesn't seem to want to actually do that move. Yes it's fun when it gets going and I don't mind challenges but most of this game seems like you're trying to work around the game's control flaws rather than you just being a \"bad player\".Enemy encounters will also be here and one way to deal with them is to, of course run, but on occasions you will have to fight some and pressing square triggers a Reaction time which is basically just bullet-time and helps with nailing the enemies with a drop kick or disarming them. However, sometimes the animation doesn't even register your move even when the gun is ready to be disarmed and making an enemy stagger doesn't allow a disarm either. So instead of getting rid of his gun when he's all winded, I have to wait for him to try to hit me before I can access the \"disarming\" part? Boo. While there is some gunplay, it's a lot more challenging to not fire a single bullet (and there's even a trophy/achievement for it).One thing I should mention is that yes the game is short, depending on how quick you can get through the levels without constantly hearing your bones break underneath you but it's near 6-9 hours for the 9 chapters but with time trials and ghosts (characters entirely in red doing one route which you try to meet or best), there is a great replay value to shaving seconds off your time but as for the main story, it's not super long but doesn't really wear out its welcome either.If it sounds like I'm being too negative then sorry but I know most people will automatically find this unhelpful and that my gripes are me just being a bad player or that I don't appreciate the \"uniqueness\" of it all but sometimes, a game with flaws is a game with flaws and Mirror's Edge has em, as much as I want to say it didn't.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2008"}
{"product_name":"B008CP6Q6M","description":"","reviewerName":"Jeffrey Owens","summary":"A Franchise of Greatness","reviewText":"What can I say, an amazing franchise. I've had this collection for a year now, and have beaten both games multiple times, each time just as amazing as before. This is a collection that follows a man, Cole McGrath, who is the center of an accident that makes him a human lightning rod basically; he has the ability to wield lightning as a weapon, and to recharge he just drains surrounding electrical sources for energy. Without spoiling too much of the story, Cole must undergo in both games a sort of journey to become a hero or a villain; a savior and protector, or a selfish person only concerned with himself, or maybe even someone who is a mixture of both. With that last one, there really isn't a neutral ground in the game, but you can pick and decide to do whatever in both games. And that is one of my favorite things of the game: choice. You choose to make small choices to big ones, from stopping a mugging or cutting down a helpless person from a light pole, to choosing between letting citizens have access to a stockpile of food or killing a few to keep all the food to yourself. The choices you make have a huge impact on the outlook of your character, how people view you and interact with you, what missions are available and abilities are available, even the environment changes with your morality shifts.The graphics, textures, and aesthetics are fantastic; sure the first one is a bit dated now, but it still looks great for when it did release, and hell it function and plays fantastically still. But the second one is where the graphics, the textures, the animations, game play, and such are at the best of the series. The shooting mechanics, the melee mechanics, the environments, the powers, and everything else react, play, and control wonderfully and are very fun, even when things get hairy and difficult. Never once did I get angry to where I had to stop out of pure frustration (unlike Killzone 2, ugh that game can get me mad when playing it on the hardest difficulty). In any case, the looks, feels, and controls of the games are amazing.The first one has no multiplayer component, but the second introduced a multiplayer component in the form of  User Generated Content (UGC). Essentially, this means that the players get to create, customize, and play their own missions and each other's missions that they create, all being shared and enjoyed through the community. You still play the UGC's by yourself, but you can access other PSN player created missions at any time when on the PSN.This is an amazing franchise that Sony should be grateful for, and I think they are so with how much they interact with Sucker Punch on the new Infamous project. I highly recommend this game to everyone who has access or owns a PS3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2013"}

Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Brian Nallick \"METALMANMN\"","summary":"Gaming Heaven","reviewText":"My beloved N64.The console that ushered in a new era of awesomeness.In direct competition to the newly arrived Playstation.Funny how this whole thing turned out.According to gaming legend Nintendo were supposed to collaborate with Sony to create a new disc based console.That deal fell through and the Playstation was born while Ninetendo released the N64.Playstation ended up whooping Nintendo big time but it's funny how the roles have now reversed with the Wii and PS3.Anyway....The N64.Widely praised for a slew of stunning and ground breaking games.

The graphics look good for the most part. This game, like other Tom Clancy games, focuses more on combat realism than on action. You must take cover, just as you would in real life if you were in such gunfights. There is small margin for error. One or two hits and you are toast. Forget about healing from behind cover as you can in Resistance, Rainbow Six: Vegas, and other modern shooters. Waiting behind cover does not seem to make much difference in how much damage you can take. Forget about picking up health in the form of food or medkits. Again, the game is highly realistic. The way you can heal is by calling over a medic if you have one in your party. And herein lies one of the negatives about this game: poor AI. Your team members can be good soldiers if you manually target an enemy and command them to attack it. However, I feel that there is too much babysitting of your teammates when they should be able to work more independently. Often when you call your medic he is slow to respond, and may run right through gunfire getting himself killed as if he was waiting for the exact wrong time to come over.Additionally, there are annoying flashing pop-ups that come on your screen quite frequently which will not leave your screen unless you hit select, go to an aerial reconnaissance screen, and then hit select again to return to the game. Some players may like to get a bird's eye view so often, but forcing players who just want to play the game to do this is obnoxious.Bottom line: Get Rainbow Six: Vegas instead. It is similar in play, has a good degree of combat realism, though with the ability to heal within a few seconds behind cover.

Using the basic gameplay and graphics of Halo 3, ODST is neat and different in some ways and disappointingly samey in others.ODST follows a squad of drop troopers - primarily through the eyes of Rookie, a silent protagonist. Rookie proceeds through the abandoned, dead city of New Mombasa looking for records of his teammates, who he was separated from. Finding these records allows you to play a segment as another trooper - Buck, the leader, Mickey, the tech specialist, Dutch, the tough guy, or Romeo, the sniper.Rookie's segments are really freeform and open - you explore the city, going through apartments and back alleys and occasionally running into random patrols of Covenant soldiers. The city's AI, the Supervisor, will occasionally try to get your attention by hijacking various city systems - signs will change to point you in the right direction, phones will start ringing, ticket machines will start spewing tickets, crosswalks and traffic lights will change, and so on. These directions will lead you to audio diaries - clues to a side-story - or weapon/ammo caches. All in all, it makes for a really great feel - almost to the level of Silent Hill - and it's backed up by some of the best music in the series.The action stages are pretty good, too, but far more traditional. There is some openness in the levels, but for the most part they're similar to normal Halo 3. This is where the main promise of ODST - the fact that you're playing as a normal soldier - kind of falls flat. You can basically do everything that the Master Chief can do, including but not limited to flipping over cars and punching through tanks. Your health works slightly differently, but it still basically equates to \"if you get hit, go duck behind cover until you recover\". You can get away with running up to Brutes and punching them in the face until they die. All in all, you basically demonstrate the same level of \"super-soldier\" that the actual super soldiers have, as opposed to having to rely on your wits and your guns to overcome your weakness.In addition to the campaign mode, ODST also offers a four-person co-op mode called \"Firefight\". In this mode, the human players attempt to hold out as long as they can against waves of Covenant troops. Like Gears of War 2's Horde mode, this can be a blast with the right people. To add a bit of difficulty into the mix, each wave of Covenant has a special effect attached to them - the ability to dodge grenades, or being more resistant to plasma, and so on. This ensures that the endless waves of Covenant continue to be challenging for as long as you play.The graphics are similar to Halo 3's, but the urban environment is much more well-designed than those in Halo 3. A lot of care went into designing the city and the various signs and objects scattered around it, and the end result feels pretty natural. The sound is really good, too. The most obvious change, sound-wise, is that an injured ODST will pant and groan realistically instead of offering a single grunt like the Master Chief does. This makes it feel a lot more immersive, and is almost worth the fact that - for game reasons - you can heal up really easily and dying's not really that big of a deal.On the whole, I understand why ODST didn't take a more realistic approach, but that doesn't mean it's not disappointing. As a game, ODST is good, but with some eye-rolling flaws that could've been turned into something more meaningful than \"another Halo game\".8/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2009"}

The quality of the game and frames will depend on your network and the signal from both your PS3 and PS Vita.Both games share a key feature. They both have an ominous feel to it that will keep you glued to the controller. The background sounds are creepy and quiet, not really sure how to explain it, but it gives the games a unique feeling.If there's something I could complaint about, would be ICO's controls, that at times can be frustrating, the feeling is gone after a few minutes of trial and error. Players new to the series may have mixed feelings, because at heart, this is a PS2 game. Fans of the series will pleased to see the great games looking better than ever, but most importantly, to see that the games have not been altered in any way that would ruin the great original experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2012"}

Nintendo, Super Nintendo, Genesis, Playstation, Game Gear, Nomad, and now Gamecube and PS2. But My two favorite systems are undoubtedly the Dreamcast and the Saturn. And my favorite of the two is undoubtedly the Saturn.The saturn was a well-built machine. Despite its internal workings being less than perfect in some ways (it was designed to work with squares rather than triangles when rendering, and had multiple processors sharing the main load) it also had some surprisingly good ideas (like built in memory for game saves and an expansion slot for memory upgrades and save backups). But what really impressed me about the hardware is the fact that even though the machine has been extinct for years, every one that I've encountered works perfectly. Now I'm sure that some of them just plain gave out, or were dropped or something. But I have never had a Saturn not load a game. I have never seen a Saturn freeze up or crash. I have never seen one stutter while playing movies. And my playstation started doing those things years ago (I finally had to get rid of it and pay for a replacement). Also worthy of mention is the fact that the original saturn controller is what I consider to be the finest designed controller in all of video game history. I fits my hand PERFECTLY. Playing games like Panzer Dragoon II, or Rayman with this controller is simply amazing. And speaking of Panzer Dragoon II...The Saturn had what I consider to be the greatest selection of games ever. The best version of Rayman (my favorite side-scrolling game ever) is on the Saturn. Radiant Silvergun (what many consider to be the best shooter ever) is for Import Saturn. Nights into Dreams (the greatest game Sonic Team ever made) is for Saturn. And what about Sega Rally (quite possibly the greatest rally racing game ever)? Truly, when you take the imports into consideration, the Saturn had an outstanding selection of games. Whatever you want, you can get. Want fighting games? Strategy games? Side-scrollers? Arcade racing? RPGs? The Saturn delivers. Big Time.The Sega Saturn is truly a system for the hardcore. And many games for it can be had for as little as three or four dollars. And with the system itself running about $30.00 or thereabouts for one in good shape, everyone should have one. Now if only the Price of the import games would drop a little on ebay...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2003"}

They didn't even make a full Sonic game on it. Sonic 3D Blast and Sonic R don't count. They were developing a 3D Sonic game called Sonic Xtreme, but it was a disaster. It had already been moved from Genesis to 32X, and then the Saturn. The directors of the game were being switched constantly, the final one almost died from stress. At one point Xtreme was using the Nights Into Dreams 3D engine, but then they got in trouble for it and had to start from scratch. So Sega made a console and never had an actual Sonic game on it.

Successful? Hardly.","reviewText":"I should make one thing clear before I kick off this review: I do not like MMORPGs.  I have never played a MMORPG that I liked, however I always go into these games with an open mind, so understand that this is not MMORPG bias i'm basing this review on.It had to happen sooner or later: Star Wars as a MMORPG.  I was very hyped up and very interested in this game for about 5 or 6 months.  Since I harbor such a strong dislike for Ever Quests, I dismissed this game initially as EQ in Space, but as I read on about all the features Star Wars would have, I was generally intrigued.  I bought the game on launch day, and the disappointment began.  The launch day problems were rampant, which is to be expected of course, since so many people were trying to get in that the servers were overloaded.  I was able to finally register and log in about a day after I got the game.Character Creation was decent...you can edit alot about the character, from body type to facial construction.  You choose from a few base classes, and then go on from there to expand the class and branch off into a more advanced class, such as Bounty Hunter or Weaponsmith or Commando.  What is good about this is that you can take a little bit from every class and mix and match it to design your very own unqiue character.  However, level progression is very slow, and it becomes necessary to teach your skills to others in order to progress.  Interesting concept, if a little flawed. There are no Jedi's running around yet, simply becuse the method of becoming a Jedi is a 'secret' which players have since discovered, but it is still difficult to do.  Thankfully this limits the Jedi population and keeps balance.As for the game itself, it just wasn't really that interesting.  The world is huge, but devoid of life.  Lots of quests require you to hump your way all the way across the planet for pathetic rewards and little experience points.  Other quests require you to destroy objects, like dirt mounds or junk piles, which creatures spawn out of.  What's bad is that these quests cannot possibly be undertaken alone, since attacking one of these mounds causes a tremendous group of creatures to gang up on you and tear you to pieces, and if you do manage to fend them off, there are other creatures healing the object, making your effort useless.  There are some quests unique to sides, if you join the Imperials or Rebels, which is a decent change, but its still the same: Find and Kill soandso, bring this item here, etc. etc.Items in the game are all made by players, which is utterly ridiculous.  There are no shops in the game at all, except for one Bazaar that holds player auctions.  Since everyone is making the same stuff, the same items appear over and over.  There are no unique items anywhere.  One of the problems with this is that making weapons and armor is a career for some players.  Funny, but that sounds like nothing more than a job to me.  I'll go to my real job if I want to be productive, thanks.  I'm sure many other players will begin to realize that too, and the items in the game will start becoming scarce.The game is just very monotonous, but I should expect no less from the makers of EQ.  Sure, its fun for the first few hours, when you're exploring and getting familiar with everything, but the experience degenerates quickly.  When I got this game, I was hoping to be surrounded by Star Wars nerds role-playing their characters...but I forgot that Role-Playing is not allowed in MMORPGS.  Try role-playing your character for one minute around other players and watch your text screen fill up with people screaming 'St0p r0lE PlAyinG j00 n00b!' and garbage like that.  Hence, the 'Wow, i'm in Star Wars' feeling wears off extraordinarily quick.The realization that this is just another online game and the fact that no one cares that its Star Wars becomes evident quickly, when you see players running around with names like 'Potthead Smokey' or 'Do0bi3 Sm0k3r' or 'L000k3 Skyywaalk3rrr123441' (all of which were names I actually saw).  Its the idiots like that which completely take away from the game experience.  You can barely understand what anyone is saying, because everyone talks in '1337 speech' or whatever the popular term for it is among the little kids.  Overall, I found the rampant childish behavior and boring, pointless gameplay to be a huge turn off.  I was off the game 3 days after getting it.  I really, really wanted to like this game, but in the end the boring gameplay just got on my nerves, and the immature players didn't particularly help much either.  This game was clearly just very over-hyped, and I was extraordinarily disappointed.  Luckily I didn't get slapped with the rather high (over $15) monthly fee since I was off the game in 3 days.If you want a great Star Wars Role Playing game, then I suggest checking out Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic for XBox, or waiting for it to come to the PC.  Its a much better game, and well worth the money.  Since Galaxies doesn't really seem to qualify as a role-playing game, you're better off saving all the money you would waste on the hefty monthly fee.  A nice try, but i'm not impressed at all.  Just another run-of-the-mill Massive Online Game ruined by childish players and boring gameplay.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00030GS80","description":"There's always been a certain magic to Zelda games. The classic formula should have gotten old by now, but it hasn't. Perhaps it's because we all identify on some level with this shy, unlikely hero. Maybe the games remind us of our own childhood. Or perhaps these titles are consistently of such high quality that we can't help but love them. Regardless, The Minish Cap succeeds in all these ways &#x96; simultaneously embracing its links to the past while offering numerous innovations that keep gameplay fresh, exciting, and a true joy to&#xA0;play.The greatest of these novel concepts is the ability to transform from normal size down to the diminutive form of the Minish, a race of tiny people living right under the noses of the humans. This opens up entirely new realms of gameplay, as puzzles and even combat must be accomplished in different ways. When miniaturized, the smallest puddle becomes a deep lake, and the most mundane creatures become monstrous foes.There's a new item called the Gust Jar that allows you to suck up obstacles and enemies before blowing them back out in a burst of air. It's one of the cooler new power-up items I've encountered in any of the Zelda games, and adds yet another level of complexity to how you play. Another new ability allows Link to double himself, creating a ghostly after-image that mirrors his moves for a brief time. As you might imagine, this results in some clever and unique brainteasers that are a nod to the recent Four Swords games. In all these ways, the game challenges you to think in multiple dimensions and carefully remember details on your journey. A large cast of characters fleshes out the land of Hyrule, and monsters both large and small await your blade. To further connect you to the world's people, you will now collect items called Kinstones &#x96; broken halves of coin-like objects that can be fused with the Kinstones that other characters in the world have collected. By doing so, you'll open up portals, treasure chests, and secret doors all over the map. It's an addictive side quest that serves as a worthy compliment to the main adventure.One of my few complaints is that while the puzzles in the game are uniformly challenging, some of the combat is easier than I might have liked, especially against the bosses, who were often one-trick ponies requiring minimal skill. Even so, the fights are satisfying in their simplicity, and you have access to all the familiar weapons and techniques, including the boomerang, spin attack, and bow. The old and new features combine to make a game that feels both true to the Zelda heritage while offering an entirely unique experience.But more than any of this, the game charms you with its stalwart hero. This silent little boy with ruffled, messy hair is faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. Through him, the game establishes a hero whose pure heart and will are carrying him forward. All the elements of The Minish Cap (even its presence on the GBA) contribute to the idea of a tiny force for good that strives to triumph against a huge evil. It's a classic adventure that more than lives up to the legacy of a classic series.Concept:The time-honored Zelda tale retold in yet another new formGraphics:Mixing the familiar images of previous Zelda games with humorous and detailed new character designs results in an impressive success for the GBASound:Some of the most memorable and recognizable tunes in gaming sound great even on those little GBA speakersPlayability:Responsive and flexible with a nearly perfect learning curve that moves from simple to challengingEntertainment:Like many of its predecessors &#x96; a true classicReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerIssue:February 20052nd Opinion:There's a bird sitting on my head, I'm no larger than a toenail clipping, and I've been stuck on the same puzzle for the last three hours. Long story short, I'm having the time of my life. For any of you who played the remarkable Super Nintendo title A Link to the Past, The Minish Cap will bring a tear to your eye. This is classic Zelda gameplay in all its glory. The journey is a tad easy for my liking (boss fights are a breeze), but I can't get enough of the creative puzzles and new gadgets. Shrinking in height to a two-pixel speck is not only hilarious, it's one of the most compelling concepts that the series has offered up in a long time. Minigames are also in great abundance, and you can collect over 130 different figurines that shed some light on the characters in the world (which also happens to be one of my favorite aspects of Wind Waker). From its stunning visuals to its gameplay finesse, The Minish Cap is another harrowing Hyrule adventure that you'll remember for a lifetime.Rated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer","reviewerName":"Nancy Morse","summary":"The Minish Cap:  The Legend of Zelda","reviewText":"If you can find my review of Zelda; Oracle of the Ages...you will find more of my experiences.The game is great.

Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"They're starting to get the hang of this...","reviewText":"I'm confronted by an unusual moment in my history of reviewing video games...On November 28th, 2009, I commented that Assassin's Creed II would have fared much better had it been a bit more like Batman: Arkham Asylum.  I felt that the strategies regarding stealth as well as fluid combat which B:AA deployed so well would have fit excellently in the AC Universe.I swear it's like they freakin' heard me.Enter the Killstreak!  A new flick-the-stick-and-hit-the-button tactic in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood that lets you wipe out a field-full of baddies in a few seconds flat.  I'll admit getting the hang of it took me considerably longer than I had hoped, but never-the-less, I got it.  Now I can drop on an unsuspecting group of guards and be surrounded by dead bodies in just 10 gloriously satisfying seconds.  It REALLY IS fun - and for that change ALONE I give this game a higher score than it's predecessor.Assassin's Creed also resuses some ideas of it's earlier games - even the first title - with the inclusion of the Borgio towers.  It's very similar to the \"Templars\" which had to be killed in the first title, but this time there's actually a reason to do so, and you're able to apply more tactics in the process.  No more running up to a guy and trying to kill him before you get your butt kicked - now you can slink across a roof top, watch his motion patterns, weed out his guards, and make the kill.It's hard to comment much else on AC:B because it's still a lot of what we've seen before.  Do missions, unlock weapons, upgrade your character, upgrade the town - there isn't a TON of new content here.  But slowly they're making Assassin's Creed a better game to play, and as long as no major glitches show up, I'll actually finally find myself looking FORWARD to the next title release.And don't listen to your neighborhood Gamestop employee as I did: the guy who told me that AC:B is mostly a multiplayer game and that there isn't much content to the single-player campaign.  I've been playing the main story now for probably close to 20 hours and still have a looooooooong ways to go.I've heard that the multiplayer aspect is complex and rather thrilling, but I haven't gotten there yet, so I won't comment.  I bought the title however with the intent of trying it out with my brother in Nevada, so we'll see how that goes.In the end, I'm satisfied with the direction Assassin's Creed is taking.

For example, it has good platforming controls, a deep and interesting story for a Disney game, lots to see and explore, a good soundtrack, and great art direction. While the camera can sometimes get in your way and act a little finicky, its not something that ruins the experience since the rest is so good.Honestly, I heard that this game was too dark and scary for children, however, even though I'm no child, I don't see this game scaring too many children, because while it's darker than some modern day Disney stuff, it's not that dark. For example, Epic Mickey is nowhere near as dark as some Disney stuff I watched growing up like Fantasia. I'm not sure if the more current generation of children are shielded off so much from the world these days that they find something as mild as Epic Mickey to be scary or something, but I don't see it as being very frightening to any child with the ability to read and play video games.This is a great video game for any age group that likes Disney before Disney stopped making amazing animated films.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2012"}

My wife downloaded this game a few days ago and we've been pumping hours into it since then. A friend of mine was over and watched us playing it (he's a big CoD meat head) and he asked to play, boy did he get hooked! It's just goofy and colorful, yet despite anything you might think it's very appealing once you actually play it.Keep in mind, you will NEED Xbox Live Gold to play (like it says in the description box) and you will also need to link and EA Origin account as well (starting a new one is rather quick).There is NO traditional single player in this game, online multiplayer & Split Screen only. Split screen uses player 1's characters/items/files to play a split screen version of Garden Ops with endless waves of zombies. It's a bit lacking but works well enough for 2 players to have fun for a couple of hours.The Garden Ops mode online is much more fun, it pits 4 players (playing as plants) against waves of zombies in a variety of maps. There are 10 increasingly difficult rounds ending in a final \"escape\" mission with random boss zombie rounds scattered in between.In Gardens&Graveyards; (GG) mode up to 24 players (12 plants vs. 12 zombies) battle for control of objectives on a very large map ending in a huge home defense level. It's very crazy and a bit difficult, but ultimately very fun as well.In all game modes, players earn coins by completing objectives, killing, healing etc. These coins are then spent in the Sticker Shop to unlock random booster packs that gives players more characters, items and abilities. It's a fun little system that leaves some excitement to chance but this too works rather well, though it's a bit slow to earn coins, playig Gardens&Graveyards; will net you around 10,000+ for winning (note: losing will get you between 3000-5000).Over all a solid 5/5Not perfect by any means, but a great diversion for a few weeks and only $30!

{"product_name":"B00BGA9V2Q","reviewerName":"Gc \"iPoker\"","summary":"I was one of those haters","reviewText":"I go way back to the original Diablo when that game use to freak me out. I was much younger and didn't even understand what a good loot meant. Then came Diablo II which I played through casually. It wasn't until I started playing online, that was when loot run and trading became the sole purpose of the game itself. D2 was fun mainly because you can massacring cows, kill Mephisto over and over again, and there was always that chance of a unique item dropping.When D3 came out, my mindset was D2 with better graphics, more loot, and more massacring . I never planned on using the real money auction house (and never did). D3 was a game for people who did not want to pay the monthly fee, so naturally most people were drawn off by the RMAH. After playing a month into the game, it became clear that the RMAH was the main reason why the game just sucks. The developers clearly did not want you to find any good loots because they wanted you to use the RMAH. And what happens if you don't use the RMAH: you die, you lose gold, you waste your time, you get mad and frustrated, then eventually you quit as I did after 2 months of playing.When the console version came out, Bilzzard was finally done milking the RMAH and tweaking the crap out of this game. I'm sure a lot of Diablo fans would agree that the console version is what the game should have been in the first place. The game brings back a lot of the fun aspect of D2. When D3 first came out, I use to get maybe 1 or 2 legendary after playing for a week, on the console version, they will drop about every 25 minutes no matter what difficulty. After completing the game in normal difficulty, I already have more than 10 legendary. I am playing Inferno right and basically one shot most of the monsters, which means I can play at master level soon. Actually, I have enough good gears to easily play at higher master levels, but I'm trying not to switch out my MF gears.It's true that there is no more cow levels or Mephisto runs, but D3 console is an improvement to that. You can now kill a field of ponys which happens to be a lot more bloody and colorful than cows. But there are more options. If you cycle through the waypoint areas, the monsters will regenerate when you leave and come back to your second to last area, so your runs are endless. No more Mephisto? no problem, elite packs mean more bosses to kill, so you don't have to kill the same guy over and over again. Game is too easy or leveling is taking too long? just increase the master difficulty. I can also tell that the skills are more balanced. There is no ONE all powerful skill. I often get bored using the same build over and over again, so when I switch to another build my character stays just as powerful, but there is also that \"right\" combination of skills that Blizzard have left for you to figure out by yourself.Many modern games are moving away from offline mode. I know that Blizzard have made their success on online games, but I solo through D3 console and it is just as fun. In fact, there are no overpowered players to ruin your fun by killing all the mobs first, no weak players to slow you down, players that join your game just to solo by themselves, annoying players who advertise their gears, or people pressuring you to rush through the game. I can pause and step away anytime. Unless you're playing with your friends, there is really no chitchat among players anyways. You don't need other players to help you, the game is setup so that you can do everything by yourself at a natural pace.As for the controls, I think Blizzard has done an amazing job with it. Sure the gamepad might not be as fast as the keyboard and mouse, but once you get the hang of it, it is not much slower. The gamepad is in fact more ergonomics than the keyboard and mouse in my opinion. The interface is circular and categorized. Items are sorted by type, any new items are highlighted, you can quickly drop unless pickups, and there is a quick preview to tell you if the item is worth keeping. The graphics are slightly turned down and the mob packs are slightly less than the PC version. That is my only complaint, but it's very little to give up for being able to play while on the sofa with the game blowen up on a 55\" TV.I think about 90+% of the console version is still a copy and paste from the PC version. Even though I stopped playing the PC version, I saw a lot potential in this game that Blizzard could improve on. The visual and audio are very artistically crafted form the start. It looks very detailed and polished compared to most modern RPG games. Obviously Blizzard have invested a lot in this game, and they have a good reputation of not ignoring their fans. Since I have already trained a DH, Monk, and Wizard to level 60 on the PC, this was my chance to play the Barbarian on the console. These character play very differently, so even though I was mainly replaying the same game, it was a much better game, played differently. The console version didn't feel like painfully grinding through mobs, it was actually fun climbing up the master levels, but most importantly, those legendary loots makes it so much more rewarding to play. Final thought, if you bought the PC version, I think you should still give the console version a try. It is actually that good. I expect Reaper of Souls to be a bigger improvement on this console version. Next time I will totally skip the PC expansion and buy the PS4 version.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2013"}
{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"Gordon \"PS3/PC Gamer!\"","summary":"OK gameplay and great setpieces in SP, but MP and terrible story bring it down","reviewText":"***SPOILER-FREE DON'T WORRY***SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGNIn my U2 Amazon review I said that there is no one game worth buying a console for. While that still holds true, there is one franchise worth buying a PS3 for. Uncharted 1 and 2 IMO are the best TPS adventure shooters of all time. Nothing comes close to the balance between great SP and MP in 2 and the character development and charm in 1. What went wrong with 3? Read on to find out.After going through Uncharted 2's campaign the night before in preparation for launch day, I booted up Uncharted 3's campaign on the 1st. I IMMEDIATELY noticed the input lag in the controls. Everyone who is complaining about the controls is not making it up. It feels similar to Killzone 2 where when you aim with the analog stick, Drake takes action a quarter second later. To give Uncharted vets an idea, I'd say a normal pistol feels like using a revolver in Uncharted 1. This makes precise aiming a pain in the beginning. After getting used to it, Drake still animates beautifully and realistically while maintaining somewhat precise control. Everything feels heavy and imprecise in Uncharted 3. The alternate control thing fixes it up a little, but the guns still sound bad and just feel weird. Oddly enough, the MP feels very responsive (after getting used to it from Uncharted 2's) and doesn't suffer from this problem. The aiming reticle is the worst in any TPS and the guns all feel unwieldy.After playing the campaign for an hour or 2 I realized that it starts very slooooooow. As much as I hate to say it, I got bored playing Uncharted. Things picked up soon, but the campaign's slow start definitely hurts the overall experience, because I can see someone who has never played Uncharted getting bored at the beginning of the campaign.For all of us Uncharted vets, playing Drake's Fortune was a very fun experience. Shooting an enemy made him fall back or stumble, giving us a precious advantage against hordes of pirates. In Uncharted 3, shooting an enemy has no effect on him. Actually I wasn't even sure that I was hitting the enemy until he dropped dead.As of now I'm disappointed with Uncharted 3 because I hate having detail everywhere besides the shooting mechanics. Enemies literally don't stumble from shots like its multiplayer or something. It's quite noticeable considering how beautifully detailed everything else is and since Uncharted 1 still to this day has stumbling enemies when shot (oddly gone in U2 and 3).MULTIPLAYER PROBLEMS (I'm a level 40, so I'm far from the best, but I'm experienced enough to speak about it.Blind firing is outrageously overpowered. On a regular basis, players sprint right at me hip-firing. I aim at their chest and spray their whole body up. Not only does this not slow them down, but they manage to melee kill me in the process. Uncharted 3 makes it so that when you aim down the sights, you cannot effectively melee someone running around you in circles hip firing. Hipfire melee, hipfire melee. Noobs are having a ball with that. I have trained myself not to let anyone get close enough to exploit hip firing.Hip firing is OK when you're trapped or have a gun dedicated to it, but I should have the advantage if I make the effort to aim at a hip firing exploiter. I was playing with a player by the name of RuggerDog27 and he uses the KAL-7 with blindfire accuracy. He was owning us level 45s like nothing and this noob NEVER AIMED and logged in a mere 6 hrs total! He runs in circles blindfiring and you'll die almost as quick as COD!There is too much health. The addition of sprint is fine, but I don't like everyone having so much health that they can easily sprint or roll out of most situations. Don't make it COD, but don't make it Gears either.Movement feels noticeably more stiff than U2 or even U3 SP. There is no doubt in my mind that U2 MP had smoother, more realistic animations and control in MP. I have played both extensively and dare anyone to argue. Its TRUE.In short, I think Naughty Dog ruined a GREAT MP. I'll take bunny hopping and pistol exploits over this hipfiring/ extreme health/bad map mess. Even the aiming reticle was ruined for no reason.Also, before 2 maps (airstrip and london) you're forced to play these AWFUL sequences for no reason. I guess ND thought forcing you to get frustrated before a match was the way to go. If aiming already wasn't hard enough because EVERYONE is bullet sponges,I had my review at 5 stars, but the MP is not good because its TERRIBLY unbalanced and it takes WAY too many shots to kill someone. WHY DIDN'T ND JUST BUILD ON THE FUN MP OF U2! WHY!!!!!!! WHO IN THE WORLD IS GOING TO HAVE FUN DUMPING AN ENTIRE CLIP AT SOMEONE ROLLING AND SPRINTING!***UPDATE***OK. After finishing the campaign I have to say that the second half really blows the first half of the game out of the water in terms of setpieces and excitement. The gigantic set-pieces and Uncharted we all know and love reveals itself after the slow start.Unfortunately there are some rough spots that cannot be overlooked. First, the story. Now I've always acknowledged that Uncharted is no Metal Gear Solid and values character development over a complex, twisting tale. This was true for Uncharted 1 and 2. Sadly in Uncharted 3, the main characters are not really personified in an interesting way. There is noticeably less humor and Elena isn't in the game as much as I would have hoped. On a side note, she looks asian for some reason and its driving me CRAZY.Also, we've all seen Chloe in the trailers, but she was an afterthought in Uncharted 3. I love Chloe, but this time around she added nothing to the game. She's in for a chapter or 2 and is gone with no mention of her again.However, a new character, Cutter is an extremely cool character. He has the Flynn accent, but complements Drake because he's as into exploring and history as Drake is. On top of that he's funny. The mature, witty humor in Uncharted is what really makes us love the characters, but as I said, humor is noticeably absent for the most part. Rather suddenly, Cutter disappears with Chloe never to me mentioned or seen again.The story definitely did not live up to how it was built up in the beginning of the campaign or in the trailers. The villain is awful and there is really no story at all. Naughty Dog usually makes up for it with realistic, expertly voiced conversations between characters, but that's not the case here. The interaction between the characters is at its worst in the series with this game because Drake is a alone for 70% of the game.Everything said, Uncharted 3 is still an OK title with an action-packed second half. In the future Naughty Dog either needs to bring back the humorous, interesting character interaction, or hire a story writer. Of the 3 campaigns, I feel that this without a doubt the worst. The lack of a real concrete story (besides searching for the usual treasure) might begin to wear thin, and the core shooting is not that satisfying. Drake and Sully's relationship should have been much more interesting and eventful than it was.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2011"}

A quality sequel with more of the same.","reviewText":"I loved the first Left 4 Dead (L4D) game.  I discovered it about 6 months later than the rest of the world, but I was hooked.  The fast-paced co-op gameplay has provided me some of my favorite and most memorable multi-player moments.  Left 4 Dead 2 is basically more of the same with incremental improvements, a few new features, and a generally improved experience.  Since I never liked the competitive modes on the first L4D game and doubt that I'll play the competitive modes on L4D2, I'll keep my review focused on the single-player and co-op campaign modes.PROS:+++ Fast-paced gameplay+++ Intense and frantic battles that can feel overwhelming+++ Huge emphasis on co-op+++ Five campaigns+++ Dynamic enemy placement switches the action up so you get a slightly different experience each time you play the different campaigns.CONS:--- Computer controlled AI teammates are about as sharp as a bag of wet hammers.--- The XBox 360 offers only 4 types of control scheme, but none of them seem to offer me the flexibility I desire.NOTABLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN L4D and L4D2:+++ Added new melee weapons+++ Added a new variety of weapons, including fun toys like grenade launchers.+++ Added several new special infected such as the Charger, Spitter, and Jockey+++ Common infected are much more colorful and diverse in design+++ Dismemberment and more detailed death animations result in more gore and chunks than the original game.+++ Improved sense of character development and story+++ Mission objectives have been more fleshed out, going beyond the first game's \"Get to the extraction point and wait\" concept.+++ Daytime levels--- Fewer lull moments.  There is almost ALWAYS an attack imminent, which kind of kills the suspense.GAMEPLAY: The basic premise is that you play one of four different survivors attempting to fight their way to safety during the zombie apocalypse.  Essentially you blast thousands of zombies into ever-loving bits as you fight and run for your life.  The new game brings some new mission objectives, which adds a subtle but noticeable bit of depth to the game.  Instead of waiting for a helicopter or boat to come pick you up after 5 or 6 intense minutes of fighting for your life, you might be expected to find a bunch of gas cans to fill up a car.  No matter what you do, success will require teamwork.The new special infected are a nice addition to the mix.  Jockeys that jump on you and ride you around, Chargers that pin you against walls or the ground and beat you to a bloody pulp, and Spitters that spray acid and explode into nasty bubbling pools of acid force you to adapt your strategies more quickly.  Tanks and Witches are still tough, and the Smokers, Boomers, and Hunters are still around to make life hell as well.  The common infected are more diverse and interesting.  My favorite are the hazmat suit infected, which make a cool little depressurizing noise when killed which makes me smile every time.GRAPHICS: For the most part, the graphics are very similar but improved in many subtle ways.  Shadows seem to be smoother and more accurate, levels have more color, and there is generally more detail to seen.  Enemy death animations have been noticeably improved with more dismemberment and more detailed models.  For example, shoot a zombie in the chest with a high powered rifle or magnum handgun and the creature will have a neat little hole you can look through.  Subtle, but still noteworthy.PRESENTATION: With only a few (very minor) exceptions, I would argue the presentation for L4D2 is much improved over the original.  The environments feel more diverse, taking you from bright and colorful New Orleans outdoor scenes to dank and ominous indoor settings.  Many of the dark indoor settings are much more open, which is much spookier since your flashlight isn't as effective in large, open areas.  The characters are far more interesting and have some interesting and humorous pre-scripted conversations.  The redneck character, Ellis, is definitely my favorite since he says some really funny stuff followed closely by Coach.  All in all, a step forward.SINGLE-PLAYER: Single-player mode is ok, but you'll be dealing with the game's biggest flaw: frustratingly stupid AI teammates.  Do you feel like sniping zombies from a distance?  Have fun with that because at least one of your teammates will invariably park themselves right in front of you so they can absorb your bullets.  They heal you when you don't want healed and constantly give you pills, which suddenly means your gun isn't in your hands.  They fall off ledges and have trouble keeping up in general, especially if you go up some stairs.  Apparently they forgot that Rule #1 is Cardio.  If I were stuck in a real zombie apocalypse and these were the only living people I ran across, I'd leave them for dead.CO-OP MULTI-PLAYER: As far as I'm concerned, cooperative multi-player is where it is at.  I love it.  Three or four players working together with good strategy can be a devastating zombie grinding machine.  This is where the game truly shines and where I spend almost all of my time with the game.COMPETITIVE MULTI-PLAYER: I never really liked the competitive modes in the original and I really don't expect to spend any time playing them in L4D2.  It isn't a judgment against the game itself, but more representative of the fact that I prefer co-op games so much more.Whether or not you should buy the game depends on several factors:- If you never played the first game but enjoy co-op FPS games, I highly recommend the game.- If you enjoyed the first game and couldn't get enough of it and crave some more, this is a must buy.- If you played the first game to death and are bored of it now, you might consider renting L4D2 first because it is essentially more of the same with a fresh coat of paint and a few new features.Overall, this is an enjoyable game that improves on the original in many ways as long as you have other people to play it with.  As far as sequels go, the changes are evolutionary instead of revolutionary.  None of the changes are all that major, but they are noticeable.  In fact, I look back on the original and now realize how much was missing in the original design.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2009"}

David Swan","summary":"Very Good for a 14 Year Old Game","reviewText":"For years I'd heard how great Chrono Trigger was. It's like River City Ransom and Kid Icarus in the praise veteran gamers heap on it as one of the classics from video games halcyon days. Now it has settled itself firmly into its position as one of the highest rated RPG's on the DS. So is it as good as people claim?Chrono Trigger has quite a few things going for it including an expansive world that stretches across seven time periods and some exceptionally well produced cut scenes. Honestly, I didn't even know that the DS could handle this kind of cinema and it makes me wonder why more games don't do it. On the downside Chrono is rather derivative. It may have broken some new ground back on the SNES but 14 years later it's looking a bit stale. The story is a rather confusing mess and with the size of the world I often found myself lost, wandering, with no idea where I was supposed to be going next and what I was supposed to be doing.If I were to guess why Chrono Trigger has remained so popular I would suspect it's the time travel aspect and it's handled very well. Actions taken in the past will often affect events in the future. Here is one clever example. I needed two stones to create a third more powerful stone. So I placed one on an alter, traveled forward to the next time period, grabbed the stone still sitting on the alter, traveled back in time giving me two stones that were essentially the same stone from different time periods. This kind of maneuvering through time is the one great innovation of Chrono Trigger but since time travel has since been duplicated on other games the innovative feel is rather blunted. My last big compliment is on the huge amounts of side quests. This is a game that definitely gives you your money's worth.I very much enjoyed Chrono Trigger but it definitely had a been there, done that feel to it. If you want a fantastic RPG from Square Enix try The World Ends With You. It has high quality production values and a much fresher feel. Chrono Trigger is more retro but it still manages to rise above many of the current RPG's.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2009"}

Antiquity (12,000 B.C.) is an age where the world is divided between people whose continent is buried in snow, and the magical kingdom of Zeal, a highly advanced civilization.

{"product_name":"B00H5V9S6E","description":"","reviewerName":"G. Denick","summary":"Rayman continues his reign as the King of Color!","reviewText":"Holy macaroni... what a vivid, imaginative, and colorful universe this limbless fellow lives in!I was a huge fan of Rayman Origins, which was released two years ago. At that time, I considered it to be the best 2D platformer in the history of gaming, and I believe that has remained true - until now. Ubisoft has done gamers everywhere a huge service by improving upon their remarkable formula in every possible way, and delivering a game that's even BETTER than the awesome platformer that is Origins.Foremost, the visuals of Legends need to be addressed. One of the best things about Origins was that it looked like you were controlling a cartoon, which resulted in terrific animations, slapstick comedy, bizarre spectacles, and OODLES of SMILES. I would have been perfectly happy if this sequel looked exactly like Origins, but somehow the developers have made it look even better. The graphics in this game POP like nothing I've ever seen before, and it looks even more like an animated movie than ever. Graphics generally have little to do with actual gameplay, but in the case of the Rayman games, their whimsical presentation has a direct correlation with the end result (that being fun, laughter, and wonder), so they do have a big impact here. This game is a visual treat, and I predict that it will be impervious to the \"aging\" that most games suffer from, because the art direction is so marvelously realized.Though Legends' graphics may make this game look a tad childish, do not be deceived - this is a meticulously designed platformer that offers tremendous challenges. Furthermore, if you study the layout of the levels and practice, you will discover that there is an incredible amount of sophistication here. As far as I can tell, EVERY level can be played in one swift movement, with no hesitation whatsoever - if you have the skill to memorize the patterns and the reflexes to guide you (which comes in handy when attempting to complete time challenges). I am blown away by the amount of care that the designers put into this game. I don't see any \"shortcuts\" or evidence of \"going through the motions\" to fill out content.And on the subject of content, there is a staggering amount here. The campaign alone is very long, particularly for a 2D platformer, but what makes the game infinitely larger is the amount of additional challenges and collectibles. Multiplayer is also a blast, and I can have fun playing Legends with less experienced gamers. Though it is far harder to complete challenges when I have other gamers along for the ride, that's not what it's about - it's about having fun and watching Rayman and Globox slap each other silly.It bears mentioning that you can have anybody play this game with you, from a five-year-old to your granny. There is no violence other than the \"cartoon\" variety, and it's a huge departure from the glut of ultra-violent titles that have saturated the market in recent years. To me, this is a wonderful, beautiful break from the norm. No longer do you have to worry about \"headshots\" and the other staples of the shooter genre, but you can focus on the types of things that made us enjoy games when we were younger: a sense of wonder, whimsy, and the relentless pursuit of fun.If you want to BOOST this game on PSN, please send me a friend request (my PSN ID is WhiskeyBean). There is one trophy that is particularly difficult to get, and you need to have PSN friends playing it and competing on the Daily/Weekly Challenges. The challenges are really fun and only take a few minutes a day, and you will also have to do the challenges to reach the last level of \"awesomeness\", which unlocks another difficult trophy. All Rayman players are welcome to seek me out... thanks!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2014"}

Use your car as a weapon and battle your way to the front of the pack -- by taking down rivals and instigating spectacular crashes.","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"Best racer out there...til GT4","reviewText":"It's difficult to talk about Burnout 3 using words. My initial plan was to compose this review entirely out of emoticons, using a lot of D and XD and that would be the most efficient (also the most annoying) way to get across how much fun this game is to play. Even not playing Burnout 3 is more fun than playing most games; I'm sitting here trying to write while my coworker is alternating between Road Rage and Crash Mode, and let me tell you, you ought to consider the mere existence of this writeup as me doing you a favor. Such is the hypnotic power of Burnout 3. It's the rare racing game these days, in fact, that's so good that you don't have to like racing games at all to enjoy it -- I don't. If you are a racing buff, then you can derive some amusement from knowing what all the fake cars are modeled after, but that's the least fun to be had here. All that's important is that they move fast and look real nice when crashing. Actually, \"real nice\" isn't nearly strong praise enough to describe how good this game looks. The car models are a little lumpen, and obviously low-poly when compared to the next crop of hyper-realistic games, but Burnout 3 smokes those titles in other, cooler ways. Holding down R1 to activate slow-motion after you've taken a spill is a great way to bask in every single spark, dust cloud, and chunk of car flying around. They're all present in normal speed, too, but you'll be too busy ramming cars and trying not to be rammed to notice much. The increased offensive focus comes from the system that Burnout 3's subtitle is taken from. In past Burnout games, the way to replenish your turbo \"Boost\" meter was to drive recklessly -- in the wrong lane through incoming traffic, or drifting as far as possible, or catching lots of air as you went over hills. In Burnout 3, though, by far the best way to earn Boost is to take out other cars. You can nudge them from behind so that they spin off into an oncoming truck's way, or force them into the wall hard enough to flip them over -- you can even take them out during your own crashes by guiding your own flight trajectory in the slow-motion Impact Time. The Takedown system is what makes the already pretty good Burnout series amazing. The most outrageously fun mode in the game, Road Rage, revolves entirely around takedowns -- you get what amounts to an unlimited amount of Boost as you go on a crusade to takedown as many cars as you can before your own vehicle is totaled or time runs out, whichever comes first. Other modes such as 1-on-1 races and Crash mode are enhanced in various ways by the new features; guiding your flaming wreck through the air so that it manages to pick up the quadruple multiplier is an incredibly satisfying feeling, as is being secure in the knowledge that taking down the only other driver in a race, and then using that extra Boost to outdistance him even further, gives you a pretty solid lead. At least for a little while, anyway. Burnout 3 does have a couple of noticeable flaws which prevent it from reaching perfection: the rubberband AI is fixed more obviously than a Tammany Hall election, and we challenge you not to snicker when you are simultaneously told that you're \"5 seconds ahead\" of your foe, who is also \"right on your tail.\" More glaringly, though, are the times when the game forgets itself and lapses into comparatively boring racing game tropes. The 1-on-1 races don't really belong in a game that rewards offensive driving this much, and the \"beat the best lap time\" courses are almost entirely incompatible with what makes Burnout 3 fun. But with over 170 individual events in the World Tour mode, there's so much to do that you can pretty much ignore what bores you, and once you've exhausted the single-player tour there's still a multiplayer mode, both online and off. Burnout 3 delivers the purest hit of awesome so far this year, and by way of thanking Criterion for the game I'd just like to say.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8LR","description":"WhenLuigi's Mansionwas first announced, many assumed it would  follow in the legendary footsteps ofSuper Mario WorldandSuper Mario  64. The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

It's fun, unique for it's generation, stars Luigi's and one of the better Mario games out there.

{"product_name":"B0002A2S26","reviewerName":"The Game \"B\"","summary":"COLLECTORS EDITION IS BETTER THEN ORIGINAL HALO 2!","reviewText":"Halo 2 is definetely my favorite game for the Xbox system currently. With amazing graphics, gameplay, sound, many weapons, vehicles and the best online play to ever hit the Xbox so far, halo 2 is is the most playable game ever created.Halo 2 has a basic story, its just that Master Chief has returned and is once again trying to stop the covenant from taking over earth and all of the other planets. Master Chief is also trying to deny a weapon of massive power and one that would have a great effect on the world!Even though this game has a simple story, the gameplay is unthinkable. I will break up my review into different categories listed below...Graphics: One of the best parts of Halo 2 is definetely the graphics. The background detail is superb, the texture is smooth and clear. The water is also very well done compared to halo 1, but still not as good as some games have done. The cutscenes are worth bragging about, for example, when i was watching a halo 2 cutscene and my cousin came into the room he told me to \"change the channel,\" as he obviousely thought i was watching television which i thought was kind of funny. The animations of your character reloading, moving and shooting are truely amazing as well, (you switch off from being the covenant and master chief throughout campaign) as it seems like a real movie like a previousely mentioned. Master Chief looks much cooler then he did in Halo 1, as he has a redesigned suit and many more guns with much better graphics. Although it seems like i am saying that the graphics are amazing, i do think that they could have done just a tiny bit of a better job on them just so that it could be one of the best games in terms of graphics to every hit the Xbox Console, that would be great! But all in all, the graphics are wonderful, and definetely not an aspect of the game to complain about, unless you are picky, wait, lemme refrase that, too picky!Gameplay: There is one word, and only one word to describe the gameplay in this game. Fun! Thats it, this is arguably the best game on the xbox console, and there are many reasons to support that.First of all, you are able to sprint at twice the speed that you could in Halo 1. For those of you who play Halo 2 you probobly do not see a difference really in the sprinting aspect. I didn't either when i first played the game, but after i played a lot of halo 2, and then played halo 1, you could definetely see the difference between the two in terms of the speed that you can sprint, which is much better then the first.You are also able to highjack vehicles which gives the game a little \"grand theft auto\" them to it which is very fun to do. When your playing on Xbox Live, you get a medal each time you highjack a vehicle. (You get medals for each bonus thing you do such as highjacking, sniping, assasinating, etc.) Of course you could not do this in the previous halo 1 game so thats another difference between the two.Another better thing in this game then there was before in the previous one is that the A.I is much smarter. For example, they can sometimes form a \"short time alliance\" with another enemy and they can swarm at you, or the grunts can hide behind corners and wait for you to come. The elites are also much better at dodging your shots which makes it much harder to hit them. Also, if you want your allies to drive a vehicle they can which you couldn't do in the first halo game. The only problem is that sometimes they don't show that they're smart by slamming into walls and you have to switch seats repetitively before they'll get there \"nack\" back.But as a result of my gameplay review, it has changed a lot over the long and painful time that it took for the sequel to come out.New Weapons: There are many new weapons in halo to and i will list them underneath. They include...(Keep in mind that the ratings are intirely my opinion)BR55 Battle Rifle: 2x scope, burst shots, all in all its an ok weapon, not the best. Long range: 6/10, Medium range: 6/10, Close range: 6/10Covenant Carbine: Basically the Covenant form of the Battle Rifle except that its not burst, its just a one shot fire. Pretty good though, as it can fire much faster then the battle rifle. Long range: 7/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 8/10Particle Beam Rifle: Covenant form of Sniper rifle, except that if you shoot two shots in a row it has to charge back up which takes a couple seconds, but i think its better then the sniper rifle seeing that if you have a good aim, you can finish your enemy off quickly! (Or ally, ha ha!) Long range: 10/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 6/10. The reason why the ratings decrease is because the closer you are to your enemy, the harder it becomes to shoot considering that your aimer is unbearably small, so its hard to aim, even from a far distance, but it doesn't take that much skill to be able to snipe people from afar.Brute Shot: In my opinion i hate this weapon. Only the brutes use it (in single player) and they can never kill me with it because it sucks. Its almost impossible to aim at anything moving from afar or even medium range. The only good thing is that the shots can bounce of walls, wooooopy! Long range: 1/10, Medium range: 3/10, Close range: 5/10Covenant Energy Sword: Probobly the best weapon for close range is the sword. Even from medium range you can lock on to your target and unleash a super upercut attack which is a one hit kill unless your openent uses a cheap overshield, which i personally think they should take out of the game, seeing that whoever has the overshield cannot be stopped by one person unless the openent has a sword or a rocket launcher. Long range: 0/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 10/10Fuel Rod Gun: Ahhhh, i wish this gun was in multiplayer but i guess it would be way to cheap, considering the amount of ammo it has and that it is a one hit kill. But for single player it works mighty fine! Long range: 10/10, Medium range: 10/10, Close range: 10/10Two other things i have to add is that you can dual weild certain weapons, but the only problem with this is that you cannot chuck grenades when you are dual weilding which kind of makes sense when you think about it. Also, the rocket launchers can lock on to vehicles which makes it much easier to destroy those cheap @$$ vehicle lovers!Vehicles: I will now mention the new vehicles in Halo 2. They are...M12G1 Warthog LAAV- Basically the same as the previous Warthog, except it uses a Gauss Cannon which is a one hit kill instead of the machine gun. (The previous Warthog is in Halo 2 as well.)9/10Specter: Sort of like the Wraith, (Wraiths can be used in multiplayer now) except its faster and can hold three people, one for the plasma cannot turret at the back, one in the side seat, and one obviousely driving the vehicle. 9/10Shadow: The vehicle that the covenant use, can hold up to 8 combatents depending on the species of convenant, an ok vehicle when your using it. It uses a plasma cannon like the rest of the other covenant vehicles. 7/10Two more things i have to add about the vehicles are that the Banshee can now be used in multiplayer as well as the Wraith which makes multipayer much more fun.Sound: A great game needs great audio right? Well halo 2 listened. From the classic halo chant, to the rather heavy halo 2 beat, comes wonderful sound and definetely good enough quality that you can just sit their drinking tea/coffee and listening to it. Well, i guess if your that obsessed with the audio, you can just by the soundrack right?Online: Now comes the best part. The online multiplayer play. I have to say, i though crimson skies had the best online multiplayer play, but as soon as this hit came out i quickly regreted myself saying that. Basically, there are ranked games and unranked games, (unranked games are known as training games.) As you win ranked games you gain levels, you start out at level 1 and the last level is level 50, but i believe that the highest level right now is 27, so as you can see its extremely hard to work your way up once you get past level 20.The different ranked games are as follows...Rumble Pit: Up to 8 players all dualing it out against each other. Thit matchmake playlist can include normal slayer, all rockets, all swords, all shotguns, odball, or king of the hill. This is probobly my favorite kind of playlist to play.Team Skirmish: Up to 8 players, 4 on 4, on a team obviousely. This playlist usually includes the different types of Capture the Flag, team odball, 3 plots or assault. Pretty fun playlist to play!Team Slayer: 8 players, 4 on 4 against each other can include normal team slayer, team rockets, team swords, Fiesta Team slayer, team shotguns or team phantoms. Probobly runner up for my favorite playist to play halo 2 on.Head to Head: Simple straight up slayer games 1 v 1 can inlcude normal slayer, all swords or all rifles. Very fun, and addicting especially when your winning.Big team battle: Huge game, up to 16 players, 8 v 8 can include team slayer, different types of CTF, Assault, or land grab where you have to take over different areas of land. Very fun playlist as it sounds like, but can get very hard and boring considering that your dying a whole tun, especially when your playing on a smaller map.Clan Battles: Basically, you can join a clan which in different words is like a club and you get your clan together and battle with them in different match types. Pretty fun, good for bragging rights. When your clan starts winning, it will level up.In conclusion to my online review and whole halo 2 review, the online aspect is probobly the best part of this entire game. Its so much fun trash talking to your opponents and so addicting to play ranked games. You can also just play custom games where you can invite all your friends to play whatever type/map you want. You can also customize ever thinkable option which makes this game truely worth your time and money.Halo 2 delivers excellent gameplayer/graphics/sound/online play which definetely makes the game a worthy $50. Halo 2 is definetely not one of those games that you are going to end up returning straight away after you get it, you'll be twice as addicted to it as you were to Halo 1!

Then the game sort of grows stale. The characters have no real resolution with their problems, not that the first Kotor had any of that, but I cared more about the characters in the first Kotor than in the first one. I would have liked to have had more background on the old dark jedi Kriea. She was a sith lord and that was about the only thing interesting about her.

{"product_name":"B0050SVLI2","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"The 3DS's Suspenseful Third Party Dealbreaker","reviewText":"The 3DS had a bit of a rough start, no matter how you look at it. The majority of 2011 didn't give gamers much hope either, with only a handful of must-plays, and another majority of those being enhanced ports. I still held out hope for the system, however, due to the fact that Nintendo has never let down handheld gamers with the exception of the Virtual Boy. And now, with Capcom's positively flawless new entry in the Resident Evil franchise, a new year of productivity has been ushered in, it being the first of several high-profile entries on the powerhouse portable. And what a first it is. Even taking away from the hype of it being one of the best 3DS games out there, \"Resident Evil Revelations\" stands on it's own as an excellent title.Fans of the franchise like myself will be instantly dragged into the intricate narrative, which bridges the gap between RE 4&5 in one fell, seamless swoop. Players take on the dual roles of series standbys Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield. Jill is exploring a decrepit ship with scarce supplies and suspenseful encounters with bloodthirsty, parasitic monsters, while Chris' missions consist of surviving in the mountains while blasting through legions of enemies. Along the way, they both learn things about the mysterious BSAA organization from the fifth entry, while simultaneously getting more information about the Los Plagas virus taken from Leon at the end of Resident Evil 4. It's an entertaining and stimulating journey, told with some of the best voice acting in the series and plenty of cutscenes.The game is split into episodic chunks, with Jill's outings billed more as a series of cliffhangers that lead into Chris' shoot-'em-up types of missions. At the beginning of each chapter we see a \"previously in RE Revelations\" sequence, a la \"Alan Wake\" and \"Deadly Premonition.\" It's quite clear that Capcom was aiming for a console experience split up into handheld gaming bites, and it comes off without a hitch.As mentioned above, gameplay with Jill and Chris differ greatly. Let's start with Jill. The steady progression and emphasis on investigation, along with the struggle of surviving the assault of only a few enemies at a time. Jill barely starts with any ammo to speak of, and the supplies on the ship only throw her a real bone every now and again. Ammo conservation is key, as is keeping a close watch on your health restore items and your HUD map. This type of playing style hearkens back to the earlier RE entries, and old-school survival horror games as a whole.Chris' portions are the complete opposite. The lovable steroid poster boy starts off with an abundance of ammo in his pistol, along with a high power shotgun. His first mission gives players two types of explosives to work with, as well as plenty of health. This seems like overkill at first until you realize that dealing with foes is nothing like the Jill missions. Enemies that you encounter attack in waves, and one of the later encounters in the first of his missions involves blasting through a whole pack of infected wolves. These encounters become commonplace when playing a Chris mission, and it starts to feel more like RE5, or a lot of other third-person shooter games.I applaud Capcom for the stroke of brilliance they've displayed at these two different types of gameplay styles. The evolution of the RE franchise has been a major source of contention among fans for quite some time now. Some love the faster and more a gameplay, and others say that it's an unnecessary Westernization of a Japanese franchise. I fall somewhere in the middle with this debate, and it's nice to see the developers addressing both parties in Revelations. It's really the best of both worlds with this title; there's no losing for either party.A lot of people looking at screenshots have doubted that the \"game looks that good.\" Put those thoughts to bed, because yes, it DOES look that good. The 3DS is getting it's graphics card pumped to the max, because what's on display here far outpaces many higher quality Wii games. The textures are convincingly realistic, especially on the beautiful player and enemy models. Ditto for the accurately rendered weapons and cutscenes. The only complain I might muster would be that some of the outdoor textures look a little murky, especially in some of the cave missions with Chris. It doesn't detract from the overall experience, though, and the 3D effects certainly don't hurt the game at all either. The options menu gives players three different options of depth layering, and the highest setting shows just how three-dimensional games can be on the handheld if devs put forth a little effort. As far as showing off the 3DS' graphics go, this game fits the bill with appropriately grotesque and suspenseful imagery.Suspenseful is the best word to describe Revelations. It's something that the fifth entry, as much as I adored it, just never was. Capcom obviously took players' complaints to heart and created the best RE game since the classic RE4. Everything works the way it should, never limiting the player with annoying key fetching and cheap deaths, instead placing a heavy emphasis on survival that never feels unbalanced and investigating the small details of an intriguing story. If this is even a tiny taste of the upcoming sixth entry in the main continuity, then my faith in Capcom has been restored with this phenomenal game. This is the game to own a 3DS for, no matter what type of game you typically play.Plot: A- (Bridges the gap between RE4&5 for fans, but is accessible for everyone.)Gameplay: A+ (Balances cutthroat, terse survival and blazing action without any effort.)Graphics: A- (Pushes the 3DS to it's very limit with grotesque, scary and thrilling imagery.)Sound: B+ (Good voice acting for an RE game, and plenty of eerie sound effects and music.)Overall: A- (Not just a fantastic handheld game, but a fantastic game overall.)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2012"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Not a bad system at all, but it was doomed from the start","reviewText":"As the N64 has finally gone the way of the dodo, we are only left to think how better a system this could have been.  I never really was a fan of the N64 when it was first released, most of the games just seemed to childish (I mean its Nintendo for God's sake).  From the start the system didn't have much third party support other than Electronic Arts and Acclaim, but as time went on the system's library grew thanks to some quality first party games, and eventually the system got the third party support it needed to survive.  However, there are a lot of cons to this system.  Games for the system cost surprisingly expensive, even the supposed \"Players Choice\" games were expensive.  The graphics on every game suffer from a certain \"fog\" effect, not to mention the graphics can be blurry as well.  The sound quality isn't anything special compared to the CD-quality sound systems of other CD-based video game systems (for example: in the N64 Tony Hawk 2 version, songs are only played for a certain time, where as in every other version they are played out in their entirity).  However, the system had some good qualities: it was the first system to have four controler ports built into the system, and with the cartridge based format, there was no loading time.  On the other hand, there are only a handful of titles I would consider \"must-haves\", and they are Super Mario 64, Mario Kart 64, Goldeneye, Perfect Dark, Resident Evil 2, the two Zelda games, Shadows of the Empire, 1080 Snowboarding, WWF No Mercy, and Conker's Bad Fur Day.  Other than those games, everything else was just average.  All in all, the N64 wasn't a bad system at all, it was just too little too late.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2002"}

Featuring detailed environments and complicated new battle mechanisms, this game demands a different kind of perspective than the first-person shooters from the original Halo series. You'll need to uncover the hidden strengths and weaknesses of each unit and play them to your tactical advantage, and that's just the beginning.UNSC: Be Part of a Legendary ConflictThe story opens with UNSC forces retaking the planet Harvest from the Covenant. At your disposal -- should you choose to take command of UNSC forces -- will be everything from a corps of highly-trained Marines to the Warthogs, Scorpions, and Hornets you'll need for air and land attacks. You'll take stock of the map and decide between holding your ground or advancing on enemy strongholds, all while trying to navigate the local terrain and outsmart Covenant forces. And when you need something extra to tip the tide in your favor, UNSC leaders can provide you with the ability to mobilize highly specialized units or call the Spirit of Fire vessel for support from above.Covenant: A Capable, Playable Enemy FactionThat's right, Covenant is playable in this corner of the Halo universe. This alliance of alien species has manipulated advanced technology, firepower, and tactical prowess into a powerful force that is engaged in a Genocidal war against human race, having branded humans as heretics. With the ability to play as these tough, alien fighters, you'll have advanced shield technology, the modular Citadel at the heart of Covenant's colonizing power, and, of course, the iconic Scarab attack vehicle at your disposal, adding a whole new dimension to your strategic warfare. The Scarab is a terrifying military vehicle crafted from heavy mining equipment. And with a mining laser that delivers massive damage across battlefields large and small, turrets for taking on air attacks, and the ability to clamber over any terrain, what's not to love about commanding Scarabs instead of fighting against them?Developed Exclusively for Xbox 360Most console RTS games are adapted from existing PC games, which can make their controls bulky or awkward, butHalo Warshas been developed for Xbox 360 from the ground up. This means the controls are sensitive, intuitive, and easy-to-operate in the midst of battle. And the UI is just as intuitive, so whether you're managing a unit of marines or a deadly machine, you can focus on creating a battle strategy instead of worrying about how to overcome a clumsy controller.No matter which faction you choose to play as, you can test your skills against those of other players in online skirmishes that allow up to six players with the New Xbox Experience through Xbox LIVE.","reviewerName":"D.M.","summary":"Great real-time strategy for console","reviewText":"Halo Wars is a great real-time strategy game.

As much as I love the Bethesda formula (Fallout 3 remains one of my top 5 games of the seventh generation), something about the Elder Scrolls has always rubbed me the wrong way. As much as I appreciated what Morrowind and Oblivion did well, I could never get into those games for some reason. The worlds felt too devoid of life for me, and I was never able to develop any sense of attachment to the game world, which made all the freedom and opportunity those games offered seem distant and pointless. While Skyrim doesn't completely correct all of the issues of its predecessors, it's easily the biggest step forward the series has taken. Skyrim takes the concept of living another life in another world to a whole new level, while at the same time creating a world that feels so much more organic.If you're not familiar with The Elder Scrolls series, these are fantasy RPGs that place you in a huge, vast open world, and let you basically tackle the game however you see fit. As you do this, your character's skills will improve in direct correlation to how you play the game. If you like to wield magic, sneak around and steal things, fight with two-handed greatswords, or anything else, your skills in these areas will improve the more you use them. In addition to this \"get better with practice\" way of character development, Bethesda has also brought in the Perk system from Fallout 3 that, upon leveling up, lets you augment your skills in a myriad of ways that suit your play style. These two systems combined allow making your character suit your play style a more natural and flexible process than perhaps any other RPG on the market. It works wonderfully and really makes your character feel like an extension of yourself.Skyrim's true triumph, however, is the land of Skyrim itself. The first game on Bethesda's new engine titled Creation, Skyrim is by far the most beautiful game they've ever made, significantly surpassing the still-excellent looking Oblivion and Fallout 3 when it comes visuals. Skyrim is a beautiful land, with amazing snowy mountains, vibrant tundras, lush forests, and stunning, expertly-crafted cities. More than ever, you WANT to explore every part of this amazing land, which is a daunting task. Skyrim is huge, filled with amazing sights and secrets everywhere. Hundreds of hours of content are here in the base game if you so choose. Special mention, though, has to go to the cities of Skyrim, which are incredible. From the oasis-like Whiterun, to the epic, stone-carved Markarth, to the sprawling capital of Solitude, the painstaking detail put into the craft of these environments, from the architecture to the inhabitants in the streets and shops, can always be sensed. The world of Skyrim is one of the most vast, mysterious, and fully-realized game worlds you'll ever see, and wandering this land, living a second life here, is a treat.With a game of this scope, Skyrim is of course not perfect. The biggest problem, as in Bethesda's previous games, remains the combat. In the face of modern RPGs like Dark Souls, Kingdoms of Amalur, and The Witcher 2, Skyrim's combat feels clunky and archaic. Sure, it's a huge step up from Oblivion's combat, with some cool kill animations and some weight behind the swings of swords and bursts of spells. But overall, while certainly competent, Skyrim doesn't have the most enjoyable combat out there. Despite being quite cleaned up on the PC, the game has some bugs, and saving often is advised. But in the grand scheme of things, these small complaints don't really matter. The game is still a huge improvement over its predecessor, and nothing else out there will give you the experience that Skyrim offers. The game runs great on a wide range of video cards, and the Steam version offers easy access to user mods and updates from Bethesda. My laptop with a second generation i5, 8GB of RAM, and an GeForce GT 540M, ran Skyrim beautifully with most of the settings turned up high. Also, I highly recommend playing this game with a mouse/keyboard. It supports a gamepad, but the menu interfaces, particularly the often-relied-upon Favorites menu, can be quite awkward to use, making the keyboard's hotkeys a much more pleasant way to experience the game.Skyrim is a masterpiece. It is perhaps the most sprawling, epic single-player game ever made, and it achieves the amazing feat of filling all that vastness with excellent content that rarely dips in quality. It is a must play for RPG lovers, and is surely a historical moment for the development of the medium of video games. Never before has living another life in a digital world been quite like this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00AMA4L4E","description":"The most controversial game in recent years returns in this special director's cut. Unofficially the best game of the year (2010) according to fans and critics alike, Deadly Premonition split the gaming community right down the middle and earned itself cult status for its memorable cast and story.","reviewerName":"Sloopydrew","summary":"Budget graphics, triple-A fun!","reviewText":"While Deadly Premonition is strictly a budget title as far as gameplay and graphics (which is why, even with the \"Director's Cut\" frills, I think the pricing is still a bit high), the game excels when it comes to story, humor, characters and uniqueness. No one has ever played a game quite like this, unless they've played this game.Deadly Premonition took me 8 days to finish, which says something as the game took 21 hours to beat. I kept coming back to the title when I knew I should be doing something more productive, like flossing my teeth or applying heel balm to my hoof-like feet.Deadly Premonition became a temporary obsession. When I was at work and couldn't play, I was thinking about detective work in the game. When I was out with friends, I was wondering what the characters in the game would do or say next. When I was in bed, thinking about the game literally kept me awake, wondering how long I could keep Agent York awake with the in-game coffee and food I had acquired.2 nights out of the 8 it took me to complete the main story, I stayed up all night and went to work the next day dead tired due to Deadly Premonition. Was it worth it? Surprisingly, yes. It actually has an ending that -- while widely criticized as too outlandish -- in the context of the game, works. No, you won't confuse this for an AAA title. But if you don't have some of the most fun you've ever had playing a game, you may be confused.A title with budget graphics and gameplay and AAA levels of fun? I'll take it! As a matter of fact, I took it twice -- first on the 360 and now on the PS3 with the Director's Cut.Don't miss out on this game! 360 owners who did are now looking at paying $60+ to buy it used, as it's gone out of print.Tip: I usually like Move controllers (they worked great with BioShock: Infinite), but they are practically unusable on this game. Both the Move control setup and the dreadfully poor 3D are gimmicks to justify a higher price and should be ignored.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00005043P","description":"Sonic the Hedgehog 3 for Sega Genesis, no case","reviewerName":"tdl","summary":"Sonic 3 is good and Sonic and Knuckles is okay, but when combined they make one of the greatest games ever made","reviewText":"Sonic 3 is good, but short. Sonic and Knuckles is okay, but even shorter. The games are near perfect when combined. The zones are huge! The bosses are hard but creative! The soundtrack is way better then Sonic 2! Describing the experience takes forever. The game opens with a clip of Sonic flying towards the Floating Island in his airplane. He jumps off (OH NO!) and then turns into Super Sonic (YAY!). Then Knuckles the Enchidna is introduced, he steals Sonic's chaos emeralds and runs off. The first level is Angel Island. It seems a typical tropical theme, but then a robot comes down and lights the island on fire! The entire Act 2 was on fire! I give Angel Island a 8/10, it was really neat.After clearing Angel Island, Knuckles hits a switch that took out the bridge Sonic was standing on, leading to Hydrocity. Hyrdocity was very exciting, twice as much as Sonic 2's Chemical Plant zone. Sonic zoomed down water slides, corkscrews, and conveyer belts. The Hyrdocity theme was very peppy, it fit the zone perfectly. It definetly deserves a 9/10, I loved it.A water geyser takes Sonic to Marble Garden. Marble Garden was okay, but it did not have as much charm as some of the other zones. It was neat that Eggman was constantly causing the land to shift with his giant drill. At the end of the zone Eggman flees and Sonic must get Tails to fly him up into the sky to chase down Eggman. Marble Garden gets a solid 7/10.I guess Tails wanted to stop for cotton candy or something, because he drops Sonic off and flies away. Carnival Night was probably the worst zone in the game. It had a dull theme and annoying red cylinders that confused everyone. Knuckles comes and turns off the Carnival Night's lights, so part of the level was spent in the dark. In the end Sonic was shot out of a cannon into the Ice Cap zone. Carnival Night gets a rating of 4/10.Sonic somehow lands on a snowboard in the middle of the polar ice cap and starts riding down a hill. Ice Cap is one of my favorite zones, it had a very impressive theme and the background showed bits of ice floating away. Ice Cap gets a 9/10.Sonic somehow ends up at Eggman's Death Egg Repair Site, the Launch Base zone. I was amazed because it really felt like what it was supposed to be. The Death Egg sits in the background, supported by a ton of cables. At the end of the zone the Death Egg launches into the sky, and Sonic uses Eggman's Eggpod to catch up to it. If Sonic and Knuckles is not locked on, you move on to the final boss. Either way, you defeat a boss and the Death Egg falls out of the sky. The Sonic and Knuckles portion starts, opening with Mushroom Hill. Knuckles (who also survived the fall of the Death Egg) peeks out from behind a ledge to see if anybody is around him. He runs off, and then Sonic follows. Mushroom Hill was a forest themed level, but then Knuckles cuts on a fan and blows Sonic to the treetops. After Sonic got back to the ground he finds Eggman, who attempts to flee from Sonic. He retreats to his giant blimp, the Flying Battery. Mushroom Hill gets a 7/10.Flying Battery was epic. Sonic crashes through the door while the music runs wild, and then finds stupid Eggman has a laser. Eggman tries to hit Sonic with the laser, but instead starts shooting the Flying Battery. It crashes, Sonic escapes, and on to Sandopolis!Then to Lava Reef!Then to Hidden Palace, where Knuckles finds out Eggman has tricked him! Eggman steals the Master Emerald, and then zaps Knuckles.Sky Sancutary is truly the highest point in the game. The Death Egg rises, Eggrobos invade, and the entire sancturary collapses! The drama was awesome, as the half the processor on the Genesis was used to control the Eggrobos who chased the little bunnies out of the buildings.Sonic manages to get into the Death Egg, but it wasn't just 2 bosses. The whole thing was a maze with gravity changers, light pathes that Sonic had to run across, and crazy tricks. Sonic somehow gets past all the chaos and gets to the final boss. A GIANT EGGMAN ROBOT THAT MADE SONIC 2'S EGGMAN ROBOT LOOK LIKE A BABY! The giant robot takes up the entire screen and tries to crush his giant fingers. Then once Sonic smashes his fingers, he switches to a side view and starts firing giant laser beams that take up half of the screen! AMAZING!That is the whole game, but reading about it and seeing it in action are two different things. I still play even though it is 15 years old and I've beaten it at least 12 times. The game's stunning graphics, musical scores, and level design still hold up, even though it is 2012 and Nintendo is about to release another crazy console. Nothing has ever compared to this game, Sonic Adventure didn't, Sonic 2 didn't, and even Mario has never been this good in 2D.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2012"}

In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms.

I have only played through as the Hero...but I have spoken to several friends who have played both sides and they have said that the ending is no different regardless of your karma choices.

You will not be disappointed.Presentation - 10/10Great plot, storytelling and twist. Graphic novel style cutscenes are cool too. As an artist I really enjoyed them. Rich, vibrant colors. The passage of day and night was a nice touch as well.Graphics - 10/10Best PS3 graphics to date. A few oddities here in there but nothing that bogged down the gameplay.Sound - 10/10Sound is sound...If I don't get annoyed by the voice acting or an overused phrase I have no complaints. Solid voice acting and sound effects.Gameplay - 10/10Easy to use controls. Gameplay is very fluid. You will discover new abilities throughout the game, so you always have something new to look forward to upon completion of a mission.Lasting Appeal - 10/10Very high replay value. I will be using this game as a benchmark for all future PS3 releases. This game has set the bar high.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2010"}

While I think the previous two games are better, all three games are five stars. This game is amazing, the graphics are great, the boss fights are brutal, the weapons are insane, the story was good but lacking a little, and the puzzles weren't challenging like in the first two games, but thats ok. The experience of playing this game is unique. If you played GOW Collection, then chances are you will get this regardless. If not, do yourself a favor and get The Collection before you play this. Don't be like those guys giving this game a low rating because they have no idea what's going on. Besides it's only $30. Remember to buy PS3 exclusives new, even if it's $10 or $15 more than used, we have to support our console.

Maybe my interest changed and I didn't know it?This is also a reedited review based on the performance issues that have plagued the Ps3 version almost exclusively. I am 30 hours into the game and I am starting to slowly witness more of the issues they talked about and some not talked about. Not everyone has suffered the issues on ps3 which is odd because it is most likely due to a structural issue with the ps3.[...]However, these are unofficial opinions based on someone who worked on Fallout: New Vegas, a similar open world game and sequel to Bethesdas Fallout 3. Skyrim and New Vegas had different game developers, but were both published by Bethesda. Nevertheless, I think the guy is probably correct. If you don't read the article, it basically says that the PS3 only has 256 mb of ram devoted separately to both graphics and memory. Why is this important? Answer: xbox 360 (pc) has the same amount (or more for pc), 512 mb, but the xbox ram is universal. Thus, it can devote more ram towards one or the other based on the games needs. As you advance more in the PS3 game, your save files get bigger (from all the things you have collected, dropped, killed guys, all the stuff you moved around throughout the game grows) while having less ram to work with. This is probably whats causing all the problems, although it is interesting to note that some PS3 users have reported no issues. Maybe they don't care? Its probably safe to assume that with a game this size, there are numerous factors at work. However, we know there are issues. I was hoping I would be one to avoid these but I am starting to see more freezes and game glitches as I reach the infamous 6 mb save files of which I am almost there (this is where a lot of people have started seeing issues). The most outrageous glitch I have had (and one I have not read other people having) is when I was fighting a dragon and was killed without good reason. During the battle, my body simply shot upwards in the air and died instantly. I reloaded and tried the battle again and the same thing happened.The Thanksgiving patch also supposedly may make the game worse which they said would do the opposite. Honestly, as of right now, I am quite worried. I saw another video where either IGN or another company was playing the game and it was suffering from frequent lag. I can't take it back to gamestop so I am stuck with my version. Sadly, I found out after I already bought the game that my friends wife (who has the same computer as me) can run the game fine. Ouch. I now feel dissapointed at what was once started out an amazing game experience. Now, I have to worry about crippling issues down the road. I would have personally been fine (I'm sure many others would to) to have the game been delayed for ps3 and done correctly, if possible.Besides all the issues, the game is a blast. No need to go over what you have already heard. Its an open world adventure that keeps getting more interesting as you go along and play at your own speed. But the issues are there. For now, it is not like it freezes every 10 minutes, but I am worried about future lag. The game has probably frozen about 4-5 times in the 30 hour span. Plus some glitches, occasional short lag in open areas, and the before mentioned super dragon glitch that happened twice. All in all, not enough to ruin it so far. That being said, I hope people take everything I have said into account. I did not mean to focus entirely on the negative aspects, but I thought they should be addressed more thoroughly because everyone knows about the awesome gameplay etc. And you I encourage you to read the article and do as much research as you can before buying this game. You will have to decide your own tolerance for glitches.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2011"}

The screen protector comes shielded by three pieces of blue plastic and four pull-tabs.  Application is surprisingly easy.  As the diagram in the second picture shows you just have to remove the four tabs in order as you apply.  With some gentle smoothing by the accompanying piece of cardboard the screen protector went on flawlessly and without bubbles.As the other reviewer indicates, the size is not perfect (which is why I'm giving it four stars).  The directions have you applying the protector towards the top, leaving a few millimeters exposed around the bottom and sides.  This is not that abnormal.  I don't think that I've ever purchased a screen protector that didn't leave at least a little bit of a gap.I've played a few of my games to test the protector out.  It doesn't appear to affect the performance of the GamePad when you use the stylus or your finger (the screen is still fairly sensitive).  It is also very clear so the brightness and color of the GamePad do not appear to be affected.Somewhat related:Obviously, you should clean the surface well before applying (I always keep a couple of boxes ofZeiss lens wipeson hand for my glasses and other detail jobs like this).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2012"}

A year has passed since the loss of the Fifty Years' War. The prince, thought two years of age, has ascended the throne, his father having been claimed by sudden malady. Too young to rule, the prince requites a regent, who would be king in all but name. The queen's brother, Duke Larg, had seemed the obvious choice for the regency. However, fearing the influence such an appointment would give the queen, the council refused to back him. Instead, they appointed the kings younger cousin, Duke Goltanna, as regent.Duke Goltanna and Duke Larg were both generals who had distinguished themselves during the Fifty Years' War. Duke Goltanna counts as ally the greater part of the aristocracy loyal to the crown. However, the fallen nobility and free knights left in the aftermath of the Fifty Years' War have aligned themselves with Duke Larg.With Duke Goltanna under the banner of the Black Lion, and Duke Larg under that of the White, the stage is set for what history would record as the War of the Lions.Story: 5/5You start out as a young boy named Rama. You must make some tough choices and witness some horrible events, while saving the world from the Zodiac Stones.Sound: 3.5/5The musical score of Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions is typical fantasy; it sets the mood and tone of this great tale. The new voice acting adds a great touch!Graphics: 4.5/5The in-game graphics have not been updated from the original game on thePlayStation One. What made this edition of the game shine is the addition of some great-animated cut scenes with lots of voice acting placed at the right moments, when the drama and excitement are high. This was a great way to add more depth to the story and keep the same old game that we all love.Game play: 3.5/5The game play for this game is Strategy RPG. You move your pieces and attack, then the bad guys move and attack. The battle system for Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions is very deep with being able to change your job class like Squire, Chemist, Knight, Archer, Monk, White Mage, Black Mage, Time Mage, Summoner, Thief, Orator, Mystic, Geomancer, Dragoon, Samurai, Ninja, Arithmetician, Bard, Dancer or Mime. Just for this edition, two new job classes were added, a Dark Knight and the Onion Knight. The dark knight is my personal favorite because they start out strong. The Onion Knight is the strongest overall; you just need to build them in layers. (Oh, tons of work!)  With mixing and matching job skills you could make tons of combinations like a Summoner that can cast Black magic and wield a sword, or a Ninja with white magic. Have fun with all the different possible combinations you can make.  I like the jobs system in the taverns, in town you can gain much need Exp. points by taking on those extra jobs.Replay Value: ?/5With the story mode 1.5/5, with the addition of multiplayer this game is given new life. 3.5/5. You and your friend must have a copy of Final Fantasy Tactics for the PSP. You can then choose between 2 modes. Melee = you vs. your friend or Co-Op you both vs. the computer.Overall: 4.5/5This game is a must have for any Final Fantasy fan or someone who enjoys mystery, political intrigue or Shakespearean tragedy. Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions for the PSP is one of the gems that I've decided to hold onto and add to my very selective collection.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2008"}

Developed exclusively for the Nintendo Wii,Rune Factory: Frontieris a singleplayer adventure that features all the popular life Sim gameplay and hack and slash role-playing fans know and cherish, but now with the stunning graphics and flexibility of the Wii's unique control system to fully immerse players in theRune Factoryuniverse..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Breath life into the land.View larger.Dungeon crawl for baddies.View larger.Make game changing decisions.View larger.The StoryOur hero enters the frontier, where no one dares enter, to cultivate the unforgiving soil. As time passes, his lonely town of one becomes a town of two, three...until it grows into a town to behold. The town is not the only thing to behold. Among the newcomers are beautiful ladies who have moved to the town to start a new life. Which one will be our hero&rsquo;s lucky lady? However, our hero is soon faced with a problem. Creatures of the frontier, many of them hostile towards humans, pose a great threat to the safety of his townsfolk. To find a way to live in peaceful coexistence or perhaps destroy them along with the danger they bring &ndash; the decision is up to our hero.GameplayAs with previous related games,Rune Factory: Frontierfeatures a myriad of Life Sim activities like farming, raising livestock, building relationships with NPCs, etc., as well as role-playing elements like dungeon crawling and item collection and leveling, but in structuring gameplay it goes to great lengths to incorporate an open-ended structure that allows players to choose the type of game they wish to experience at all points in the game. This means that although at the beginning of the game players will find themselves presented with the familiar opportunity of starting a farm, selling their crops at market and by doing so improving the overall prosperity and size of their town, they are not necessarily tied to the land. Although farming is an excellent way to finance adventuring, the rich RPG elements of the game can be pursued at any time. These elements present themselves mostly in the form of battling monsters and bosses that have found their way into the land, but seem to be coming from the mysterious 'Whale Island,' which floats in the sky above your town. Players can either battle the monsters or make friends with them, raising them as a kind of livestock. As with everything inRune Factory: Frontier, the choice is yours. Whether it's growing crops, expanding the town, fighting (or befriending) monsters or even falling in love, the experience is unique to each player.Key Game Features:Lifelike Interactions- NPCs will come and go based on the player&rsquo;s actions. Want to get along with your neighbor? Want to give fellow townsfolk something they might hate? Go ahead, but they may get upset and leave the town. Be nice to attract more newcomers.Natural Ecosystem- Breathe life into the barren wilderness by cultivating it and planting crops. Small creatures (spirits) will gather first, triggering a food chain to later attract larger and rarer creatures. You are responsible for bringing more fertility to the land.Floating Island to Explore- There is an island that floats in the skies. When you see it, you must quickly find a way to get on it as new discoveries await.Intuitive Wii Controls- Use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk to do everything. Plow the land, shake hands with townsfolk to strengthen relationships, or even wave it around when you&rsquo;re on a date with a girl. (Also compatible with the Classic Controller.)Open-ended Play Structure- Whether you prefer Life Sim gaming, Action RPG action or a mix of both,Rune Factory: Frontierlets you game as you want, when you want.Console Debut-Frontieris the console debut of the popularRune Factoryseries.","reviewerName":"Daniel Mosquera","summary":"A great Harvest Moon like console game","reviewText":"My wife and I love harvest Moon games and got this game to check it out since the development team is involved as well.

Beitler \"Avid Reader\"","summary":"Best buy for the money!","reviewText":"Although you can purchase an Xbox Live Gold Membership at any number of retail stores or online shops, I found it most cost effective to purchase it from amazon.com. Why? Three basic reasons:1. Cheapest price - This is pretty much a given, right? Amazon generally has cheaper prices on products than most stores, and if you opt for a code rather than for a physical card, you know you're going to save a few bucks. At the time I purchased my online code, I got a price $10 less than the asking price for the physical card.2. No sales tax - For the time being, this is going to be the case for most buyers. The government will likely start applying sales tax to online purchases in the next year or so, depending on how much backlash the public throws at them. Given the current state of our complacent and ignorant populace, it is very unlikely that this can be prevented from happening.3. Bonus offers included - This is time sensitive. At various times of the year, amazon or Microsoft will have bonus offers for their products. At the time of my own most recent purchase (on Christmas Day of 2013), I received redemption codes for three free game downloads.This was the best deal I came across, and I doubt I could have found a better deal had I spent all day searching for them.

{"product_name":"B00005YTYJ","description":"WithGrand Theft Auto III, Rockstar proves that not all  developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games.  This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular  predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any  criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the  local population for their money (or weapons), make time with  prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking  more structure can embark on dozens of plot-driven missions or steal  cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and go on vigilante  missions. Grab a cab and play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi.  Take a fire truck and earn money putting out fires. The game just never  gets boring.As in real life, there are consequences for your criminality. As your  random acts of mayhem mount up, the police start hounding you,  eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you  continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily  the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are  packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every  category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump  trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically  when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific  detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic,  pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing.  Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine  different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a  monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages  to get everything right.--T.

{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"A. C. Ege/Acedoh \"acedoh\"","summary":"Welcome to Liberty City","reviewText":"Niko is new to America.  Brought by hopes and promises of his cousin Roman about how wealthy he is.  Unfortunately for Niko he quickly finds the stories to be lies.  Grand Theft Auto IV starts as others in the series with an anti-hero.  Getting involved in doing the wrong things is all to easy in this game.  From the very get go you are learning that living the American life can be difficult and in order to get your story going you must break the law.  For the most part Niko doesn't have a problem with this since he has become raw after being a soldier in war.GTA IV has probably one of the darkest stories so far in the series.  This is not the type of game you will play and comment on how cheerful the story is.  For those of you who have played previous GTA games you will notice many similarities.  From the gameplay mechanics to the story line.  Although people who are new to the GTA series will find how simple the learning curve really is in this game.  The game gives you an incredible amount of tutorials and guides you thru your first several missions making things easy to understand.  Most features in this game are simple to understand and keep this game from getting over anyones learning curve.What has made the Grand Theft Auto series so superb is the story telling.  Excellent voice acting with intense and exciting missions make GTA IV a true winner.  From the first moment on you will notice that you aren't really playing a game as much as taking part in an intense crime drama.  Think Sopranos from the former Soviet Union.  The game is mission based and gives you the ability to choose what you want to do at any given point.  You meet numerous characters who are all about committing crimes and they give you certain jobs.  Of course these jobs increase your reputation and help progress you thru the story.  Along the way you will find numerous characters.  Some you will like and others you will probably want to get rid of yourself.This game has further evolved ideas from previous GTA games.  Niko can not only date one woman at a time but several.  It's really up to you.  Just remember how in real life this can be time consuming it can also be in a game.  You will have woman calling and texting you if you ignore them to long.  Then comes taking them out for dates.  Each woman has different tastes and interests and it's up to you to know where to take them.  Some of the activities can actually be fun like playing darts or pool as these mini games do have learning curves.  The girl you are with will respond to your success or failure at these games.  Obviously there are numerous other activities in wonderful Liberty City.  Also it's important for Niko to accessorize and finding the best clothing to wear is important.  Image is everything as as you progress you get access to better clothes.  The car mechanics have improved in this game but don't expect to have similar handling to a racing game.  What is cool to look at is the amazing detail they have put into the car damage.  Every little ding makes an impact on the car you are in.  Lastly is the music selection.  An incredible 200 songs are available in Liberty City to listen to on the radio.  Numerous radio stations including the talk ones belt out hit songs and comedic advertisements.  Niko even has the ability to watch t.v.  They covered every detail in this game and it shows.As if a single player mode that will take you 30 to 40 hours to beat is not enough there is also online multiplayer.  Yes you and 15 others can play on the beautiful streets of Liberty City.  The multiplayer is truly open ended for your enjoyment.  Several game modes plus the ability to create your own multiplayer.  You can also invite seven friends to take on eight others.  It's easy to say this game will be enjoyed for months on end.It's easy to be impressed by Liberty City.  It's as close to New York City as any game has ever got.  From the pedestrians that make up the neighborhood to the realistic design of the buildings.  The weather changes and the days progress realistically.  This is one of those games where you can just take it in and enjoy the scenery.  In Grand Theft Auto you have the freedom to do what you want.  This game is intended for adults.  The language and content can be mature most of the time.  Although that is at a parents discretion.  I wouldn't suggest this game for everyone.  Although I would suggest it for those who have enjoyed previous Grand Theft Auto games.  I would also suggest it for those who enjoy mafia or crime movies.  This game will have you sitting back and enjoying the incredible story.  Just don't forget that it's your story to play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2008"}

It takes a few hours to get your hands on weaponry, the majority of the city is locked off from the get-go, and the driving controls take some serious getting used to. I am a decent gamer, and play a ton of games in all genres, and I had to retry quite a few of the early missions due to some seriously tough vehicle handling. that's not to say that it's bad, but rather that you won't immediately be zipping around, pulling off perfect drifts and turns. The combat, however, controls brilliantly, and is a blast.So, basically, this game's amazing, but not without its flaws. If you get frustrated easily, it's still worth getting, just because there's so much \"free play\" stuff to do.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2008"}

With rich palettes of colour, eight four level worlds, spot-on play control, and expert level design, SMB was a much longer game than most of Atari's products and was a game unlike any other at that time. SMB also had the benefit of being very simple to grasp; run, jump, and fire. It was also the first side-sroller as we know it, though Atari's PITFALL set up the concept. Also, it's one of the best.

You young whippersnappers have no respect for your elders, that's what.Without lovely 64 or 128 bit graphics, NES game designers had to use their brains and think of good plots, fluid play, and interesting gimmicks. Of course, some video games failed at that, such as Hydlide or Athena, but the NES truly had some of the finest titles to offer, many of which took on new incarnations throughout the ages to current gaming platforms (Super Mario Bros, Legend of Zelda, Tetris, Mega Man, Final Fantasy, the list goes on...)Nowadays it's hard to find a intact, much less functioning NES and many of its games have been re-released into current platforms so these games aren't lost. But there's still something about the NES and it's simple joypad and array of fun and entertaining games.

Enter an exciting gameplay environment that authentically recreates the whimsical time period of the film and expands the lore and supernatural events that seemingly plague New York City.","reviewerName":"Caleb Williams","summary":"A Very Good Effort","reviewText":"The Ghostbusters, when the films were first released in the 80s, featured a cast of some of the best known names in comedy of that decade. I don't think I can conjure up a memory or thought of a film or TV show that matches the comic brilliance and originality of the first two Ghostbusters movies. Harold Ramis, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson have not combined their skills since those movies until this marvellous video game. The four original Ghostbusters including a few other original cast members reunite to deliver what has undoubtedly led to the talks and eventual confirmation of a third Ghostbusters movie.Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd combined their talents as the writers for the original plot of the video game. The plot circles around the player as a new recruit to the Ghostbusters who is undoubtedly thrust in at the deep end during his initiation period by having to face the Marshmallow Man on a destructive rampage during his first day on the job. What triggered this massive attack was a city wide PKE shockwave that the team eventually discovered has kicked off a tragic event which is slowly combining our dimension with the dimension of the ghosts.Set as a third person shooter, you are certainly placed in a scenario you will have dreamed of as a child. You are given the power of the proton pack in hand and given permission to blast the hell out of New York City and go against the infamous Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man, amongst other famous ghosts from the movies. The aiming and firing aspect isn't anything overly unique but it's simple and effective, and allows you go take the enemy out with ease. The surrounding environments are surprisingly detailed and destructible, so destructible in fact, that when you're destroying it you are shown a meter in the corner that tells you how much your destruction is costing New York. Useless this meter may be, but I found it pretty cool.The enemies vary, there are the simple slime born creatures which can be disposed of easily with the use of the slime blaster. However, the small slime monsters are aplenty and do become a pain as they swarm around you. Another enemy type are the possessors which take on physical forms by using the objects around them and you may be forced to take on a new tactic aside from the general proton blast to take them down. Then there are the ghosts themselves, the ones we are all familiar with from the movies and these are quite tough when you first tackle them, but you become used to the attacks they may throw at you and they are quite easy to dodge. Wearing them down and capturing them is pretty fun though and is the main staple of what the Ghostbusters are about.I really enjoyed this game and am thankful that the old team were brought together for this as I would have hated to think the voice acting would've been done by imitators. The voice acting is very much on par with the characters we know from the movies. Some of the cut scenes are very well done, but they are not consistent as some are magnificently animated, whilst others use the game play graphics for the scenes which takes away from the overall movie like experience which I believe they're trying to project to the player. The comedy was there but in all honesty it wasn't wholly noticeable which is kind of disappointing, but overall, just to have the actors voicing in this game makes it a worthy addition to the Ghostbusters brand.I would recommend that anyone buy or rent it as it's certainly a fun game to get involved with and the trophies are relatively easy to collect, so if you play the games for the trophies, you will have them collected in a second.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2009"}

So, here it goes. The camera, Argh!!! Half the time you can't see what your fighting because your character is in the way or one of the lame AI characters desides to plant his butt right in your view. Speaking if AI, why is it that they seem to shoot allot but kill nothing? I can't tell you how many times I got killed from someone from behind while the stupid AI just watched!The \"skills\" system that allows you to upgrade your magic and weapon would be good if the game lasted more than four hours and you had more opportunity to upgrade. You get awarded points at the end of each level and if you sucked, good luck upgrading anything. For example, I had to play the game through twice just to get all four gun modes and then when you finally are able to \"level up\" your gun/witchcraft, there's no difference. I've maxed out my machine gun and it's no different than it was when I started, lots of noise and 800,000 shots just to kill one enemy. Argh!!! What were the developers thinking?The levels are long and tedious with allot of kill this \"thing\" to unlock that gate. Another funny note is that you meet the final boss right off and you're told that you can't fight him right now because you lack the skills however when you finally do fight him you're character is no different than when you started. What? I know you don't get it but if you buy this game you will... Anyway, I bought this title because there's a survival horror thing going here on which I love, however is the game worth it? Trust me, rent it first.Bullet Witch gets 2 stars from me because there are some really cool moments like battling a demon at 10,000 feet while trying not to fall off the jet.

{"product_name":"B002I0J5UQ","description":"","reviewerName":"1Dub79","summary":"Good game. Low replay value","reviewText":"When I first heard of this game, I was not interested. I figured this game to be another Mafia/Godfather type of game. However, upon seeing things, which can be done on this game, I knew I wanted to try it. I have never played a game, quite like this. This game makes you really feel as if you are a real policeman.CASES: Each case offers varieties of scenarios. Of course, you will have to investigate a crime scene and investigate suspects or witnesses. In addition, some cases may involve chasing a suspect on foot, fist fights, car chases, and gun fights. On some cases, you may have to do all three.CONTROLS: If you played any GTA games, you pretty much have an idea of how the controls are on this game.CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATIONS: Warning!!!! Crime scenes can be VERY gore. This part of the game is very important, and exciting. There is nothing like the feel of being a part of analyzing a crime scene. It truly feels like REAL police work. Not to mention, it is cool to see what types of evidence is found. Some evidence may have to be found via of figuring out a puzzle. Sometimes, being in a quiet room, while trying to find evidence feels a little scary. lol The more evidence you collect on a crime scene, the better off you'll be, once you interrogate a witness or a suspect. Upon finding a piece of evidence, the controller will vibrate and a brief tune will play. Keep in mind; some objects will have absolutely nothing to do with a case. Upon picking up certain objects, you'll have to rotate it with the right analog stick for increase examination, while doing this, the controller will vibrate. When the important evidence is observed, it will be written down in the Phelp's notebook. Once all important evidence is analyzed, a tune will play.DRIVING: Driving is simple. The maps are big to navigate around. That is no big deal. You cannot get lost because you can ask your partner for directions, while driving. Just press the square button, and he'll say, \"make the next left/right.\" If you do not feel like driving, just hold the triangle button, and your partner will drive. Of course, this will be similar what happens, when you call a taxi on GTA games. Keep in mind; your car cannot run through all objects. This can be VERY frustrating, while chasing a suspect. For example, I was chasing a suspect, and ran across a chain linked fence. I actually could not run through it. Wow!FIGHTING: When fighting a suspect, I feel like I am playing a boxing game. The punches feel very nice, upon landing on a suspect. Try not to swing to wild. Pace your punches!!! You can also do grappling moves, and a variety of finishing moves.GRAPHICS: The graphics are better than any Rockstar game ever made. The characters and the landscapes are very vivid and well detailed.INTERROGATIONS: This is practically the basis of the whole game. How good you are able to interrogate witnesses and suspects can determine the outcome of a case. Upon a witness or suspect's response, you may select if a person is lying, have doubt, or are telling the truth. Upon choosing the right option, you'll hear a brief tune. This indicates the right selection. When questioning a suspect, it is VERY important to check their facial expressions, after questioning them. If they are looking you straight in the face, they are likely telling the truth. If they are looking down after the question is asked, they may be lying. Possibly, you may doubt if they are telling the truth. You can even look up at witness or suspect, even after asking them a question, without making a judgement. This gives you the opportunity to get additional looks at their facial expressions.Keep in mind; if you accuse the suspect of lying, they will challenge your reasoning. Then, you automatically go to the evidence pad and use a specific piece of evidence found on the crime scene, which proves the accusation. Sometimes, you might not have the evidence, which proves they are lying. If so, do not worry! Press the circle button, so you can choose the right option. This part is VERY critical. Too many wrong answers, and your case can go awry.INTUITION POINTS: You can gain these, while doing street crimes or solving cases. This can assist you, while analyzing evidence or questioning suspect or witnesses. For example, you may use an intuition point, so you can see exactly where evidence is on the crime scene. I choose not to do this because I would rather find the evidence on my own? Intuition points are more vital for questioning. For example, by using an intuition point, while questioning, one answer can be removed. I can just mark to remove an answer, and I will be left with two answers, instead of one. This narrows down the selections. Sometimes, you may need the assistance of an intuition point because you will endure some very tricking suspects and witnesses, to the point, which you may not be sure if you doubt they are telling the truth or if they were just flat out lying.STREET CRIMES: If you ever playedTrue Crime Streets of LA, do you remember when traveling on the streets, receiving a call about a random crime going on, and deciding to go to the scene to fight it? Well, that can be done on this game, but it is actually a side mission. There are a total of 40 of these missions. Increased amount of gunfights will take place in these missions. Some missions may have you keeping a person from suicide, car chases. One time, a person stole a police car, and had to be chased. In my opinion, Street Crimes just add to the games depth. Not to mention, many buyers have DLCs, as well. Between the original cases and these, you'll have a total of 61 missions.VERDICT AS OF JUNE 4, 2011: I beat the game, prior to this date. Though the game was good and introduced innovation, I would consider this game more of a rental, instead of a buy because of low replay value. Once I beat the STREET CRIMES, what is left to do? I enjoyed each case, but I cannot see myself playing through, again. Still, the game is worth given a try, under the circumstances.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2011"}

Noire isn't  GTA in the 1940's, it's really more like GTA meets CSI in the 1940's. Unlike the GTA series, this game isn't about bringing a city to its knees with mass chaos and mayhem, it's more about investigating crimes and solving murders. L.A. Noire is a much more slower and in depth game that is somewhat stylistically influenced by film noire classics like Stanley Kubrick's the Killing, Roman Polanski's Chinatown, L.A. Confidential, among many, many others. While there is some action, car chases, and gunfights, most of the game seems to fall under investigation, and the game penalizes you for being a bad cop, so no running over pedestrians. The performances of the animated actors is remarkable, as is the attention to detail in terms of the recreation of 1940's Los Angeles. If you are looking for straight up action and explosions, then you're better off with the GTA series, but for those who want to take their time, solve crimes, and enjoy police action without the nuisance of search warrants then this is the game for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2013"}

But it is hollow at its core.  The reason is apparently the fact that Bethesda had a collective stroke and decided it would be smart to bring back leveled monsters, a concept that we all thought had mercifully died off around about Final Fantasy 2.  For those of you newer to RPGs or who haven't read some of the other reviews here already, the idea is thus:  any time your character goes up a level, so do all the monsters.  The stupidity of this scheme should be apparent to anyone, let alone any RPG players, because it makes leveling pointless.  One of the great things about a real RPG (which, sadly, Oblivion is not) is that you get to \"inhabit\" your character - train them, customize them through various levels and skills, and enjoy the game in new ways as they grow stronger.A long time ago, when RPGs were particularly new and (by today's standards) crude, monster levelling was common.  You'd start off at level 1, take your pixelated character icon for a stroll on the World Map, and get ambushed.  Typically, regardless of where you were or what terrain you were in, you'd get ambushed by monsters about your level.  Eventually, you would end up in completely ridiculous situations like getting ambushed by 40th level Ancient Red Dragons right outside the pristine capital city, and realize the game was junk.  I'm no programmer, but I'd speculate that it was simply easier to create a monster auto-generator based on your level than worry about area-specific creatures.Of course, the ENTIRE POINT of going up levels is to be able to rip weaker opponents to shreds or simply frighten them off without a fight, features that savvy game designers started incorporating around about 1985.  Bethesda's decision to turn 20+ years of collective gaming wisdom on its head is the corporate equivalent of Ford deciding it would be a good idea to make its next model of car run on a steam engine.The fact that Oblivion also ties loot gathering to level is just an extra kick in the pants.  Between the two, you've basically removed any incentive to be clever at all.  Great games like Gothic, Gothic II, Divine Divinity, and, yes, Morrowind, encourage you to explore and be tricky by ensuring that if you manage to act \"out of level\" and steal a valuable sword or kill a higher powered monster, you will be so rewarded.  You may get killed repeatedly in the attempts, but I think many folks would attest that managing to off an overpowered monster/player or raiding a castle you had no right to succeed at based on your character stats is one of the most exciting aspects of any good RPG.  With Oblivion, there is no such incentive.  You may as well \"role-play\" a penniless level 1 beggar because you have the same odds of success.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2006"}

Each animal has a unique mode of operating, which means that the two interconnected narratives behind this game each offer their own distinctive challenges to conquer.As the armored, action-oriented scorpion, you'll string together stinging blows into deadly combo moves that culminate in cinematic finishes and decimate your opponents. Playing as the sneaky tarantula requires a little more finesse--you'll find yourself leaping from above onto your nemesis, throw out neatly aimed shots of webbing to paralyze your prey, and finishing creatures off with your devastating fangs.Wild Enemies and a Sinister Back StoryIt takes skill and composure to master the moves the scorpion and tarantula have at their disposal. And, even after you think you've got every move down, you'll find you need to learn methods, since these life-and-death struggles take place between you and a huge array of vicious, hazardous creatures, including wolf spiders, rattlesnakes, Gila Monsters, Tarantula Wasps, black widows, mantises, enemies of your own species, rats, and even humans.Beyond the immediacy of fighting for survival, this game features a story of greed and betrayal in the human world. Slowly unveiled from the disparate perspectives of the two headline creatures, this evolving storyline helps keep even advanced players engaged and guessing at the implications of their own actions.Explore Brutal, Unforgiving EnvironmentsWhichever creature you're playing as, you'll have 360-degree access to a wide range of 3D environments based in the harsh Sonoran Desert. You'll explore a gloomy maze of thorny brambles, forgotten underground tunnels filled with rusting pipes, an above ground wasteland packed with people's garbage, and even a desolate gas station. Each arena promises to challenge your skills as a hunter and a survivor in its own way, while unique angles and a sense of scale that turns small, familiar objects into major obstacles help make these environs especially prickly.","reviewerName":"A. Jefferson","summary":"One of the most unique and immersive titles I've ever played!","reviewText":"This game is unlike anything I have ever played.  I have been following this title since I first heard about it early this year, and am glad to report that I was not disappointed! This game is an interesting take on gaming, since I really can't compare it to anything else on the market.  There really isn't any other game to compare it to.  I only hope that it will catch the attention of Wii owners, since this kind of creativity is all too often overlooked by consumers.  Here `s what I liked:CREEPY gameplay and sound effects: 10/10 I do not like bugs (in person)...but I am fascinated by them.  The protagonists of this game are a Tarantula and a Scorpion, and as such, the game is played from their perspective.  From the very opening scenes of the game, your senses are assaulted with creepy and foreign sounds that I really can't explain... but they work: you will be completely immersed in the world as these insects see it.  It is a really interesting feeling:  The cutscenes and sound track are very well done, and manage to create a really creepy and immersive atmosphere... almost like a survival-horror game.  And I can't say enough about the sound effects... all these little random bug noises (and also some not-so-little bug noises!), and the sound of the creepy-crawlies walking around is especially interesting (considering that, like I said, I am not a big fan of bugs!).  Also, take note of your surroundings while you walk around.  There is a storyline to follow involving humans, and you have a front row seat from a bug's perspective... and as such, you will encounter all sorts of interesting things buried and hidden in the desert.Gameplay/Fighting: 8/10 -  Around every corner waits a battle with thug-like Gila Monsters, stealth and deadly spiders, venomous beetles, or a number of other interesting adversaries. You will quickly find that as the Tarantula/Scorpion you are well equipped to defend yourself.  As you progress through the game, you unlock new moves/combos, as well as increased abilities and strengths.  Let me tell you... the fighting portions of this game are VERY rewarding... some of the \"finishing combos\" that you perform are really interesting and cinematic...and surprisingly brutal.  In addition, since you are an insect, you endowed with really interesting abilities that add some interesting elements to the game: swinging around by spider web, crawling up and down walls, charging up and delivering powerful venom-charged attacks... I had a really good time playing this game, and would be really happy to see a sequel.  For sure, this kind of creativity should be rewarded.  If only more developers had the guts to put out this kind of new stuff.  A game like this could ONLY be done right on the Wii!Controls: 7.5/10 - The controls are simple, and they work.  There aren't any gimmicky waggle controls.  When you perform the finishing moves, you do have to chain together some wiimote and nunchuck movements that are prompted on the screen in order to complete the combo, but I found that this really made the game enjoyable, and weren't gimmicky.  The motion controls don't feel tacked on, as is the case with a lot of 3rd party Wii games, and there aren't any dumb mini-games.  The camera was also really well done, despite what I read in some reviews online... I was actually surprised at the quality of the camera in fact.Replay value: 7/10 - I started the game off on Normal difficulty rather than on Easy, and the game seems nicely balanced.  However, after a few levels I thought I would kick it up a notch and play on \"Deadly\" mode... and proceeded to get jumped by a pair of scorpions that handed by butt to me repeatedly... so I dialed the game back down to Normal difficulty and was able to proceed.  So, I am certain that once I beat this game on Normal, I will likely give it a rest for a few months, then come back and try it again on Deadly, and no doubt it will be just as enjoyable and challenging as it was this time thru.  I should mention, though, that the game has NO multiplayer modes.  It would have been nice to include the option to allow for you and a friend to play through the game together or perhaps some kind of versus mode, and this would have made the game's replay value better.  Once you have beaten this game on Deadly mode, there really isn't much to say or do.  That said, it is still a solid single-player game, and definitely worth a play-through!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2009"}

{"product_name":"B003IEBO9Q","description":"","reviewerName":"MisterMusicFan","summary":"Great game, but not entirely what it could have been","reviewText":"After more than ten years of waiting, the follow-up to one of the most successful and well-known crossover gaming franchises at last arrives. Marvel VS. Capcom 3 breaks into the scene facing a great deal of expectations and anticipation, and in most aspects it delivers, but unfortunately it falls just a bit short of being the spectacular game it could have been.The gameplay and general mechanics are essentially a mishmash of those from both Marvel VS. Capcom 2 and Tatsunoko VS. Capcom. You're given three characters and a series of four core buttons to work with, those being Light, Medium, Heavy and Special attacks. This closely resembles the setup of TVC, simplifying things a bit from the punch and kick commands of MVC; a wise move, given that it generally trims the fat of the previous game's complexity.The Assists, Hyper Combos, crossovers and many other advanced tactics all return, but there are a handful of new alterations and quirks. For one, unlike TVC, there is no Mega Crash (although it is possible to break away from certain long combos) or Baroque; instead, there's the X Factor, a completely new tactic that may only be used once per match. X Factoring allows each of your characters a brief speed and power boost, along with gradual health recovery. These effects are strengthened depending on how many of your 3 characters are remaining (it is at its maximum if you only have one character left). This occasionally adds an interesting element to the gameplay, but many have argued that it's an unnecessary feature which can unfairly turn the tide of a fight, and there is definitely some validity to this complaint. Adding to the imbalance of this is the fact that different characters receive different boosts, leading to some characters gaining ridiculous power boosts while others don't really become much more of a threat.Switching out, or swapping characters, is unfortunately now a sorely obnoxious task, requiring the player to press and hold the Partner button until their other character appears; mistakenly tapping the button will cause a crossover Assist, and as many veteran players know, initiating an Assist when you're intending to switch out can cost you a character, or worse, a match. Needless to say, this can take a bit of getting used to, particularly for those accustomed to the simple back+/Partner command that came before.`Simple mode' from TVC also returns, allowing a significantly simplified control scheme in which special moves and Hyper Combos can be more easily initiated. This may sound unappealing or unfair to those more willing to adjust to the traditional controls, but simple mode also disallows certain attacks and abilities, so it's more of a tradeoff than a wholehearted handicap; it's ultimately a more accessible and user-friendly version of the control scheme.The roster has been among the most debated-over aspects of the game; MVC2 had a whopping 56 characters to choose from, while so far MVC3 only offers 36. Granted, unlike MVC2, you'll find no recycled sprites here; each and every character is brought to vivid new life and design. Many staples and favorites return, so fans of Ryu, Wolverine, Morrigan, Storm, and many others won't be complaining. Devil May Cry's Dante and X-Men's Deadpool are among some of the exciting new additions, while a surprising number of more obscure fan favorites also managed to make the cut. Some of the exclusions are rather upsetting, however, particularly the lack of Venom, certain X-Men characters and most shocking of all, Capcom's flagship character Mega Man. There's more downloadable content to come, however, so we'll have to see what the game's future has to offer.Some of the game's modes and single-player options are more disappointing than others; the online mode is overall pretty satisfying so far, allowing players to either log on for a quick match with a random player or friend, or join a lobby of several players in a sort of informal tournament system. Players can `friend' opponents they'd like to play again and even speak to one another through console-compatible microphones. Lag is generally minimal or non-existent, and thankfully you'll be forewarned of the connection strength in the lobbies before joining. There are also of course leaderboards and rankings for the best of the best, but you can only gain ranks through random Quick Matches, and sadly there's no spectator option; this is particularly frustrating when you're waiting around for your next match in the lobbies.The single-player modes aren't quite as satisfying. MVC3 has a rather standard Arcade mode which features nothing but a series of random battles followed by a boss fight and usually anticlimactic ending sequence which differs by character but is merely a brief series of still pictures and text. The end-game credits are nice the first time you watch them, but they're the same regardless of which character you win with, and therefore aren't nearly as interesting the second, third or fourth time around. Super Smash Bros. Brawl's Subspace Emissary wasn't what a lot of people were hoping for, but it was more engaging than what's offered here. Although the Arcade mode serves its generic purpose, a few more cutscenes or character-specific individuality would've made it really worthwhile.MVC3's biggest asset is it succeeds in a few of the key areas where both TVC and MVC2 failed. TVC offered an overly simplified control option which occasionally allowed for disproportionate advantages, and yet was oftentimes preferable to the needlessly complex alternative. MVC3 manages to find a healthy balance between MVC2's ice-cold complexity and TVC's desperate attempt at accessibility; both regular and simple mode in MVC3 are useable without being cheaply advantageous or impossible to understand. Although deeply advanced tactics will be reserved for deeply skilled players, as they always have been, most players will gain a deeper understanding of the control schemes offered here more quickly than they would have in MVC2.Unfortunately, as expected, opportunities to be cheap present themselves in MVC3 just as they do in most fighting games. Thankfully only a small handful of the characters seem genuinely broken or overpowered, but the ones that are can be truly frustrating to go up against; both Sentinel and Iron Man can fill the screen with enormous and heavily damaging beams and projectiles, while Phoenix becomes virtually impossible to approach, let alone defeat, once she transforms into Dark Phoenix. Ryu spammers are also expectedly back in action, but thankfully so far it doesn't seem quite as common as it was in TVC.The game has a visual style that is distinctly American and heavily influenced by comic books; as where MVC2's artwork and aesthetics felt more authentically Japanese, this game comes off as though it belongs a little more to Marvel than it does to Capcom. This works both for and against it; most of the Marvel characters look amazing, and several of the Capcom ones do as well, although the heavy Americanization of the likes of Tron Bonne and Morrigan can come off as a bit wonky at first. Aside from that, however, the visuals are vivid and gorgeous; one thing you'll never be bored with is what goes on onscreen during matches.Although the complaints may have seemed heavy, MVC3 is in fact a very entertaining and visually appealing game; the online mode is extremely fun and engaging, and some of the downloadable content to come, namely the new characters and complete costume revamps, seem very promising. Tuning up the roster and 1-player mode-adding more modes in general, for that matter-would have really made it nothing short of excellent, but here's hoping they really take popular demand into consideration for DLC.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"\"wellmlynn\"","summary":"The Next Installment in the Mario Legacy","reviewText":"Clear and simple, any kid who tries to play Mario for a while will become engrossed in it and like it.  Mario once again delivers a very good platforming experience with a few new advances.First of all, the water pack.  With the FLUDD added to the game, all new moves such as the rocket or hover nozzle allow for dynamically different gameplay than Mario 64.  For those still looking for the vintage Mario moves such as the patented triple jump and other such moves, many of them have been included.  You can still do the smash thing from mid-air, as well as a few others, although a good deal of  your time will be dealing with the FLUDD.For those from an older generation, many of the original Mario's moves have been added once again.  You can ride Yoshi once again, as well as the way that Mario could climb on fences.  As for the game's difficulty, yes, a child could beat Mario at a young age, but it would be very unlikely that they would finish everything.  The addition of blue coins to collect to buy shines(like the stars from M64) add much more depth to the game.  This as well as a few levels without the pack and other challenging levels make sure the entire game is not as much of a breeze as Luigi's Mansion was.  Although these events are not required to beat the game, they are fun.As for gripes I have about the game?  They are few and far between.  I would have liked to see more control while swimming, although the current control sufficed fairly well.  This and a few of the tried-and-true enemies such as goombas and koopas, but the new enemies are interesting as well.  Although the graphics aren't perfect, many of the water effects as well as some of the nicer textures do well.Overall I'd recommend this game to all ages, as it is very fun and not something that you'd be likely to put down unless you were dying of starvation.

{"product_name":"B00004U5VF","description":"The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.--Jeff Gerstmann--Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect.

Think GTA San Andreas minus the infuriating difficulty, change the setting to medieval times, and you get Fable.  If you're like me, you've been wishing for a more action-heavy RPG, where you viscerally decapitate your opponent with a powerful slash of your sword rather than kill them by choosing options in a menu.  Consider your prayers answered!You have direct control of the hero in fast-paced real-time battles.  You'll be swinging your sword around, hitting foes from afar with your bow and arrow, avoiding damage by dodging or blocking, adjusting to the flow of battle on the fly as foes try to swarm and surround you, and even pay attention to the weight and reach of your weapons.  I don't think I can ever go back to a traditional RPG after playing Fable!The main character's quest of revenge is a theme we've all seen before, as are the rather stereotypical characters (i.e. the self-absorbed, condescending rich-girl snob Briar Rose, the old and fatherly Guildmaster, the mysterious Maze, the enigmatic and evil-as-could-be villain Jack, and so on).  But what matters most is how fun the game is, and Fable hits the mark.  To begin with, there are many things besides the main story quests you can entertain yourself with.  You can flirt shamelessly with the lasses (or lads if you prefer) - although they won't give you a second thought in the beginning since you're just another newbie.  You can drink at a pub till you drop, gamble away your hard-earned money, or go fishing.  If you're feeling spiteful, you can punch people at random or fry them with a lighting spell, or even kill them, although you'll have guards tackling you pretty quick whenever you \"break the law.\"  When you get famous enough that people start cheering at your mere presence, you can get someone to fall in love with you and get married.  Of course, you'll have to buy a house for your new bride/husband, and since you can own multiple properties at once, you can rent out the ones you won't live in for income.As is the trend in games today, Fable has no moral compass - be as evil or good as you want to be, although I found that the game actually has a subtle way of pushing you in the good direction: one, the vast majority of the missions that are offered in the Guild are righteous ones.  Two, people will flee in terror at the mere sight of you if you're very evil, which makes it all but impossible to show off your quest trophies to earn some quick Renown Points.  Three, you'll automatically gain small amounts of good points every time you kill a monster.  And four: some gamers have said that merchants will refuse to sell you stuff if you're too evil (I've yet to verify this).  All too often I found that being evil was simply too inconvenient, so I took the good path.Another minor gripe I have is in the combat system: you'll need EVERY button on the controller for combat, and since the Xbox controller is big and clumsy for people with smaller hands (like me), it's a bit overwhelming at first.  Probably the biggest fault is that you have to hold down the left trigger to stay locked on your enemy; using the left thumbstick to move the hero while holding down the left trigger is not the easiest task unless you have football player-sized hands.  I would have preferred a system similar to Jade Empire, where you can simply tap either trigger once and stay locked on until you change targets.  Also, there is a bug that sometimes causes you to lose your lock-on for no reason, even when the left trigger is held down.  This is kinda frustrating when you're outnumbered and about to be surrounded.Another bug I found is that sometimes your magic spells will be \"locked\" and unusable.  This happens when you visit the town of Bowerstone, then leave to another area.  What actually happens is that when you visit Bowerstone, the people there will tell you that they \"like their peace in their town\" and prohibit all magic and weapons inside the town's borders.  Your spells are supposed to be reactivated as soon as you leave, but sometimes they get \"stuck.\"  When this happens you can fix the problem by simply saving the game and then reloading.Fable is now one of my favorite RPGs of all time.  And the fact that Lionhead Studios took a chance and made Fable exclusive to the Xbox, a console not known for RPG fans, is that much more commendable.  I'm eagerly looking foward to Fable II.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-02-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00178631E","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Well worth the wait, but still lacking something","reviewText":"The Good: DirectX 11 visuals look stunning, fun and past paced action, bullet time is used well, superb camera work and cinematography, one of the most engaging stories in any recent shooter, lengthy story modeThe Bad: Some bullet time quirks, last-man-standing has some issues, gameplay is a bit shallow and feels repetitive some times, scripted bullet time events are spread too thinMax Payne pretty much took bullet time effects mad popular by The Matrix and made it mainstream for games. Back in the day Max Payne was a high-tech graphic noire story by Rockstar Games. It was fun, full of action, and had a great story and character. The second game did the same thing, but felt too familiar to the first game. The third time around is a decade later, but Rockstar now has the tech to do what they originally wanted. Max Payne 3 is one of the best looking games out there, but also features one of the richest and well delivered cinematic stories in recent gaming history.Max Payne has retired and is just mourning the death of his wife and kid while getting drunk every day. An old buddy from the police force stops by and recruits him for a body-guard job in Sao Paulo protecting a very rich family in a third world country. Things go wrong, like they always do for Max, and he needs to redeem himself and set things straight after so many screw-ups through the game. I can't say much more without spoiling the story, but you're in for a treat on this one.The game feels familiar once you start getting into it. You can dual wield weapons or use a two-handed weapons. Bullet time is back with bullet dodge as well. You can get behind cover and use bullet time to pull off headshots and kill a dozen enemies that would normally kill you without it. Bullet dodge is fun to when you don't have cover or just want to knock some guys down quickly while moving to cover. My only issue here is that it isn't as fast as previous games. Spinning around in bullet dodge is slower and feels too weighty for me. Max's bullet time meter only refills if you stick your head out and start killing enemies without it so there is some balance. If you get hurt you can pop painkillers, but they aren't in abundance like the last two games. I don't think I ever had over 4 at one time and they are hard to come by.That's pretty much all there is to the action. There are many different weapons with things added on like laser sights, nightvision sights, scopes, and flashlights. I really wish the gameplay was evolved a little more, but all you do is shoot everything that moves. There are some great cinematic moments that break this up like bullet time shooting in different scenarios which is really fun. I just wish it wasn't spread so thin because a lot of the time the game gets extremely difficult and repetitive with too many of the same type of shootouts in a row. At least the environments change all the time so you have a lot of different scenery to look at.Max Payne 3 has some of the best camera work and cinematography in a game that I have ever seen. At certain points the camera will snap to the last enemy in the area that is dying so you can pump more rounds into him as he falls. Then the scene will go right into a cut scene seamlessly and then right into another action sequence. I don't think I have ever felt like playing an action movie before more than I have with Max Payne 3. The game is also really long with 14 chapters that will take about 12+ hours to beat. The story is just bursting at the seams with detail and lots of scenarios to make it not seem rushed and incomplete.There's a multiplayer mode that can be pretty fun as well as an arcade mode to keep you coming back. You can play through the main story again to find all the golden gun parts and clues if you want for achievements. The game also plays better on the PC due to the pin point precision of a mouse, and the addition of the latest DirectX 11 graphics which will require a monster rig to run at a decent frame rate. I didn't find any major problems with the game, just a few annoying ones that were persistent throughout the whole game like the difficulty imbalance, some bullet time quirks, and actually a big issue with last-man-standing. If you have a pill bottle left and you die you get a few seconds to shoot that enemy and Max will automatically consume the bottle. If Max is flopping around or turned around you have to wait for the reticle to automatically face the enemy. If you are out of ammo you're screwed. Some times objects will be blocking your shot and you get screwed there too.Overall, Max Payne 3 is a wonderful game with top-notch cinematography, superb voice acting, and high-end visuals. Fans of the first game will be pleased with this lengthy shooter, but the gameplay itself can be repetitive, and shallow some times. The cinematic bullet time events are spread too thin, but it can be forgiven due to how wonderful everything else is. Max Payne 3 was well worth the 10 year wait, and here's to hoping there is another one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00007LV7Y","description":"Silent Hill 3continues the series' trademark brand of psychological horror and terrifying gameplay. As a teenage girl named Heather, players must explore and unravel the mysterious connection between the god-forsaken town and her inner fears. The game features enhanced graphical detail, a more complex storyline, and even more grotesque monsters than the previous games.","reviewerName":"Matthew Warner","summary":"Welcome Home","reviewText":"Heather, your average 17-year-old American teen girl, leads a fairly normal life. She's a tad rebellious and has an independent streak, but at heart she's a brave but kind soul. Nothing spectacular has ever really happened to her, and the only really remarkable thing about her -- besides the expensive (but impressive) dye-job haircut -- is the nightmares she's prone to having. This may stem from her vague past, but for quite some time she's managed to ignore the implications a smoky history and an oddly concerned father bring to bear. Of course, it's only a matter of time before your past catches up to you...So starts the third installment of Konami's groundbreaking horror series, Silent Hill. It's both a departure and a return for the series, in that it ties in very closely to the first game in the series both for fear factor and plot, but eschews that game's penchant for wildly incoherent narrative in favor of the more straightforward storytelling of the second game.Translation: Not as weird as part one, but scarier than part two.And, after playing through all three installments all over again, I can only say that the series continues to outdo itself. Silent Hill 3 is arguably the best in an excellent line, and any fans who felt a little burned by the thoughtful but slower pace of Silent Hill 2 should be jumping for joy; part 3 actually surpasses the original for raw fear factor.In addition, it tightens and clarifies what was built upon in part 1, and acts as far more of a true &quot;sequel&quot; than Silent Hill 2. Along with this comes one caveat, however: To get the most out of Silent Hill 3, it's absolutely critical that you've played (and finished) the first game. Silent Hill 1 is the groundwork for Silent Hill 3, and if you try to tackle part 3 without part 1, several scenes will leave you scratching your head.On the other hand, vets of the first game will be in fan heaven (or hell, I guess) as not only are the events from the first game directly addressed and concluded, but there are numerous clarifications, expansions, and further explanations on some of the more shady and surreal aspects from Silent Hill 1. Ever wonder why the cult from Silent Hill 1 had odd Christian overtones (the church, the &quot;bible&quot;) but obviously had nothing to do with real Christianity? How about the real purpose of the purple goop found from the first game? Just what did &quot;White Claudia&quot; really mean, and what was up with the ending, anyway? All these and a few more questions are finally answered, and coherently at that.As for the more technical aspects of the game, it's obvious Konami put tons of effort into this title, and it shows. Graphics are, hands down, the best on the PS2 so far. These are comparable to some of the best Xbox graphics, and the Konami development team has pushed the PS2 into doing things you would have sworn were impossible. Lighting is fantastic, detail is immaculate, and the framerate is a rock-solid 60 fps. The sound, as well, is tip-top, with the series' trademark guitar track theme song mixed with some truly hellish ambience and sound effects. In a game where atmosphere is everything, Konami nailed it. Again.Now we get to the real question: Is it scary?Short answer. YES. Very.Most importantly, the &quot;dark world&quot; from Silent Hill 1 makes a much (un)welcome return. We only caught glimpses of this macabre hell in Silent Hill 2, but with the third game, the plane of terror makes it's next-gen debut in stomach churning style, and it's every bit as god-awful as you could have hoped for. Walls bleed. Screaming abounds. Grotesque monsters stalk you. The very atmosphere kills, sometimes literally (be careful of the bloody mirror in the hospital, kids. It's mesmerizing to watch, but for God's sake, RUN!). In short, it's perfect.Tack onto this a boat-load of extras (including, happily, the requisite &quot;joke ending&quot; for those tenacious enough to play through the game a few times) and you've got a keeper. Fans will have this DVD spinning in the PS2 for quite some time, and they'll love every sick minute of it.There's one important thing to note with this game. I said it in my Silent Hill 2 review, and I'll say it here; the game is only as scary as you allow it to be. For the full effect, play this game ALONE, with the lights OUT and the sound up very LOUD. If you're actually unwilling to go into the next room for fear of whatever awaits there, then the settings are right where they should be and you're enjoying the game the way it's meant to be experienced. Needless to say, this isn't for the faint of heart (or stomach.) The game is both viscerally and psychologically disturbing, and is absolutely not for everyone.It's been argued in more than one review that, while the game is certainly compelling, it can't really be described as &quot;fun&quot; because it's such a task to even force yourself to proceed. I guess this can apply to certain people, but by this point Silent Hill should be a name common enough that anyone who buys the product has a good idea of what they're in for. If you've never heard of the game but want to see what it's all about, I'd suggest picking up Silent Hill 1 first. If you make it through that game and liked it, then Silent Hill 3 is right up your alley and then some, with Silent Hill 2 in between to give you a fresh, deeper perspective on the genre.For fans, however, this is it, folks. We can't ask for much better.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00149PCAO","description":"In a city where information is heavily monitored, agile couriers called Runners transport sensitive data away from prying eyes.  In this seemingly utopian paradise, a crime has been committed and now you are being hunted. You are a Runner called Faith - and this innovative first-person action-adventure is your story.    Mirror&#x2019;s Edge delivers you straight into the shoes of this unique heroine as she traverses the vertigo-inducing cityscape, engaging in intense combat and fast paced chases. With a never before seen sense of movement and perspective, you will be drawn into Faith&#x2019;s world. A world that is visceral, immediate, and very dangerous. Live or die? Soar or plummet? One thing is certain, in this city, you will learn how to run.","reviewerName":"Strategos \"The Guardian of Time\"","summary":"Run Faith Run","reviewText":"Mirror's Edge is unlike any game you've ever played. Except maybe Portal. While Portal features a gun that allows you to create Portals and walk, run, jump, or fall into and out of them, and Mirror's Edge features a super-human parkour runner who can run across walls, fall through glass ceilings, and get shot, and keep on running faster than any human being alive, they share a common gameplay style.The story has been much criticized, but it was never important to begin with. In a 1984ish dystopian future, the fight against the establishment is aided by runners who carry messages across the city parkour-style. You play the runner Faith, who during a routine job finds herself being shot at, and shortly thereafter finds herself running from place to place through the city chased by the police in an attempt to clear her murder-suspect sister's name.The cinemas are Heavenly Sword/Flash Animation style cut-scenes that you'll either dig or not, but the main game features incredibly realistic yet incredibly austere depictions of an empty metropolis you get to traverse in the course of the game. The sense of speed, and the uncanny realism of BEING inside of a character as she runs, rolls, climbs, and leaps through this gameworld is unparalleled. She gasps for breath, huffs and swings her arms faster as she gains momentum, and makes wince-inducing sounds every time you hit the ground too hard or take a hit.Where you run into the love/hate relationship of this game is the puzzle/chase aspect of the game which is the actual gameplay. Just as some people undoubtedly hated the game Portal because of the incredibly frustrating precision timing needed to get past certain areas (which resulted in replaying entire sections over and over again or not being able to figure out how to escape from a room for hours), this game similarly has chase sequences where you will die. And die. And die again. Simply because you don't know where to go or what to do, and the Blues are right behind with bullets flying. And it's not just the thrilling action sequences which can drive you to the edge. The puzzle filled empty rooms once again recall the irritation you may have felt with Portal. Just as a misstep in that game put you neck deep in acid, a misstep in this game often sends you plummeting toward the ground to end in a sickening crunch.What saves this frustration from making the game worthless is the fact that surviving action sequences is often a matter of keeping your momentum going, and not fighting anyone unless absolutely necessary. Getting past rooms is often a matter of following the bright red signposts, pressing the B button to see where to go next, and remembering what you are capable of. Like Prince of Persia: The Sand of Time, in an empty room you will often wonder just how the heck you are supposed to get where you need to go, only to get the sinking feeling that you know exactly how but it ought to be impossible (run across the wall, spin 180 degrees, and leap across the room to grab a thin pipe, all in a smooth singular motion, run across a wall and then leap out into space). The thrill you get from accomplishing these superhuman puzzle feats and chasing or fleeing enemies successfully is outstanding (and I still want to yell every time in Portal and in this game when I leap through the air).There are a few missteps in the game's design that think should have been changed. While they are somewhat enjoyable, the puzzle sections are a bit long and distract from the game's momentum. And while the game is very beautiful, the curious lack of people except for yourself and the Blues seems oddly out of place (again, just like Portals, you get a very lonely feeling from extended play), like this would have been the ultimate chase-action game if only the streets and building were full of people to run around, dodge, and perhaps even catch or vault over. Those would be my suggestions should a sequel ever be made.In the end, this game has loads of replay value, but only if you are the sort of person who enjoys not just playing a game, but playing it well. If you've played through Ikaruga in search of higher score multipliers, if you played Space Channel 5 trying to get the whole crowd to follow you, and especially if you played Portals trying to accomplish puzzles in the fewest moves and record times, you will enjoy this game. This is the sort of game that is frustrating to bumble through, but very satisfying to flying through. You may find yourself after a play-through turning up the difficulty, turning off the targeting reticule, and going for record time. It's that kind of game. Not for the faint of heart, but definitely an enjoyable thrill-ride of a puzzler for those who enjoy unique games off the beaten path. Those who love first-person shooters should stay clear. Oh, and I would recommend playing the console version instead of the PC version, because the lag in Portal on the PC made me very motion-sick, but not so on the Xbox 360 version (console games sacrifice graphics for frame-rate consistency and PC titles the opposite). For what it's worth I find this game thrilling, if a bit frustrating (but not enough to make me dislike it). But then again, I was raised on a game that resulted in dying over and over and over for slight jumping mistakes and simply TOUCHING enemies (and I loved it). You may remember it: Super Mario Bros.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2009"}

More frustrating than fun, it's a game that pretends to hold your hand through the first 5 hours of the game, shuttling you down a corridor without a lot of freedom to explore.  Yet in spite of this, there are things the game stubbornly refuses to tell you how to do, such as how to complete certain quests (one of the NPCs in the game suggests that I just keep doing what I've been doing in over to complete it.)  In another example, I had to go on-line to find out how to access the Armory in the main character's homestead, as nothing in the gameplay or in game manual told me where it was.  Many of the quests involve running around trying not to get shot, or running around on a horse giving orders and trying not to get shot.  Want to go for a walk in the wilderness?  Get ready to deal with annoying Quicktime events!  You see, you can't go anywhere without getting attacked by some random bit of wildlife and when you get attacked you have to mash certain buttons as they appear on screen.  It's not fun.  I hate QTE's, they're a gaming fad that should have gone away by now and at the very least you should have been able to turn it off in the options.They've also taken away some of the gameplay freedom you had in the previous games.  The first Assassin's Creed, for all its flaws, at least gave you the freedom to interact with the NPCs how you wanted.  It was fun, in a GTA sort of way, to push an NPC into a market stall or start a fight with one and watch the chaos that created.  Unbelievably, you can't do that in AC3.  So in short, there's a lot of stuff to do in the game, but not all of it is fun.  And as other readers have pointed out, the game is a buggy mess.I'd give this game away to a friend just to get it out of my house and never see it again, but I really don't hate anyone that much.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2012"}

The screen is larger and brighter than the previous DSi system which makes games easier and more fun to play. The larger stylus is one of the best new features of the DSi XL. I am now able to play games that I could not previously play on other systems because of the larger stylus. I owned The Legend of Zelda: The Phantom Hourglass when it originally game out a few years ago. The game is soley controlled with the stylus. I could not get the hang of playing the game with the tiny stylus. I decided to try the game again with the larger, brighter screen DSi XL complete with larger stylus. I was able to quickly adjust to the stylus control with the larger stylus. It feels natural to control the game this way. The DSi XL is larger but is light enough to hold/play in one hand. It's a very nice looking system. It looks sleek. The DSi XL comes packed with free software like an internet browser, brain age games and flip note studio. Flip note studio is a program that allows you to design your own mini cartoons/graphics. It's a neat little piece of software. You can download games on the DSi XL using wii points or a credit card. The DSi XL supports flash memory cards. It also supports headphones. This is a great system for any Nintendo fan. The price has dropped $20 bucks since I bought it. It's a steal! Just an FYI though.. There is a new Nintendo DS system coming out sometime next year with 3D graphics. It will support all DS games so you might not want to buy this system if you plan on purchasing The 3DS.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2010"}

It definitely feels like a game from the early days of the PS2.  The game play is very \"retro\".  To give you an example, you spend a lot of the time picking up precursor orbs, which are more or less the golden rings in Sonic or the golden coins in Super Mario.  You have to collect many, many, many of these to get power cells which then let you go to other parts of the map.The attacks are rather simplistic and you don't have a wide variety.  That's not to say gameplay is not fun, but it relies a little too much on taking only a couple of hits or doing a speed run on a vehicle perfectly for my tastes.  A lot of time is spent memorizing obstacles, dying, starting up again, then getting further, dying, restarting, and finally succeeding.  I really enjoyed it, but I've liked more recent PS2 titles more.  The game's cheap now and if you're going to play the other Jak games you probably want to play this one just to see the start of the story.  Decent game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2011"}

You cannot use the stick to aim shots while in the close up view.  You must tilt the actual 3DS to aim shots.  With the 3D turned on, this is a nightmare.  And it's not very accurate.  Plus, the game auto runs your player.  Letdown...  You have to use the overhead view for the ability to fully control your player as well as aim your shots.Two.  All the neat swag you unlock can only be used by your 'Mii' character.  So you can't change out equipment on the Mario Bros characters.  This makes it kind of pointless to unlock and buy equipment if you are someone like me that enjoys walloping people with Boo or Diddy Kong.  The developers could have had each of the Mario characters come with their standard equipment already and then have the ability to change the standard equipment out.  Like Mario Kart 7.  Alas...Another interesting and wonky thing is that you can't set a stable camera angle even in the 3/4 perspective.  The camera rocks and tilts and moves sporadically, creating a headache of a view angle.  Plus, the 3D is not really very good in this game, so you don't really get the effect of the shots in proper 3D.  I actually turned the 3D down after several hours.The gameplay is not true tennis by any stretch.  You basically make contact with the ball in any fashion and the game compensates.  The only time it doesn't is when you are late in hitting and the ball hits your player instead.  The trick to winning is to use shots that are effective against the shots your opponent hits.  Standing in the colored 'special' circles gives that effect to your shot.  For example, if the blue squid lights up in the circle, run to the circle and power up a shot.  The shot then gives a huge arcing shot that is more difficult for the opponent to hit.  Fire flowers, stars, mushrooms, and bob-ombs all give different effects.The best and most interesting part of this game is the ability to 'play' the original Super Mario Brothers by hitting the screen with tennis balls.  It's weird and strangely addictive.  Plus, it gets tough.  Especially at first when you are looking at the screen you're attacking and not really controlling your player that well.  I found that most of the time when I lost was when I was trying to do something and completely forgot to hit the ball with my player.Multiplayer is good, but with the style of gameplay it can be frustrating.  It is a setup that makes it so that even newbies can play effectively against veterans.  As long as they keep hitting X (regular shots), and getting into the special circles, they can present a challenge.  I also found that it is stupidly easy to get back into position for tricky shots.  For example, if I hit a long shot and then drop a slice over the net on my next shot, the opponent usually gets up to catch the shot  despite being miserably far back in the court.It's a decent game and it's fun.  But there are quite a few tweaks the developers could have made to improve it.  More camera angle options would have been a good start.  Then the ability to change Mario Bros character gear.  And perhaps improved the scale of the players to the courts making it a bit tougher to reach out of place shots.  It's a game with training wheels (at least in tournaments and matches - not as easy on the option when you play SMB1), it seems aimed at a younger crowd.  And usually I dig games even if they are aimed at younger audiences, but this is one that I think could have been a lot better with more options and settings.  Perhaps we can get a Mario Golf game soon with some more depth.  In the meantime I will be playing Mario Kart 7.Of note:  I've heard this is mostly material from Mario Tennis 64.  I will be checking into this, I never actually played it on my N64, but judging by the screen shots, it looks very similar with the exception of some characters and the SMB1 mini game.  Perhaps one could download it on an emulator to see if that is the case...Also of note: received 6.5 / 10 by IGN and has very mixed reviews from most critics.  I didn't discover this until after I played it and penned this review.  Gladly I checked this out from my local library rather than shelling out $40.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2012"}

But at 40 or so defintely.Games like this that aren't huge, blockbuster affairs but tell a more focused and personal story to me can almost be better than the world saving epics that dominate the charts.

But games like Spec Ops I played all the way through until I beat it.Almost every game nowadays has a tacked on multiplayer element for whatever reason. Thsi has one but no one plays it. It's pointless. Why even include it and just sell the game for a less expensive price? I would be willing to take a gamble on a 30 or 40 dollar game than one at 65. It would sell more copies and games like this could get made.There's plenty of other reviews about the story and gameplay. The gameplay is pretty stock stuff, it's fun and responsive. Shootouts are basically the same each level, kill some dudes in this way and move on, blow some guy up with this gun and move on, etc. The story and imagery is really where this game excels. Graphics are gorgeous for the most part and the art direction and visual imagery are awesome. That's why I originally picked this up because of the awesome views of the city of dubai covered in sand.Overall at 30 or so bucks this is a good game.

I have found myself lost more often then not thoughthe quest markers return and again some are vague but that's a minor issuein such a well made game. the colors are far more vibrant as is the world.the new enemies will kill you, often so don't dispair just battle through it and slowly you'll notice your power growing as your level increases (though you donot get a skill point until lvl 5 ugh)another new feature is Badass tokens earned by completing challenges throughout the game like kill x number of bandits. once done you get a token that allowsone minor power up in a variety of abilities. class mods also return alongwith artifacts and alien weapons.the combat this time around is far smoother and your skills allow you to improvejust about anything that might annoy you about your character.don't like how much recoil your weapons have, toss a few points into recoil reduction! they seemed to have thought of everything.finally across the land like last time there are domes though they differ this timein that they all specialize such as the Robot Slaughter dome the Creature Slaughter Dome etc. (creature slaughter dome while a pre order exclusive will be available soon for 9.99)Gameplay: 5 stars! every gripe I had in the first game is fixed and made better.Sound: 5 stars, Fantastic Voice acting bring characters to life, guns sound great.Controls: almost exactly the same but made more friendly 5 Stars!Graphics: 5 Stars vivid and bright colors and color usage in all the right places!Overall: a stunning game whether you played the first or not this is a must own for FPS and RPG fans alike. the game is simply so much fun 6 hours had passed while I was playing and I barely noticed. the world is so Huge this time I feel I have barely scratched the surface. I am loot hunting like most of the rest of you and hope to update this review a bit down the road. overall this is one of the few Must Own titles of this year. headsets work great this time around as does matchmakingco-op is flawless though it's still a loot grab-a-thon since it's fair game if it's in a chest or on the ground, while some may be bothered by this I say to you give it a chance it's just amazing. the vehicles now include a 4 man vehicle so no one get's left behind this time. (smaller cars are available too) and the new customization features while rather limited by rpg standards are a welcome addition here. some look really good others are wicked. it's a Five Star Game. buy it today!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2012"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed.

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"LOVE THE LORD \"W.Y.

{"product_name":"B0050SYDEQ","description":"","reviewerName":"J.S. Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"Another Title Worthy of the Name \"Forza\"","reviewText":"I've enjoyed every Forza Title released on the Xbox 360.  With every iteration, Turn 10 seems more and more determined to make more than just a racing game.With Forza 2 it was online content.  With Forza 3, enhanced livery abilities and player accessibility.  With Forza 4 it was autovista, storefronts, and clubs...And now, Forza Horizon.  For the first time ever, we - the Forza Diehard - can take our customized cars with their robust upgrades and tear through a city, along a mountain, or through a residential subdivision.  And we can still do it with online integration, visual liveries, and player-driven car clubs that have made Forza what it is today.Forza Horizon is not the racing simulator that Forza is known 4.  We've been told all along that it would have \"some\" Forza physics, but not all.  We cannot adjust our spring rates or ride height, we can't adjust our gear ratios or tire pressures.  But we can hop into any car we want and quite literally drive it like we stole it.Forza Horizon takes place in a virtual interpretation of Colorado.  Unlike other open-world racing games, the setting is more rural - towns are rare and when encountered, only feature a small handful of city-like \"blocks\".  Roads are VERY wide, and intersections are  open and relatively uncluttered.  Corners can often be taken much tighter than expected.  This is good and bad, as it makes the game a bit less technically challenging, and it takes a few tries on a track before one becomes comfortable with just how close they can cut their corners.The storyline of Horizon is pretty straightforward, and definitely drives home the idea that you're out here TO race.  You are a new participant in the annual Horizon festival, which might not seem unlike the \"Race Wars\" of the original Fast & Furious movie.  Loud music, younger people everywhere, tricked-out cars, lights and fireworks, etc.  You compete in events to earn points, points unlock \"wristbands\" which in turn unlock harder events.  As with pretty much any racing game, you'll start off with \"entry level cars\" - Volkswagons, Mitsubishis, Hondas - and before too long will be driving Bugattis, Lamborghinis, and the star of this title, the 2013 SRT Viper.There are things both to love and to miss in Forza Horizon.  Don't expect any cop chases - police are surprisingly missing from the environment.  You can get some significant visual damage, but visual is as far as the damage goes.  As mentioned already you won't have technically challenging races through crowded city environments.  That isn't to say the terrain itself isn't challenging, as one can often find themselves airborn by getting a bit too relaxed on dirt roads and shoulders.  You also won't get to fast-travel to any location as with Test Drive Unlimited or Need For Speed.  You can fast-travel to the main hub of the Horizon event - where you can manage your club, buy & customize cars, etc.  You can also travel - for a cost - to \"outpost\" locatios of the Horizon event scattered around the map.  Performing PR stunts at these hubs will eventually reduce the fast-travel cost to nothing.  These hubs allow you to change cars and purchase performance upgrades.  Purchasing cars and painting is reserved for the main hub.  It would have been nice to find more things to do at these outposts - even point-to-point races to other outposts would have been nice.  They quickly serve as nothing more than a fast-travel spot, though you'll be inclined to get the PR stunts done quickly as the base cost for travel is 10,000 credits.There is more to do in Forza besides just racing however, and these other events can certainly keep you busy.  You might enjoy hunting down signs for the local upgrade garage - smash all 100 of them to receive a 100% discount on parts.  You might enjoy setting off speed traps and speed \"zones\" - measuring average speed across a section of road - and setting hard-to-beat times for your friends to compete against.  You also might enjoy chasing down NPC-drivers and challenging them in point-to-point races for extra money.Or you might enjoy Forza for it's multiplayer content.  New in Forza Horizon are \"rooms\" where you can pick your degree of difficulty before entering.  Beginner rooms use default assists and stock vehicles, while harder rooms allow cars with no upgrades and no driving aids.  Drivers \"level up\" by completing events (even if they don't place first), and earn cars or cash with each level via roulette.  It would have been nice to see other online drivers zipping around Colorado with you, though - let's face it - many other games have attempted this and failed miserably.  Your friends are still with you in spirit however in the single-player story in the form of \"Rivals\" - you'll be given the option to repeat events you've run in order to beat the times of your friends for extra cash.  This can be where the challenge of Horizon really ramps up - suddenly that \"lucky corner\" that netted you the advancement of a few positions becomes all up to you.Forza Horizon certainly deserves merit.  This isn't just another arcade title of repetitive races - all more or less the same - that quickly collects dust in your collection.  It may not survive the 2-year life expectancy of previous Forza titles, but Turn 10 - working closely with Playground Games - has sprinkled their love of the racing genre and their constant ingenuity into an otherwise stale environment.  It could be more, for sure, but we've seen far, far less.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2012"}

Though most folks may disagree, I believe this game surpasses its spiritual predecessor, Super Mario 64. I understand the nostalgia behind the classic Mario games, but when those games came out, no one was longing for the Atari and Pong days.It's time for the next generation to take its place in the timeline. Galaxy is a revolution in platform type games, and NOT an evolution. Ratchet and Clank 2 & 3 are fantastic platform/shooters that probably innovated the \"limited horizon mini-planet\" game-play in a few of their levels. However, Galaxy takes it to the next \"galaxy\" with some of the most physics intensive and innovative levels ever witnessed in a video game. Said levels are a pure joy and exceedingly fun to experience.The production values of Galaxy are right there with some of the greatest video games of all time-not just Mario games: GTA San Andreas, Ninja Gaiden Black, Half Life 2, Oblivion, God of War 1 & 2, Metal Gear Solid 3, as well as Super Mario 64. In a year that may be the most prominent in video game history with a plethora of quality titles released, I still would not be surprised if Galaxy takes game of the year in many different categories and from a variety of video game establishments.Pros: Unprecedented platform level designs Stellar production values Addictive game-play that is accessible for the novice and hardcore gamers alike. My 5 year old loves this game and so do I. Does not abuse the Wii controller. Control of Mario far surpasses that of Mario 64. We are talking Ninja Gaiden Black tightness here for those of us who know what I am talking about. While not in HD, graphics are still a wonder. The total crispiness is not present like a quality XBOX 360 title running 1080i, but one can only fault Nintendo hardware design decisions and not their software developer on this issue. With that said I have yet to see any frame rate drops. The color explosions are a incredible. Anything viewable on the internet does this game no justice. Certainly, these are the best graphics on the Wii, and far surpass all previous plat-formers - Mario or otherwise - period. Musical score is on par with the great CG movies of our time. It has a top notch Disney film feel to it. Sound effects are spot on with nostalgia galore built in. Very little voice acting is present and although that is criticized, I applaud it for a Mario game. Who knows what cheesy Japanese voice acting we would have had to endure. Some things are best left unsaid. What sets this game apart from most others and puts it in the realms of the greats I listed above is that magical other-worldly feel you get when you dive into it. It's the same feeling you get when you played Mario 64, the Zelda games, and even GTA San Andreas. The simple Co-op functionality has been criticized, but it is good enough for the parent who wants to assist their young child get through some challenging areas of a level (or vice-versa!!)Cons:None that I have yet experiencedSome will criticize the \"old hat\" story premise. However, this is a platform Mario game. You don't engage yourself in this type of game for the story.Bottom line: If you own a Wii, this is THE must-have title. Not that Nintendo has trouble selling Wiis, but if this is the game you have been waiting for to justify the purchase of a Wii, then now is the time to buy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2007"}

The beauty of 8-bit is the simple elegance of the character sprites. A good test is to go play Resident Evil 1 on the Playstation and compare the graphics to Mega Man one. RE looks ugly while MM looks clean and crisp, yet simple.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00004U55E","description":"It's been nearly 10 years sinceWolfenstein 3Dforever  popularized the first-person shooter, and at long last everyone's favorite Nazi  killer, B.J. Blazkowicz, is back inReturn to Castle Wolfenstein. Set  during World War II,Return to Castle Wolfensteinfinds the Nazis  dabbling in the black arts in an effort to create an army of supersoldiers.  Naturally, Blazkowicz is the only thing standing in the Nazis' way, so he's set  behind enemy lines in an effort to end the madness.On the surface, the single-player game seems like pure gold--after all, everyone  loves killing Nazis. But the story jumps all over the place, the enemy AI is  less than impressive, and most gamers will be able to finish the game in a mere  10 to 15 hours. The single-player game falls short of the standards set by  titles such asHalf-LifeandNo One Lives Forever.In fact, the best thing aboutReturn to Castle Wolfensteinis its  team-based multiplayer mode. Each multiplayer adventure features Axis vs. Allies, and  both sides offer four character classes: engineer (removes obstacles), medic  (heals and revives teammates), lieutenant (calls in air strikes and replenishes  ammo), and soldier (only class able to use sniper rifles, flamethrowers, and  other unusual weapons). The game includes only eight multiplayer maps, but they  are all perfectly designed, and in order to be successful teams have to work  together. The result is a great gaming experience that fans ofCounter-Strikeor the Day of Defeat mode forHalf-Lifewill really  appreciate.Graphically,Return to Castle Wolfensteinlooks amazing. It uses the  powerfulQuake IIIengine to great effect, and the character models,  explosions, and lighting effects are all perfectly done. Alas, pretty graphics  and a great multiplayer game don't quite make up for an exceptionally average  single-player experience.--William HarmsPros:Amazing graphicsGreat level design (including secret passages)Awesome multiplayer modeCons:Lackluster AISingle-player game is very short","reviewerName":"J.

{"product_name":"B000O5DS32","description":"Prepare to experience an evolution in the first person shooter. Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"takethekman","summary":"A Decent Game 6 Years Ago","reviewText":"I really wanted to like this game....To me this game wasn't fun at all. The movements are slow and awkward; There are times when you are being attacked and you can't even tell where it's coming from, mostly due to clumsy, plodding controls that don't allow you to react as quickly as you would like. The graphics to me were far from 'next gen'; While very creative in theory, the graphics are often muddy and not very well defined(esp. when compared to a game like 'Drake's Fortune' or even 'Far Cry', which both had great jungle look to them...).  The creatures are cool, but you are often outnumbered...and with the sub par controls, you're usually dead meat. I have been playing FPS's for a long time, and while I'm not the best, I'm def not a novice. I know when I died because of my idiocy and when I died because of a control issue. This doesn't even control as well as games from 4 or 5 years ago, like 'DOOM 3', 'Return to Castle Wolfenstein; Tides of War', and 'Killzone'. I guess I just found this really boring and not up to snuff. I didn't really care about the story, and the action was more annoying than fun. I don't understand why this game wasn't made into the game it could have been. Hard to believe no one spoke up and said 'Hey, this isn't good enough...'. Or maybe they did, and were promptly fired.

There is lots to do and collect.  It is fairly immersive. The key here is if you have the time.  I ended up logging nearly 60 hours on this one, which took a long time playing casually over time.  I did play all the side quests and exploring though.The main story missions are a lot better than the side missions.  The side missions and planets to explore are generic, uninspired, and repeat, but yet I still had fun exploring all of them.  You see the same base or ship configuration over and over when exploring.The game is pretty easy on the default setting once you level up a little bit and get upgraded weapons.  I found it very difficult early on to pass the first major set of enemies I ran into at the end of the first planet I landed on, but afterwards was a near cake-walk on the shooter aspects because I kept leveling up and getting better armor, weapons, upgrades, etc.  You collect loot from enemies you kill and can sell it and buy more.  But there is little need to purchase because you find enough better weapons anyway and just use them.  It is a little annoying to trek back to a shop keeper that likes you that you can sell for a higher price.  In the end I ended up maxing out my money since I rarely spent anything in the game.It is a little tedious to wait in elevators, watch the docking and undocking animations over and over, etc.  I wish I could jump more directly onto the ship and off rather than docking, embarking/decontamination, elevator, then taking a fast transport to where you want to go.The game adapts a bit to your choices, so there is more replay value to play again with different choices.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2009"}

Foliage is more realistic - again, it's a combination of lighting and overall detail - and you do spend a lot of time in and around foliage - from hunting, to sneaking...Ironically, the same improvement in graphic detail and lighting can make some things look markedly worse - in certain scenes peoples faces, hay stacks, and a few other things are more cartoon like and IMHO, looked better without the added detail...---Storyline---I thought there was no way I was going to enjoy being a pirate...or sailing a ship around 'the world'...especially when sailing a ship was fairly arduous in AC3...but in AC4, it is absolutely a blast - as one reviewer wrote - 'this maybe the best pirate game ever produced!' - and I have to agree...it was just flat out fun taking the crew around the world, fighting with other ships...boarding them, and adding them to my fleet...IMHO, If you're going through the effort to take on a ship and win, you might as well 'add them to your fleet' - this way, you can either upgrade your fleet (same ship more speed, more firepower), or scuttle them...at least at that point, you'll get the choice...vs immediatly scuttling or repairing your ship...it's pretty cheap just to repair your ship at many fast travel points, should you need to...The modern day part is an interesting departure from past AC's...overall, I liked the idea of it and what it offers to the AC story...and I'll just leave it at that...(no spoilers here!)...---Looting---As with other AC games, there's bounty to be had...you'll have chests on land and out to sea, in addition to warehouses to loot...As with anything else in this 'world' you can get this loot in and out of the main story line...chests can be looted once, but warehouses can be looted more than once...check your map...if you find a warehouse that 'is full', just fast travel to that town and loot it...to me these are really fun missions...you have to take a key off someone, and loot the warehouse without the bell being sounded - conversely, you can just incapacitate everyone on the plantation and loot the warehouse - personally, I like looting the warehouses undetected...Also, there are treasure maps to be found...and chests to be looted once you get the maps...and the game did a great job of letting you know, if you were in a location that was on a treasure map (if you have discovered the map)....---Diving---Underwater diving, via a bell - this was cool. The underwater graphics were amazing! Tho, I found the swimming ability to be a bit waning...which really came into play when the sharks were around...but still a cool addition...---Hunting---As in previous AC's, you're going to be doing some hunting...on land and on the sea. I found the harpooning side of the hunt to be fun (your going to want to upgrade your harpoons, harpoon storage, and rowboat)...again, the graphics are great, game play is smooth, and it's well thought out...and at least the authors saved the turtles...not the monkeys tho (they're just eating berries minding they're own business..why kill them?...just saying...lol...)---Synchronizing---Climbing to sync points was really, really smooth in AC4...(and they fixed that 'glitch' in AC3s towers where you'd climb all the way to the top only to find out you're on the wrong side of the tower to be able to pull yourself up and sync....nice!)---Sweet Moves---One of my favorite moves in AC3 was the horse assassination - jumping from a galloping horse, right into an assassination...in AC4, they've given you a similar move...while boarding a ship, you can swing on a rope from your ship and go right into an assassination on the other ship...sweet!---Summary---I had a blast playing AC4, and IMHO, it is a must buy for anyone who owns an X1...gameplay is really smooth, storyline is well thought out, and the graphics are great!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00005ME6O","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"The best survival horror game is back for an encore.","reviewText":"\"Silent Hill 2\" is what survival horror should be, where players must use their minds rather than reflexes. In much the same style as the original \"Silent Hill\", much of your time is spent searching, solving puzzles, and fetching particular items. The action is toned down when compared to \"Resident Evil\", and it is just as well.The centerpiece of the game is the story. You are James, who has just recieved a lettr from his wife saying that she will meet him in the resort town of Silent Hill. The odd thing is that she has been dead for three years. That is just the beginning of what will become a very strange and nightmareish journey. Gunplay is exchanged for problem solving, which gives gamers a much needed challenge.The first \"Silent Hill\" was fantastic, and the sequel makes no exceptions. The graphics are amazing, with the trademark use of fog adding to the surreal and frightening atmosphere. The sound is also to die for, obviously much time was spent tweaking the music so it matches each scene perfectly. The biggest improvement, however, is the control. If there was one flaw with the first game, it is the impossible controls, which made combat clunky and frustrating. It is much better here.Although the fights themselves are not too difficult, the puzzles are. I have gotten stuck more than a few times, and had to retread in areas to look for things I missed. This can be a bit frustrating, but I always found my way out. Players who rush through games hoping for the cool moments won't last long. In \"Silent Hill 2\", you need to be on your toes, and missing a detail can mean hours of scratching your head, wondering how to proceed.Like the first game, SH2 can be beaten in a week. But there are multiple endings, and multiple outcomes to different situations. These are determined by your actions during the game, and you will find yourself playing a few times over in an attempt to see what new things your can find. Games with replay value are the best kind, in my opinion.Even though the \"Silent Hill\" series is only in it's second installment, it already has the potential to be a big one, like the \"Resident Evil\" series. I only hope that future installments are as good as this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2002"}

Just stay off screen at the doorway to the room, and they just stay back and do nothing. Just stand there and shoot until dead. Not all are like this, but many are.

For instance pistols pushing the button and holding it allows to aim the pistol to line up your shot, releasing quickly or pressing quickly allows you to fire, or if you release slower you will lower the pistol and not fire. The xbox 360 lacks pressure sensitive buttons.The PS3 version also allows \"transfarring\" (I know its spelled wrong but that's how its spelled) which allows you to use a save file to play on other PS3 systems or use them on your Vita version of the game.And you also get all 3 games on 1 disc vs. the 360 version where you have 2 discs.So that's it, just a few minor reasons as to why I would recommend the PS3 version if you have a PS3.

{"product_name":"B002I0KOSI","description":"","reviewerName":"TheTruthHurts","summary":"Wholly unintelligible pseudointellectual pseudoprofundity that makes zero emotional connection...","reviewText":"5.5/10I'm reviewing the game as I go, so bear with me...Edit 1 (beginning of hour five): Quite frankly, I'm finding the experience emotionally unengaging, and somewhat tedious, into the fifth hour of the game...and I simply don't like Elizabeth. The animation of her character is indeed groundbreaking (facial expressions, etc.), but despite being visually appealing, and very much wanting to connect and identify with her plight, I simply can't stand the obnoxious, valley girl-esque voice and personality they gave her (\"she's supposed to be like that\"...a). I doubt it...I understand that she's meant to have been \"headstrong\" and self-determined, but the arrogance, ego, nasally-restricted intonation, and elongated \"S\"'s are way over the top and completely unwarranted, and b). I don't think I can handle another five hours with her next to me, regardless of whether or not this character ended up as intended). (For reference, I'd consider Alice to have been perfectly acted, and perfectly sympathetic, in AMR [both are lead characters that we need to care about in order for the game to connect...this is a big part of what made AMR the best game of 2011].)It's a real shame, because if you can't connect and/or sympathize with this supposedly \"charming\" character (or worse, you find yourself praying for her spectacularly gory demise), then this game leaves little else but mediocre combat and a moderately, but not overwhelmingly (in contrast with the first game), interesting environment to explore (hour one was great). Additionally, while visually impressive, the game is a bit too cartoonish in appearance...it could almost pass for some sort of bizarre, macabre Disney spectacle...you might disagree, but I remember having that thought at many points throughout the game. :)So far, the game easily pales in comparison to Bioshock (if not the expansion-pack 'sequel' that was Bioshock 2), and as the other guys coming out of the woodwork with honest reviews are stating, I want to love it (especially given Irrational's physical location...I have a great deal of pity for them, on this basis alone), but I don't. It's quite clear that a ton of work went into the game, and I don't regret the purchase, but so far, it's a letdown of significant proportion; (I hate to say) unsurprisingly, the hype wasn't warranted, and unless things improve quickly and substantially, I see very little replay value here (I've played through Bioshock five times, AMR six times, Mirror's Edge over 20 times [lost count long ago], Crysis 2 over ten times, etc., for reference...). Que sera...life goes on...but if things get substantially better in the final hours, I'll surely update my statements.Edit 2 (nearly eight hours in; at this point, the game is a very marginal 7 out of 10): I'm finding nothing about this game remotely engaging...I feel no connection with the environment or the characters, and that's a big problem, in my book...and my distaste for Elizabeth's personality is quickly becoming sheer hatred. :) (I'm still smiling...always smiling...I'm a happy dude, and as massively disappointing as this game is, it won't bring me down.) I'm certainly going to play through it twice, however, before concluding that it's as empty as I believe it is at this point (Edit: no, I am not...one playthrough was more than enough to draw a justified conclusion).  To me, emotional connection with a work of art (in any medium) is a very simple concept, yet seems to be one that critics either don't understand, or simply don't value when reviewing games (despite the fact that it's essentially the only thing that matters). AMR: 6.5-7.0 from every critic on the block. 9.5-10.0, in my book; easily the best game of 2011. Why? I connect with and care about Alice, I care about the story, and I care about the outcome of my actions...and as a result of that connection, I fell in love with the game...I've been playing it non-stop for about a year now (literally...haven't left the abode since last March [just kidding, though I wish it were true]). That isn't the case with Infinite, unless something drastic happens toward the end of the game, and I finally feel something other than boredom and disgust toward Elizabeth's uppity demeanor. I always felt Bioshock was fairly overrated, but appreciated what it tried to do, more than did, for gaming. Compared to Infinite, it's in a different league altogether. If this game is truly seen as moving video games toward film, as a medium, then I feel sorry for the future of video gaming...because if this were a movie, I would have turned it off after twenty minutes (as I typically do when I realize that said movie has no discernible plot and isn't going to engage me emotionally). I really hate to make these comments, but the game feels like a chore.Final Edit (the game has finally ended, praise Comstock): in sum, this game was simply agonizingly repetitive, mundane, and as tedious as could be imagined. Make no mistake: the first hour was solid, and exploring Columbia was initially nearly as exciting as exploring Rapture...but persevering until the end was akin to torture, and I'm actually surprised that I had the tenacity to keep going (I'd considered simply watching the ending on YouTube, since I'd been told that it's simply mind-blowing, and sparing myself the agony of endless hours more gameplay that were going to be the precise opposite of \"fun\"). When I did get to the end, I finally understood why the game has been praised by so many here...it's pure pseudo-intellectual fodder on the level of \"Inception,\" the tripe that was earlier heralded as \"genius\" by critics who were predominantly too stupid to independently determine that the film made no sense and was the precise opposite of intelligent (everyone else says it's brilliance wrapped up in a neat little package...so I guess I have to too). To be clear, the plot of this game made little sense (I've seen and read the \"explanations,\" and they don't help to make the game any less convoluted or silly than it is...they simply work to prove that whoever wrote the \"multiverse\" angle of this thing has seen far too much low-rent sci-fi), multiple realities are a cop-out (designed to trick the average viewer into thinking that they've just witnessed profundity), Booker's role in the game became utterly ludicrous, and ultimately, it was a massive waste of ten hours that I simply can't get back; frankly, I'd rather be waterboarded than play this game a second time...and since there's no new game plus mode, it won't be happening. Given that I bought it on day one, I must have been expecting something on the level of Bioshock...not an utterly derivative dung heap that ranks below some of the worst fps titles of the generation (and believe me when I tell you that I've played *all* of them). Bioshock was a great game, despite being overrated to some extent (and nowhere near as deep an experience as the ocean in which Rapture sat)...but if this game is a 5.5/10 (which I'd say is more than equitable), then Bioshock was dang near a true 10/10. Remember Bioshock 2, the expansion pack (\"sequel,\" so we were told)? Remember how we all slandered it (including myself), saying \"we'll wait for the true sequel?\" Well, if Infinite is a 5.5, Bioshock 2 is an 8.0. There...that should provide a clearly quantified figure representing just how low the series has fallen with this \"new' entry.  Oh, I weep for the time and money spent on this dog...but more so for the ten hours of life that I lost playing it (hey, I am an American [which means my priorities are #1]).  On that note, I appreciate the political side of things here...but it's forced, overcooked, and doesn't amount to having stated much about our society or anything else, really...In conclusion, I have this to say: game critics depend on gaming's success to stay employed, and if games like Bioshock Infinite, which are depended upon to generate revenue for the industry, and thus, keep these people employed, aren't good, it won't matter, because employment is more important than integrity these days...and anyone who gave this game anything over a 7 out of 10 is either completely incapable of rational thought, afraid of his/her peers, afraid of becoming broke, and/or so desperate to grab onto the bandwagon and \"fit in\" with the other ignoramuses/blatant liars of the gaming world that they have no place discussing what makes a video game truly worthy of a \"10\" score in the first place. This game is a complete failure on virtually all levels, from the terrible voice acting/characterization of Elizabeth, to the *stunningly* repetitive gameplay, to the complete lack of a story that generates any emotion whatsoever (minus humor, in the end...I literally laughed at how silly the ending was), and if it doesn't turn out to be not only the worst high-profile, \"AAA\" game of the year (I would never have imagined that Crysis 3 would have been usurped), but a top three contender for most overrated game of all time (we have no precedent, here...this is proof that game critics are completely devoid of integrity circa 2013), my gaming days might just be coming to a close (coming from someone who owned NES on release date, and Atari 7800 prior to that).p.s. between Crysis 3 and this game, I will *never* spend $60 on a video game again...unless it's Mirror's Edge 2 or Alice 3 (hey, it could still happen). I had a rule...I've broken it twice in recent months; both times, it's been a near-total loss...*I'd added the below as a comment, then remembered that comments can be removed if enough people say they're \"offensive\" (for any reason they'd like):Because it's inevitable that someone will try to argue that I haven't gone into enough detail as to why the game is terrible (honestly, 5.5/10 makes me question my own integrity, to some extent...I'm fairly certain that it deserves lower than this, but because I refuse to play it again, and may have somehow missed some important detail of the game that made it remotely enjoyable, I'll leave it as-is), here you are (forgive me, but the commentary was long enough):a) terrible plot that is seemingly as intentionally convoluted as possible, unoriginal, uninspired, contrived, and derivative of/clearly attributable (in style, if not content, directly) to recent Hollywood trash (if you'd like to dispute this, add a comment, clearly explaining the story [in your own words, not Wikipedia's or IGN's] and what makes it as compelling as you'd like us to believe)...I contend that even if you're able to explain it effectively, it's still incredibly silly and a cop-out that's ultimately tangential to (and detracts from) the original intent of the game (sociopolitical commentary, as were the other Bioshock games)b) terrible characterization and voice acting of Elizabeth that is as inappropriate and forced as possible, which *prevents* us from caring about her at all (and unfortunately, caring about Elizabeth is the entire backbone of the game)...worse, I simply *couldn't stand her* any longer after about five hours...(the little song she sang almost helped, but no...I still couldn't stand her)c) cartoonish art style that simply doesn't fit within the Bioshock universed) *amazingly* repetitive gameplay that *simply does not vary at all* throughout the game (and the hook/rail system is a total gimmick that adds nothing of substance)...the game becomes nothing short of agonizing by hour seven (you simply pray it's going to end soon...and it just keeps going, and going, and going...then makes you *retrace your footsteps for half an hour*...then keeps going, and going, and...)e) terrible music (forgot that one)f) zero replay value, with no \"new game +\" mode (as far as I can see)g) runs terribly on PC, with frequent stuttering and slowdown on even a highest-end system (a fault of Unreal 3...note to devs: please stop using Unreal 3)h) an initially interesting environment, totally squandered by how repetitive and dull it all becomes (nothing remotely compelling to explore in each subsequent section of the game...it's all the same, beyond the first hour)i) forced \"sociopolitical commentary\" that rings false and doesn't add up to anything substantive...the game ultimately says nothing about anything, except at the most juvenile level possible (\"slavery/segregation: bad\"...ok, thanks). Now, had the game stayed merely an exact-opposite-of-complex sociopolitical commentary, it would have been weak enough...but then it became science fiction akin to something you'd see on SyFy (C-grade or lower entertainment, folks)...j) on that note, everything in the game is forced...everyone involved needs a lesson in \"subtlety\" (we'll attribute this to poor direction, similar to how the Star Wars \"prequels\" are utterly miserable thanks to George Lucas's complete inability to relate to other human beings and to understand what sources emotion)..as a \"work of art,\" as some will claim it is, it's about as effective as tossing paint randomly at an easel. You could call that a \"masterpiece,\" but I call it offal.I think that may be it, for the moment. In short, for any game to be worth playing, it has to have at least a couple of these qualities (and in spades, if only a couple)...here, we have zero, where Bioshock has nearly all (though it was forced, to some extent, as well). See the problem?Wanting something to be worthy of praise does not make it so. Think independently.Another edit: from my AMR review (please read it, if you haven't played the game...you're truly missing out), here are four questions I'd like to ask the folks who are labeling this game a \"masterpiece:\"a). Did you feel as though you \"loved\" the game (and/or character(s)), and did this only intensify as the game progressed?b). Upon the game's conclusion, did you feel hopelessly compelled to begin another quest (thank God for \"new game +\"), in spite of the five or more games you might have downloaded after this one and not played yet?c). While playing the game, were there numerous moments where you simply sat in front of your screen in awe of what you were witnessing (artistically, etc.)? How big was the smile on your face, or how trance-like was your state (how absorbed were you into the moment)?d). How likely are you to emphatically recommend the game to another and tell them how amazing or truly one-of-a-kind it is (regardless of any reason you can vocalize at said time)?Go ahead and post your responses (try to be a little more creative than \"yes yes yes yes\"...show us how exactly how passionate you are about the game, as it will lend itself to your credibility [or lack thereof]) in the comments section (all four questions...not just one or two of your choosing)...if you dare. Be warned...I will respond, if warranted. Note: you probably shouldn't try to answer these questions in defense of this game (you'll probably be laughed out of the room by people who are willing to comment honestly about it). :)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2013"}

Fortunately, with some key personnel back on board, the folks at Crystal Dynamics and Eidos have put together Tomb Raider Legend, a game that's much more true to what made the series actually attractive in the first place.Of course, Lara Croft is back as the well-endowed and athletic protagonist, and this time she's going to delve into a mystery that involves her parents, long lost friends, and plenty of ancient ruins to explore through.Unlike past Tomb Raider games, Legend goes back to its roots with a healthy does of exploration and puzzle-solving. You'll still use your dual pistols, complete with infinite ammo, to take out plenty of bad guys throughout the game, but the killing of various wildlife is pretty much gone. There will be a leopard or an attack dog to kill every once in a while, but mostly you're going to be fighting various commandos that also want whatever Lara's looking for in those ruins.Combat is much more stylish than in the earlier games. Lara can still flip, dive, and roll while shooting, but now she's got even more acrobatic moves. Charge an enemy and slide at them while shooting, and you'll pop them up into the air, ragdoll-physics-style, and keep shooting them. Jump at an enemy and then jump again once your feet reach their face, and Lara will do a graceful, slow motion backflip off of the guy's head while shooting him simultaneously. We've seen this kind of stuff in games before, but the delivery here is very satisfying. And Lara isn't just limited to pistols; she can carry very powerful grenades, and she can carry an extra, limited ammo weapon on her back, like an assault rifle, grenade launcher, or shotgun.Lara's got plenty of moves she can employ even when her guns are safely in their holsters. When it comes to acrobatic moves, Tomb Raider Legend has picked it up habits once again from the Prince of Persia series of games (the Tomb Raider games have borrowed plenty of platforming elements from the original Prince of Persia games from the late '80s and early '90s). Lara moves gracefully as she hops, climbs, flips, and shimmies around. The animations are great, and the situations Lara gets into can get intense. There are a few dramatically scripted sequences, complete with a \"tap this button right now or Lara gets crushed or falls to her death\" element, which will keep you on your toes. Some Tomb Raider purists might scoff at these part-Dragon's Lair, part-Shenmue moments, but I think it's a good way to make sure that players are paying attention to the action at all times, even if it's during a cutscene.Mixed in with the platforming and action elements are some new sequences on a motorcycle. Although Lara can shoot from the bike, you will find quickly that you really have to watch the path in front of you. Every bump against the wall or a rock costs you plenty of health, so watch the road! Well, in this case, watch the dirt path. These sequences are kind of fun but leave something to be desired, especially the very, very short motorcycle sequence in Tokyo.Most of Tomb Raider Legend's difficulty comes from the puzzles that are laid out in many of the ruins. Combat is usually pretty easy since everyone but Lara is a terrible shot, and most of your enemies stand still while you're flying around the room, and the controls are pretty sharp and easy to get used to. That leaves actually figuring out what to do when the game presents a puzzle, and the first major one will test your logic skills right from the start. Sure, Lara has some crazy binoculars that can \"scan\" items like what we saw in Metroid Prime, but the game still doesn't tell you how to solve anything. You'll have to figure them out for yourself.The addition of a grappling hook makes for some interesting gameplay in Legend. You'll need to use it to pull things towards you, smash things open, pull yourself towards something else, or even swing from the ceiling like Indiana Jones on his whip. That last bit only happens in specific spots, though, so you can't just use it to go all Tarzan to escape an area.The Xbox 360 version of the game of course has excellent graphics, but the frame rate can get iffy at certain times. While the developers seem to have tried to make sure that there aren't any major frame rate issues that pop up in mid-jump or during combat, it's a little disconcerting having the game slow down significantly just because you decided to swing the camera around a bit.The locales you'll be visiting in Legend range from the Ghana rainforests to Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Tokyo, and even Peru. The developers have done a great job mixing up the pacing, sending you back into ruins just before you get tired of shimmying around the edge on a Tokyo skyscraper (and vice versa). While Lara's adventure this time around is pretty short, the exploration elements, great visuals that the Xbox 360 can produce, and even the surprisingly interesting story all come together to make a pretty solid game anyway. Those who aren't big on finding hidden bonus items or replaying levels in a \"time attack\" mode might find that the price is too high to pay for six to eight hours of gameplay, but there's plenty here to satisfy both those who like to rent or buy their games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2006"}

It took me quite a while to get into the game.  I was put off by the lack of fighting.  Yeah, there are monsters to fight, but they seem mostly an afterthought to add more challenge to getting sand refills for your dagger.Speaking of your dagger, that is the hook to this game.  Short version, you get tricked into stealing it and unleashing the Sands of Time which destroy everybody except the main villain, and a princess who helps you named Farah.  You get the ability to turn back time briefly.  You might not think how just reversing an event might help in a fight at first, but it is incredibly useful.  Picture just getting hit by a nasty combo from a guard, whoops now you've reversed time and are able to dodge at the beginning of the combo and avoid taking damage.  Nice.Even better though, the time reversing powers are invaluable for the jumping puzzles.  The ultimate problem with games that give you lots of ability to interact with the environment are that some things will inevitably look like you can interact with them, but end up just being part of the scenery.  The classic example might be in a first person shooter where the wooden door you blast with your bazooka just gets some scorch marks but won't break.  Reversing time allows you to try different options without the pain of starting all the way over on a long sequence.  With few exceptions, the game really doesn't make you replay huge chunks of the game out of spite.  It may not always let you save, but it will often do checkpoints on particularly long runs so as long as you don't quit, you don't have to go all the way back to the save point.The puzzles sometimes require some thought, but mostly just require looking around.  There's generally only one thing you can do things.  Things are also fairly automatic once you start them.  For example, once you're walking along a narrow ledge, it's very difficult for you to actually fall to your death.  Much likeGod of War, you can pull yourself back up.  Real annoyance comes late game in the form of birds/bats that will attack you and make you fall, but generally you're safe unless you really jerk the control stick around.  Still, they're mostly very fun and it's really cool to swing around on poles and jump over large chasms.I would rate this game down a bit because there is a game ending bug fairly late in the game.  You meet up with Farah and she's off screen and supposed to activate a switch to raise the platform.  If you revert from that save, you'll yell to her to do it, but she'll not raise the platform.  No platform raise, no possibility of progress.  Keep at least two saves and switch between them!The reason it goes back up to 5 stars is because they had the brilliant idea to add visions to the game.  When you hit a save point, you get a brief vision of what is coming next.  It's not a play through like the shadow training inDisney's Kim Possible: What's the Switch, you get more of a brief jumble of what will happen later.  Often it's just some views of puzzles, but sometimes a view of something important that will happen later in the game.  This simple addition makes figuring out puzzles much less painful.  You don't get handed the answer, but you do get sort of hints.  The visions will save you a lot of frustration at points in the game.  If you get really lost though, you can usually find uploaded videos of the game to help you along.  I'd tend to suggest that for bits where you cannot reverse time near the end.  It can be pretty brutal otherwise.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2010"}

The night vision clicking on, the MW3 logo popping up, and the demo that hooked me on Modern Warfare. That demo inspired me to get this game and I'm glad I did. First off the realism was amazing as I was going through the cargo ship mockup and level, the gunplay is fantastic while providing the feeling of you putting an end to the terrorist plot as one man wreaking machine. I write this review as a single player kind of gamer so I did not play multiplayer that much. I really am bad at it but it is a fantastic thing to play with friends. The campaign was captivating as I was an SAS operative, codenamed 'Soap' one minute, an awesome marine the next. The visuals were stunning and during the marine's campaign, the plot twist had me screaming WTF!?!?! at the top of my voice. From that point on, the campaign picked up intensity and I really got into it. This probably my third favorite FPS franchise behind Halo and Resistance.Pros:+ Realism is unbelievable+ Story is fantastic (except the plot twist of course)+ Fighting was a blast+ Multiplayer is still good for those who still play this particular gameCon:- The Campaign is REALLY short (6 to 8 hours)- Veteran Mode is the biggest challenge out there that I have ever overcome.

They've been porting their award-winning titles to the DS like crazy and it's easy to see why. First off, everyone and their mom (literally) own a DS. It's the best selling console EVER. Secondly, the casual game market for Nintendo's portable is second to none. Lastly, the hardware and setup of the DS makes translating point and click puzzle games from the PC platform a breeze. The problem with Bejeweled Twist is not that it's on the DS or that the game was poorly made or badly ported. The issue is that the \"Twist\" mechanic just isn't as fun as classic Bejeweled.Of course when you get into the subject of game mechanics it's REALLY just opinion. This game WILL work on your DS. This game has TONS of puzzles and options to keep you glued to your favorite portable. This game is flawlessly ported. Based on reviews, some people loved the addition of the Twist. Unfortunately, I was not one of them. I can't, rightfully give the game less than 3 stars because there's really nothing wrong with it. It simply just didn't do it for me. Give me Bejeweled Classic any day!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2010"}

What I mean by that is that it entices you to do mission after mission nonstop until you realize how much time you've invested in a day! So you can get a whole bunch of missions at once and you're free to go about which one you want to do. The fact  that you have to level up is very unique although I can't say it is much different from any other open world games like Far Cry. I hear a lot of comparision between this and Fallout but I've never played it so I can't say for sure. Another OCD factor about this game is the amount of items you can carry is limited. You can upgrade to bigger inventory but they give you soo many variation of guns, shields, grenades, etc. that you really have to figure out what you like best. The game have over 17,000 guns because there is a program to generate different variations so you really have to pick and choose. Overall I like it cause it's addicting but I don't know why. I can understand why some like it and some don't. The graphics are not the best and the developers seemed very lacking on creativity with enemies. The plot is also very dry. You're a vault hunter looking for a vault with little story telling in-between. However, they make this up by incorporating humor into the game. Overall, the gameplay and sidequest will keep you playing and this is a pretty interesting 'weird' game. I like it. If you like good graphics and deep plots, this game is NOT FOR YOU. If you like leveling up and shooting enemies, this game is for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2014"}
{"product_name":"B000085AHJ","description":"In the open-ended space action/adventure gameFreelanceryou play a ne'er-do-well with a lucky streak, one of two survivors of a space disaster. Penniless and shipless, you venture around a space dock until you find a ship and a job. You'll encounter a heady mix of canned missions that follow one main quest, and a million opportunities to make money or aggravate the various factions that co-exist in the universe. Like an online role-playing game, or Bethesda'sMorrowind, you determine who your enemies are and who your friends are by your own actions, and, in another nod to role-playing, you can customize your ship with guns, rockets, and equipment just as you would customize a RPG character with swords, bows, and magic items. Best of all, you can play cooperatively with friends or fight it out with enemies online.The backstory posits a future where various countries, divided by both nationality and, seemingly, race, have boarded massive colony ships and ventured into a wormhole that appeared within reach of our crude space technology. They found themselves in a galaxy far, far away and they got stuck there when the wormhole collapsed. They quickly colonized new home worlds and named everything with familiar locales that make navigation a breeze. In the American sectors you'll feel at home entering the New York system and landing at a spaceport called Manhattan, for example. While contrived, this device is used beautifully and it's far better than having to memorize a bunch of sci-fi names and remembering where they are, perfect for a massive universe such as this one.ThoughFreelanceris set in space, it is technically not a space simulation. The game was designed to be accessible to casual gamers. For example,Freelancermakes you use the mouse for ship control. This is quite a shift for a game genre normally known to require joystick control. But even old-schoolWing CommanderorX-Wingfans may find that the sacrifice of verisimilitude is made up for with gains in agility. The mouse controls your guns, while you use the keyboard to maneuver around the rich universe that developer Digital Anvil has constructed. Much like a first-person shooter, you can dodge and weave while precisely blasting your enemies.Despite the game's age, its graphics are spectacular, as is the sound and voice acting, and in that way, fighting and trading with friends or alone,Freelancerproves worth the wait. Just keep in mind that it is explicitly not a hardcore space simulation, and you'll have to leave your joystick on the shelf.--Andrew S.

I was like the game is older but has great reviews and the screen-shots/videos looked good enough. But I should have listened to my inner voice trying to warn me that there must be a reason that this game never got a expansion or sequel. Even though I got the game at a really low price but after playing it for few days I regret even spending that money. Anyways here is what ails & doesn't ail me;CONS1)Repetitious to the nth degree. You do get to visit different worlds but other than a scenery change the missions are the same over & over. You pretty much fly to a way-point; dog-fight with pirates or attack other ships, maybe destroy a space-station sometime, you can also mine or destroy a derelict ship to get upgrades for your vessel but in the end all these missions are just variations of the basic premise of a space-shooter on rails.2)If you want to be a trader, or pure mine or find some other non-combat way to advance your character that is not really possible. The game is designed in a way that for you to progress beyond star systems you have to complete part of the required story-line as well as have certain threshold of money. That is only possible via doing combat missions of the main plot/side-quests otherwise you will not have enough money or enough progression to move to the next zone. So in all this is at-heart a pure action space rpg.3) They are also 4-5 npc's at best in the game who you will meet all over the galaxy saying almost the same dialogue and handing you over essentially the same missions just worded differently.4) Even though you will be visiting different planets, sectors etc. you really can't travel anywhere other than pre-assigned rooms where the above mentioned npc's gives you newer missions making the game feel confined rather than open-world.PROS1) Graphics of space-ships, stations, planets etc. are impressive and holds well even to this day.2) You can upgrade your ship with armaments, equipment or buy better ships over-time which gives a decent rpg feel to the game.3) The cut-scenes (though repetition abounds here too) helps propel the story and gives the game that quint-essential rpg feel.In the end this is a ambitiously conceived sci-fi rpg yet a poorly executed game. I actually came here expecting a Eve offline but alas it's more of a action rpg that is designed for people looking for immediate gratification.EDIT: I got my hands on X3:Terran Conflict and it's the space sim that I have been looking for a long time. If you are looking for a open-ended, single player space simulator rpg with incredible visuals or essentially a Eve Offline than check out Egosoft's X-series games.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2012"}

You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or fighting the good fight solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support.Multiple Controller SupportMonster Hunter Trifeatures a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes. And finally the Wii Remote allows the ability to save your character&rsquo;s information directly to it, just as is possible with Miis, so you&rsquo;re always ready to play at a friend&rsquo;s house.Key Game FeaturesSpecial Controller Included- Designed with input from the Capcom development team, the Wii Classic Controller Pro is included in this bundle.Hunt Together- In the hunt, you&rsquo;re never alone.

In single player mode, you even have the ability to hunt with AI-controlled characters named ChaCha.Communicate Online- Because communication is key in coordinated huntsMonster Hunter Trisupports Wii Speak and text chat.Monsters with Unique Abilities and Attacks- Monsters have unique and dynamic personalities, abilities and defenses, increasing in complexity as the player progresses. They camouflage themselves to ambush hunters, but will flee or call for help if outmatched.Immense Living, Breathing World with Ecosystem- Monsters interact amongst each other in a living breathing ecosystem, complete with food chain. Monsters have stamina, migrate and even attack one another, the strong feeding on the weak.New Underwater Maps- For the first time ever in anyMonster Huntergame, you will be able explore land and sea and hunt monsters of the deep.Fully Customizable Equipment- With ten weapon categories &ndash; including the all-new Switch Axe &ndash; and new armor and weaponry created from the remains of slain monsters, there are almost limitless opportunities for equipment customization.Choice of Controls- Play with either the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, with the Classic Controller or Classic Controller Pro.Take Your Character with You- The ability to save your character to your Wii Remote lets you engage in multiplayer hunts anytime on a friend's console.","reviewerName":"Deimos \".\"","summary":"Epic.","reviewText":"These are the games I love.

Players will find familiar names like Glass Joe, King Hippo and trainer Doc Louis. These boxers come to life again in cell-shaded 3-D, complete with hilarious fighting animations and backstories that capture all the fun and flair of the originalPunch-Out!!games.The Wii's Motion SensitivityThe motion-sensitive controls of the Wii console mean that when players throw punches, Little Mac throws punches as well. Additionally, you can control hooks and jabs by combining motion control with control-stick movement.

Players can now use multiple stars in a single punch for an extra-powerful attack.Controller OptionsPunch-Out!!features multiple controller options. For players looking to take advantage of the Wii's motion control capabilities,Punch-Out!!uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers to simulate throwing punches. Use the Nunchuck to throw a left punch and the Wii Remote to throw a right punch. Fans of the NES version and core gamers will be excited to see Nintendo has also included the option to playPunch-Out!!using the classic layout from the original NES controller.

The music, characters, everything, all top notch. They didn't hold anything back except widescreen support lol.

I mean it's one of the greatest games of all time, AND you're getting in your cardio, doesn't get much sweeter than that lol.Career mode is very good, some new characters were added but they fit in just fine and add to the content so that's a plus. Multiplayer mode is tons of fun and is where you REALLY get a workout, especially if the two people playing are good at it. I'm glad they don't force motion controls though cuz it'll wear you down if you really get in to your video games like I do.

I swear by my belief that violence isn't needed to make a videogame good (though I'll never believe in censorship), and nudity should have never even been mentioned in the same sentence. For a long time videogames were geared toward children. Yes, those children grew up. But, and this is big, those one-time children also had children who will no doubt play video games. And the rating system sucks, to be completely honest.But with that out of the way, I highly recommend this game (what a change, huh?). It is easily the best PS2 game of 2005, even better than Metal Gear Solid 3. And it's better because it's more of an experience than an actual game. There are few moments when you can put the controller down. Everything is interactive, with mini-games popping up in the oddest places to change the pace. Visually, it's eye-popping, both for its action and its graphics, with very little slowdown during the intense moments.Then there comes the story. I'm not afraid to admit this: I'm a mythology buff. I can name nearly every Greek or Roman deity there is, their specific domains of power, and some stories that can be told of these gods and goddesses. God of War doesn't disappoint with its accuracy, and even throws its own visual interpretation of some of the gods (Hades actually looks like a god of hell).Anyone 17+ should own this game.

{"product_name":"B00000K125","description":"Featuring graphics that surpass even the amazingNFL 2K,Soul Caliburis the martial arts fighting game to end all fighting games andthegame to get if you're a Dreamcast owner. Based on the arcade classic of the same name,Soul Caliburlets you choose to represent one of 10 fighters in a series of battles against your peers. If you can successfully defeat all of your opponents, you will then face the fiendish Inferno in a final showdown that will determine the fate of the world. Each of the game's warriors is armed with a different deadly weapon--sword, ax, stave, nunchaku, you name it--and an assortment of special moves all tailored to that specific weapon. The warriors include men, women, and creatures from all over the globe and from various mythologies. Each is brought to life with amazing motion-capture animation, which results in incredibly lifelike and realistic duels.

It's worth the money, it's worth the money, and it's worth your time to check it out. You may have some trouble grabbing a copy of Soul Calibur, because every Dreamcast owner probably purchased this at the counter when picking up their system. Soul Calibur is the ultimate in fighting games - sleek, graphically unparalleled, and deep - and ranks as the best fighting game out there. It's set apart from its competitors by the double knockout of a great look and solid game play. Based on last years hit arcade game, and a sequel to the smash PlayStation hit, Soul Blade, Soul Calibur pits ten fighters against each other in a standard two-out-of three battle for supremacy. But might doesn't always make for right in this game. Soul Calibur is unprecedented in its game balance, with large, impressive bulky fighters on the same ground as small, fast players. The ten starting fighters are just that - a starting lineup. Through game play and advancement you'll uncover many cameo fighters, like Yoshimitsu from Tekken, and Seung Mina and Hwang from Soul Blade. There are also mystery stages and costume changes to uncover. Soul Calibur also offers many new options that the arcade version couldn't. Battle Mode, Team Battle, and Survival modes all lend the game an enormous replay value, while the sometimes complicated move system is helped out by a very thorough Practice mode that explains every move and shows you how to execute them. Graphically, the game evolves past its arcade counterpart in every respect, with incredible detail and superior polygon counts. Soul Calibur on the Dreamcast is without a doubt the best looking fighting game ever, with nuances like muscle rippling, facial expressions of pain, fear, and anger, and caustic lighting effects that dazzle the eyes. The game also excels in the area of sound, achieving what other games only dream of - the perfect balance of music, voice, and sound effects. Clashing swords, primal yelling, and blood-pumping heroic themes course through the game, all meshing for the perfect sonic mix. Namco has retooled the fighting dynamics so that both button-mashers and serious students of ass-whupping can both benefit and prosper in the game. Although novices can easily beat the game on easier settings, the game definitely favors those who understand Soul Calibur's complexities, like dodging, vertical and 8-way run attacks, and stagger blocking. Someone who has mastered the arcade game will find the differences in the moves trifling, while every one else will scarcely notice. What are you waiting for? Sonic can wait, TrickStyle will still be pulling tricks next week, and NFL 2K has a millenium ahead of it. There's no excuse for you not to be enjoying the best fighting game this year, and possibly the best ever. Power Stone and the laughable Mortal Kombat Gold can't touch the soul of this fighter, but you can.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2003"}

I always loved the series back when it was released on the PS2 (at the time I didn't think it sucked I know...that version was terrible) and now the series just keeps getting better and better. This version, however, feels like an expansion pack than a full out sequel. The story continues with the Mexicans vs. Americans war and this time they have a nuke (you can figure out what happens there). The game is EXACTLY the same as the first so I won't explain what you already know. There are some new cool weapons though (the names are too complicated to remember) and a new support vehicle the M.U.L.E.

This is a BIG improvement and is much needed. Plus you can now move the UAV around in the mode as well.The graphics are only slightly updated (they don't look to impressive now) and the multiplayer is only slightly updated but is still crippled (why can't they keep the single player stuff in the multiplayer?

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar.

Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"S. Morales","summary":"Forget the negative reviews, this is a GOOD game","reviewText":"RE5 has gotten a lot of slack for its rehashing of RE4 and controls that haven't been \"updated\" to the likes of Gears of War and Dead Space (action/adventure games that have evolved from 1st gen survival horror).Yes, RE5 does *not* have a surprisingly creative story (there's one twist that RE fans will find ok, but nothing spellbinding), RE5 DOES carry 90% of the controls over from RE4 (which can seemingly feel problematic if you're accustomed to Gears of War type controls), and RE5 is in fact RE4 with a fresh coat of paint. Yes, all this is true. You cannot move while aiming or shooting, you cannot jump, the most agility you get is doing a 180 degree turn... but at the end of the day, the game is dang fun and enjoyable all the way through to the end. I found myself simply WANTING to come back to it, and most of the reason had nothing to do with how \"up to date\" the controls were or how agile my character was, or how similar it was to Gears of War and Dead Space. No, RE5 makes itself fun through the most subtle things that most people tend to overlook. In fact, I felt myself having more fun with this than I felt with Dead Space. ..but then again, I'm an RE veteran, and from what I gather, absolute newcomers to the series entirely simply won't \"get\" why this game controls the way it does.RE5's characters are bulky, and have weight to them and their weapons; this can be noticed in the graphic detail, the movement and step sound effects (which are wonderful, the sound engineering and production of this game are top-notch). When your characters move, both their feet and gear clank, ruffle and footsteps match all the various types of terrain, which at first sounded a bit dramatic and overdone, but after about an hour or so into the game and it becomes second nature - the effects no longer are surprisingly loud but make this game feel all the more realistic. You'll pop in another game and notice the fact that it's NOT there and wish it was.Graphically the game is ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING. Rarely will you see a graphical showing on the PS3 that is just as good. If I'm really picky I'd just have to say that the water effects could've been done a bit better, but as long as the sound engineering makes the water sound real, you could do without it looking perfect. Otherwise, characters and enemies are insanely detailed and precise, environments are perfectly lighted and texturized. Even in the smallest and most insignificant sections the producers still went the extra mile to give every single wall or area look as realistic as possible. Overall, the graphics, effects, explosions, etc are look stupendous.Game length goes for 6 chapters or areas split into about 3 sections each. You'll come across areas with some vast amount of enemies, and while hey aren't zombies anymore, you'd really rather they not be. You can only do zombies for so many years before it becomes stale. No, just like RE4 these are humans infected by a virus, so the \"zombies\" are less like 'Night of the Living Dead' and more like murderous versions of '28 Days Later' type zombies. They run, they throw things, they yell, and later in the game lots of even use machine guns and weaponry. While this may seem silly to some, it definitely ups the challenge, and you'll definitely die a few times at some areas but overall the game doesn't punish the players too much. It is aware of its control scheme and understands how characters are only able to evade attacks in so many ways, so enemy attacks and behavior sort of \"work\" with that.Weapon upgrading is enjoyable, taking down bigger baddies is fun, and you'll no longer need to solve any puzzles. No, this is a flat out action game. It's not scary in the way that the old RE games were, and it would be cool if for the next game the producers could do SOMETHING to bring back that old secluded and frightful \"survival horror\" vibe while still maintaining this same control scheme, camera work and character detail. I'd love to hear that eerie orchestral music once again and be scared to play the game in the dark... it's been too long since.Unlockables are your standard fare and most RE fans will know what to expect, hasn't changed.If there was something I'd change about this game it would be the aiming in some portions, but you never really run low on ammo as it seems to be everywhere, but it's a little disappointing that your inventory space feels somewhat limited, even if you have a partner who you can exchange and sort with. Most weapons are too expensive and lots of what you can buy you may not be able to until your second playthrough.Overall I think RE veterans will very much enjoy this game and will look past the fact that it doesn't control like Gears of War. Newcomers will enjoy it if they give it a chance and take it for what it is.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0000503MO","description":"The third title of the Gran Turismo series takes full advantage of the new PlayStation2 game engine, which is capable of rendering about 20 million polygons per second--roughly 10 times the number of total polygons of the series' previous installment,Gran Turismo 2. Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course.

{"product_name":"B005EYRAUK","description":"Play as both Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic in the ultimate Sonic experience. Master the moves of each character as they race through each environment on their own specially designed track.","reviewerName":"Ryan Sil. (Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...","summary":"Stands out from the console versions!","reviewText":"Is it better than the console versions? No.Is it shorter? Yes. (By 2 zones)Do these questions matter? Nope.You know why we were all hyped for this game? Because it is a flashback of nearly the blue blur's whole history, with familiar environments that cast all new levels! To top it all off, you finally get to play as Sonic's original design again, as well as compete with other players via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.This version stands out from the Xbox/PS3 game due to its different worlds (With the exception of Green Hill Zone) and said online play. Players get to romp through the greatness that is Green Hill (Sonic 1), Casino Night (Sonic 2), Mushroom Hill (Sonic and Knuckles), Emerald Coast (Sonic Adventure), Radical Highway (Adventure 2), Water Palace (Sonic Rush), and Tropical Resort (Sonic Colors).Classic Sonic plays nearly exactly like in the original Sega Genesis games! While the Genesis-era levels for him are duplicates of the originals (Without the miniboss for Mushroom Hill, though), the rest of the levels (Dreamcast-era and so on) are all-new, yet they fit with the classic platform-orientated gameplay amazingly! Eventually, Classic Sonic gets the Homing Attack, which locks onto enemies for Sonic to hit. People may not like this addition, since people recognized it from the Adventure games, which were way after the Genesis games (Although it was first in Sonic 3D Blast as you could use it when receiving the Golden Shield). The console versions of Sonic Generations also had this attack (As an optional feature), but players could enable or disable it. Personally, I think it adds to the gameplay nicely, but in case if you just don't want to use it, I suggest you just try not to press B twice in a row.Modern Sonic, on the other hand, is more focused on speed. Like in the Sonic Rush series and Sonic Colors for DS, Modern Sonic is equipped with a Boost bar to go extremely fast, as well as the Homing Attack. While it's still somewhat platform-orientated, Modern Sonic is best defined by his much faster pace, as well as certain in-your-face surprises (Whoa! A giant totem pole is falling towards Sonic!).Also exclusive to the 3DS version is the Special Stage. Special Stages are for rewarding a Chaos Emerald after completing obstacles where you must collect orbs to be able to Boost to dash to collect the emerald. The gameplay here is like that of Sonic 2's or Sonic 3D Blast's Special Stages.Remember when Sonic had to race Metal Sonic? Or when he was chased by that killer whale? How about when he was venturing through the neon Casino Night Zone? You can relive those moments in this game, and they fit perfectly with the new level layouts!The graphics are hugely lush and very colorful and detailed. Heck, since you don't need a 3D TV to see it in 3D (obviously), you can just go and gaze at the visuals at their finest with ease and awe. The music is from the respective Sonic games that the worlds represent, but the soundtrack is still pretty robust and catchy.Online play is a very nice addition. You can race another player worldwide through any level that you have beaten in the main game. Like racing games such as Mario Kart Wii, there are points rewarded to you as the other player loses those amount of points. The result is well done and adds to the replay value greatly.Speaking of replay value, like the console versions, this game has a whopping 100 missions. However, you'd need to unlock said missions, but once you do, be thankful that there's even more to the game than it shows to begin with. The game is actually very short. You can beat the game within perhaps a couple hours. But even if you did beat the game with its minimal requirements, there is absolutely no doubting that you had enjoyed the thrillride throughout, from beginning to end. While it wasn't better than the console versions, it certainly was close. Besides, whether you have the console version or not, this game is still a must-buy.Happy Birthday, Sonic...(Note: You should buy the game from a store. Copies online are overpriced as of this writing, and are as expensive as Wii games)UPDATE: 10/7/2013Okay, I think I've given the game a bit too many positive aspects. It's definitely not an AWESOME game by any means, or maybe even great to some, but it's still well worthy of 4 stars in my opinion.There are some pointers that may be a turnoff for some players. First off, Modern Sonic's levels are not exactly as well-polished as they were in the DS titles. The Rival battles are also somewhat monotonous and couldn't pale anymore in comparison to the console version's (They still beat out Sonic Rivals's races by a long shot, though).Saying that Classic Sonic fits perfectly with new level layouts was also a klutzy claim I made. The level design is still not bad, but at times, some segments don't feel too pleasant. Whether it's a chain of dash pads or bursts of wind trying to carry Sonic, this certainly isn't the best level design out there.Overall, though, I still recommend Sonic Generations to those just wanting another portable Sonic to play, or for those who simply want more of Sonic Generations. If the choice is there for you, though, I recommend at least one of the DS Sonics over this......Unless you're in for the online play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

Together, these two titles laid the foundation for the series and spawned many hit sequels that have now sold over 42 million units worldwide.","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"The right games on the wrong system","reviewText":"FMV sequences don't do much for me any more, and as impressive as they can be sometimes having FMVs just does not warrant a port of a remake of the classic Final Fantasy on the Playstation (or PS2 in my case) when it is obvious that even using enhanced graphics the game still does not fully utilize the PS1's sprite power. The games are still great, especially for nostalgia, but they would have been better off being brought to GameBoy Advance. The enhancements made to FF 1, and the never domestically released FF 2 were appreciated, but not drastic enough considering the types of enhancements that could have been made, but were not. Animation is still stiff, the music is improved but still not to the level of FF VIII, or X, and at this point if they are going to keep doing remakes of older FF titles they need to either fully realize the game's potential for the system the game is being made for (PS2, I mean does anybody still have or even use a PS 1 anymore?) or bring it to a system where less is expected of the game, GameBoy Advance is screaming for a game like this. Not that I don't appreciate that Square has been so dedicated to getting us updated versions of their classic games, its just that I'd like to see some 32-bit looking remakes out of them for PS1 or some 128 bit remakes for PS2, rather than low end 16-bit looking RPGs with a couple FMVs thrown in to justify the decision to put it on the Playstation.And in all honesty I'd much rather see updated versions of FF VII, VIII, and IX on Xbox or GameCube at this point, or even PS 2 as long as it is able to fully realize the game's artistic potential. Love the games as I do, FF 1 and 2 are simply not upgraded enough to warrant their appearance on the Playstation. GameBoy Advance would have been a much better platform for these games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2003"}

Terrorists operate openly, killing thousands; drugs, disease, and pollution kill even more. The world's economics are close to collapse, and the gap between the insanely wealthy and the desperately poor has grown to the size of the Grand Canyon. Worst of all, an ages-old conspiracy bent on world domination has decided that the time is right to emerge from the shadows and take control. No one believes the conspiracy exists--no one but you.In this thrilling role-playing adventure, you play the part of J.C. Denton, a powerful, nanotechnologically augmented antiterrorist agent. It's up to you to stop the conspirators from achieving their goals. But this world is full of lies and betrayal, a world where nothing is as it seems and entire nations can seemingly be turned against you at the push of a button. To succeed, you must travel the globe in a quest for knowledge, develop your character's nanotech augmentations and strengths as you see fit, build a network of allies to assist you, and determine when stealth and strategy are more important than action. And each time you think you've got the mystery solved, the game figured out, there's another, deeper mystery to be unraveled. You will never know whom to trust, who your friends are, who's in the conspiracy, and who's innocent. Maybe no one is.","reviewerName":"VG Fan","summary":"Maybe the best game of all time","reviewText":"Deus Ex is considered by many to be one of the best, if not THE best PC game of all time.  Having recently completed it, I can tell you that the hype is justified.  This is truly an amazing game, and may indeed be the best video game I've ever played.  This is such a fantastic game on so many levels that it's difficult to write a good review that isn't ridiculously long, but I'm going to try.  But you should probably just go ahead and order it now and then finish reading the review.Deus Ex is basically a hybrid an FPS / RPG hybrid, and it combines the two genres brilliantly.  The game play is similar to most shooters, except that there are stealth, hacking (you can hack into computers, turn off security systems, even have turrets shoot the bad guys!), and lock picking elements you don't normally see in generic shooters.  It's an RPG in that you gain experience points and new abilities (you find modules you can install into your nanotech enhanced body to give you special abilities) as the game goes on, allowing you to build the kind of character you want.  The game gives A LOT of choice here--you can make a walking tank who specializes in heavy weapons or be a super stealthy guy who can cloak himself, uses a dart gun, and tries to stay unseen.  The game is so well designed that both approaches will give you a great experience--neither one feels like it's the one you are \"supposed to\" pick.  And there's plenty of middle ground as well.One thing I like in my RPGs is when you start pretty weak and get a lot stronger over the course of the game, and that's the case here.  You can barely aim your gun at the start of the game, but by the end you are a bad, bad man.So what makes it so great?  If there is one thing I think it's the combination of lots of choices with a really, really great story.  Usually games with lots of choices have a weak or minimal story, but that's not at all the case here.  There are ALWAYS 2 or 3 or ways to reach your objectives in the game.  You can walk in the front door blasting away (though it will be A LOT harder to do than in your basic shooter, especially early on), or you can crawl through an air duct and hack into the security system.  Or if you explore enough you might find someone with a key to the backdoor.  Maybe if you've leveled your swimming skill, there's an underwater tunnel you can swim through to get where you need to go.  The levels are BIG and incredibly well designed; you never feel that there is one \"right\" way to handle a problem in the game.  Seriously, there is so much in each level that there is pretty much no way you will find it all in one play through--there is a ton of exploration here.What else?  Well, the game designers hit every other game element out of the park as well.  Music is awesome and totally immersive.  Did I mention the story?  I know I did, but it's incredible as well (involves a vast, global conspiracy), so I want to mention it again.  The game is very well paced.  Ammo and inventory space are limited, so you get a little thrill every time you find some.I have very few criticisms of this game, but here are a few that many people have mentioned.  Some people criticize the graphics, but I think they still look fine--about what you'd expect from an 11 year old game, and I never felt the graphics detracted from the game.  It's mainly the character models that look iffy.  Interiors in particular still look great.  Some of the voice acting in Hong Kong is a little iffy as well.  Also, the AI is not super sophisticated about looking for you, but it's smart enough.  Last thing I want to say is that the start of the first level is probably the weakest part of the entire game, so if you start off and feel a little underwhelmed after all the hype (like I did), just keep playing and the game will get very awesome very fast.Non-obvious gameplay tips:- Talk to people multiple times, they may have more to say.- Hard difficulty is actually harder than Realistic.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2011"}

The gameplay is just about as good as the other 5 games but due to the lack of new-game-plus (which means extras when you beat the game) this game is not easy to pick up once you beat it. the other problem (which is related to the lack of replay value) is that the game is hard and it is tough to figure out where to go next (which leaves players frustrated and want to throw out their GBA or DS out the window). this is why I give the overall rating of 3 stars. Each of the other ones have great replay values (like Circle of the moon has certain names you can choose so that you can have higher strength or magic or whater than when you first played the game without any secrets or Aria and Dawn of Sorrow have you keep your most powerful weapons even when you beat the game, Portait of Ruin had more weapons than just a whip, and even though Symphony of the Night didn't have the best secrets, it has great replay value and it's just that great of a game overall)Even though it's still a good game, just think twice before you purchase this game. If you get the 2 in 1 game (this game and Aria of Sorrow), I guess that's a little different because there are 2 games in one cartridge and even if this game isn't played often, at least the cart gets a little more attention.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2007"}

Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"This Ain't Your Grandma's Sandbox","reviewText":"Read players reviews of Saints Row for 5 minutes and you'll probably find five-or-more references to the Grand Theft Auto series of video games.  I however feel that the comparison between Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row exists only at the highest level - they are both massive sandbox games with basic stories involving gang warfare.From that point on, they're two totally different ballgames...As this isn't a Grand Theft Auto review, I won't go into depth on the series, but GTA has become increasingly about realism and immersion.  The most recent title demanded players use cell phones to arrange outings with friends.  Nightclubs and Theatres were even included to give players a place to take their \"dates\".Saints Row marches to the beat of a slightly different drum...  Probably one made out of recycled hooker boots and rigged with explosive devies...Saints row has continuously strived to push the envelope of absurdity and chaos.  I wouldn't be surprised if the next Saints Row title is probably banned in a handful of countries!  You don't call your friends and invite them to a comedy show: instead you ask them to bring you a tank so you can pretty much blow up everything in sight.  Or to come out and help turn the tide of a gunfight to reclaim some gang territory.  There are no standings to maintain, no relationships to manage, and from the looks of it, you're not even penalized from accidentally mowing over one of your own gang members.  Oops.  My bad...The compromise of course comes at the expense of the story, which as one reviewer put it, \"must have been written by 5-year-olds.\"  I can't totally disagree, though having not completed all of the story yet, I can't say for sure what lies ahead.  I do know that it didn't take long to start slingin' bullets into the faces of.... ...well, suspecting foes...  There was no time wasted running courier missions, and even the standard \"help your friend make a bank-heist\" mission was completed not by driving the getaway car, but by providing rocket launcher support FOR the getaway car from the side-door of a helicopter.Two significant complaints I do have are the graphics - which are barely above PS2 standards in my opinion, and the controls - particular while behind the wheel.  There are certainly times when the graphics fare well.  Of particular note are the general building environments - especially the \"cribs\", which have a look-and-feel on-par with their part of town.  The dingy cribs are especially dingy, the palace suites are glamorously lit, with reflective surfaces and textures.  But start customizing a vehicle in a garage, and the lack of adequate anti-aliasing, shading, and overall resolution is painfully apparent.  On the controls end of things, cars are surprisingly twitchy - in most cases TOO responsive.  For those of you who were frustrated with the way cars in GTAIV felt overly heavy, cars in SR3 feel almost weightless, and make impossible turns with the flick of a finger.  This can be useful when you're hauling a$$ to a gang fight - or running from said gang fight - but can be frustrating when trying to thread the needle at max speed down a 4-lane highway.Saints Row is not for children, not for the faint-at-heart, and not for the \"I wish video games were a lot more like real life\" crowd.  And while the story, events and activities won't cause you any immediate epiphanies, it should certainly provide ample car-stealing, pedestrian-murdering, rocket-launching, mayhem-causing fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2011"}

Platforming is a little sticky. The gameplay is fast and feels like its on crack especially during the huge gun battles of dozens of enemies or more. This game is absolutely wonderful, though some low points are some sticky movements and the dream sequences Max Payne has are kinda difficult because they require you to go through maze-like environments.OVERALL: This game could easily be enjoyed by any fan of action titles because of the great gameplay, interesting story, comic book-style cutscenes, a great selection of weapons (molotov cocktails anyone?), and the awesome slow-motion feature which would later be used in games like F.E.A.R.THE GOOD: Fast bullet-spraying gameplay, interesting story, cool weapons, and the innovative slow-motion feature.THE BAD: Some sticky controls and platforming sequences, and ugly graphics.

As these survivors' allies mysteriously fall victim to dementia, it becomes clear that protecting a young girl granting them a bizarre immunity may be their only hope for survival in a struggle that could have implications for all of humanity.GameplayAlthough designed to preserve the feel of the action of the original game, gameplay inExtractionis also quite unique. First, the player perspective has been changed from third, to first-person, placing all the action right in front of you. Also,Extractionis a 'rail shooter,' meaning a shooter game where most of the action engaged in and paths followed are programmed into the mission play, instead of the freeform wandering ability built into the considerably larger Next-Gen and PCDead Spacerelease. The combination of these two changes funnels the players focus onto the combat options available in the game. In dealing with the danger of the alien Necromorphs swarming the game space,Dead Space Extractionutilizes the precision of the Wii Remote in variety of ways. Weapons like the Plasma Cutter can dispatch these enemies from a distance by taking advantage of the remote's pointing targeting ability, while a quick wave can activate weapons like the Ripper, a guidable spinning saw blade. The Wii Remote is also handy for picking up items and hurling them at enemies using the power of Kinesis.Other gameplay changes include new play modes. The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn't become too easy. In addition,Extractionalso features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed. Taken together all these changes add up to more action, more fun and moreDead Spacefor players on the Wii.Key Game FeaturesAn All-New Prequel Exclusively for the WiiFollow the lives of several different Aegis VII colony members as they carve a bloody path to survival.Meet a new cast of characters, destroy fearsome new enemies, and wield brutal new weapons.Real TerrorStunning graphics, panic-inducing audio, and a frenetic first-person perspective thrust you headlong into the terror.Play through an engrossing, interactive horror movie experience that raises the bar for storytelling in video games.Intuitive ControlsStrategically dismember your enemies with pinpoint control using the Wii Remote.Wield a powerful arsenal of abilities and weapons to freeze enemies, manipulate gravity with telekinesis, solve puzzles, and fight off attacks from every direction in zero gravity.Co-Op GameplayTeam up with a friend to fight off the invasion on the USG Ishimura with jump-in cooperative play.Combine efforts on engineering puzzles or determine specific roles to create a unique experience with each play session.","reviewerName":"James P.","summary":"Experimental Fan Service","reviewText":"Some of the best visuals available on the Wii system.

It&#x92;s your job as the mercenary mammal to find all the spellstones that will rejoin the splintered planet and defeat the evil General Scales. This entails much exploring of ancient temples and completing of subquests to help everything from Yorkshire-accented woolly mammoths to pterodactyls who've lost their babies.The game may lack the epic scale and endless invention ofZeldabut it has plenty of new ideas of its own, including a fully interactive dinosaur sidekick, some cool shoot-'em-up sections in Fox&#x92;s spaceship, and lots of ways to upgrade a magical staff--your weapon of choice when out of your ship. To add some icing to the cake, the graphics are absolutely amazing, particularly the superrealistic fur effects.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Scott Cohen","summary":"Star Fox Adventures; the greatest adventure yet","reviewText":"The moment you play this game, you will recognize the gameplay. Any person who played the Nintendo 64 will recognize that this game is like The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time! Just about everywhere, this game was given the perfect 10 score. Rare took that award winning formula and created the long awaited title; Star Fox Dinosaur Planet, recently re-dubbed Star Fox Adventures. Star Fox Adventures was announced at E3 2000 for the Nintendo 64. It was worked on with a enourmous 512 megabyte game-cartidge. Later that year, Nintendo announced the Dolphin, what is now the Nintendo Gamecube. The graphics were the most amazing graphics almost brought to the Nintendo 64, making use of the almost useless Expansion Pack. Flash-forward to 2001, Star Fox Dinosaur Planet was delayed to ship when it was supposed to. Later, it was removed from the game list. It was made public that Star Fox was canceled. Everyone was really (pissed off). The game was kept under wraps for almost a year until late 2001. The game was announced for the Gamecube a year later. Star Fox fans rejoiced. We saw some screen shots of the game, and it blew everyone away. Excellent visuals! I mean, you can actually see the individual hairs in Fox's head. Cool! An announced date of March 2002 was official. Only a few months to Star Fox. Flash-forward to March 2002. Just a few more days until Star Fox. Come to a reliable site of games. Just when it was about to come out, Nintendo announced that it was delayed until June 2002. It was made official that it's release was to coincide with Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem's. June 24th, Eternal Darkness was released, with Star Fox now where to see. Nintendo lives up to it's reputation for delaying games again. Star Fox was delayed until September 30th. August, Nintendo bumps up to September 23rd. This is where we are today.As I said before, Star Fox Adventures definately is based on Ocarina Of Time's. You see a similar A button atack, B for items. It also has the Z-Targeting that Zelda had. The graphics are the most amazing you will see in a long time. The game runs in proggressive scan mode for the TV's that can use it. This game even looks amazing in S-Video and Composite mode. This game deserves to be in the 5 million people who own the Gamecube's collection. This is the best game to come out of Rare, sadly the last, after Rare closed their connections with Nintendo and gone off with the poseurs at Microsoft. Oh well, their loss, we never expected Perfect Dark 0 to come out until 2004. You definately need to try this out, and if you hurry, any retail store has is it in the new demo disk for August 2002, along with Super Mario Sunshine. Buy this as soon as you possibly can!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2002"}

Even years later.HIGHLIGHTS:-Stunning artwork with graphical filters that emulate colored pencil drawings-With regards to the purported \"storybook\" format: this is incorrect. The game is presented as an in-universe encyclopedia of the war which its plot details.-Good voice acting in both English and Japanese--both are present--contributes to the likability of both protagonists and antagonists.-The soundtrack has an extraordinary balance between recurring motifs and standalone tracks, an effect that builds emotional momentum as you play the game without causing the recurring musical themes to become stale or annoying.-The romantic subplot is presented in a completely natural way compared to most Japanese stories, which is refreshing. Rather than awkward scenes like you'd see in a teenage movie or anime, the characters are clearly interested in each other from early on. Heck, the obligatory kissing scene was a shock to me, because I'd assumed they were in an offscreen relationship for half the game or more.-The story is heavily evocative of World War I/II, including elements of that period such as Nazi work camps and technological arms races.-The \"magic\" element--which, notably, the player never has access to--is held in check in such a way that it seems more like a parallel to nuclear weapons or the like than a fantasy story.-The gameplay is a brilliant blend of smoothly animated, unique combat units and tactical warfare. The post-game \"Hard\" skirmishes provide a huge challenge, as do some of the story chapters, but a calm mind can solve any of the game's puzzles after a few \"recon\" attempts.PITFALLS:-Frankly, the game is damn near perfect, but replayability is an issue because a strategy that works once will always work the next time, no matter the challenge. However, there are a multitude of ways to play the game, so the determined can find more fun after the story is over.-The game ranks you purely based on the speed with which you complete objectives. This spurs players to use riskier maneuvers, which may jive with the plot (you play as a quick-strike militia unit, rather than army regulars), but ultimately is less fun than if the developers had made the game harder and ranked you based on other criteria.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-23-2012"}

There is nothing to hate about this game.  I was let down that it wasn't longer, but it is still very complex.  I even like how the trailers for the game were misleading.  It kept the element of surprise up.  The attention to detail is spot on, the new combat skills are awesome, the leveling up of powers is better than the force sphere feature of the first game, the enemies are smarter, the dual light sabers and ability to mix and match crystals is a big plus, the levels are more involved, the loading times are faster....need I say more?  The first game I blew through in about 2 days.  This game took me 2 days as well, but that required solid giving it my all.  It is for skilled gamers, its a challenge and no one is going to just hack and slash through it.  When I was done with the first FU I had to buy the 3 downloadable levels to get new enjoyment, but this game comes with some mini challenges that are very hard to complete and will keep your attention long after the actual story is finished.

{"product_name":"B00C7103DO","description":"Batman: Arkham Origins features an expanded Gotham City and introduces an original prequel storyline set several years before the events of Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City, the first two critically acclaimed games of the franchise; Taking place before the rise of Gotham City's most dangerous criminals, the game showcases a young and unrefined Batman as he faces a defining moment in his early career as a crime fighter that sets his path to becoming the Dark Knight; As the story unfolds, players will meet many important characters for the first time and forge key relationships","reviewerName":"Chris Chapa","summary":"Unique it is not","reviewText":"*My review, while a little harsh, is reflective of THIS particular game against the games that came before it (Arkham Asylum & Arkham City)CONCEPT:Taking place shortly after Bruce Wayne dons his cape and cowl, Batman is still a rumor whispered about in the shadows.  From this installment, we see the Dark Knight evolve from myth to legend, right from the beginning. His dealings have him coming face to face for the first time with some of the more notorious characters from his dossier: Black Mask, Bane, Cobblepot, Enigma, as well as his first encounter with the Joker.GRAPHICS/SOUND:The makers of the Arkham series (Asylum, City, Origins) have proven themselves to be quite adept at consistency. The look of Gotham is more or less....exactly the same as in previous titles. After popping in the previous games into my PS3 for a quick verification, I can say that aside from perhaps &#34;sharpening up&#34; a few graphics here and there, nothing has really changed or improved. To be fair, the graphics were pretty good to begin with, but the look of Arkham Origins could come off more as a companion DLC to Arkham City than it's own standalone (prequel) game. The music is above par, dramatic, and fitting to all situations that Batman has to contend with, as well as I feel as though perhaps the composer Christopher Drake was subconsciously channeling Danny Elfman once or twice. Drake has had a long history of composing music for the Batman series, both in television and in the Arkham series, and you don't really need me to tell you that he fulfills his role exceptionally.GAMEPLAY:Origins is, for lack of a better phrase: a carbon copy of Arkham City - with a few tweaks up and down. Fighting has changed 0% with the exception of a couple of new enemies (Venom thugs and Martial Artists). The landscape and explorable world of Gotham (Later Arkham City) has little-to-no deviations from it's predecessor title. With nothing really new to explore other than the linear plot locations, Gotham/Arkham feels very bland and unexciting; traveling from one point to another becomes more of a chore. On THAT note: I understand that this is supposed to take place early in Batman's career, but the &#34;quality&#34; of Batman's available gadgets seems to have diminished. The Batclaw, which made getting around the city a damn fun experience has probably lost HALF of it's previously available use. Although you can still use it for grappling ledges to pull yourself towards while gliding, there is significantly much less for it to grapple somehow. Where you could cross the entire city without touching the ground in Arkham City, Origins will have you spending quite a bit of time on foot until you can find some other low building to raise yourself. The whole mechanic of &#34;Diving-then-pulling-up-for-a-faster-glide&#34; is virtually useless since you'll be too close to the ground 90% of the time. New gadgets that become available throughout the story are basically &#34;original versions&#34; of the same gadgets from previous titles with the exact same functions: Ice grenade is now Glue Grenade, Disrupter is now in &#34;gun form&#34;. The only gadget that stands out as a damn good addition is Shock Gloves, which make me wonder why Wayne would have thought that converting them into that pathetic REC gun was EVER a good idea.REPLAY VALUE: Low/ModerateThe motives for replaying Arkham Origins are the exact same as for the previous games: New Game+ offers a second playthrough with all of your previously earned gadgets from the start to use against significantly more difficult enemies. Continuing your existing game after the credits roll allows you to work towards 100% completion.OVERALL:Asylum and City was loaded with great cameos of some of the most notorious enemies that Batman has dealt with, as well as each game telling a compelling story. By comparison, Origins falls terribly flat. There's only two real enemies that Batman has to deal with, the others are more or less &#34;filler&#34; baddies that you won't recognize unless you have more advanced knowledge of the Batman universe than your average joe (like myself). The plot line had IMMENSE POTENTIAL but didn't deliver. For instance, the very word Arkham isn't mentioned ONCE in the game and is never referred to whatsoever. The Arkham series has yet to put out a BAD game by definition, but when you find a formula that works and beat it like a dead horse, you get the closest thing: a STALE game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2014"}

After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. Get ready to jump out of your couch cushions!--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessGreat cooperative modePlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multi-player options","reviewerName":"Ethan D Van Vorst","summary":"I need...my....nitro pills...*gasp*","reviewText":"I remember the original Doom quite fondly...I downloaded \"Doom: Knee Deep in the Dead\" back in the early 90's from a bulletin board and introduced it to a number of my Air Force squadron friends, who all got pretty much hooked on it. It was an enormous leap forward from it's predecessor, Wolfenstein 3D, except with a much creepier setting. Plus it had a really cool multiplayer setup for it's day...you essentialy went through all the maps of the game either cooperatively or in deathmatch. That said I soon became the squadron champion in Doom, my weapon of choice the chainsaw naturally :)My brothers got this for me for my birthday. I had heard that there were steep system requirements (a lot of people buy new rigs just to play this) and I was worried it wouldn't run well on my aging Athlon 1.8 with 1 gig of ram. At first it was a little clunky, so I turned the detail down to the lowest possible setting, which seems to have cured the worst of it. Still, even on the lowest detail setting, the graphics and sound are the most mind-blowing I have *ever* seen in a first person shooter...nay....in a game ever.I'd like to say that Doom 3 is a bit of a departure from it's forebears, Doom 1 and Doom 2 (which was a Doom 1 clone which added new maps and a double barreled shotgun. That was the only difference). Actually it feels like the boys at iD, in an effort to increase the play value, added a few elements from other games in the genre, specifically AvP2 and dare I say it...I sense a lot of System Shock 2 in this as well. The atmosphere is incredibly spooky. The plot revolves around your character, a no-name marine, who gets transported to Union Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars research base. Along the way we're introduced to the other 4 big characters of the game; Sgt. Kelly, your CO, two corporate goons from Earth, Swann and Campbell, and the UAC Mars research leader, a creepy dude named Betruger with milky corneas. Your first mission is to go retrieve a rogue scientist deep within the bowels of the UAC compound and it is when you finally get to him the game really begins. Most of the base personnel become \"possessed\" and transform into zombies bent on finding you and presumably eating you. Yuck.The game ultimately leads you on a wild chase. Betruger, who is somehow controlling this wild turn of events, is being pursued by Swann and Campbell, whom you catch brief glimpses of from time to time. Always one step ahead I would find myself shouting at the monitor \"Hey! wait up!\" whenever they ran by. The game brings out a whole lot of paranoia as you play. Suffice it to say that survivors on Mars are very rare and the rule of \"If it moves, shoot it\" is pretty safe. Keeping your link to humanity is your CO, Sgt. Kelly, who issues you orders via a series of video linkup displays and your built in radio. I really like this aspect of the game as it helps reduce the *overwhelming* loneliness of the game as you in essence spend so much of your time surrounded by flesh eating zombies and fire-throwing demons hell bent (pun intended) on killing you. An interesting addition is the PDA, which you use to keep track of tons of archives gathered from slain workers of the UAC complex and stores access codes for you. This particular nuance I feel must have been lifted *directly* from System Shock 2, where a similar device was used to listen to audio logs of fallen comrades.The game is really creepy. iD Software didn't pull any punches with designing a foreboding atmosphere with this game. Hissing vents, bloody walls and floors, bodies strewn all over...the game wants to make you feel alone, and succeeds with panache. The weapons selection is premium, and I find myself able to use most of the weapons I acquire with great regularity. The shotgun will become a mainstay as the ammo supply for it is seemingly endless and it does great damage up close. The plasma gun is a thing of beauty and will make you feel all powerful as you use it. And of course the immortal chainsaw...I went all the way through the recycling center using nothing but it, and it made me feel like a Norse berserker!And now the cons: The chaingun is powerful, but something of a letdown. You need a whole lot of space to use it, and the cramped rooms and hallways of the base just aren't conducive to it's use, or that of the seldom used rocket launcher. Further the chaingun eats ammo at a horrible rate...if you use it exclusively for one level you'll have to stow it for another 3 before you get enough ammo to really use it again. Dittos for the beautiful machine gun, which unfortunately eats ammo like popcorn.Naturally the game being so dark there would need to be a portable lighting system with which to navigate your way through. iD gives you a flashlight. On paper this sounds good, but in reality it's a terrible tradeoff to force on the player. See your enemy vs. shoot at them blindly. The designers made the flashlight have an alternate weapon ability, basically you can bludgeon your enemy to death with it, but this also works better on paper. You're more likely to beat an Imp to death out of a panic attack rather than on purpose (it is possible..I did it during just such an attack) but it's certainly not recommended. Were there a way to put in night-vision I'd find that a whole lot better. The base layout is both brilliant and confusing at the same time. At no point during my playing of the game did I think \"Wow...I bet the employees never get lost here\". And my God, the hallways become extremely draining...there's so plagued many of them! You can go through an entire level and only ever see 4 rooms...the rest of it is an endless series of hallways. Why is every human character in the game bald? Why did UAC put so many hidden compartments in the walls? So many unanswered questions.Still the game even finds time for a little humor too. For a good example of this view the \"Safety\" video from the Recycling Plant, which calmly explains that the two major dangerous byproducts of the refinery are steam \"which is pretty much vented everywhere\" and \"Green Goo\". That and the references to Human Resources (gotten from the room where you move the barrels around with the crane) had me splitting my sides, unexpected in a game like this.Overall I give this baby 4 stars. A definite creep-out special that will have your skin crawling with each hiss of a steam pipe. In the near future I'm upgrading my machine, primarily to see what this game looks like when it's jacked up to maximum detail. If it's low detail look is any indicator I think I'll be in for a huge treat. Great game that will have you spooked out and begging for more!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2005"}

We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

Oppressively dark and not in a fun way. I started to wonder why they even bothered with all the graphics at all. Then I found some mods to \"tape\" a flashlight to my gun and to modify the cfg file to brighten things up a little. (Unfortunately, the side effect was to cause heavy banding in the shadows.) I then forced myself to finish the game.Overall, I was suprised at how easy it was. I'm not talking about the reflex shooter aspect, but how non-challenging the game itself was. It was mostly just running as fast as you could gathering mostly useless PDAs. If you removed the enemies, there would be nothing left. At least most other games have an interesting story, however light weight, backing everything up and maybe a few mental challenges.Despite all this, I enjoyed the middle of the game enough to make me really debate whether to sell it on eBay or wait for the upcoming expansion.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2005"}

I know I'll be in the minority here, but I don't think this one is as good as the first Lego Batman.  The controls and camera are more frustrating than any other Lego game I've played (in the Metro section where you have to glide with the Bat Suit, it should be a 1x thing but it took me a good 60x because of the problems between glide, jump, and the camera).  Also when you control Superman out in Gotham City it's really frustrating.  You look around normally with the right stick (which cannot be inverted, which to give credit to TT and their great Lego games I normally won't even play a game without the option to invert look but I'm slogging through this with tremendous regret), but then when Superman flies look changes to the left stick...it's clumsy.  Also the lack of online coop is a big negative.  TT says no one used it when Lego Star Wars had it, but I'm not sure about that.

{"product_name":"B000VJRU44","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"All About Motion","reviewText":"When Nintendo came out with the Wii a few years ago, it gave gamers a whole new appreciation in the way we actually play video games. With games like Super Mario Galaxy, Wii Sports and Super Smash Brothers Brawl, gamers of all ages have shown a great interest in the new ways we play video games. But, Nintendo has taken that motion gameplay worldwide with a whole new level with Wii Fit. Unveiled at E3 in 2007, it really showed a new method of the way we can use our bodies to flex and stretch in new shapes and forms to balance ourselves into a better fit life, and a whole number of great activities that are really more than meets the eyes, and might.Wii Fit for the Nintendo Wii is one of the most exciting titles to come out for the system this year. The gameplay is more about the motion and abaility to test you shape and movement of your body. You will work with a virtual trainer either male or female, who will help you guide your body to the better future you desire. There are activities that range well from simple aerobics and exercises like Yoga, push ups and Pilates, all the way to more aggessive activies like jogging in place through a run through the park. But, the minigames that you unlock along the way really bring out more of the challenge with the sensitive motion of the Wii balance board. The minigames range from line dancing step aerobics, all the way to balancing on a tightrope walk on a high wire, all the way to simple exercises like table tilt which is actually much easier to master by tilting your body to get the ball in the hole, without causing it to fall down.As I found out, trying the Wii Balance Board out at the Nintendo World Store on May 8th in New York City, the balance board is very sensitive to all your movements, so its takes percise accuracy and timing to master through some of the activites in each of the games like the Ski Jump and the Downhill Ski course. If you move too fast, you might lose points whther blocking a soccer goal or balancing to the top. The graphics look great and appeal very well with the gameplay, as well as the music to the game which is simple and elequent to the gameplay. Sadly, there are a few disadvantages to the game. The first is that the Wii board is extremely sensitive, so much that you can't even have your shoes on when playing the games, and could damage the Wii Balance Board. A second disadvantage is that the battery life for the balance board takes so much energy, that you'd have to constantly recharge the battery in the balance board.While Wii Fit does have a few errors, it is definitely proof that Nintendo really has made a whole new way on how we play video games. Wii Fit is very challenging for all gamers young and old and works pretty good addition to your Wii video game library. While I honestly wish the game could've cost a little bit less, the game it really worth the weight.Graphics: B+Sound: BControl: C+Fun & Enjoyment: BOverall: B 1/2-","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2008"}

The artistic direction of Muramasa is amazing, difficult to imagine this game can look any better than it already does. Muramsa is a 2D hack and slash game that plays similar to the Nintendo DS Castlvania games with some minor RPG elements. There are two playable characters, each with their own unique story and epic boss encounters. Each characters's tale will take about 6 hours to complete but I have already spent over 20 hours on my journey to collect every sword, complete every challenge zone, and unlock the alternative endings.Muramasa has a great story, heavily rooted in Japanese mythology. It is a gorgeous game influenced by the legendary Japanese artwork of Hokusai, images like The Great Wave off Kanagawa appear in the game in motion.My only minor complaint is the presentation of the game's story, it is told in exposition form before and after boss battles, which can interrupt the pacing of the game. Backtracking is another minor issue but becomes less of a factor as the game progresses due to a couple of teleporting options that become available.The biggest complaint I have heard about the game is that it is repetitive, this can be true to an extent but not any more than any other solid action game, and only if you choose to play the game on easy (Muso mode) without learning all the combat controls available. The game is a lot of fun and I disagree with the receptive critic, especially if you choose the more difficult Shuro mode, which forces you to be more tactical.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2010"}

I asked for the Genesis  and when Christmas time came I got an original Sega Genesis system with a built in headphone jack and it came with this awesome new(at the time) game called Sonic The Hedgehog. It reminded me of 1985 when the classic NES system came with Super Mario Bros. Much like that title it set a new standard for platform video games with it's fast paced action,catchy yet quirky music and great controls (A,B and C buttons all made Sonic jump the D pad moved him around and that was about it).Like Super Mario World, Sonic The Hedgehog was an instant classic but in terms of originality and fun Sonic was even more revolutionary.The levels were all colorful and easy such as the beautiful Green Hills and Starlight Zone plus the brilliant Scrap Brain levels, but like another reviewer said the best part of this game were the special stages.

I, like so many of us die hard PC shooter addicts loved Far Cry and was waiting for this release. Heck, I pre-orderd this from Amazon in the Summer!!!  And boy, what a let down.The first part I felt like I was replaying Far Cry, maybe an updated version, but the same basic island setting, similar weapons, vehicles, etc.  Then I got into the tank battle part, and this was highly derivative of the hover tanks in Quake 4.  I kept spacing out and thinking I was in Quake 4.But then, I got to the middle part, where you're inside this mountain, and it was blatant RIPOFF of Prey.  The whole thing.  Floating in this 3 dimensional space, no gravity, similar type gameplay, and hugely pointless.  There was no story.  It was just a pain to get through, cuz nothing really happened.  You shoot these things.  Then nothing.Then I got to the ice planet part, and this was somewhat interesting, for the first 3 minutes.  Then it too, became boring and repetitive.  Hugely so.  The flying blue things are totally annoying.  The weapons are simply lousy, even the alien weapon is basically useless (it overheats in like 4 seconds and doesn't actually kill anything that quickly)All in all, what a huge letdown.  The Crytek guys spent lots of time on the detailed environment that they became famous for with Far Cry.  And the first part was similar.  The nanosuit was somewhat novel, but it too ends up being useless because it runs out of power every few seconds.This is not what I had hoped for.  I made it through the game, but I'm not sure I'll go back for another run through.  Just too boring and repetitive.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2007"}

{"product_name":"B002I08RA0","description":"","reviewerName":"Vynny \"Vynrod\"","summary":"Ezio redeems himself!","reviewText":"The last Assassin's Creed game got a royal roasting from me in my review. Not because it was a bad game per se, but because of the decisions the designers made towards the end of the game - the locked off cameras, the cruelly timed running missions, the Apple that takes away your health to use, not being able to summon your fully trained assassin's for no valid reason, and Desmond's very tedious parts etc. So I was very worried that AC:Revelations would follow in the prequel's footsteps.My initial impressions going into AC:R were not good and that fact bolstered my fears that I'd be ultimately disappointed. The opening tutorial levels and Desmond's beginning bits really do go on for far too long. In fact according to the game stats I actually entered Constantinople and was finally able to free roam one hour and forty minutes after starting the game. That's nearly two hours of silly Desmond in Lost/tutorial levels/horse and cart/tower defense practice that really has no relevance to the actual game. Not a good start at all.Thankfully after that it was pretty much pure Assassin's Creed bliss. The apple, although it makes an appearance, is not seen in Constantinople's free roam and for the most part you can go through the huge city upgrading, discovering, buying and performing side quests without interruption. Sure some of the more frustrating aspects are still here that have plagued the franchise since the first game. For example, missions where you can literally desynch one second after starting it because you went in the wrong direction, missions where you have to follow someone on the rooftops in an insanely small amount of time or missions where you walk for a second then see a cut scene then walk for a second, cur scene, walk, cut scene and so on. These missions are very few thankfully and nothing was insurmountable.The main location is, as expected a joy to behold. Whilst it doesn't sport large open spaces as see in Brotherhood, it does have distinct locales and amazing architecture. The atmosphere created by this game is in my opinion better than any other game currently available. The markets, the shiny domes of the temples, the passing of time and gorgeous water effects all blend together to ensure you really feel like you're there. Special mention must be given to clothing, it's amazing especially in the real-time cut scenes that are shown. If there was a gaming Oscar for wardrobe then AC:R would win hands down. The music should also get a shout out as it too adds so much to the environment but does it so subtly. Sad to see that the codex element was removed though.The new addition of the tower defense element wasn't nearly as annoying as it seemed on paper. In fact aside from the opening tutorial I only did it twice and failed both times. Failure just means you have to retake the den by force so no loss in simply not bothering with the TD element. Why the devs felt AC needed a crude tower defense game is beyond me but as I said it wasn't a massive ordeal. Plus once you have a level 15 assassin trained in the den it can no longer be taken by the Templars so eventually the TD part of the game disappears.What is left is exactly what I wanted from an AC game - me, as Ezio (and sometimes Altair) sneaking, killing, stealing, upgrading and completing very inventive missions as the ultimate Assassin as an amazing story plays out.If you enjoyed AC:II and but felt the ending of AC:BH left a lot to be desired then this will win you back. Welcome back Assassin's Creed!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0010EI6T2","reviewerName":"eternal now \"roejoerrer\"","summary":"Rainbow Six Vegas Ver. 1.5","reviewText":"Lets be very clear; 'Rainbow Six: Vegas 2' is a very great shooter BECAUSE of the implimented cover system and the experience points system. WIthout these two things the game would be just another boring shooter. Sure, the tactical squad based commands are very neat, but your A.I team mates are so stupid that its easier to just take on the enemies yourself.I was never a huge fan of the original Vegas title, having only played it for about two weeks and making it through only about half of the campaign mode and a few online Terrorist Hunts. I can honestly say that Vegas 2 only marginally improves upon the original in terms of controls (Ubisoft added a 'run' button) and a slight graphical overhaul. Everything else about Vegas 2 is pretty much a mirror image of the original Vegas title.The campaign mode is fun, if only for a little while (once you play online the campaign becomes moot), but the A.I of the enemies and your team mates is really atrocious. Your team mates will face in the opposite direction that the enemies are, they will shoot walls, and they will act like idiots. Your enemies are no better, as they will sometimes stand still while you shoot them, or they will run into your grenades. Seriously, we are in the 7th (?) generation of video gaming, you would think that developers would have nailed A.I by now. I mean, these are supposed to be ruthless terrorists, yet they act like cardboard cut-outs most of the time. I guess I'm being a little harsh, since in practically every shooter the A.I is bad.As far as a storylines goes, I pretty much ignored it. That is to say I could care less about it because it wasn't that interesting. What more do you need other than \"Go here, shoot this\"? Sure, they try to incorporate Tom Clancy cliche's here and there, but for the most part I gave up trying to understand what was going on.The notable feature is the cover system (think Gears of War or Metal Gear Solid). This seemingly minor feature really changes up the game play. Since Rainbow Six is a First Person Shooter, a cover system really helps out the gameplay. Being able to sneak around and hide behind boxes, walls and doorways is an awesome feeling. I cannot even stress how important it is for a modern shooter to have a cover system. It should be standard by this point in gaming, but alas it is not.During the campaign you have the ability to commmand two team mates. You can have them move anywhere you want, breach a door way in a number of ways and disarm bombs. This is a fun feature, but since the A.I of your team mates is very poor and inconsistent, the implimentation of this particular aspect of game play can be pretty pointless at times.Another cool aspect of the campaign mode is the snake camera. Similar to the snake camera in 'Splinter Cell', you see what is behind doors before entering them, further adding to the \"sneaky\" aspect of the game.The campaign is somewhat short, but it does have its share of fun. Fire fights can get pretty intense, but there are no major \"WTF!?\" moments (think Call of Duty 4 Nuke scene). No, the real meat and potatoes of this game lies in the online portion. There are a variety of modes to choose from, you can either go at it solo in deathmatch or in Team Deathmatch. There are also different variations upon the team deathmatch (some protect the leader/kill the enemy leader game type). By now, in our 7th generation of gaming, these different types of deathmatch are all standard fare for a shooter such as this, but they are fun nevertheless. It is in the online portion of this game that I truly fell in love. I cannot describe the feeling I get when I am sneaking around the map, searching for camping enemies; the sound of gunfire and grenade explosions erupting in the distance. It is such a rush.Another amazing aspect of Rainbow Six Vegas 2 is the experience point system. Similar to Call of Duty 4, you gain experience for every kill you make during an online match. Unlike Call of Duty 4, you also get experience for every kill you make during the campaign mode as well. You can also score points by how you kill as well. This is called the A.C.E.S system. Headshots go towards Marskman points, up close and personal deaths cout towards CQC (Close Quarters Combat), while grenade kills and breach-type kills count towards Assault points.Graphics - not so great. I mean, they are worlds above the original Vegas title, but in comparison to games like Gears of War or Call of Duty 4 or Bioshock, the graphics just look dated. Come one Ubisoft, why are the graphics so bad?Well, I would highly recommend Rainbow Six Vegas 2 because I think it is a very fun and highly engaging game online. The campaign is lacking a little and the graphicals are certainly not up to snuff, but there is much enjoyment to be had here.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2008"}

Yep, you press keys and things appear on the screen, very much like what I'm doing right now with it.Generally, this is a very good keyboard. I have no huge complaints. However, there are a few niggling issues that should be brought up.1.) There's no stand on the back of the keyboard, so unless you like very flat keyboards, stay away.2.) There's that nasty reflective plastic used around the number pad attachment and the arrow keys. It gathers scratches pretty easily, so be careful with it.3.) The normal small alphabet keys make a satisfying enough sound when you press them, but the larger keys, such as the space bar, enter key, shift keys etc sound VERY clacky and cheap. The space bar in particular is very distracting in sound. Definitely not in the same league as the Logitech DiNovo keyboards.4.) The macro keys take some getting used to. I question their use only because Microsoft is bound to replace this attempt with something in the near future, and then you'll be bound to learning another new macro configuration if you choose to upgrade. If you buy this keyboard and no others, then ignore this point. :)But there are things to like!1.) Very easy to switch the number pad to the left or right of the keyboard, and installing it takes just a second. Snaps right in!2.) The light-up keyboard is quite fun, and not blue, most importantly. Red is fairly easy on the eyes, and blue is a very harsh color, so be grateful Microsoft were smart about this.3.) It works with a Mac! No, you can't program the macros since there's no software for the Mac, but you can use pretty much all the other keys, including volume up/down, play/pause/next track/previous track etc in iTunes!

The improved reaction time you have with the Wii-mote (as opposed to the analog joystick) makes the game MUCH easier than it was on the other systems.
