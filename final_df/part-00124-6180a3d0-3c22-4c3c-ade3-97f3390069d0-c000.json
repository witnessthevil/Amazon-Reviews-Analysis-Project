{"product_name":"B00004YUWA","description":"Icoweaves the tale of a young boy trying to escape his  imprisonment in a large, vacant castle. Along the way, he discovers another  captive--a beautiful princess named Yorda. Players control Ico with the goal of  escaping the castle with the princess safely in hand.Although it looks like an adventure game and has some rudimentary action  sequences, Ico is mostly about solving puzzles. Players will run, jump, and  climb their way through the gargantuan castle as well as figure out which  objects and environments are interactive. Yorda is very much a damsel in  distress, and isn't nearly as capable as Ico. A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike. The  ambient soundtrack and simple controls let the player focus on the tasks at  hand. Sony has crafted a very unique game that anyone can play. Few games are as  elegant in their simplicity as this puzzler from Sony.--Raymond M.

ICO, a mysterious boy, has been expelled from his village to an isolated castle. Within his confines, he begins to have eerie dreams of rescuing a young princess from the evil spirits that dwell within the fortress. Blurring the lines between fantasy and reality, ICO embarks on a quest to save the princess and along the way, discovers his own cryptic fate....The story is good not great.  Anyone looking for action, look eleswhere, because this game relies heavy on puzzle solving.  There is a tid bit of action but nothing to fancy.  This is a game for the puzzle crowd, how to get to point A to B, that what's this game is all about.  It's up to you, Ico, to make passage ways for the princess, who by the way lack that much agilty.  You will only be cheating yourself and also be throwing away your money if you have a cheat guide, its much more enjoyable if you accomplish something on your own.The gameplay is solid for this type of game and never feels like you do the samething twice.  The graphics are good and the atmospher and animation is something to be seen.The only complait I have is in the replay value and length.  It last about 6-7 hours and once you complet it nothing changes so that is cut in half.  Other than that it is a good solid game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2001"}

I loved the first Smackdown games, and figured the next generation on PS2 HAD to be fabulous...but now that I've had the game and played it for awhile, I can see where they were coming from.First off, the game is graphically beautiful...the only exception perhaps being the 2-D crowd, which looks pretty silly when your character goes into the crowd to fight.  Entrances are true to what you see on TV, and the music &amp; videos on the TitanTron are fabulous.  The create-a-wrestler mode is big, with tons of options, even some you need to unlock.  There are dozens of game modes including Royal Rumble, which can now handle around 8 in the ring at the same time, and Hell in a Cell with tag-teams, fatal 4-ways and even a 6-pack type match...it rocks to climb to the top of the ring and fight or jump off, and pancaking Tazz through the top of the cage was awesome!!!  The many other modes are great, and will provide variety in gameplay.The Story mode is the 'main' part of the game...you pick a character and guide them through to the title.  Trouble is, the title is usually only 2-3 matches away...too short.  A career/season mode would do better.  You can walk around the arena at certain times, but this is generally pretty pointless as you usually are just looking for a tag team partner, and once you find one, nobody else is around the building, giving you nothing interesting to do.Controls are not that great, as trying to find a specific opponent can be rough.  You can attack your partner or the ref, and you will frequently do this accidentally during a match because you can't quite tell who you just scrolled to.  In matches where you have multiple opponents, this can cost you the match as you could get squashed by your true opponent while trying to find another.  Personally, I often find myself launching a simple kick or punch when I think I'm close enough, then wind up missing altogether and getting nailed...perhaps it's a perception problem on my part, but this adds to the frustration factor.Commentating from Tazz &amp; Michael Cole is ok...repetitive and pointless often, &quot;(Fill-in-the-wrestler's name)...is different from other superstars&quot; and other pieced-together phrases don't make much sense, but I learned to ignore the commentators after awhile (ps - Tazz does commentary for his own matches).Overall, this game entertained me, but won't have the shelf life it could/should have.  The create &amp; exhibition modes somewhat make up for a lackluster Story mode, but you can only have so many meaningless exhibition matches...good for multiplayer games, as a one-player will wind up collecting dust after a few weeks.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2001"}

Then came a couple sequels and now we've got this, Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures! Yes, the little man in the plastic fedora has come to join the fun!And what fun it is! Though by necessity smaller than Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, and lacking a level based on Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (which I liked, even if no one else did), this game still delivers all the fun, laughs and challenges one would expect of the Lego games.Though the game is rather short, only eighteen levels, and they aren't especially challenging, though some of the puzzles take a little effort, there's enough items to collect and characters to unlock that you'll keep going for ages until you finish it off.Best of all, this is one of those rare, great little games that can be easily enjoyed by adults as well as children. In fact, with the really good two-player co-op mode, it's actually a good game for parents and kids to play together.So saddle up, get your staff of Ra, and give this game a go!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2009"}

The genre of first person platforming is one that has barley been touched at all, especially in an era of games that emphasis shooting like John Woo, and Micheal Bay-esq explosions.Jumping seems like such a foriegn concept to most games today, but ME keeps it fun and simple. For controls, one button is assigned for any upward movement (jumping, climbing, etc) and one button is set for downward movements (slidding, skidding, ducking). The premise is simple: in a world where the 1st Amendment is gone, and news is super censored, one woman (named Faith) must clear her sisters name by finding out who is the infamous cop killer. In Faith's world of corrupt politics and information, you have to find out the truth by city jumping. ME puts you even more in Faith's eyes when you see her arms pumping while sprinting, feet flailing in mid jump, and air rushing by Faith's ears. Small details go a long way into player inclusion.The cities colour palate consistes of a small, but symbolic, set colours. Bright and vivid reds, oranges, whites, blues and greens fill the city up with life. Set pieces are grand and memorable also. Wether you're sprinting through the sewers, empty offices, roofs or elevator shafts, the sets are extremly detailed. You can admire the detail up close while constantly spatter yourself on the wall to. ME focus' on fast paced momentum, but the paths often branch off, giving you one correct path, and 4 wrong ones. ME uses red objectes illustrate the correct path to travel, too bad the red objects only show up when the path is blatently obvious, leaving most of the game to be a frustrated frenzy of trial and error. This becomes an all to common occurance, escpecially once the dead ends result in Faith getting shot, splattering on the pavement, or the player becoming extremly annoyed.Even better yet (sarcasm) is when the seemingly \"right path\" takes you to an awkward combat encounter. Combat is a simple but tricky disarment. Simple as in one button to flip the bad guys over. Tricky as in getting 1/4 a second to do so. Even in the slo-motion mode, one simple mistake equals death and restarting over. Gun combat is even more harsh. Once you take a gun, it becomes a cumbersome piece of metal that cant hit any target unless up close. Even then, it still takes half a clip to kill someone.ME has good intentions, but I cant help but to think that DICE found a cool concept, and shelved it prematurly. When you know the right path, ME delievers a great experience that I havent see before. If you go slightly off track, or run into a dead end/police, there is no experience as frustrating as ME","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2009"}

The beauty of it is that there are times when you start thinking like a Runner and suddenly you're doing combination moves that you figured out an instant before you pulled them off:  the acrobatics are fluid and seamless and the environment does a good job of guiding you by sparse colors that light the next object you need in neon red.The downside is that when it doesn't work, it can be very, very frustrating.  Sometimes the combination you need to work to get out of somewhere isn't obvious, or worse yet, it's extremely hard.  You may land on a surface, only to have Faith keep moving and slide off the other side, unable to backpedal under the impetus of your jump.  And of course there are also \"duh\" moments where the \"wall-run\" button being the same as the \"jump\" button means if you're not spot-on, she does the wrong thing, and away you go into space.Which is the scary part:  knuckle-biting adrenaline moments where you just sealed your doom play out all the way to the crunch of hitting the pavement.  Being shot to pieces leaves you with a slow-mo falling sensation that will give you amusement-park vertigo and near-death-experience chills.  I put this down to simple \"oops\" mistakes, but one larger complaint that looms is that you are a skinny twenty-something in a roomful of heavily armored SWAT and police soldiers, some of whom are carrying belt-fed miniguns.  You are supposed to get a reward for making it all the way through the game without killing anyone, and I find it extremely unlikely, especially on the last level, that this is possible to do.  Even more so, you get a trophy if you can avoid getting shot--I simply do not believe that is possible.This game has been agony and ecstasy for me, and when I beat it I felt exhilarated.  If you are a high-energy gamer who has the patience to try and try again, you will find yourself rewarded.  If not, you should know ahead of time that there's no cathartic blasting your way out of trouble in this game.

I just thought it might be fun to try the newest version.The first version I played was the PS1 version, and that version closely resembles this.  Flaws and all. I also played the fan translated ROM for a NES emulator awhile ago as well, so I have played the NES version. The main flaw is the leveling system.  It's similar to what is now used in Elder Scrolls, but this older version has it's issues.  The main issue being the gaining of HP and MP.  If you had traditional leveling to gain HP and MP, then leveled weapons, armor, attack, magic power, etc while battling, then the system would have been an improvement.  Instead all of the stats are raised by battling.  So to raise HP, just take damage.  The easiest way to do so is to fight weak enemies and just hit your own characters with attacks.  Seriously.So boring level grinding system aside... the game is pretty amazing.  We finally see the first final fantasy that really had a true story.  The ability to customize your characters, while flawed, still adds some variety.There are some issues that newer gamers will find intolerable.  Such as wandering a little farther from town might result in running into uber-strong monsters that will destroy your party instantly.  So save often!Graphics are improved, so that is a nice plus also.  Music has been remastered as well.It's one of the weaker Final Fantasy titles, but it's still a numbered Final Fantasy entry, so for true fans, it is a must play.  Especially considering so many of the newer RPGs are taking control, variety, exploration and customization out in favor of shiny graphics and intense plot and story development.

{"product_name":"B001IK1BJ0","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"My pick for RPG of the year","reviewText":"In the special features of the Lion King DVD, they mentioned how they felt they were the \"B Team\"; the team that's making that other movie whereas most of the concentration and excitement was on Pocahontas. I'm not saying Dragon Age is the B team and that it's going to eclipse everything but it's kind of weird to look at Dragon Age: Origins in that in a little over 2 months we'll be getting the highly anticipated \"Mass Effect 2\" which many people are saying it's going to be Game of the Year for next year, let alone RPG. Strange analogy to compare to M-rated RPG's to kid friendly movies but I bet a lot of people are looking at this game as one of 2 things: they're excited for it if it only weren't for Modern Warfare 2 being released the week after or the second thing which is this is what will tide you over till the big game comes out in January. Well what a surprise to find that it's actually a fantastic game and my pick for RPG of the year. Why not Demon's Souls? Mainly because this game is actually fun to play whereas the other game is fun but the learning curve might make people just give up right away. When people talk about getting their 60 dollars worth well there's more than enough content here to justify the price so it's definately worth checking out.Story: In the kingdom of Ferelden, an event known as the Blight happens which threatens the whole land when creatures known as darkspawn rise from the ground and wreak havoc on the populace. Ancient, highly revered warriors known as the Grey Wardens have been the defense against this danger, even when a creature known as the archdemon arrives on the battlefield. You can play as one of 6 origin stories which range from the son of a king, an elf who uncovers a mysterious mirror or a mage living in a tower practicing their magic. Eventually you'll meet party members who'll aid you in battle as you gather your strength and numbers to vanquish the Blight and the darkspawn.Graphics: A commmon thread on message boards is \"sign here if you think the graphics suck\". Well they don't suck per se but compared to other games, even in Bioware's catalogue, it might not astound. While from an art design standpoint the game's gorgeous with some really cool and even stunning locales, the actual visuals themselves might underwhelm and I even notice the occasional hiccup such as textures that flicker during conversations and screen tearing but as someone who doesn't mind playing an old school Playstation or even Nintendo 64 game on occasion, the graphics never bothered me one bit. One petty thing is that the designs for the characters in the Sacred Ashes trailer look downright awesome whereas in-game they look off. Leliana, the redhead badass in the trailer, now looks almost...innocent and the guy with cornrows (Sten) looks oddly fatter in-game than in the trailer.Sound/Music: One thing you can't fault Bioware on is voice acting and here they are spot-on. From some great character work, especially by Morrigan (her VA also did Uncharted 2's Chloe) to general NPC's, very rarely do I find an outright badly voiced character and it's one of the few games that I actually want to hear the dialogue as opposed to Mass Effect where I'll admit I pressed X a few times to get to my dialogue selection bit. Music as well is awesome with some epic orchestral scores and if you got the Collector's Edition, the soundtrack's on the DVD (which can be added to your iTunes/Media Player via file copying). Sound effects in battle are alright though I love the loud boom you do when you do a Shield Bash.Gameplay: Now one thing I have to mention is I've never played Knights of the Old Republic so I can't say if it's similar but basically what this game is boils down to characters see enemy, press A to start attacking. But holding the Left trigger will bring up a radial menu where you can switch between party buffs, magic or special attacks, make potions, check your inventory etc. Your X, Y and B buttons can be mapped so they activate a specific ability you want with a second menu providing more space, giving you 6 quick access abilities. It's not a bad system and works fairly well though it can get chaotic during the battlefield with not only your 4 characters but I've ran into at least 7 or 8 other characters to fight. Taking a page from Final Fantasy XII is where you can set your tactics, or if you want \"if x/then y\" situations where character AI will automatically perform certain actions should you program it in. Example, curing if someone's low health, automatically turn buffs on but how about casting an area of attack spell if you have a certain amount of enemies bunched together? The benefit that FF XII didn't have is that these tactics are available to you right from the get go as opposed to being bought or found though your slots and how much tactics you can program is limited.Like any RPG you got to have customization and there's a ton in the game and it starts right from your choices as a dalish elf can have different conversations and most likely even quests not available to say a noble dwarf. One thing I will say is the the character customization, my bane of RPG's lately, isn't that bad though for some reason I still can't make people look how I want them to look. Past this you can specialize in a specific class such as mages opting to become a shapeshifter or a healer whereas warriors and rogues can have their own classes as well and then there's abilities which can involve general attacking, archery, whether or not you'll dual wield or just have a sword and shield combo. And how about customizing the quests? Indeed like in Mass Effect but moreso here, what you decide to say can influence the outcome of quests and characters so for example in the first town you go to (Lothering), there's some basically \"toll collectors\" who want you to pay money you most likely can't afford so you can decide to fight them to a point where they'll pay you and run off...but in a different run I said I was a Grey Warden and they just let me pass. And if you want to get your freak on you have 4 romantic options and figuring out how to get on their good side and subsequently them on your bed side is quite fun though keep in mind, try to romance 2 at once and you'll get confronted. So jealous, they are.For those interested, I got the Collector's Edition and this is just to detail what's in it: you get a cloth map (complete with unsnipped thread still hanging off the sides, a neat touch), a bonus DVD which includes a making-of documentary, trailers for the game and Mass Effect 2, the soundtrack and wallpaper for your computer. The big addition is 3 download codes: the Blood Dragon armor which sadly requires a high amount of strength to even wield so it'll be awhile before you can wear it, the Stone Prisoner quest involving recruitable character Shale as well as in-game items. It's a cool collector's edition but I just put this here since more people'll read the regular version reviews than the CE's, I bet.Does it have some flaws? Well aside from the aforementioned love-it-or-hate-it graphics, the game can get somewhat hard if you're not really paying attention and for those after achievements, Dragon Age, like Mass Effect, requires multiple playthroughs not just for the opening origins (Magi origin took me roughly 2 hours, rest were less) but you got to get not only the warrior but the mage and the rogue to level 20 and that might be awhile, in addition to 4 endings, 4 romance options and you better be in it for the long haul. If you are though, there is so much stuff to do in this game that it gets crazy. I don't know if it'll eclipse Oblivion's reported 200 hours but you never know. Question is, how thorough are you?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2009"}

The Online Contributors Make It Perfect","reviewText":"Gameplay is fluid and full of options.  There are not as many moves to choose from as the serires offered years ago, but there is still a huge list to help customize your CAWS or pro wrestlers.Divas cannot clash with superstars, which I think is absolutely stupid.  But the assortment of divas is not great anyway.  In fact, I would say that the superstars offered in this version of the game are more varied and fun to play than in previous games.  Including the DLC, there are some awesome legends like Macho Man, the Road Warriors, Demolition, Kevin Nash, Arn Anderson, Ricky Steamboat, original Kane, etc.  A pretty nice mix of legends and current stars, but still not enough for true fans.  Where is Andre?  Where is Khali?  Where is Piper?  Junkyard Dog?  Hogan?Well, the answer to that question makes this game perfect: Online!The online community has produced so many high-quality CAWS for players to download that you WILL run out of save slots.  Players from all over are creating the superstars THQ will not or cannot.  And the likenesses of most of them are incredible!  Yes, there are kids producing superstars that look more like halloween costumes than the wrestlers they purport to be, but other serious creations are lifelike down to the facial expressions pasted onto the CAW.  You can have Sting, Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, Tazz, the Dudley Boyz, Rowdy Roddy Piper, Giant Gonzales, Ted Dibiase, Kamala, Earthquake, Mike Tyson, Rob Van Dam, Matt Hardy, TNA wrestlers, Bill Demott, Japanese wrestlers, the Sandman, and MORE.  There are hundreds of well-made CAWS.  Not CAWS that kind of resemble the wrestlers--CAWS that look good enough to be a part of the line-up received when you buy the actual game!This game is truly saved by the gaming community's creativity.  If not for the contributors online, this game would feel like a well-made yet unfinished attempt.  Yes, there are lots of types of matches, but who wants interesting matches without interesting superstars to pit against one another?The ref is still getting in the way.  The targeting system is pretty good, though.  You shouldn't have too many matches screwed up by that little nutter butter.The weapons to choose from are not that exciting, but they have grapple options.  THQ could have been more creative with weapons.  More moves to choose from and more illegal weapon choices.  But that is not a big deal.A big deal is the lack of names and announcer-vocalized terms a player can use to create a wrestler.  THQ has obviously left out any word that could possibly be used to create a wrestler on Vince McMahon's doo-doo list.  That really leaves us out in the cold, because they KNOW we are going to try to create the wrestlers THEY FAILED to make.All in all, the game is smooth, fun to play, with controls that are not dumbed-down like that All Stars monstrosity.  The animations are lifelike.  Thanks to the players, the match-ups are pretty much the matches of your dreams.  BUY IT.  Pin it.  Into your XBOX.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2012"}

Racking up points as an objective were passe when Super Mario Bros was originally released in 1985 and it was the only game (from the original 17) released for NES that was'nt ported from the arcades during NES's launch.  There was nothing wrong with Excitebike, Duck Hunt, Street Brawlers, Popeye, Mario Bros, and a few generically titled sport games, but all eyes, ears, and hands were all on Super Mario Bros in 1985.

Then I heard that Nintendo themselves were going to be making improvements to the game, that's when I got excited. Nintendo handled Ninja Gaiden back in the day, and they know what to do with the series. The improvements they made are quite obvious and make for a much better experience than offered on the PS3 or 360. One thing I will say is that if you have the option, it may make things a little easier on you to play this with the Pro Controller rather than the Gamepad. It wasn't a big difference for me, but I know a few people who say they prefer that option. If you were disappointed in the PS3 or 360 offering of this game, then this could be something to redeem your faith in the franchise.

I've enjoyed every single one and actually have played them through more than a few times. The multiplayer in all of them have been extremely impressive. I'm probably one of the few minor people that aren't sick of the WWII games. I love them. I just hate that they all are the same exact thing. At least Return to Castle Wolfenstein took a different approach. However, Call of Duty has always been fun because it's not you, storming the beach or covering D-Day each time. They put you through many different eras and civilizations that battled in the war. I mean, it's not WWII because Germany fought America, right? It's a world war meaning there were Russians, Brits, and the cowardly French (sorry about that). Call of Duty pits you with all of them, even the forgotten Canadians. Each of the games have had the same \"feel\" and the same cinematic storyline. However, when Call of Duty 4's first big trailer hit the scene, I knew we'd moved onto bigger and better things. Modern warfare.Call of Duty 4 pits you against our current \"Nazis\" of the world: terrorist. While fighting, you take the lead of two soldiers in a more 'at-home' war in Iraq. One soldier is America and one is British. Both are in for a world of hurt. As far as the single player, there's always that sort of \"Aww, it's over...\" that I've had with the games. Mainly because I hate anything to end if it's really good. It's only a really bad thing when the thing you never want to end ends quicker than hoped or expected. Call of Duty 4 manages to keep your attention with it's quick gameplay and great story, but before you know it, it's all over after around 6-8 hours, even on Veteran mode. As far as the missions, they're very well designed but from a standpoint of what the Call of Duty series used to be, the missions seem shorter and more linear than before. There's a few missions that break away from the 'spray and pray' gameplay from the first few missions. For instance, one mission pits you in the seat of a gunship miles above the sky while you watch your team to safety, pepper spraying enemies with heavy machine guns and bombs. It's fun but with the constant commentary, the mission becomes a bore after a short time. One of the best missions is found in the middle of the game, where you are a very well disguised sniper following another sniper through a wooded area, taking our guard post and even laying perfectly still through a patrol of tanks and guards while they walk and roll right around/over you. It's the juice of the game. Don't get me wrong, the single player is something to be played, it's just you'll want more game after it's over, more than ever. It's probably a perfect experience for console gamers, but for some of us PC gamers out there, the game will feel more arcade-y than some of the previous Call of Duty games we're used to. I'd wished they had made the game for PC and ported it to console myself.Once you beat the game (or if you don't even want to beat it) you can load up the multiplayer, which in my opinion, is the meat and potatoes of the game. It's not only fun and addictive because of the gameplay, it's because the maps are so well put together and the ranking system. It's an amazing unique multiplayer. It's familiar, yet tweaked enough to be entirely new to some. The ranks go to level 55, which would take a good while to get to unless you play for a week straight. For the console owners, you get the option to cash in your level 55 badge for a special badge next to your name, however, sacrificing your rank and guns collected. But hey, that gives you a week more of gameplay to get all that stuff back. Unfortunately, this feature was left out for PC users. Why, I just don't know. The unique thing about the multiplayer is the rewards you get for getting kill streaks. A 3 kill streak will give you a radar scanner for 30 seconds. A 5 kill streak gives you a jet call-in to drop bombs on a selected area. A 6 kill streak gives you a personal helicopter that will just go around blowing everyone away. It's a new take on an old formula. Each gun is customizable in the Create-a-Class mode. You pick your weapons, weapons attachments, grenades, and then your perks. People familiar with Fallout already know what perks are but for those who haven't played one of the best RPG's ever, let me explain. A perk would be something benefiting you during combat. For instance, one perk is the ability to have more health, or have extra clips. There's a good list of perks you get to unlock, giving your multiplayer character it's own special ability. My personal favorite is Martydom, which when you die, you drop a grenade. It's the perfect revenge solution to the guy who just knifed you in the back while you were try to get a head shot with your rifle.Overall, I think Call of Duty 4 is one of the best games of 2007 hands-down. It's a great story, a great multiplayer game, and well worth the money. The guys did a terrific job, yet again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2009"}

{"product_name":"B001HWB68K","reviewerName":"Michael J. Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"Halo is reaching...","reviewText":"I've been a big fan of the Halo series, having played through all the campaigns up to Halo 3: ODST.  The challenge in storytelling has always been that Master Chief is a cipher, a stand-in for male power fantasies of invincibility.  He's not exactly a sympathetic character, and he really can't be - fleshing him out means ruining the connection between the myriad players who have walked in his suit. So it was a refreshing change when ODST veered off into \"normal people\" territory, following the exploits of Orbital Drop Shock Troopers (ODST) as the Covenant brings the war to Earth.What sounds good on paper isn't nearly as good in game play.  Where Spartans have regenerating shields and can jump super high, ODST get hurt, panting and moaning about it until you accidentally bump into a healing pack.  This becomes downright annoying after awhile, especially if you can't find a healing pack quickly.  It also has no relevance on game play, as your ODST is still fully functional despite his wounds.  In short, playing a wounded ODST in the campaign is an irritating experience.The other new feature is the ODST visor, which allows the troopers to see in the dark.  What it really does is outline different items and enemies according to their utility.  This alters player behavior by encouraging them to leave it on all the time and making a beeline for the highlighted items.  In short, the city of New Mombasa might be beautiful, but there wasn't much incentive for me to look at it.New Mombasa itself demonstrates how the Halo engine has not aged well.  Apparently everyone on earth drove three types of cars, lived in giant rooms filled with huge furniture, and never used a toilet.  New Mombasa doesn't feel lived in, and the cutesy sidewalk bots that chirp at you don't make it any less cold.  If there was an ever an argument for an upgrade to game engine, ODST is it.To make up for the generic blandness of Master Chief, ODST is populated with a cast of characters.  There's Dutch (Adam Baldwin), Mickey (Alan Tudyk), and Romeo (Nolan North).  You get to play all of these characters, but despite the occasional verbal aside, they are exactly the same.  As a player, you forget very quickly whom you're playing because it doesn't make one whit of difference.Then there's the squabbling leaders, Dare (Tricia Helfer) and Buck (Nathan Fillion).  It's a credit to the designers that you can recognize the actors by their CGI-rendered faces. The two have a love/hate relationship that progresses throughout the game, and their dialogue is a high point.  When they're both on screen you spend it as an anonymous character known only as Rookie.Just like Master Chief.Much of the game is a sniping battle, with huge environments requiring careful ammunition rationing.  There's no other legitimate style of play - brute force characters will get creamed and run and gunners will be sniped in the open environment.  Only the very last stage provides some diversions, including a tank battle, some dogfighting, and a battle underground.The multiplayer has many of the features now well established by games that preceded it like Gears of War. I played it a few times, but it was simply not the new Halo experience we all wanted.ODST looks and feels like what it was: an interim project that was supposed to tie into a movie that never happened.  It makes some half-hearted attempts to be different, but doesn't try too hard because hey, Halo Reach was coming out soon enough.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2010"}

I will review each game seperatly then make my comments on the collection itself.FF5: One of the previously unreleased FF games (at the time anyway) is now in America. I really like choosing classes because it does to raise the replay value through the roof. I literally trained my characters (this is during the between the beginning and the middle of the game) to get to level 30 or 40 (can't remember exactly) just to get my jobs mastered. the storyline is good as well because unlike some of the other FF games, this one sticks with the one you need to get rid of (X-Death) rather than fighting the final battle against someone that you have no clue on what makes that character so evil and why your fighting him/her instead of the one who is destroying the world. the bad thing about this game is the lack of characters (there's only 5 in the entire game, you stick with 4, one of them dies and is replaced with his granddaughter) so be prepared to look at the same 4 characters on the screen and also not having a menu to change characters.FF6: I think this is the best one in the series. there is absolutly no real \"Main\" character in this game. For those who are confused, what I mean is that, well for example, FF7 you have about 9 characters but the leader character is Cloud (the one you see and control in the fields in the majority of the game), well in this game you can have 4 different characters in your party and you have the ability to put in any character as the leader. The characters are excellent in this game, I pretty much like all of them (Gau is funny, but he doesn't have the best abilities and one of the secret characters you can't even control them at all during battle). Sabin having the Blitz ability. for those of you who have been playing fighting games for years will have a pretty good understanding of this but sadly when you make a move, no matter which direction your facing, you still hae to put in that same command in the same direction. for instance, one of the moves is RLR (I am talking about Right Left Right on the control pad) and if your character is facing to the right, then you have to insert that command, but if you are facing the opposite direction, it is still the same command (not the opposite combination). when I first beat the game, before beating it, I got all of the characters to level 99. This game also has some of the best music for a FF game (at the time anyway).the collection itself: you get a music CD, the random battle screen is like FF7 and 8's random battle loading screen, FF6 has a bonus menu for looking at stats on enemies, has CGI cinemas, FF5 is pretty much like the Super NES (or should I say Super Famicom) version with just the exception of Random Battle loading screens and PSone style Opening Cinema and no extra bonuses because the game was never released in the USA and Square probably wanted people to experience it without a huge bunch of bonus features.overall: If you like the SNES FF games, this is the right collection for you (Along with Chronicles which includes FF4 (FF2 in the USA for the SNES) and Chrono Trigger)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2006"}

It was fun at first, felt like a time machine going back to when I would stay up all day and night playing D2, hearing my mom yell that my meals where ready. D3 is not the same experience (and not because I'm grown up and don't live with my parents) the addictive gameplay that was present in the first two is just not present in D3. You will have fun for a good 2 to 4 weeks depending on what level of difficulty you keep going for, but eventually you will get burnt out and the game just won't feel the same. I'd recommend just going back to D2 and playing that or buying it, you'll have much more fun and if you have never played the first two, before playing D3 just go back to though before continuing forward, and if you do proceed with caution.  Or just have someone get it for you as a gift, that way you don't waste your money.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2013"}

What an amazingly fun game!  I play a lot of FPS' and this one definitely stood out as memorable in many ways.  Here's my take;Pros+ Brilliant graphics, even by today's standards.  The Environments are lush and gorgeous and character models are top notch.+ Clever AI.  Enemies have no qualms about staying where they are and shooting you if you're in sight.  If they don't see where you're hiding they will come and find you.+ Good variety of weapons and gadgets to use throughout the game.  The binoculars were extremely useful and the guns all had a realistic feel to them.+ Plenty of vehicles to use (similar to what made Halo fun).  The various boats are especially fun to control.+ Open ended and expansive environments allow you to approach your objective from just about any way you want.  There are no invisible walls in the game either which really adds to the immersiveness of the environments.+ Great musical score.  Even though some of the tracks are looped and mildly repetitive the overall score is excellent in its entirety.+ Lengthy game campaign.  Much longer and engaging than most other FPS' out there.+ Gameplay mechanics are solid.+ Respectable voice acting.Cons- Story is somewhat contrived- Dialogue can be a bit cheesy at times- Land vehicles are tough to drive and have some control issues- Ending was completely anticlimactic.  I was extremely let down with how the game finished.- Some overly difficult parts, especially sequences with numerous helicopters or mutants.- Enemy sight distance can be a bit too long at times allowing them to spot/shoot you before you ever even see them.Far Cry is a gaming achievement and the developers should be commended for creating such a great FPS.  To get so much right and so little wrong in a game like this is a rarity.  If you haven't played it yet, don't wait any longer.  Pick up a copy and enjoy the FPS fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2009"}

This game, the way it looked, I didn't have much expectations, but I was surprised. Here is why.PROS.AWESOME SOT LIKE GAMEPLAY: This game goes back to the roots of Prince of Persia. Sands of Time trilogy (SOT) wowed me with running on the wall, jumping from ledge to ledge and reversing time type of gameplay mechanics. In this game they go back to the roots and give you more of that gameplay.NEW MAGICAL AND ACROBATIC ABILITIES: In addition to what mentioned above you get some new moves and magical abilities. Most notable of them all is to freeze water for given amount of time. Developers have wonderfully make use of this ability give this game a novel feeling. Freezing and unfreezing water with proper timing makes it very important to move from one part of the palace to another (Very difficult to explain in words, have to see the gameplay to understand it). In addition to freezing water you also have other unique abilities such as swift jumps, crow hooks and one VERY UNIQUE one. But I don't want to spoil much here.MASSES AND VARIETY ENEMIES: In this game they have made good use of next gen console processor power in enemy battles. Unlike previous Prince of Persia games where you had 5 or 8 enemies at most, in this one you will have 15-20 enemies (if not more) at the same time. While initial enemies will look the same, as you progress in the game, variety of enemies will appear that will require you to change your strategy in defeating them.POWERS AND SWORD UPGRADES: Defeating enemies will give you orbs and these orbs can be used to upgrade your combat and magical powers. You can make your attack stronger, life bar larger, have fire walk power, ice sword power, stone armor power, wind explosion power or you can increase the time to reverse time. Each one of these can be upgraded up to 4 levels. Personally I loved the RPG element they added to this game.DECENT STORY: Not much to describe here. Voice actors are good and the game has decent story. Don't want to spoil too much.LOTS OF TRAPS: To many of you, this may belong in cons section, but I personally like challenges. In addition to acrobatic gameplay, there are tons of traps in the game that requires you to successfully guide prince through them. To me this was very challenging but the fun part of the game.CHALLENGE ROOMS: After you beat the campaigns, you can attempt challenge rooms to test your skills. While there are not that many of them, they are better than nothing.CONS.FEELING OF CHEAPNESS: I enjoyed the game, but when I played it, I just can't help but to feel that this game was either made on low budget or shortage of time. Unlike previous prince of Persia games where artwork was the strength of the game, this game didn't carry out the legacy. Sure things look great in 720p resolution, but in terms of artstyle and graphics, it look similar to PS2/Xbox games.BOSSES: There are bosses in this game but honestly they are not impressive. I love the game with strong bosses, especially those who require unique strategies to beat. Unfortunately, the bosses in this game are not much fun and can be beaten using mostly the same strategies.SANDS OF TIME TRILOGY CONNECTION: According to developers, this game takes place between first two games of SOT trilogy. So I was really hoping they have some information on DHAKA or some sort of connection to him. But to best of my knowledge, they didn't. So somewhat disappointed.CONCLUSION:Honestly, if they had put some more money into this game and had not pressured the artists to release it along with Prince of Persia the Movie, I think this would be a five star game. Nevertheless, I loved it. I think if you are Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Trilogy fan, then you should definitely give this a shot, especially now that it is selling so cheap. Chances are you will enjoy it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2010"}

There are so many little things like this that smack of a rush job(resulting in an inferior game). Checkpoints don't consistently work causing some levels, particularly on Veteran difficulty, to become unreasonably frustrating and nearly impossible to get through. Enemies in the open can randomly become immune to gunfire and friendly AI randomly ceases to support you. There are much better games out there for the 360, so don't waste your time if you expect your purchase to work like it should.

{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"James Hunt","summary":"Classic Role Playing","reviewText":"Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is a 3rd person perspective, classic role playing game.  Character creation does not offer a huge choice of looks (as in the Elder Scrolls games) but is o.k.  You select male/female, 3 different \"classes\", your face (not a large selection but various hair styles, skin color, etc.), create your own name, assign points to attributes, skills, and feats.The game is not \"open world\" but is not totally linear either.  You have to advance the main story to open up new worlds to explore.  There is a wide variety of environments to explore.  In a few areas you are confined to \"paths\" but most places have a more open feel.As you play the game you accumulate a number of followers.  Two can be selected to accompany you at any one time.  The various characters include a nice mix of personalities.There are three different \"mini-games\" to serve as diversions:  a gambling card game, swoop racing, and defending your ship from attacking fighters.  They could have been done better but are o.k. as a change of pace.I have been playing older games as I don't have a high speed internet connection so can't play the newer STEAM games (and Windows Live, etc.).  I would highly recommend Star Wars KOTOR to any fan of role playing.  The designers definitely understand the genre.  There is a nice balance between exploring and fighting.  The graphics are not great but still work fine.  It reinforces what I've always thought - that characters and story are much more important than fancy graphics.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2013"}

However, \"Yoshi's Island\" is still one of the most challenging platformers ever made, throwing a whole swarm of tough enemies and long stages.It looks like a simple game. The childish story is about reuniting Mario with his brother, captured by a Magikoopa. Most of the action lies with Yoshi, who can hover in the air, throw eggs and pound the ground with his butt.But don't be fooled by the childish drawings. \"Yoshi's Island\" is tough as nails. Part of the challenge is attributed to Yoshi, who is almost invincible. He can take multiple hits without losing a life. However, whenever Yoshi gets hit, Mario is trapped in a bubble until Yoshi pops it to get him back.The true test of skill is to open up all the extra levels. Players can only unlock them by earning 100 percent in each level. This means that players have to get all the red coins, stars and flowers in the stage. And players lose stars after Yoshi is hit.Thus, the gameplay leads to some especially difficult situations with loads of enemies on the screen at once. The extra levels are the most hair-raising platform exercises. Yoshi sometimes has to navigate through loads of watermelon seed-spitting monkeys without getting hit.Sure, the music can annoy gamers. Baby Mario might irritate countless numbers of people with his annoying cries for help. However, the immense size of the levels feature some especially epic jumping sections that even Super Metroid cannot match. Players will enjoy every second of grabbing all the goodies to get 100 percent for each world. The cute graphics also soothe people's minds as they are desperately trying not to get hit.Super Mario World 2 is like a fast-paced trial by fire. It might cause people to throw their Game Boy down in agony, but they will still love every second of jumping and hovering with exact precision and timing. This game is a definite classic.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2009"}

Those two babies are Mario and Luigi. Suddenly, an evil witch named Kamek charges at the stork with top speed, snatching only Baby Luigi. Baby Mario falls toward Yoshi's Island and lands on Yoshi. Something else falls along with him. It's a map the stork used to find the babies' house. Since Yoshi can't figure out the strange situation, he decides to talk to his friends about it, completely unaware that Kamek's forces will stop at nothing to get Baby Mario. Will the two babies make it home?You control Yoshi, making sure nothing harms Baby Mario, swallowing enemies, and making eggs to throw at other enemies. In certain areas, you may find a bubble that lets Yoshi morph into a useful vehicle (for example, using a helicopter to fly over a big gap).  Every time you reach a boss level, Kamek enlarges a normal enemy and you have to find a way to defeat it, such as pulling down the pants of a boss, making him deflate from embarrassment.As for the replay value, there's plenty of it. With plenty of levels and the classic Mario Bros. game included on the cartridge, there's definitely something to bring Yoshi and Mario fans back for more.Enjoy! If you like this game, I also recommend Yoshi Touch & Go for the Nintendo DS. You can use the magic pen to throw eggs, draw clouds, and help Yoshi guide Baby Mario back home.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2006"}

You can bank with the R Button and tip down your nose while making jumps. You'll need all the control you can get, too, as you roar through the twists and turns ofF-Zero's 15 deviously difficult courses. There are four hover cars to choose from, each with its own strong points and weak points. Most beginners find the durability and handling of the Fire Stingray easiest to use (despite poor acceleration), but veteran players will often choose the more-balanced Blue Falcon.Strategy plays a big part in this speedfest. In this one-player racing game you will need to find shortcuts, elude hazards and snag power-ups if you want to beat your savvy competition. Keep an eye out for sand, land mines, magnets and other trouble spots, but always be ready to get a boost from a speed or jump plate. You'll earn one Super Turbo per lap, and part of the strategy is knowing when to use it.When originally released in 1991,F-Zero's graphics were light years ahead of most of the competition. It still impresses mightily, thanks to innovative use of Mode 7 scrolling that immerses you in the adrenalin-pumping action.Sonically,F-Zerois one of the best SNES titles.

Yes, this is a large claim, but one that can be explained in a single phrase: Next-Gen Freedom.Driver's heaven is a wide open worldIn Paradise City even cars can fly.View larger.Go for broke in 'Marked Man' Mode.View larger.Nothing is off limits, even head-on crashes.View larger.Start a race any time with 'Easy Drive.'View larger.Although theBurnoutseries&#146; over the top mobile action has been its calling card since it ignited audiences on the PS2 in 2001, and later on the first generation Xbox console,Burnout Paradiseis the first game in the series that has been designed specifically for play on Next Generation consoles. This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Jason","summary":"Taking Burnout formula and mixing it with a Sandbox Environment is a Winner!","reviewText":"Let me say right off the bat that I'm not a simulator racing person. I don't use a driving wheel and I like my driving games to be wild, crazy, fast and full of beautiful, unpredictable racing tracks. My favorite racing game of all time was Star Wars Episode I: Racer until I discovered Burnout 2.So naturally, when I purchased my PS3, I was very interested in getting the next generation version of Burnout. I found that this Burnout was very different. At first it seemed kind of fun, driving around, smashing things, eventually tried a few races, most were pretty straight forward, not too hard. But it didn't take too long until I was insanely frustrated because one small mistake, one wrong turn can lose you the race, and there is no \"start over\" button. This is because everything about this game is open world sandbox style. The races are such that you can pick your own route. For me, at first this meant a great amount of frustration, eventually it meant thrills and miles of fun. There is more than racing to be done here, there are stunt runs, marked man runs (you're getting chased by these strong cars that attempt to wreck you), burning routes and more.The one thing missing from the Burnout series is the incredible crashes where you would drive full speed into an intersection and just watch as your car crashed and caused incalculable damage. While Burnout Paradise has something called \"showtime mode\" where you basically have a controlled crash mode where you must cause the car to continue to bounce and cause a lot of damage, but it seems somewhat contrived and gets boring quite easily. My only other complaint is the crashing during race like events, you'll be driving and smashing with other racers and causing them to careen off course and crash magnificently, but if you hit some civilian-non-racer you'll end up in a pile of junk on the side of the road before you can say \"what the...\"Aside from these two minor complaints there is plenty to love in this innovative arcade racer that allows you to roam the entire city and country side of \"Paradise City\". There's plenty of signs to smash, parking garages to explore, lots of events scattered around the city, plenty of cars to earn, and races to win, shortcuts to find and lots of fun to be had in this bold take on the Burnout series. This is probably one of the best arcade racers you can find out there.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000R3BNHE","reviewerName":"Female Spy","summary":"Will You Have a Nice NiGHT?  (by Laura)","reviewText":"*Pelted with tomatoes over punned title* I'm sorry, but there are a lot of puns I can use with this game.  Some things in this game are just flat out ridiculous, but I'll get to that later.  I recently got this game for Easter, but I have my facts straight on it by now.  I'm new to the NiGHTS series, meaning I've never played one of her (I'll tell you why I think she's a she later) games on Sega Saturn, but that doesn't mean I don't know the character well.  How NiGHTS herself is related to Mobius (Sonic the Hedgehog's world) is still a mystery.  Is she, perhaps, part of Mobius' dreamworld?  Either way, she's made several appearances throughout the Sonic games (I'm refrencing Sonic Adventure DX and Sonic Riders for those who are curious); one of them claiming she's a nightmaren (In Sonic Riders, it says her board is made specifically for a nightmaren).  At the same time, she seems to defend Nightopia and be a Nightopian; but with REALA looking a lot like her (and being a Nightmaren), and the fact that the manual says she doesn't have a strong sense of righteousness...  I'm confused on who exactly she is, and who she is fighting for.  I ramble too much with her mystery; I'll do the cons and pros, in that order for this actual game.  Since I've never played a previous NiGHTS game, I will be unable to do comparison.  These are the cold hard facts as I see them.Cons:1.  Repetitious, Tedious, and Awkward gameplay.  This knocked my fun rating down to a three.  For a game that promotes dreams and flying, both things having to do with freedom, it puts a lot of shackles on you.  Missions, that you are graded strictly on, and time limits all inappropriately bog down gameplay.  There's a time limit on every level; and if you don't do what you're supposed to do by then, you get a \"Nightover\" (equivalent to a gameover.  I assume your character wakes up).  If that wasn't bad enough, other conditions (such as failing to rescue a Nightopian in time) causes the same result.  I was really looking forward to an expanse world where you could explore freely; but this is a game that just forces you to go from point A to point B.  The repetition is broken up a little by the different missions; but many missions are similar causing you to fly around seemingly endlessly.  When you're controling a human (Helen or Will) you can't defeat enemies; you can only stun them with blue chips and run!  There are ghost like things (which look suspiciously like Boos from the Mario series) called Awakeners that further frustrate the human end of the gameplay.  When the little clock runs out of time, they come after you in a herd (like ten to twenty of them).  If three catch you, your character wakes up, and you get a \"Nightover\" AGAIN!  Ugh, I should feel free in this game; but instead I feel like NiGHTS when she's captured by those dumb birds.  I'm in a prison cell and I can only escape from my prison temporarily before I'm locked up again; unlike NiGHTS, though, I can't find my keys to escape...2.  Repetitious themes.  The first mission of every world (so far it seems) is to rescue NiGHTS, who doesn't even do the slightest thing to defend herself from her captors.  Awakeners also appear too much and look a lot like Boos to boot.  Owl (who, yes, is an owl) likes to talk your leg off and slow down gameplay.  What owl doesn't these days?  This Owl also has the terrible tendency to say \"well\" and \"visitor\" far too much.  It reminded of Blathers from animal crossing.  While Owl's information is normally useful, a blubbering owl named Owl is nowhere near an original idea Sonic Team!!!  The least they could've done is give the poor bird an appropriate name (although a name like Blathers really isn't THAT much better...).  While were at it, look at NiGHTS' personality and compare it to Sonic's.  They're exactly the same!  Laid back, and likes freedom.  Sonic Team, if you must \"borrow\", don't do it from your own characters!  That's not all: the first area you go to is a fountain.  The Fountain of Dreams?  Sounds a lot like Kirby to me.3.  Weird things...  Small things can annoy me.  This probably isn't a new issue; but why in the name NiGHTS are all the letters capitalized except \"i\"?  As previously stated, a talkative owl named Owl is far from original.  On top of that, if you walk away while he's talking to you (if that's even possible) he STALKS you while finishing his thoughts...  That's creepy.  The concept behind dualizing is also creepy and reminds me of Dragonball Z's fusion thing (I'm not a fan of DBZ I just hear things).  Both human kids have the ability to merge with NiGHTS separately and become one with her; how this helps her temporarily escape her prison, I have no clue.  Speaking of which, you have to unlock three cages before NiGHTS escapes from one, and then you always have to battle a boss.  Why?!  Oh, and for the heck of it: WHAT THE BLAZES IS NiGHTS' GENDER?!  I tried reading the manual and it just uses her name in instances where he, she, or it ought to be used.  I used to think NiGHTS was a he (well, she never had a voice before now; and videogames usually favor male characters), but, by the sound of her voice, I have to assume she's a she or be a little creeped out.  REALA's gender isn't announced either, but his voice seems to be masculine; insinuating that he's a he.  If I haven't stressed it enough, the Awakeners bug the heck out of me.  Oh yeah, have you heard of the visible forces of your heart (like courage)?  There called Ideyas.  No, I'm not joking.  Everyone apparently has Ideyas.  You know what's worse?  It's pronounced very close to \"Idiot\".  I laughed.4.  My Dream isn't as good as I though it would be.  I'm just confused by it; and it seems like all you do is put things in it to rot or spare the lives of five creatures you like (you'll have to feed everyone else blue chips to keep them alive).  Apparently, time passes there while you're playing elsewhere...  If that's true, everything I haven't been feeding is probably gone.5.  The bosses are too easy.  Once you know what to do, it won't take long to beat them.Pros:1.  Interesting storylines.  Two kids, a girl named Helen and a boy named Will are having trouble in their lives.  Helen usually practices playing the violin with her mother.  Helen's dream entails playing in front of large audiences one day.  Lately, however, she's been more interested in hanging out with her friends.  Not allowing herself to feel the guilt of leaving her mother out, she begins to have nightmares at night; eventually finding herself in NiGHTS' world.  Will is a great soccer player who was taught by his dad.  He and his dad were always together, until his father had to take off in business affairs.  Now terribly lonely, Will started having nightmares; and he found himself in NiGHTS' world as well.  Both kids made it with the Ideya of courage, but lost all other Ideya to the nightmarens; who cause nightmares and are trying to destroy Nightopia.  With Wizeman as supreme evil overlord, and REALA as his loyal servant; can NiGHTS and the kids prevent good dreams and Nightopia from being destroyed forever?2.  Beautiful and various graphics both in and out of cutscenes.  It really does look like a dreamworld: the water and ice are clear and sparkly, the woodlands are well textured, and the beaches are pretty.3.  Enchanting music.  Sweet tunes emphasize you are in a dreamworld.  While possibly the best feature of the game, be warned that much of this music can stick in your head.4.  Colorful characters.  No matter how rip-offish and genderless they appear to be, you have to admit at the very least that they have depth.  They also have various personalities.5.  The controls aren't bad.  You can play in your favorite style; meaning you have a choice of wii remote and nunchuck, wii remote alone, or gamecube controller.  If you're just starting out, I wouldn't recommend the wii remote alone.  The controls seem complex and difficult at first, but there surprisingly easy to get used to; and you have a tutorial by Owl.  Controling the humans alone is also easy once you know what each button does.  The characters also move fairly fluentlyConclusion:Five cons, and five pros.  Whether the pros outweigh the cons I'll leave to you.  There are two player and Wi-Fi capabilities with this game, but I don't normally use those; so I can't comment on whether or not they're good.  Regardless of my vents, please note that I don't think bad of the Sonic Team; nor do I think they they violated any rights.  They've made many exceptional games; they were just having a wierd day when they made this one...  Overall, I think this game is worth a look at; you can get some potential fun and enjoyment out of it.  It's a gamble, however, and you might want to wait for the price to drop around thirty-five bucks, or rent it first; just to make sure it's a game you really want.  I, myself, have no regrets asking for it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2008"}

{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"Is this what Uncharted is becoming?","reviewText":"I started playing the Uncharted series by pure accident as the PS3 I purchased a few years ago included the first Uncharted game.  While it took me a couple of weeks to actually start playing the game, when I did play it, I was immediately hooked; it was one of the best games I ever played.  So when Uncharted 2 was announced and released you bet I bought this game almost immediately and again came away blown away by the game.  When Uncharted 3 was announced, I again was excited, but I didn't buy it right away merely because I never had time to get to the store.  In hindsight this was a good thing because I finally picked up the game from bestbuy.com for $29.99 on a Black Friday deal.  After playing and completing the game, I'm glad I paid $29.99 instead of $59.99.Uncharted 3 starts off with Drake and Sully negotiating with some thugs in a bar about the sale of his Francis Drake ring, when things go awry and you are immediately thrown into a bar fight style combat sequence as you try to escape.  The highlight of this fight is when you are attacked by a muscle bound steroid freak in the bathroom that is almost twice Drake's size.  Once you defeat him you escape the bar and your next adventure begins.The game started off well enough with what I came to expect from the Uncharted series, excellent plot line with a good mixture of stealth and action.  There was even a flash back scene from 20 years ago when a young Drake first met Sully.  After I completed the first 2 or 3 levels, I had high hopes for this game as I did with Uncharted 2.  Unfortunately the first levels ended up being the best part of the entire game.My main gripes come with the non-stop in your face action ala Michael Bay.  It is clear this game \"borrowed\" aspects from Modern Warfare complete with the ability to throw back grenades (which enemies seem to have an infinite amount of).  There are constant explosions and endless spawning of enemies out of nowhere, Unlike the first two games were many levels can be completed with stealth or no combat at all Uncharted 3 bombards you with non-stop combat and/or action basically the entire game.  You rarely have time to sit back and enjoy the ancient ruins Drake and Sully discover because you always have to defend yourself from 300 enemies at any given time.  The cruise ship level was absolutely terrible and frustrating because every second you are either falling through something for the 16th time, or you have to defeat nonstop enemies by yourself.  Remember that muscle bound steroid freak I mentioned earlier in this review?  Well if you forgot about him, don't worry; you have to fight the same guy no less than 8 more times during the game during very frequent hand to hand fights during the game.  Instead of coming up with original characters, Naughty Dog used the exact same character throughout the game.  The only thing different was the guy's race.  It is so obvious it is almost comical.With so much time obviously being spent on action and special effects, it seems very little time and effort were spent on the actual plot line and story.  Other than the first few levels, the story line is very poorly done with non-convincing voice acting.  Chloe and the new person Cutter are abruptly written out of the story after a while and you never hear from them again.  The character you meet in the end only has a handful of scenes, but you never really get the opportunity to fight by his side other than through yet another overdone Hollywood action scene.  There is so much going on it's as is the writers lost focus.  The story line itself is weak, and straight out of some SyFy movie.  Really guys?  Controlling the population through fear by infecting their water supply?  This has been used before in other games and movies, why not come up with something original?  Are you completely tapped out for ideas?As I was playing through this game, I was mainly focused on finishing the game instead of enjoying it, as I did with the first two games as it became so repetitive.  When I finally reached the end I was rewarded with a pathetic final boss fight and a weak ending.Personally I think Uncharted 2 is the best out of the three, and I wish that Uncharted 3 at least matched Uncharted 2.  Heck, I would be happy if it matched Uncharted 1.  Instead Uncharted 3 is a game that suffers from an identity crisis with a mishmash of overdone action scenes and a weak story line.  After beating the game, I came away disappointed, but relieved that I finally finished it.  With the previous Uncharted games, I played through the games twice, once to beat the game and find the treasures on my own, then again focusing on finding all the treasures.  But honestly, I don't think I'll be going back to play this one again.  Its worth completing I guess, but probably not worth playing again. I won't even try multiplayer, I hated the multiplayer in Uncharted 2, and I don't expect Uncharted 3 would be any different.  I've always played Uncharted for the single player only, and I don't expect that to change.This is easiest the worst out the Uncharted series, and if you are new to the Uncharted series, then I advise you to try the first two instead.  I sincerely hope this isn't the direction the Uncharted series is headed, if so it would be such a shame that a great series suffers a demise like this.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2011"}

Unfortunately what immense amount of fun I had at first dwindled where I noticed I was spending most of my time doing the same thing over and over again. Getting kicked for no mic, re-running through the same campaigns, Versus with moronic players or rage-quitters and a general feeling that the game wasn't exciting anymore. Literally a day away from being a full year do we get Left 4 Dead 2, a sequel many wanted but few expected so soon especially in light of the complete absense of Half-Life 2: Episode 3. I mean, Blizzard is taking awhile with their games but at least we get the occasional new trailer or class reveal, Valve is taking the \"we're not saying ****\" approach so I guess this game is supposed to be our placeholder until that comes out so how's the game? The slightly-changed phrase \"more of yet still the same\" comes to mind as Valve added a lot of more features to the game yet it feels like the last game, decomposing limbs and all.Story: Whereas the campaigns in the first game felt slightly disjointed, each campaign in this game seems to directly link to the next. The car you drive in the climax of the first campaign breaks down prompting the 2nd campaign or a rescue boat in one campaign's finale becomes your transport to the next. The new 4 survivors are Ellis, an auto-mechanic with wild stories about his buddy \"Keith\", Rochelle a tv news employee, football coach Coach and drifter/con-artist Nick and together they brave a freakish amusement park (\"ho.lee.****...it's Kiddyland!\"), a swamp, a town hit by a huge storm and a mall. The problem with the game's characters is that they kind of lack personality and whereas I didn't mind playing any of the previous 4, I would always beeline straight for Ellis for his hilariousness or Nick for his \"I just walked off the set of Miami Vice and I'm a badass\" vibe.Another issue I have in that it relates to the quick turn-around between the last game and this is that many campaigns are not completely perfect and they range from generic to awesome. Dead Center for instance has the most unique finale where you have to fill up a car with gas rather than wait for rescue but from that point on, every finale is the same ol \"wait for rescue\" schtick. Hard Rain, the highlight of the whole game, has a pretty cool first half till it becomes awesome in its latter half while The Parish has one of the more intense finales yet it's got an absolutely boring middle section. Almost feels like Valve would've had a stellar release if they waited a year to pool all their ideas except they just brought it out as quickly as they can which is a bummer.Graphics: Let's face it, the Source engine is in need of a replacement or a massive overhaul. While smaller things have been upgraded, on a whole this isn't a leap forward and zombie animations feel recycled, level design is still a bit too barren and devoid of any reality to it but then Valve hits us with improved gore, unbelievably impressive weather effects (Hard Rain) or atmospheric touches (Swamp Fever) but considering other companies like Naughty Dog or Ubisoft continue to make leap forwards in their graphics, the Source engine still looks like it's churning out the same graphics with a couple of tweaks. Oh and I hope you have a great internet connection beca.use. thi.s. thi.n..g wi..l..l la..g on yo...u. It literally lagged so much my entire Xbox disconnected from Live. But end of the day, a company like Bungie who goes from Halo 3 to ODST with not a whole lot of upgrades is apparently introducing a brand new engine for Reach so hopefully Valve is on their way with this too.Sound/Music: During the opening cinematic for the first Left 4 Dead, it completely set the tone for what was to come: freaky, possibly scary and it's still one of the most intense movie clips in a game. This game opens with a tone that might as well come with grindhouse-era film scratches and movie trailers because it's filled with guitar twang and while the music in-game does carry with it some horror stuff, they seem to be going for a more chaotic fun vibe than previously. Sound effects are again more of the same with the still awesome Hunter scream abound, the gurgling and bubbling of Boomers though I noticed Witches have a new crying sound and guns are fairly similar but I wish some guns had more kick. It's a shotgun damnit not some clicky pistol thing. Voice acting as always is strong lack-of-personalities aside and apart from Ellis, everyone does functional roles but they're not exactly endearing either. Nick for instance who apparently is one of those \"I don't trust anyone except me\" guys never really comes across as such.Gameplay: For the most part, it's the same. Guns don't have ADS (aiming-down sights) and you can only carry 2 guns at a time but there's been one change and that's the addition of melee weapons. Crowd control in the previous game mainly consisted of pressing LT to butt zombies away to get you a shot but now one swipe can literally down 4 zombies at a time so it becomes surprisingly invaluable to bring a machete or axe or even The Freeman's (said in a vortigaunt's voice) crowbar over dual-wielding pistols. The guns also had a bit of an upgrade so it's no longer just Uzi and Assault rifle but they also added my new fav, a silenced machine gun and even a grenade launcher. Carryable items have also added some new members included the teammate-reviving defibrillators, the boomer bile that you can use on enemies instead or ammo that can light zombies on fire or explode em. Nice. All in all it's a nice bit of additions that doesn't add a whole lot especially in light of the major additions found in Assassin's Creed II but still fundamental nonetheless.Left 4 Dead 2 adds some more modes as well as opposed to the first game's patch so we have standard campaign in either co-op or single player (don't bother, they're dumb as wood yet excellent shots), the familiar Versus where you switch teams to either make it to the safehouse or prevent the other team and the new Scavenge mode which I'll get to because I want to nitpick Versus for a tad. The problem with being an Infected is that while they're fun, the cooldown for abilities seems strangely a bit too high and more often than not I'm simply waiting around for an attack to regenerate before I can use it. I know it's meant to balance the game and not have boomer bile every 10 seconds but the wait for it to be re-used seems oddly long and the 20 sometimes even 28 or so seconds to respawn is just aggravating and as Yahtzee said, \"flow-breaking\". As for Scavenge, you play as a team to refill a generator with gas cans while the other team prevents them from doing so and team with most rounds won wins. It's quicker than Versus to trade places. Oh and I'd recommend playing with friends since I think it's the ability to vote makes this game a breeding ground for people to kick you for no apparent reason. Once I was kicked for actually incapacitating the rest of the team single-handedly (I guess they wanted something to do?). Hopefully the community will smarten up and not vote to kick because of some inane reason.Is the game worth a buy? Honestly no, the game is fun for awhile and there'll be some people that will indeed enjoy the game for awhile, the repetitive nature might just grate on you. Oh and this is an incredibly small and somewhat petty gripe but I hate the achievements are in caps. At least previously it was a nice \"Red Mist\" or \"Burn the Witch\" but here it's like \"THE REAL DEAL\" or \"SEPTIC TANK\". It just looks odd but again they're small gripes. The game isn't worth 60$ or 70$ if you're Canadian but it makes for a good Christmas present so consider asking for it instead of buying it yourselves.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M4","description":"It's often argued that Nintendo makes the best video games in the world,  but one thing the company isn't known for is scary games. If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster. While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C. Persia. And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"The Gamecube's most innovative title.","reviewText":"In a style more similar to \"Onimusha\" than \"Resident Evil\", \"Eternal Darkness\" is one of the Gamecube's most hyped game, and one gamers have been waiting forever for. I bought the game recently, and have been playing it almost non-stop. There are some pitfalls that gamers might encounter, but overall, it is a great game. Here is the breakdown:Pros:1. Details. I read somewhere that it took over 4 years to make this game, and you can see where the effort went. The various environments are very well detailed, and the animation is as fluid as they come. The sound and music add to the ambient atmosphere. Sometimes, the music is as insane as the visuals.2. Originality. The story line in \"Eternal Darkness\" is unlike anything I have ever seen. The idea being that you play several different characters in various points in history is something new to me, and it gives a new spin on what would otherwise be a \"Resident Evil\" standard hack 'n' slash.3. Gameplay. Whatever your skill with video games, this will give you a good challenge. In ED, you have not only to worry about you life meter, but your sanity meter. Throughout the game, your sanity wains the more enemies you cross. This alters your perception. This is an innovative twist. The controls are responsive and easy to grasp the first time playing. A fair warning: The action get pretty intense pretty fast, so be ready.4. Replay value. With 11 chapters, spanning a good 15-20 hours, there is a lot of reasons to go back. Actions and choices you make early on change the direction of the game, so you are guaranteed something different each time.Cons:1. Frustration. Even seasoned \"Resident Evil\" fans might find the puzzled a bit frustrating at times. To be honest, I didn't even get to the first chapter until I read through the guide. The clues are as cryptic as the puzzles sometimes, so some parts might be unreasonably hard. Much of the gameplay is trial and error, so a guide is recommended.2. The healing items don't recover much on the life meter, so sometimes recovering health is a tricky thing. This makes the game all the more hard.As you guessed, I really enjoyed this game, despite some moments of frustration when I had to double-back to find something I didn't get. Will you like it? Fans who like the ultraviolence of \"Resident Evil\", the puzzle-solving elements of \"Silent Hill\", and the real time combat of \"Devil May Cry\" will love this game. Gamers who want something more strait-forward probably will not.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2002"}

{"product_name":"B001D7T2VC","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"Zelda + God of War + DMC + Portal (MINOR SPOILERS)","reviewText":"I feel so very sorry for this game. Why? Because this is a great game, people just don't know about it. Even I didn't know about it until I played 60 min demo through Playstation Network (also available on 360). In demo they allow you to play through a whole \"dungeon\" (a huge level). Once I played it, I liked it so much that I had to play the whole game. Now that I have finished the game once, here is what I think about it.Pros.CREATIVELY DESIGNED WORLD: The thing that I liked the most about this game is it consists of 6 huge \"dungeons\" (huge stages like in Zelda games) connected with by a even bigger open world. Each of these dungeons is very creatively designed with plenty of puzzles (don't worry not boring ones). They can very from greenery filled open fields, destroyed towns, beautiful swamps, gothic towers, magma caves, deserts and more. Such variety in stages really encourages you to explore more and move forward in the game so you can unlock more stages. Just loved it.TONS OF WEAPONS: You start out with just a sword, but then you can purchase, find and unlock A LOT MORE short, mid and long rage weapons as you progress in the game (such as deadly scythe, gauntlet, revolver etc.). Furthermore, anything you see lying on the ground can also be used as weapon (Cars, pipe etc.). Also, certain weapons such as shuriken can target multiple enemies and objects. Their creative use is a MUST to progress through the game. All of these weapons can be leveled up and customized (by use or purchase) which adds a great RPG element to this game.INTRIGUING GADGETS: Other than weapons you will also obtain variety of gadgets in this game. Some of these gadgets are horn, grapple chain and a HORSE (YES THERE IS HORSE RIDE IN THIS GAME). There are some cooler gadgets that are unlocked toward end. Really don't want to spoil it for you, but if you want a hint look at the title of this review. Creative use of gadget is required to progress through the game.INTIMIDATING BOSSES: Each dungeon has a mini bosses and when you get through the whole dungeon, you are presented with very imaginatively designed MAJOR BOSS. Let me tell you one thing. These bosses are no push over. Beating them takes combination of skills and creative thinking. I personally enjoyed battle with each of them (almost all of them, except one).DIVERSITY IN ENEMIES: A lot of heck and slash these days have the same looking enemies from the beginning to the end. Fortunately, this game offers variety of different enemies. When I speak diversity, I am not taking about size, shape and color, but also strategy required to beat them. If you just go around button mashing, you won't go anywhere. A lot of these enemies require you to dodge, block and perform certain stunts (for example light your shuriken with fire and then hit them with it) to critically hit them.FANTASY NOVEL LIKE STORY: While all may not enjoy it, this game has a deep, unique and suspenseful novel like story. You have angles, demons, guardians and what not. I would describe more, but don't want to spoil it for you.AWESOME VOICE ACTING: While the central character is a bit dry (for a reason), all the others have done wonderful job (especially a character that is your colleague). I don't know the particular names, but some Hollywood grade actors are doing voice acting, so you won't be disappointed in this area.CONS:FEELS LOW BUDGET AT POINTS: While the most of the game looks gorgeous because it is competing with games such as God of War 3, at points it will feel cheap. However, don't get me wrong, for most part it will amaze you.DIAPPOINTED BY FINAL BOSS: While all the other bosses are SPECTACULAR, the final boss was somewhat disappointing. I truly can't tell you much without spoiling.GOOD STUFF IN THE END: I am talking about gadgets. Some of the best gadgets are given to you in the very end. I truly wish I could have had them earlier.CONCLUSION:Contrary to minor cons, this game has a lot to offer as it takes the best games out of popular games such as Zelda, Devil May Cry, God of War and Portal (YES PORTAL). I totally thought it was worth the price so at very least you should at least give it a try.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2010"}

Hopefully I will be able to play them on Vita-Recent Price drop: Definitely helps.******************************Cons**************************************-Memory Cards: In the era when you can download full games, Sony should provide big memory cards at cheaper price or at least give option to buy memory cards from other companies.******************************Conclusion**************************************I didn&#8217;t buy Vita so far because I felt that it may not survive competition against 3DS and to be honest it is still doing bad compared to 3DS. But with so many awesome Vita games in the market, price drop and PS4 remote play, I have no regrets purchasing Vita this holiday season.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2014"}
{"product_name":"B003ZHMMEM","description":"","reviewerName":"JoshJosh","summary":"amazing game with one caveat","reviewText":"Donkey Kong Country Returns has a ton to offer.For one, the graphics are extraordinary - the characters look like their sprite based predecessors and the animation is superb. The backgrounds are amazing, with a superb attention to detail. The old SNES games used computer renders to display their graphics, and Retro has done a great job of capturing the look of the old games with polygons. At the same time, they took advantage of the hardware to power some effects that just were not possible on the old Super Nintendo. There are a lot of really spectacular and impressive special effects. Graphically, it is far superior to Nintendo's 2D Super Mario games this generation (NSMB/NSMB Wii).The level design is excellent. The game is not too difficult, really - it is fair. You need to learn how to play, though. You need to learn how to time jumps and observe patterns, like platformers of old. Finding the secrets can be a genuine challenge. You are rewarded with the unlocking of galleries and super-tough stages, but these are rewards that only come at the end of a lot of work. And, of course, there are no achievements. You are purely doing it for pride in DKCR - like games of old.You can play this either with the nunchuk+wii remote or just the Wii remote. So far I have been playing with the Wii remote. It's not too comfortable because of that groove next to the trigger on the remote, but it's playable. The only real problem is the forced motion control. You need to shake the controller to ground pound, roll, or blow breath. It is really imprecise and has gotten me killed several times. The fact that the classic controller is not supported really is unfortunate, and has led me to docking the game a star. I grew up playing games like this, and DKCR feels legit - it's a great platforming game, but it lacks the precision of the best ones. This could easily have been rectified but Nintendo/Retro chose not to.Still, this is totally a game worth playing, I highly recommend it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00012TIW8","reviewerName":"Adam B","summary":"Stealth and Action to the Fullest","reviewText":"Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow is one of those games that everyone is talking about and you have to try it out for yourself.  It's a stealthy action game that really lives up to the high expectations.  I liked the original Splinter Cell game, but I wasn't looking forward to the sequel very much.  This was because I pretty much sucked at the original game, especially playing the multiplayer on xbox live.  You have to have a pretty good understanding of the maps, the controls, and your surroundings.  You also have to have some practice with the game before you can become good enough to play people over xbox live.  I got my [...] kicked SO many times playing this game it's not even funny.  Even with all my doubts at how bad I would be at this game, I couldn't resist picking up Pandora Tomorrow the first week it came out.I played through the single player campaign with ease.  Well, not ease I guess, but it went over smoothly.  I really enjoyed the single player gameplay, something that I hardly ever like.  At least not as much as I like the multiplayer experience.  It seemed as though the gameplay of this sequel is toned down quite a bit and makes it easier for a new player to the series to complete the game without having an extremely difficult time.  I liked this a lot because it makes for a more \"pick up and play\" experience and not so much where you have to be SO good at the game.  It was like this through the single player campaign that is.  When I tried to play online, this was a while different story.  I guess I'm just not up to par with my Splinter Cell skills.  Again, I got destroyed in pretty much every time I played a match over xbox live.  Either I really really suck at this game, or its one of those that you really need practice to be able to play well.Even though I completely suck at the multiplayer portion of this game, it is still one of the best games overall that I have played in a while.  The graphics are great.  This game goes into so much detail and the lighting is phenomenal.  Sam Fisher (the main character) looks incredible in this game and there is a greater level of detail in his face and his outfits.  There are also things like rain and smoke that also look insane and very realistic.  The sound in the game is also something that makes it shine above the rest.  It's a game here if you play it with the volume too low you might actually miss something crucial to the story.  The sound effects are also great along with the dialogue and voice acting.  This game is a definite buy for those people looking for a great multiplayer experience.  I for one enjoyed the single player game better, but with all the features and modes, you can't go wrong with Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow over xbox live (that is unless you totally suck at it like me).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2006"}

Redmond","summary":"Naruto Fans -- Enjoy","reviewText":"This isn't a bad game.  There is a known bug with the audio messing up (annoyingly so) when you finish combat in certain situations.  Other than that the game runs smoothly with no hiccups.The good sides:  the VS matches are very fun in a Tekken kind of way.  I, personally, enjoyed the Tekken series and this is like a Naruto ninja version of it.  Also, I was pleasantly surprised that the original Japanese Seiyu (Voice Actors) are in it.  You can choose English or Japanese voice-overs which is great.  I watched this series in Japanese so I prefer it the way I heard it to begin with (just as people who enjoyed the English version would).  The ability to choose either is very nice.  Also the animation is great -- it's like playing through the series itself.Downsides: the biggest thing is the tedium of the quests.  They all seem to be about the same, and after every quest is the boring chore of running all over the map to collect the special items you need to get more special items that don't really do much of anything for you (except for some support ninjutsu for combat).  Story mode is a lot of the same over and over, and I was disappointed that there weren't more cutscenes showing the storyline taking place.  If you hadn't watched the anime you'd have no idea what was going on (but then you probably wouldn't be playing this, either).  With the animation drawing you in as if you were IN the anime -- cutscenes would have perfected that feeling.  Also, unlike when I watched the series, I felt somewhat like I should feel ashamed for playing such a childish game.  The anime didn't feel that way but for some reason the game seems very childish.  Perhaps that is the western approach for the anime -- I don't know since I haven't seen the American release.All in all.. not a bad game.  For Naruto fans (especially if, like me, you think the series should have ended with the Sasuke/Naruto fight) it is a good addition to your game collection.  It could be better, there could be many improvements.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000ZKA0J6","description":"","reviewerName":"Yossarian","summary":"Starcraft III:  10 Cents A Bullet?","reviewText":"Starcraft II has been a long time coming, and I don't mean its comically long development cycle.  Rather, it is the long-feared bastard child of a lengthy line of increasingly invasive and repugnant designer control devices gussied up as \"anti-piracy\" conventions.Gather 'round, wee bairns, and I'll tell you a tale.  Once upon a time, when if you bought a video game, you actually owned it.  In this crazy bizarro world, ownership of the game cartridge or floppy disk actually enabled you to simply play it whenever, wherever, and however often you wanted.  It was yours, like the books on your shelf or the 'shine in your still.But then the designers grew wroth.  Somewhere, they assumed, someone might not be paying for their game.  And so they, in their infinite wisdom, decided they could take steps that -- although mildly intrusive -- might cut down on some of the imaginary money diverting away from their coffers.  So they invented things like CD keys and watchdog programs and hidden rootkits and \"phone home\" programs that would secretly report your nefarious doings back to the mothership whenever you foolishly logged your computer onto the Internet or wandered into a WiFi area.  Each \"anti-piracy\" development was a little more aggressive, a little more probing and invasive, than the last.  But for many gamers, as long as they got the particular game they wanted, all was well.  After all, the developers had to come to their senses eventually, right?  It's not like in their eyes, all gamers are guilty until proven innocent or anything.  ...Right?Then, one fateful evening in the early 21st century, an overworked developer accidentally crossed the streams of his Mountain Dew and Red Bull and had an epiphany:  we don't even need to sell the games at all!  We can sell ACCESS to the games, which we keep safely locked up here on Planet Jackass.  And lo:  Steam was born, requiring you to download and play nice with an entire suite of malicious nannybot programs if you even wanted a fighting chance of playing the games you supposedly purchased when you obtained Valve's \"Orange Box\"/Steam download kit.  Quietly, privately, we all died a little bit more inside.Starcraft II is the next evolutionary step in this process.  You do not actually own Starcraft II.  You do not even own the present 1/3 of Starcraft II that has been opened for public viewing.  Rather, you own -- temporarily and subject to unappealable veto -- access to Starcraft II provided you maintain a live internet connection, invasive BattleNet account under your actual name, and inherently agree to chisel off any of your former expectations of playing with any of your friends in LAN games or spawning games to host with others.  No, instead you must each buy a Starcraft II \"game\"/access kit, stay connected to BattleNet, and pray that Blizzard decides to not alter the deal any further.  If you're very, very good, maybe you'll get to buy the Zergs or Protoss someday for another $50+ a shot.Something has to give.  Do we really want to pay another $30 just to be able to use the Barbarian class in Diablo III, or subscribe to a $15/month recurring fee just to be able to use flying units in Starcraft III?  How many pay gates will we permit developers to place between us and a full, unfettered copy of the entire game that we supposedly purchased in the first place?  Someday developers may realize the basic economic point that selling 10 million copies of a full game is more profitable than selling 500,000 copies of a spyware program masquerading as a space odyssey while simultaneously enraging their own customer base.  We can help that happen by not buying into the latter in the first place.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2010"}

I mean, I believe every Xbox owner has played this game atleast once, and a big part of them love the game. I bought my own Xbox some weeks ago and I couldn't wait to play this game Halo of which everyone was talking about so much for years... My expectations were at the top, and the game had to be a real masterpiece to fill my expectations. And, oh boy, it did.Analizing the game, you see that, graphically, this game is a beauty. Perhaps not the best Xbox can give you (this game runs at 30fps instead of 60fps), but you'll be impressed. The soundtrack is a great thing, it totally fits every situation (the main menu song is amazing... I'm seriously thinking about buying Halo Soundtrack), and the voice acting is top quality too. The controls are perfect, I wasn't confused by them, not even once... It feels awesome, and you can choose what kind of controls you prefer. Well, that's about it, technically.If somebody told you Halo is worth picking an Xbox for alone, don't think this someone is crazy. If you like action/sci-fi games, Halo will be an unforgetable and eternal experience for you in gaming world. Even if you don't, you should atleast rent it. Not a single Xbox owner should leave the plataform before playing Halo. It's like having a Nintendo64 and not playing The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time, do you feel me? If you don't own this game and you own a Xbox, I wouldn't think twice before buying it. How can a game survive with lots of hype since 2001, when it was realeased, and it was hyped even before... There's not a second option, dear gamer... The only option is: this game kicks a**. And I really hope Bungie won't let us down... But it won't be a easy task for Halo 2 to be better than this first game.A beautiful and amazing experience, Halo is a must-buy game for anyone who owns an Xbox. That's it, don't waste your time reading even more reviews. Just order your copy, and you'll also write a 5-star review when you play it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2004"}

A brave New World is rising--a hostile yet beautiful world, filled with innovative gameplay, new strategic scenarios, eye-searing graphics and much more. Welcome to a world calledAge of Empires III.CampaignIn this action adventure tale of historical fiction, players take on the role of Morgan Black and his family, struggling against the hostile wilderness and a mysterious cult that's crept in from Europe.In a series of 24 scenarios divided into three acts, Morgan Black and his descendants help the Aztecs resist conquest by Spanish conquistadors, pit the French against the British in the French and Indian War and help Simon Bolivar lead revolutions in South America.MultiplayerWhether you're searching for a quick game or hoping to talk strategy with friends online,Age of Empires III's Multiplayer site is your community destination.Here, you can play with persistent Home Cities that gain power and strategic options the more games you play, compete for a spot on dozens of ladders, help organize your clan or chat after a game -- all without leaving the multiplayer portal.Fans ofAge of Mythology's Quick Search can still look for games swiftly, while players looking for something specific can browse game lists to find the set of options that matches their tastes.New Feature--Home CitiesThis revolutionary new feature to the RTS landscape is incorporated into all aspects ofAge of Empires III-- from Campaign to Multiplayer -- and is unlike anything you've experienced before.Much like the persistent character from a role-playing game that encourages you to keep playing, your Home City is an important support system to your efforts in the New World. During a game, your Home City can regularly send you supplies or military reinforcements.You are the leader of your colony, but your success brings glory back to Mother Europe. The more games you play, and the better you do, the more powerful your Home City will become. Every few games, you gain the ability to both upgrade and customize your Home City:Upgrade your city by unlocking new types of soldiers or buildings, or improving those you already have.Broaden your tech tree in whatever direction most fits your play style--invest in warships, native alliances, cavalry, artillery or economy.Customize your Home City by changing the appearance of buildings, the weather or even the types of people who walk, work and perform in its streets.Throughout a game, as well as in between games, you can visit your Home City to watch its citizens go about their lives, get an opinion on how you're doing, plot your next move or just marvel at the beautiful sunset.Full 3-D Graphics, Destructible Environments and MoreWe first set out to reproduce the rich detail ofAge of Empires II: Age of Kings. As we strove to make the fascinatingAge of Empires IIItime period come alive, that goal quickly evolved: We at Ensemble Studios wanted to create the best-looking game ever. From the stunning water effects to the hundreds of units battling on-screen, you'll feel like you're a part of the action in the New World.Tone mapping--This photo imaging technique balances the colors in a scene on the fly. The end result is a rich, warm game where bright colors are vibrantly rendered alongside darker counterparts, such as shadows.Lighting and shadows--The sun is always shining inAge of Empires, so it's important that lighting and shadows be an awe-inspiring experience. Units and buildings cast shadows according to a real sun position, and even cast shadows on each other. High Dynamic Range rendering allows us to represent the shiny glints of sunlight that bounce off highly reflective surfaces.Bump and specular mapping--Water glistens like water. Metal shines like metal. These advanced techniques serve to provide an extra level of rendering detail heretofore unseen in real-time strategy (RTS) gaming.Water--We felt that portraying stunning, realistic water effects in the game was so important that we devoted a programmer to it full-time. You'll find the water rich with details like foam near the shore, accurately modeled water motion, flotsam in rivers and realistic water colors. Plus, reflections change with the viewing angle, the angle of sunlight and the motion of the water. The overall effect is breathtaking.Cliffs and Riverbeds--Instead of just stretching terrain, we built a system to attach geometry to the terrain map to allow for realistic overhangs and steep cliffs, from areas like the American Southwest. This effect is supported on random maps too.CivilizationsBritishQuick access to Settlers gives the British one of the strongest economies in the game. The ability to upgrade two key units -- the Musketeer and Hussar -- make the British military formidable in the late game. The British Home City emphasizes improvements to technology and naval warfare.DutchAlthough Dutch Settlers are limited and costly, their civilization makes up for this economic disadvantage by building Banks and generating coin automatically. The Dutch Home City emphasizes upgrades to defense and economy.FrenchAlthough the French economy starts slowly, the Coureur unit, a Villager with strong fighting skills, makes the French difficult to attack early. The French also have the strongest cavalry unit in the game -- the Cuirassier. Plus, the French are experts at allying with the Native Americans.GermanThe Germans have fewer Settlers and therefore a slower economy. Fortunately, both the Settler Wagon and Uhlan cavalry spawn for free from the German Town Center. Plus, the Germans start with the ability to send Mercenaries from their Home City (long before other civilizations can).Native AmericanEuropean civilizations can learn new technologies and gain troops by forging alliances with the Native Americans. A British player who allies with the Iroquois is essentially playing as two civilizations: the British and the Iroquois.OttomanFor the Ottomans, Settlers spawn automatically from the Town Center. Building a Mosque and conducting research help keep that Settler production steady. Befitting their position straddling Europe and Asia, the Ottomans have more unique units than any other civilization.PortugueseStarting the game with two Town Centers, the Portuguese can quickly produce Settlers, control territory or support their allies. The Spyglass ability allows the Portuguese to easily spy on the enemy. The Portuguese also have a strong navy, strong light infantry and the best Dragoons in the game.RussianStarting the game with extra resources but fewer Settlers gives the Russians the flexibility of focusing on economy or an early raid. Russian infantry, individually weak, are trained in blocks at a faster rate, providing the Russians with the opportunity to overwhelm their enemy with greater numbers.SpanishThe Spanish have a strong military, with both hand infantry and cavalry. Flexibility in early shipments from the Home City give the Spanish the option to attack early or set up for a strong, late economy. Spanish Home City improvements benefit soldiers, buildings and naval units.&nbsp;CombatAge of Empires IIIgives players an amazing amount of control over their side of the battlefield.More to command -- Not only are you in command of large and diverse armies of infantry, cavalry and artillery, but also Native American warriors, mercenaries and tall ships.Multiple formations -- You can assign different formations to your army for different strengths and weaknesses, or have the game automatically choose the most appropriate formation. Examples include:Volley -- ranged infantry, like musketeers, take turns firing at enemies ahead of them.Charge -- your soldiers walk, then run into combat. Cavalry wield sabers, and musketeers fix bayonets. This formation does tremendous damage but makes your soldiers more prone to injury.Bombard -- your soldiers protect the cannons, while the cannons shell enemy ranks. Available only when you have artillery in your army.Battles are easier to follow -- You can still command individual units. But when the units fight in formation, you'll be able to tell exactly who is winning the fight.Real-time physics -- Infantry struck by cannon fire will be thrown like rag dolls, perhaps even over a cliff and into the water. Cannonballs bounce and ricochet.Detailed destructions -- Shingles, shutters and whole towers may fly off a building and interact with the terrain, such as crashing into nearby water. This next generation effect is done on the fly so that each building always has a unique destruction, no matter how many times you see it.Unique animations -- With hundreds of unique combat animations, you'll never see the same battle twice.","reviewerName":"M \"Delicious Strawberry\"","summary":"Addicting","reviewText":"I have played this game many times, and I have not even played any of the expansion packs, the original itself is pretty good on its own though I would like to try the complete collection one day.

I love games like Sim City, the Sims, and I was really looking forward to that sort of game being combined with genetics and a space-faring game like Master Of Orion.  The trouble is... Spore is just not that game.First off, Spore is really not an open-ended \"sandbox\" like game like its predecessors.  In fact, the first couple stages of the game offer the player relatively few choices, and the end result feels canned and pre-determined.  As if that wasn't bad enough, the game feels like a game for little kids.  Cutsie-poo graphics, simplistic \"arcade-like\" controls and gameplay, make for a game I wouldn't touch with a 100' pole.  Well, they tried something different, I give them credit for that.  But this game certainly isn't for me.Now about the copy protection thing that has caused a big uproar here on Amazon... I'm not sure people understand the tradeoff here.  I don't like copy protection any better than the next guy.  The companies that trust me (like Galactic Civilizations), I make it a point to give my loyalty to.  But honestly, I don't really think Spore's copy protection scheme is all that bad.  Take games like Sim City and the Sims for example.  For those games you need to always carry the CD/DVD around, and plug it into the machine every time you want to play.  Have a half dozen games you like to play from time to time?  Then you'll be lugging around a half dozen dvds with you too.  Spore, once registered, requires *no* dvd/cd to play!

{"product_name":"B0002B90SA","reviewerName":"tvtv3 \"tvtv3\"","summary":"Lost and Alone","reviewText":"KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC II takes place about five years after KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC ended.  Lord Revan has disappeared.  The Jedi were wiped out in the war that followed and the Sith seem firmly in control of much of the galaxy.  The game begins with your character, known as The Exile, sitting half-naked in a prison cell aboard an apparent mining station.  There are dead people all around and most of the robots have seemed to go insane.  The Exile has no lightsaber, but does have Force powers.  As the game progresses, you learn more about The Exile from rather frequent cut-scenes.  The ultimate choice lies between choosing to return to the Jedi or to fully embrace the path of the Sith.  The path isn't exactly as clear as it was in the original KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC.  People give advice, but commit actions that are in opposition to what they advised.  Some characters appear to be allies, when in reality they are enemies hoping for your characters downfall.There are also some of the same characters from the first game.  Some of these pop up as additions to your party, while others are part of the storyline and appear mainly in cut-scenes. The Ebon Hawk is also back and is the ship that your character uses to get around the galaxy in.The workbench can be used not just to upgrade items, but to make new armor and weapons as well.  An additional lab station has been added, too, that allows for the creation of medical devices and explosives.  These stations can be located on just about every location.Pazaak has gotten more interesting with the addition of a few new cards and a first play rotation.  The racing games have also been improved, but I didn't spend too much time on those.  I was more interested in the storyline of the game.The fighting seemed to be much easier than in the original KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC, especially towards the end of the story.  This could be because the game seems to autosave more often, allowing progression to happen faster.  Overall, enemies seem to die easily and without doing much damage.  The one exception I found was in the Jungle Tomb on Dxun.  I don't know why, but I found the Sith Masters there to be particular difficult to defeat.A component to the storyline that I really enjoyed, was having your character be able to teach and train other characters in either the ways of the Force.  It was pretty neat to be able to have a small army of Jedi going into some of the final confrontations.However, despite some of the improvements, KOTOR II is disappointing. After having played through KOTOR, I had a huge sense of accomplishment. It felt as though I had gone on a long journey and saved (or later when I played as a Sith, overtaken) the galaxy.  There was even a cool scene celebrating the victory.  KOTOR II doesn't have any of that.  The ending of the game is terrible and leaves more questions unanswered than I had when I first started playing the game.  But, it's not just in the ending.  There are several times throughout the game that elements seem to end rather abruptly.  That's not to say that playing the game isn't fun, because it is.  There are times when the game is exciting, but overall KOTOR II just isn't as engaging as the original.  Looking back at the gaming experience, it is as though the developers just rushed through the game to get it completed on time.If you haven't played the original KOTOR, I recommend playing that first before playing KOTOR II.  KOTOR II is fun to play, especially if you're a Star Wars fan, but it'll make more sense having played KOTOR first.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2007"}

You'll find that there's no solace in a room that you think you've completely freed from zombie infestation.","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"A mixed bag, but still holds some nostalgic fun","reviewText":"Capcom basically made the survival horror genre a force to be reckoned with (while borrowing heavily from the original PC game Alone in the Dark) thanks to the original Resident Evil on the PS1, and now the game that spawned an entire series and countless immitators makes it's mark on Nintendo's DS, and also marks the first Mature rated game for the dual screened handheld to boot.  Now, let's get it straight that this is pretty much a direct port of the original PS1 classic (along with the unedited \"director's cut\" opening FMV sequence), and sadly the game hasn't aged all that well.  Everything bad you remember about the game is still here; from the unbelievably bad voice acting and dialogue, to go along with the incredibly cheesy FMV sequences.  Not to mention that the controls, which were annoying enough when you first played the game a decade ago, are now just plain archaic, especially on the DS.  However, after a while, you can get used to the control scheme, although prepare for bouts of frustration.  Not to mention that the graphics look granier here than one may recall, particularly the character and zombie models which look washed out.  Besides all the negatives, if you've played the PS1 game at all, then you know what else to expect here: playing as either Chris or Jill in different branching single player modes as you take on zombies, mutated dogs, and other beasts in a huge mansion.  There's doors to unlock and puzzles to solve to progress to your inevitable showdown with the Tyrant, which still manages to pack a punch to this day.  For all it's negatives, Resident Evil: Deadly Silence still has a bit of nostalgic charm to it that makes it worth playing, and the bonuses which Capcom has thrown in (including a first person perspective using your trusty knife and some additional touch screen and microphone features) make the game worth checking out even for veterans of the long running and influential series.  Whether you want to lay down the full price for it though is entirely up to how much nostalgia you can take in before longing to play the much superior Resident Evil 4 on your console.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2007"}
{"product_name":"B004L4G8UC","description":"","reviewerName":"Nightmare","summary":"First 3DS game, definitely a winner!","reviewText":"Well, my loving wife surprised me with a 3DS for my birthday along with this game, Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars.  This is my first Ghost Recon game (which I understand that Shadow Wars is not a typical entry in the series), and I am completely impressed.  Shadow Wars proves to be a user friendly, yet complex turn-based strategy game.  One of my favorite game series of all time is definitely Advance Wars because it mastered the art of turn-based strategy games that involve unit production.  In my opinion, this game does the same for turn-based strategy games that do NOT involve unit production.Campaign mode presents you with 6 characters, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  Not all missions allow you to bring all 6, so you are forced to make critical choices that can completely change the way you play the mission.  You can level up characters that you use in each mission to give them new weapons and skills.  I find all 6 of the characters to be extremely useful in most circumstances.  Your \"ghosts\" are as follows.Duke (Commando) - Versatile unit that offers good movement and firing range with a shoulder mounted rocket launcher for area effect damage and vehicle destroying power.Haze (Sniper) - Long range unit that can negate defensive bonuses and eventually wields rifles that can decimate vehicles.  Can also use Grenades.Saffron (Medic) - Heals friendly units, carries a pistol for personal defense, and can eventually offer extra bonuses to her comrades.Richter (Gunner) - Slow to advance forward, but offers excellent power and maximum return fire.  Can also use Grenades.Mint (Engineer) - Handy with a machine gun (similar to Duke), but also has the option (eventually) to use a pistol that halts vehicles in their tracks.  Furthermore he can plant a stationary turret or a mobile drone to add to your teams firepower.Banshee (Recon) - Carries a low power machine gun and has the choice of a lethal knife or grenades as backup.  Her main advantage is that she can't be targeted by enemy fire unless an enemy unit is next to her.  She is easy to kill once she is spotted though . . . .Shadow Wars uses the bottom screen to give you every amount of detail you could ask for.  It serves as the map, terrain detail screen, and shows all the info on your characters.  Anything you need to know is readily available from the skills that each character has to how much damage your unit will do at what range (range does change how much damage you deal).  The game features obstacles that block line of fire and various elevations (more damage is dealt to enemies at lower elevations and less damage is dealt to enemies at higher elevations).  To put it quite simply the game is heavy on strategy, but its user friendly interface makes the game very accessible.  There are also three difficulty levels to choose from, so anybody can have fun with this game.  And as you progress through the campaign mode you unlock skirmish missions for one player challenges and multi-player missions for pass-the-3DS style competitions.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Robert Evans \"Robert\"","summary":"Outstanding game but ruined from some flaws...Big Flaws!","reviewText":"Halo 2 is one of the biggest and baddest Xbox titles to hit the X box systems since...well...HALO!  And of course some other awesome games.  The game has bin hyped since 2002 and finally the wait is over as they announced the official November 9th release date.  Does this game live up to the hype?..does it outdo Halo one?  To answer your question my friend Yes!....and no..Ok first lets get one things straight.  Bungie did an excellent job with this amazing FPS shooter.  The games visuals are breathtaking and the new dueling systems is just superb.  The game did get some pretty good scores like 9.8 on IGN but that's besides the point...HALO 2 is truly an amazing game.  It will be rememberd as one of the biggest Xbox games ever.  I salute you Bungie for this awesome game.  Visuals PERFECT, Gameplay PERFECT, Um....Good lengh NO.  Lets just get this down and over with...Lets startGraphicsGraphicly this is the best looking Xbox game to date.  The graphics can be comparable to Doom3 Trust me.  Sometimes you'll just stop and look at the brilliant visuals on the water, mountain anything.  The lighting effects are unbelievable..  This game looks simply....AMAZINGSoundThe music from the original is back but with more of a remix and more rock(something like that) and that it self deserves a star.  The sound is extreamly detailed.  The gun shots from from shotgun sound simply....Real..Bungie made no flaws on this part of the game....1 star for this one...Gameplay..The campaighn is wonderful with a pretty odd story that is a little different then Combat Evolves.  The game not only gives you the role of Masterchief but you also get the role of an Elite and once that happends it really starts to pick up the pace.  Bungie added some great features in this...You can use the tank more often now unlike Combat Evolved were you only used it in one level.  Some of the most amazing parts in the game is when your on Earth(which is only 2 levels sadly)But don't worry for all of you people who wanted to use the tank more often HALO 2 is here for you.  The campaighn earns a star.............and loses one(Uhhh I think)..The campaighn is short...not(only 13 hours short) it's more like(7 hours and less, short).. And it ends very abruptly so if you're expecting a huge ending that was very cool and remarkable don't expect it in Halo 2.  It just.....ends...Or as most people call it a cliffhanger.  And No I don't have Xbox Live but I have played some good wholesome mutliplayer with some budds of myn at his house and it was friggin terrific.  Now besides that If Bungie didn't worry about the Xbox live stuff and worked more on the story it could have bin better.  I know I'll probably get negative reviews by some but This..Is not the best FPS...C'mon it's notIt was a bit overhyped..I thought EGM said on there really early HALO2 Cover stroy issue(it was when Vice City was just begining to get hype for the Ps2 before it's even out)that We would get to no more about Masterchief....HE BARLEY SAYS ANYTHING ATLEAST HE TALKED MORE IN HALO 1!Over all verdict+Amaing GraphicsCool MultiplayerSuperb GameplayAwesome campaighn story(yes I liked it unlike most game mag reviews)YOU PLAY AS AN ELITE!  You can't beat that now?Cons..Just way too shortCliff hanger ending...Just...ends...dammit..Halo 2 has the potential to be the greatest Xbox game ever but ultimatley fails with its short campaighn and horrible way of an ending..IT's not even an ending if you think about it!  Lets not forget the superb multiplayer(man dueling weapons and using energy swords rule) This game is plain great and yes it was a bit overhyped but it does not dissapoint..Halo 2 is fantastic and that is why I give it a...4.7 out 5....You must own this game if you have an xbox...that's it..I'm doneLates..","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2004"}

Everything about this game screams quality.  The graphics are beautiful, the sounds are immersive, the gameplay is great as ever, and the controls . . . the controls are simply amazing!If you like shooters, I'm not sure how you could not like this game.  The controls are perfect.  I can't imagine how they could be improved (as far as the shooting and moving mechanics work).  Using the controller to point and shoot at enemies works flawlessly.  There are cool points where you must mimic motions of twisting, pumping, and pulling to perform certain actions.  All of these work without blemish.  Going back to standard controllers to play shooters is just not as fun after playing Corruption.The bosses are very enjoyable to fight, and offer a nice challenge (something missing in a lot of games nowadays).  You can also unlock harder difficulty settings that make the game even more challenging, which can make for some intense battle sequences.Voice acting has been introduced to the Prime series with its 3rd (and presumably final) installment, and it is done very well.  It's too bad Samus doesn't get to do any talking, but that would take away the mystery wouldn't it?  If they had a voice actor for her no doubt some would hate her voice.  At least this way the entire problem is avoided.No multiplayer is something of a negative, but at the same time I wouldn't want to be disappointed like I was with Metroid Prime 2: Echoes.  That multiplayer was decent, but nothing more.  Perhaps it's best that Metroid stays what it's best at--solid, single-player action/adventure.Overall, you can't go wrong with this game if you like shooters.

{"product_name":"B00003E4EB","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo-Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$110 recommended retail price for a console with two controllers, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Rex Marksmanson \"HEYO!\"","summary":"Most entertaining system I have ever owned","reviewText":"Now ever since the release of the original Nintendo, NES I have been a gamer.

If the jet ski portions were actually fun, they'd be a nice break, but as is, they're breaking up crap with a few crap sequences.- Wave after wave after wave of enemies. On the surface this looks like an Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider genre game - well no, it's not, it's a freaking Gears of War clone. Gears of War was all about fighting waves of enemies, you expected it. This game  - jeeze - you'll kill off like  15 bad guys (and that takes a while, a long while) from behind cover and you'll think for a second that was fun now time to explore - NOPE - you'll hear a bad guy yell and another wave will hit, and you'll be pinned down fighting them off - then you'll do it one more time. There's a fine line between fun combat and GRIND, this game leaps over that line, you'll be GRINDING through bad guys thinking, \"Shouldn't I be doing some platforming?\" Usually if they just had one less wave it would be bearable, annoying, but bearable - as-is, it's just tedious, the combat ain't that great.- What little platforming there is, isn't all that original, but compared to fighting wave after wave of bad guys you'll enjoy the five or six ledges you get to jump around on your way to the next 3 waves of bad guys.- Later in the game, guys with one shot kills - they have laser sights - when you first meet them there is insufficient cover so they bum rush you. Seriously, who thought one hit kills was a good idea.Graphics -(A) Cut scenes - Can you say PS2? The cut scenes, (what drive the story) look like ass, like something from PS2, or XBOX(B) Game - Graphics on backgrounds are nice, but get repetitive. I mean the jungle looks nice, but after about 20 minutes get's old.End Boss - Anticlimactic quick time event let down.

Only without the clunky controls of Lara Croft.  Everything is solid about this game.  This game has everything from gameplay, great story, top notch voice acting, and probably the best graphics that I have ever seen.Gameplay is very smooth which I haven't seen in a long time from a game.  Most games recently I felt that I had to fight with the controller to get anything done.  This game makes you do something that most games today make you do.  It actually makes you THINK about what your doing!  At times it can be frustrating, but thankfully they drop hints when your having difficulties figuring out what to do.Graphically this game is stunning.  Even on my none HD TV set everything looked so real.  They put the Xbox 360 best graphic game to shame.  I can only imagine what this looks like on a HD TV set.Storyline is very engaging with characters that you can truly feel for.  I haven't really felt this since FFVII where I actually felt for what the character was going through.  Most of the time I lose interest in the games, because I could care less what happened to the character.  It's refreshing to have a game that does this in market of stale wanna-be's and bad clones.By all means get this game.  Its probably one of the few games made today that is actually worth dropping full price on.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0050SX7BQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Thomas Riccardi","summary":"More of a movie than a game","reviewText":"Right now in the gaming industry there is a fine line between games and other forms of entertainment. Games such as Heavy Rain want to immerse the fans in a unique experience instead of having GTA type gameplay. Now there is a new game called Beyond Two Souls which promises to deliver a breathtaking story but does the whole game fall flat.The game stars Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe as Jodie Holmes and Nathan Dawkins respectively.While I am not going to go too deep into the story it seems that Jodie Holmes has some supernatural powers. Having these powers have attracted the attention of certain agencies and at one point these two characters paths cross. This story takes place all over the world and there are some really breathtaking moments that you will experience in the game.The biggest problem that I have with this game is there is a lack of an actual game in here. Yes there is a story and it might be a compelling one but this is a game and that element needs to be present. There are situations that you will be put in and you need to get through them and even if you fail the story continues on! Unlike some of the laserdisc games of old when you made a mistake you lost a life and you had to repeat the section. Sacrificing gameplay in order to tell a story is not acceptable by any means and turns it from an actual game to interactive fiction.Beyond two souls has some impressive graphics that make this game shine on it's own. You can see in detail the way these characters express themselves through body language and facial expressions. The way this was done is they attached dozens of sensors that were able to capture a range of facial expressions. This data was imported into the game and made for a more believable character.If you want to experience a great story that has little to no replay value then you might want to rent this. But for me to call this a game is not right as it is at best an interactive story. If you are looking for a game that has Ellen Page in it go pick up The Last Of Us.  For more information on this game go to [...] /#home and get ready to experience a compelling story.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2013"}

I would say that there have been better games, but this has been the best one of the series. I could not put this game down. One word of advice though. Don't get too crazy with the smithing and enchanting and alchemy. If you do all 3 to the max, you can make some epic weapons. Unfortunately it makes the game way too easy! I was able to play this game with a GT 440 on high settings.

{"product_name":"B0050SWNZW","description":"","reviewerName":"G. Denick","summary":"Stick THAT in your pipe and smoke it","reviewText":"This game, without question, receives an \"A\" for imagination. I have been playing games for a long, long time, and very rarely do I experience one where I can genuinely say that it is a unique concept. I can wholeheartedly endorse \"Puppeteer\", and I promise you that it is a novel, fun, heartfelt experience. It's weird, whacky, and wonderful. Quite frankly, you can stick this sucker in your pipe and smoke it, it's so downright funky. It's like the psychedelic product of somebody's crazy dreams after drinking a whole box of Sangria and eating a tray full of magic brownies.The art direction of this game is marvelously realized. Whoever came up with the concept to place a game in the setting of a puppet show/theater is some kind of crazy genius. Oh, and then this crazy genius decided to give your character the ability to swap out his head... you know, with things like bananas and cherry trees. Yeah, it makes no sense... get used to it. This game does, after all, take place in the setting of a puppet show, so the developers wisely elected to let their imaginations run wild as the story progresses through its wild, Moon Bear King infested chapters. Further capitalizing on this unique setting, the visuals of \"Puppeteer\" utilize a beautiful paper-craft style, which is intelligently implemented into the actual gameplay (with particular emphasis on your \"magic scissors\"). The inclusion of an actual audience and curtains is brilliant, framing the experience into something that has never before been attempted in a video game - and it works! This game's art style will make it impervious to aging, and I think it will still look wonderful 20 years from now, just like the recent Rayman titles.Why is this game \"budget priced\" at $39? I have no idea. Don't be fooled by its enticing price, that by no means is an indication of a short game, or one that was put together with limited resources. This is a full fledged, wondrous experience, and I hope as many gamers as possible get to take a whack at it. There are tons of collectibles, challenges, and trophies. HOWEVER- if you are dead set against platforming or goofy ideas (in no way is this game at all realistic), you probably won't enjoy \"Puppeteer\". But for everybody else, this game is a banana-headed blast of craziness and fun. If you like Muppets or puppets or anything pertaining to Jim Henson, you will get extra tickled on your weird journey.This game is, in short, a breath of fresh air. With recent releases like \"Rayman Legends\" and \"Puppeteer\", not to mention the forthcoming \"Into the Nexus\", this is turning out to be a wonderful time to be a platforming fan. This console generation is exiting on a high note. Now go get your banana head and take on the Moon Bear King!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SWNZW","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"The hidden gem of 2013","reviewText":"It isn't often when a game comes along where I really can't find anything negative to say about it. I could suppose I could nitpick about the lack of significant challenge, or the slightly overlong scenes of dialogue, but those would be such minor details in a game that I consider to be the best AAA platformer I've played this generation. Puppeteer is a masterpiece. What is shocking to me is how little attention the game seems to be getting. It did release very close to the behemoth known as Grand Theft Auto V, and is also arriving on the eve of the release of the next generation of gaming consoles. This is highly unfortunate though, because Puppeteer displays everything that makes a video game like this great: fun, responsive, and varied gameplay, a good story, incredible presentation, a sense of humor, and unabashed creativity. Puppeteer is a game that truly deserves to reach as large of an audience as it can, and hopefully over time, that will happen.Puppeteer is the story a boy named Kutaro. Like many other children of earth, he's had his soul stolen by the evil, corrupted Moon Bear King, and he is given the opportunity to save the fate of not only his own soul, but those of all the other children as well. The story of Kutaro's adventure is told on a single-stage puppet show, a format that the game commits to 100%. Stage sets rise, fall, and shift as Kutaro moves from one area to another. Characters speak to the audience, which often reacts with gasps, laughter, shock, and amazement. A pitch-perfect narrator recounts each act and gives often hilarious commentary to the on-stage happenings. But the best thing about the puppet show format is the unfiltered way it allows the game to brilliantly shine with creativity. Stage prop backgrounds are vividly animated, packing the screen with an almost constant overload of visual delights. Story characters, friends, enemies, and especially bosses are memorable, beautiful, and often stunning to behold. Colors are vivid and dynamic, constantly enhancing the wide variety of themes that make each and every level in Puppeteer unique. Puppeteer is one of those games that you want to keep playing simply to see what comes next, and it always manages to surprise. Few games have ever been made that pack so much creativity and imagination into every frame of gameplay. It is a stunning feat of art direction, graphical par excellence, and pure creative ingenuity. I haven't been this much in awe of a game's presentation from a creative angle since I played Okami on the Playstation 2.None of this raw beauty and spectacle would matter if the game wasn't mechanically sound, and it absolutely is. Playing as Kutaro is a joy, and whether he's moving along the stage floor, through the air with his magical scissors, on the backs of high-speed creatures, the game controls are tight, intuitive, and fun. As Kutaro slowly gains abilities such as being able to launch paper mache bombs (this is a puppet show, after all), launch a hook to grab distant objects/enemies, generate a deflective shield, etc., the controls are taught in a clear concise way and never feel overwhelming or convoluted throughout the entire experience of playing Puppeteer. The game is so diverse not only visually, but in its gameplay as well, as this is a game that never gets boring or repetitive throughout the entire 8-10 hour campaign. There are many secrets to discover, collectibles to find, and bonus stages to uncover. This is very generous game, especially considering its $39.99 price tag.I was enamored with Puppeteer from the moment I began the game right through the ending credits. This is a special game that is one of the most beautiful and creative games I've played in the PS360 era. A shame it was wrongfully ignored by the gaming community, as the fantastic ratings here on amazon can testify. If you like 2D platformers, or just like to see games that are willing to try something new and be uninhibitedly creative while doing so, Puppeteer is a game you shouldn't miss.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00AMA4L4E","description":"The most controversial game in recent years returns in this special director's cut. Unofficially the best game of the year (2010) according to fans and critics alike, Deadly Premonition split the gaming community right down the middle and earned itself cult status for its memorable cast and story.","reviewerName":"Chance Briggs","summary":"The best survival horor game on the market","reviewText":"Overall, I would say that this would probably be considered one of the best survival horror games of all time had it been released a decade or so ago. As such, the game itself feels like a relic from another era, even though Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut was released this year. The game feels like a fanfic version of Twin Peaks with the game play elements of survival horror games such as Silent Hill, Resident Evil, and at times Clock Tower.In terms of presentation, the game is woefully outdated. The graphics would only be impressive if it was released on the PS2. The controls for the fighting and driving sections are awful. The mapping and guidance system, which is seemingly borrowed from GTA is just plain terrible. Also, there are maybe five or six character models for enemies throughout the game. Finally, the sound during the combat missions basically consists of the enemies muttering the same two phrases over and over again. That said, Deadly Premonition offers something downright inspiring for every one of its technical shortcomings. There's an ugly world thick with idiosyncrasies and history, a vast cast of memorable weirdoes, and a fascinating lead in Agent Francis York Morgan. It's better than getting to play Twin Peaks; it's like getting to be Dale Cooper.Throughout Deadly Premonition, you'll find yourself in very odd situations punctuated by Agent York's equally odd demeanor. This is where the game absolutely shines; the surreal interaction between York and the townsfolk (as well as the interaction between York and himself) can only be described as a work of art. In a town where crimes can be solved by shooting bird nests with shotguns, trees drop severed hands that can be used as doorknobs, and countless giant dogs fall out of the sky at midnight, the choice to behave illogically is simply... logical. The game contains an intangible, eccentric atmosphere which easily overshadows its many shortcomings. This is a game simply overflowing with a vivid personality and bizarre charm.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2013"}

Tilley Jr. \"goatman_1\"","summary":"Project Gotham vs. Grand Turismo 3","reviewText":"Ok, for those of you out there that have been fortunate enough to either own, or play several different systems, or are hard-core enough to know what's hot or what's not, you probably know that the biggest baddest racing game on the market is GT3, for PS2 which is the newest installment of the Grand Turismo series.  While I wasn't as addicted to GT3 as some get, I've got to admit that it deserves almost all of the hype it's received.  When buying Project Gotham, there could be only one comparison, one game to beat: GT3.While far superior in some aspects (I like to knock out complaints early), my biggest complaint about Gotham, especially compared to GT3, is the lack of cars, especially in the beginning.  You only start with three cars, none of which are uber-cool or exciting.  There should at least be more cars for multiplayer as it's a drag to pull the game out of the box all hyped to play with friends and have to choose from a mini-cooper and a MR5.  With GT3, there was a huge selection of cars right out of the package for arcade or multiplayer games.  I was so annoyed by this that I'm almost tempted to knock Gotham down a star, but the good things are so revolutionary that it survives well.Some people will be annoyed with the lack of a &quot;campaign&quot; style game where you can buy and customize cars.  I didn't find this too disheartening, as that's really a GT3 thing, and not something I expect with every racing game I buy.  Gotham is much more of an arcade style game than a simulator.  It's easy to overlook this one.Ok, what's good about Project Gotham?  Everything Else.  If this is an example of things to come, we can expect some incredible racing games for the Xbox in the future.  What PGR lacks in cars, it makes up for in some of the most detailed circuits imaginable.  The incredible RAM and video RAM capacity of the Xbox means all the tracks consist of 3D models, with 3D statues hurling by at an impressive frame-rate.  Buildings boast real signs and posters, and landmarks down to the barest details.  GT3's cardboard cut out people and environments sometimes bordered on cheesy.  Living in Japan I've been to Asakusa, Shibuya and Shinjuku and they've captured the landmarks and buildings perfectly. All that RAM also allows PGR to do something that always bothered me about GT3: show damage to the cars.  That was always irritating.  Winner: PGR.The Dolby Digital sound is incredible.  I only recently got the advanced A/V hook-ups, and this game roars on my surround sound system.  While it has an impressive song collection already on the disk, PGR is the first Xbox game I've owned that allows you to use your own music copied onto the hard-drive.  For another cool twist, you can choose to listen to the radio pre-sets, which include authentic radio stations from the various cities including real DJ's.  Super cool.  PGR has it all over GT3 in the sound category.Fun.  This game is extremely fun and addictive.  The game play is strong for any racer, but the addition of a Kudos system: rewarding players for cool skids, two wheels, overtaking racers etc. adds a new dimension.  While I thought it was cheesy at first, the arcade game, which allows you to run through a track solo strictly to collect Kudos, is a lot of fun.  Trying to do outrageous turns and combos becomes addictive.  I don't think I can honestly say that PGR is more fun than GT3, but I can say it's at least AS fun.In the end, while I really wanted to be able to declare one the undisputed victor over the other, I really can't.  PGR is far more sophisticated which is to be expected.  GT3 has a depth and garage that PGR lacks.  They're both a LOT of fun.  If you can afford it, there's only one true solution: buy them both.  If not, I'm a big fan of better, faster, stronger so I'd have to go with Project Gotham.  With new features and advancements not seen in other racing games, Project Gotham has set a new standard that will certainly improve all games in the years to come.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2002"}

Burns \"Slackjaw\"","summary":"Gran Turismo 5 or (a good reason to still own that PS3)","reviewText":"Finally!a game that has depth and replay value. It's hard for this microsoft lover to turn on the PS3 nowadays what with Halo Reach, Kinect, etc..  But this game is a viable reason (among others) to invest in a PS3. I have read alot of reviews on this game as any game with a 6 year wait would garner much discussion- did it live up to the hype?  Yes, it absolutely does.The common complaint is the lack of new tracks and improvement off of GT4. I never got to play GT4 so that aspect is not a concern to me. I find that the realism of this experience is unrivaled. Forza is nothing close to this game. No one is ever going to be completely happy with a game, there are always pluses and minuses. But at the end of the day I liked this game alot. IT would take a very long time to complete all of the nuances of this game. As challenging as it is, you may find it hard to progress and buy the cars you really want.  but that is precisely what makes me love this game. It's not going to get tired like alot of arcade racers these days. The graphics are just simply the best I've seen in a racing game. PRETTY doesn't do it justice. The cars are extremely detailed with over 1000 to choose (though not initially as you must unlock them. I understand that there are premier cars that are more accurately rendered (around 200) but I liked the look of the basics and again the tracks are simply breathtaking. Contols can be difficult to pick up but with a little patience you will get alot out of this game. I would personally not shell out the money necessary but there are 2-3 different racing wheels you can purchase to simulate the race experience and these supposedly work better. (Expect to pay 100-350)I thought it might be good to hear from someone who rarely plays a PS3 unless I'm watching the Blue Ray. Since Uncharted I have not found many games that fit my individual tastes but both systems are great and both have many cool games to play. My review is maybe more taylored to those who already live on their Xbox 360 like me, and who don't typically play the PS3.This is a game worthy of the tremendous time investment it requires to unlock the bulk of the cars.  But with license tests, races on around 20 tracks and multiplayer this is a great buy and a must own. I am yet to get deep into this game but I thought my intitial thoughts might help the score as this should NOT be ignored! Even by Xbox heads.Thanks for reading","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002I0K6DG","description":"","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"A local co-op BEAST!","reviewText":"I got this game because it has local, splitscreen co-op. That, and I heard it was a good game. Really though, that's an understatement. This game looks and plays better than most any shooter I've played. The control scheme does take a little getting used to, but you do get used to it. And that doesn't take away from the fact that the aim sensitivity is perfect, and the controls aren't glitchy in the slightest. Mostly it's the clicking of the R3 button to aim down your sights that initially makes controlling feel strange. But, as I said, you get used to it. One thing I'm really loving here is the cover system. You don't push a button and pop into cover, then push a button to pop out of cover. You hold the button to cover, and keep holding it to stay there. This aspect reminds me of Rainbow Six: Vegas 2, and I love it. It completely eliminates those moments when you pop out of cover, don't mean to, and end up dying. The weapons are also exactly up my alley. Two minutes in and I was wielding a handgun/shotgun that holds 3 rounds, instead of the standard 2. You feel the strengths and weaknesses of each weapon as you should, and the sights don't dumb down the play or blind you to your target. The enemy AI is akin to Uncharted 2, in that each enemy moves in ways that aren't always predictable and make you feel more like you're playing against a live opponent. The action is endless, and the game (while linear) normally gives you multiple routes for flanking enemies. The splitscreen play is wonderful as well. If you want a game you can sit down with a friend in the same room, on the same TV and have a blast with, both playing at the same time; this is the one I'd tell you to go with. I enjoyed the story as well. It's a bit predictable at times, but that's refreshing to me; having had so many fragmented storyline experiences in the shooters I've recently taken on. In short; this game looks great and plays great. The control scheme is going to take you a short while to adjust to. But before long you'll realize how much better the changes to the standard shooter control model has made this experience. I loved the original Killzone. The second game was pretty decent. But this one takes the cake. It's also one of the best shooters I've ever played with regard to response, graphics and feel. A must own.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2011"}

And i was very pleased with it.The concept is exactly that: You are the Hitman.  Your Codename is 47.  You start by escaping a mental institution.  How did you get there?  Who is helping you get out?  Questions that are answered later as you make your way out.  Afterwards, the fun begins!Know this before you play:  This is a thinking man's game.  It requires intelligent thought and rational planning.  Don't go running in with your guns blazing.  You will need to use covert tactics.There are many different weapons to pick up, and you can change into the uniforms and clothing of most of the people you 'take-out'.  Many times, the success of the mission will depend on dressing up as a member of an organization or a bodyguard to get as close as possible to your target.  And remember, there is ALWAYS more than one way to success.Many complain of the complexity of missions and having to know everything by playing the level several times.  That simply is not true.  It is very easy to beat the level on your first time through.  You just have to be able to use your brain.  Its as simple as following instincts.  You are given enough information in your pre-mission briefing, and the map is clearly marked for you on where you are supposed to go.  After that, you go and wait for your opportunity.  There is always more than one way to complete a mission, which adds to the gameplay.  Complaints about the game moving slow are nothing more but impatience.  You MUST be patient in this game.  If you are not in the mood to think and act, then you will NOT enjoy it.Missions definitely do get more complex later on, but again, their is always information available to help you through, and once you get the feel for being the Hitman, it is easy enough.  As far as story goes, there really isnt much.  Your first few missions are pretty straightforward: You are Hitman.  Go and Kill.  But soon Hitman starts having flashbacks in between missions that evolve the story.  Overall, the concept is very good, and the last mission finally brings sense to the story.  However, as with most games these days, the ending leaves alot to be desired.  Lets hope for a sequel, because this game was alot of fun.There are quite a few problems i discovered.  Namely, the 3rd person angle gets quirky.  The camera has a habit of going in all directions at times, making control very difficult.  Sometimes you will end up getting stuck on objects in the level, requiring either mass button mashing to get yourself out, or a restart of the level.  There is no mid-level save, which is very annoying, because if you die, you can continue only twice, and once you continue, the target will most likely be aware of your presence, making the rest of the mission difficult.  However, if you are very skilled, you won't die too often.  There are also many graphical problems unless you are using a Voodoo 4 or higher.  Anything less, you will experience many graphical problems.  I recommend going with a GeForce 2, or possibly a GeForce 3.  Although the game seems to be optimized for Voodoo graphics cards, the company went out of business, so now Nvidia would be the optimal choice with their GeForce chipsets.All in all, a great game with a great concept.  If you are buying a new computer and are looking for a few games to start out with, i strongly recommend picking up Hitman.  IF you are patient and willing to put your mind into a game, rather than run in with guns blazing, then this is the game for you!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2001"}

{"product_name":"B0001NJHH8","description":"Combining the best parts of role playing games and first-person action games, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines plunges players into the dark and gritty vampire underworld of modern day L.A. as a recently embraced fledgling vampire in the service of the city's dark Prince.","reviewerName":"AntVector","summary":"It bites.  In a good way...","reviewText":"There's something uniquely satisfying about being evil.  Evil gets to play with the best toys, listen to the best music, wear the best clothes and generally be sinister, introspective and cool.  In game terms, being evil also means that you get to do all the things that make the good guys wince, like bursting people with blood-magic or biting them in the face.  Vampire - The Masquerade: Bloodlines is the latest excuse to be deliciously evil.  From developer Troika the game takes advantage of both the rich heritage of White Wolf's role-playing game, and Valve's spanking new Source engine, which powers Half-Life 2; an undeniably exciting concept.In practice the game is a thrilling merger of RPG sensibilities and frenetic, brutal action...with just a dash of stealth and lateral thinking thrown in for good measure.  The player takes command of a fledgling vampire in the dangerous employ of Prince Le Croix - the vampire overlord of Los Angeles.  Like any good RPG, Vampire allows you to choose an avatar for your character from a number of different models, both male and female.  The species of vampire you choose will, to some extent, dictate what sort of player you'll be in the game.  Action fans will probably be at home with the more physically powerful vampires such as the Brujhar, whose natural instincts for combat will confer increased power and accuracy.  More conservative or cerebral players may prefer to outsmart or out-magic their opponents - there's even a chance to play as the sanity-challenged Malkavians, which leads to some unique conversations and scenarios.You can choose to play from either the first-person, like a traditional shooter, or to view your character in the third-person, which is useful for melee combat or to judge jumps.  There's no great emphasis on any one aspect of play - combat or puzzle solving - and the fact that experience points are rewarded for completing missions rather than killing enemies means that players are invited to explore as they see fit, and solve problems in a manner of their choosing.  Skillful players are able to sneak past sentries, or talk their way past an opponent.  Or they could just choose to pull his head off.  There is a huge variety of weapons, both ranged and melee to experiment with, as well as a great implementation of `Thermaturgy' - vampire blood magic.Like other games such as Morrowind, or semi-RPG action games like Grand Theft Auto, there are central plot missions that need to be completed in order to really progress through the game.  However, the giant sandbox world that Troika has crafted means that there's seldom a dull moment in between times, and sub-missions are often just as fun and rewarding to undertake.Visually, the game is a treat, with the Source technology really shining through.  There is a realistic physics engine that allows in-game objects to react to the players' (and other characters') actions - gun fire may dislodge boxes, doors and walls can be smashed apart...in a more gruesome touch blood and viscera has a tendency to splatter and stain the environment.  Aurally, the effects are crisp and detailed.  There is a huge amount of spoken dialogue, with multiple variations depending on who you `are' and what you say - coupled with multiple endings this game has oodles of replay value.System-wise, you'll need a decent rig to play this game.  I've recently upgraded my system to cope with Half-Life 2, and this game runs smoothly on what I would consider mid to high settings - 32bit color depth, 1280x960 resolution, mid-range sound etc.  My system is a P4 2.6 with a gig of ram and a 9600 pro graphics card.  If Doom 3 proved completely unplayable on your system then you'll find this over your head as well, but the game seems a little more scaleable than Doom, with more allowance for the average machine.  One thing you will need is plenty of free hard drive space - a gig+ if you like to have as much as possible on the drive.In the spirit of great games like Deus Ex, this game is going to appeal to both straight up action and RPG gamers, as well as any fans of the 'Vampire' series, who'll flip for the great attention to detail and the immersive visuals.  It's difficult to suppress a smile when you're slinking through alleys, vaulting over high walls and slitting the throats of your vampire and supernatural foes, or going in gun's blazing with your Uzi and katana combo!  This is certainly not a game for either kids, or the faint hearted; but for anyone who thinks having a taste for claret and no pulse sounds cool, this is the game for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00095LIC0","reviewerName":"Madisen","summary":"Another A+ DS title","reviewText":"Nintendo's on a roll with quality DS games. WarioWare and Pac Pix were clever, unique and fun, and now along comes another classic icon: Kirby. Once again, the transition to touch-screen is made in fine style, with a delicious mix of challenge, fun, and creativity.The control is everything that the DS will eventually become famous for: intuitive, fresh, and perfectly executed. Although it mainly consists of drawing lines and tapping objects, you can use these techniques in innumerable ways. Dead-on physics are also a helpful touch: the more steep your lines are, the more speed Kirby needs to reach the top.Level design is flat-out brilliant. While some stages look similar, each one requires different skills and strategies. Unlike the GBA Kirby games, real brainpower is needed to figure out what to do. It's made even more deep by the fact that you can absorb enemy's abilities to get by certain obstacles. Often, you'll need to get a certain power, and then carefully avoid losing it until you get to the area where it's usable. Not that it's all head over heart; there are plenty of moments where pure speed and a precise hand will rule the day. It doesn't take uber-gaming skills, but you can't just mindlessly run through it either.The main game is a pretty quick play, but like WarioWare, the true fun is in the extras. By looking carefully around stages, completing time trials, or finishing a level with a minimal amount of drawing, you can earn up to 250 medals. Collecting them becomes insanely addictive, and is a meaty, satisfying challenge without being overly frustrating (I only consider myself an above-average gamer, but I still managed to get 231 of them). And they're not just for show: you can spend them on new songs, extra life bars, different-colored ink, and even extra characters.Game Informer hit the nail on the head: if you invested in a DS, you must purchase a copy of this.

When first hearing about Metal Gear Rising Revengeance, I was in huge doubt of the games success in capturing the essence of what makes all MGS games great. Metal Gear RISING isn't a Metal Gear SOLID game, it is a spin-off in venturing the story of the bait-and-switch protagonist Raiden and exploring his character a little bit more. Rising comepletely veers off from the taditional stealth action gameplay to a hack-and-slash mayhem that fits Raiden's cyborg ninja persona. This game takes place approximately 4 years after Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots where the war economy has shifted into being a mere business (what else is new) and there is a new terrorist group trying to eclipse the world with new ideals and comeplete control. While this game is developed by Platinum Games, Hideo Kojima and Kojima Productions oversaw the storyline making sure it fits into the Metal Gear Universe the best way possible without tainting the credibility of the characters; and while I think the ending product could have been better, I thought they did a decent job of creating an engaging storyline from beginning to end (despite its flaws).Pros:- Gameplay is incredible, (although not traditional Metal Gear) the swift hack and slash gameplay has been 100 times over in countless games before it, but Kojima developed an innovative style of gameplay that I;m sure many games in the future will try to replicate. The concept of being able to cut practically everything in sight, and to have comeplete control of the blade is pretty damn cool. The new over the top gameplay is different, but it is quite entertaining. And for all you Metal Gear purest, there are old MGS elements of stealth snuck into this game such as the iconic hiding in cardboard boxes, or just sneaking behind enemies and killing them before you get seen by the enemies and it goes into Alert mode.- Graphics are pretty incredible, Platinum Games did a great job creating easy on the eyes environments and having a diversity of levels.- Characters - The main character Raiden has been a polarizing favorite for Metal Gear fans. Every since his introduction in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, fans have either hated him or tolerated him; and ever since Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots when he transformed into the new cyborg ninja, fans have either loved him or hated to admit he has turned into a cool badass. In this new game, he is more confident and a very different person from MGS4. The bosses in this game all have something going for them and have distinct personalities especially Samuel, which would be Raidens arch nemesis in this game. And just to make sure this game actually connects with the other metal gear games, they added Sunny for a little cameo which was very cool and relieving to know this game is canon.Cons:- The story can be very silly at times. Although the story has a decent theme that fits in with all the Metal Gear games, how it unveils is completely anti-climactic. And for all of you hardcore Metal Gear fans wondering; RISING is in fact Canon and is a continuation of the main Metal Gear storyline. For some that may be bittersweet, but for me personally, I will buy any Metal Gear game that is canon. (Unlike Metal Gear Ac!d) Luckily this game is actually pretty good.- Without spoiling anything, I thought the final boss was total crap. Not memorable nor interesting.- The length of the game runs for about 5-7 hours depending on the difficulty. I expected at least 8 hours of gameplay and storyline.- Voice Acting - was a comeplete hit or miss. Some characters voice actors fit for the most part such as Raidens crew and the return of Sunny's voice actor, but everyone else...mehhhhh. The villains sounded so cliche' and idiotic, especially the voice actor of Sundowner.- The Camera angle for this game would work for the most part at least 8/10 of the times. But there are instances where the camera would lose focus on the enemy and just go to some random place.Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is a pretty good game that is able to hold its own. For all the Metal Gear fans out there, I'm not gonna lie, you might hate this game for what it is. But personlly as an MGS fan myself, I found this game enjoyable and fun all around, albeit not up to par with the other Metal Gear games. But if you're willing to give it a chance, you might be surprised of how well executed this game actually is. With that being said, I hope this will be the FIRST and LAST Metal Gear Rising Kojima decides to create. Its a good game, but I hope Hideo Kojima will just focus on Metal Gear SOLID from now on and leave Raidens character alone. If he does so happen to create another RISING game, I hope it will revolve Frank Jaeger's character AKA Gray Fox.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SWUTQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Maek","summary":"Bravo, Visceral!","reviewText":"When I first came across Dead Space, it was back when I got my PS3 back in 2010 and was looking for something inexpensive to play.  I saw Dead Space was a greatest hits and at $19.99, why not??  I played the game at 1 a.m. and after 30 minutes, I stopped and walked around my house turning lights on everywhere.  I was 37 years old and the game had actually scared me senseless.  The sound design was superb and my Pioneer Elite receiver was more than eager to deliver the scares.  Dead Space 2 was a superb follow-up which follows the unwitting Isaac battling Necromorphs again and a newly constructed Marker.So Dead Space 3 was announced and I was initially hesitant.  Dead Space 3 co-op?  I groaned and thought about Resident Evil 5/6; having a \"partner\" in those games detracted from the sense of dread, knowing that someone had my \"back.\"  However, I started hearing more and gradually warmed up to the concept.  Now that it's finally here, I have to say that I love the game overall.First and foremost, know that Dead Space 3 can still be experienced as a single player.  Secondly, Dead Space is to Alien as Dead Space 3 is to Aliens - I saw that another reviewer had echoed the same sentiment and I heartily agree.  Dead Space 3 definitely moves a lot faster than its predecessors, but there are still moments of the original Dead Space such as Isaac's exploration of a 200-year old derelict spacecraft.Gameplay has significantly changed compared to Dead Space and Dead Space 2.  The most notable change has to be the replacement of stores/money with pure crafting.  No more of this collecting money nonsense - now you actually have to scavenge for scrap parts, materials, and components to build weapons, improve weapons, improve your RIG, build ammo, and build med packs.  It makes exploration/scavenging extremely important now and lends itself to the whole survival aspect that we all love about Dead Space.  Also, don't like the weapon that you crafted?  Need more materials to craft something else?  Scrap your existing weapon, ammo, and/or health packs to make other things!  The combinations are endless and although the learning curve is a little high at first, it's rewarding.  Also, don't expect one weapon to do your job throughout; you'll come across several beasties where a different weapon (or weapons!) might work better whereas the other weapons that you crafted for smaller targets merely whittles down something larger.  That's the other nice thing about crafting too is that you can actually have top/bottom components...so perhaps you have an assault rifle on top with an underslung flame thrower?  Or something that delivers a kinetic blow to damage/knock back foes?  It's very well-created and the replay value just based on crafting below is immense.  True, ammo is universal, but given the numerous weapon combinations, it would have made level design considerably difficult tracking various ammo types as well...it's a minor \"minus\" for me.  If you want to play it so that it's harder, start off on a harder difficulty from scratch; Visceral will reward you accordingly.Graphically, Dead Space 3 is eye candy.  When my TV blipped that it was still in 1080p mode, I held my breath.  Dead Space 3 preferring 1080p mode?  I was dreading framerate issues, tearing, texture pop-up, etc.  I'm happy to say that NONE of that has happened.  The surroundings look exquisite and there are subtle touches that lend itself quite nicely such as the light emitted from Isaac's helmet - it actually illuminates his surroundings in the slit-like shapes that it forms!  It's a very subtle detail, but it really, REALLY helps to emphasize that Isaac is in a dark environment and helps to enhance the feeling that Isaac is exploring a derelict spacecraft.As for co-op mode, having a buddy there working with you helps to ease the tension, but Visceral will throw more at you.  What helps to make it more terrifying, however, is that Carver is not exactly as stable as you'd like him to be.  He will suffer from Marker hallucinations that he will see but Isaac can't.  Having an unstable partner at your side is a little unnerving as a result.  That, and a 14-15 hour single player campaign turns into 4 hours of additional content and slightly different story elements with co-op enabled.  The game experience is different as a result and it's refreshing to see it as a reward to experience it rather than a terror-detracting option.  CAPCOM could have taken a page out of Visceral's book when they botched Resident Evil 5/6.Even after having played Dead Space 1/2, there were still a few moments in Dead Space 3 even after all that I've experienced that managed to scare me pretty good.  There are new Necromorph breeds and some Necromorphs that I've dismembered at the legs (USED to be my favorite tactic) will sprout additional tentacles to fire at me despite their lack of mobility.  I'm also finding Lurkers a little harder to take down before...and some of the standard Necromorphs move a LOT faster.  Some of the newer breeds are terrifying as well, but I'll leave those surprises to you.As for story, I won't spoil that much either except to tell you that the action picks up very quickly as EarthGov soldiers Norton and Carver find Isaac and inform him that Ellie has gone missing in her quest to find a means of ending Markers once and for all.  Isaac's relationship with Ellie has failed because he's a man broken psychologically by his ordeals.  However, knowing Isaac, you can sense that he doesn't want to have Ellie suffer the same fate as his previous girlfriend, Nicole and so the action starts amidst the chaos of a Unitologist uprising on a lunar colony.  Isaac faces human as well as Necromorph foes which makes gameplay interesting to say the least as you alternate between ducking for cover and returning fire, rolling (yes, rolling!) out of the way as a huge lumbering Necromoph tries to pulverize you, and backing away as quickly as you can as a Necromorph horde threatens to overwhelm you.Sure, it's action-packed, but there are still original Dead Space elements interspersed throughout.  Let me put it this way.  If you loved the movies Alien and Aliens, then you will welcome what Dead Space 3 has to offer vis a vis Dead Space.  I personally love the changes immensely and look forward to replaying it several times.  Well done!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2013"}

Thank you.  Some people don't have an internet connection and others (like myself) don't have a high speed connection so games that require STEAM are not playable.The game is sold as an action/rpg but the role playing features are minimal.  There is no choice of sex, race or class.  You can't customize your character at all.  There are no attributes like Strength, Dexterity, etc.  A very limited number of skills can be selected as you proceed through the game.  You don't get to loot fallen enemies (except for a few weapons).  Economics seems to be nonexistent.You must play in first person perspective.  The game is totally linear (at least as far as I played which admittedly wasn't far).  There is no free-style exploration.  The game just proceeds from one \"scene\" to the next.  You have an objective and must complete it successfully before you can move on.  Fail and you just have to keep playing it over and over until you succeed.  Checkpoint saves are made automatically although you can save manually at any point.  Fairly early in the game I reached a scene that could be described as a jumping game which was also timed.  (take too long and you fail and have to start over)  I hate trying to jump in first person perspective.  After a number of failures I just gave up and quit the game.On the plus side, the graphics and audio were fine.  The environment had many interactive elements.  You could pick up and throw things, kick enemies off ledges or against spikes (why would there be so many walls with spikes projecting from them?), etc.In summary, the game was not at all what I expected from a rpg.  If you like linear, first person perspective games with a lot of jumping then this would be a decent game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2012"}

Sega Genesis made its debut in 1989 and the console came with the game Altered Beast. Some games still look pretty decent today with sharp and colorful graphics. There are 28 genesis games in this collection with 5 more unlockable. It baffles me that Sega don't make a true arcade collection.... or mix more arcade games in this collection and name it Sega Hits or whatever. This Genesis collection is much better than the horrendous Sega Classics Collection from last year.There are too many action platform games in this collection therefore most games have similar gameplay. Its sad that Streets of Rage, Space Harrier, Outrun and Revenge of Shinobi are not in this collection.Here are the games:Alex Kidd in The Enchanted Castle, 1989: A zany action/platformer, nice graphics. Good game.Altered Beast, 1989: The game that came with the original system, a mythological brawler. Great game.Bonanza Bros., 1991: Action/platformer, horrible game.Columns, 1990: A puzzle game similar to Tetris, horrible game.Comix Zone, 1995: A brawler/platform game, you go from 'box' to 'box' like reading a comic and beat up few enemies.

And please don't let the 4 rating scare you away. These are excellent games. They look great, sound great, and have some unique ideas (for the time they were made) which are generally executed with a high level of success. One great thing about this collection is that these are all pretty different titles. So if you don't like the one you're playing, simply switch to another. Trophies come fast and don't require any outrageous feats in order to obtain the platinums. You'll just be playing the games and enjoying the experience of doing so.So, why the 4? Well, the offering still suffers in ways which weren't even forgivable at the time of their release. While the games will often remind you of Mario's amazing 3D platforming romps, the camera will soon feel like your worst enemy later in the progression of each game. Also, I had forgotten just how much these depend on the use of double-jumps. Those are neat to include here and there, but 9 out of every 10 jumps seems a bit much.Again though, that isn't to say that these are bad games. They aren't. They're simply flawed in ways you're going to notice. Beyond these flaws however are some truly wonderful games that deserve your attention. So do not skip this one.

Join the Color Revolutionaries to refine your skills while making a mess. The race to rescue Chroma City has just begun, and only de Blob can save the world from a black-and-white future.Gameplay: de Blob's Primary Goalde Blobis a 3D platformer where players use the Wii Remote/Nunchuck combo to maneuver their hero, de Blob. Equal parts amorphous blob of paint, struggling artist, revolutionary and juvenile delinquent, de Blob's goal is to replace the drab, lifeless gray coloring that the I.N.K.T. Corporation has imposed on Chroma City and its inhabitants, the Raydians, with a range of vibrant life-giving colors, all the while avoiding and battling the gray-clad forces of the Inkies.Players must acquire paint and hurl de Blob at the buildings, walls, statues, roads and skies above Chroma City. As de Blob bounces around, adding color wherever he lands, his supply of paint is depleted and he begins to dry out. As this happens players must collect more paint and rehydrate in pools and in front of hydrants scattered across the city. As the game starts access is limited to the colors red, blue and yellow, but these can be blended to create a number of other colors. Being able to create and apply these colors becomes important as Chroma City and its inhabitants come to life, and de Blob makes contact with a range of other characters known as the 'Color Revolutionaries' and receives an increasing amount of missions that charge him with splattering color all over town. Success at these mission gains the player point which drives the game forward, eventually leading to a direct assault on Comrade Black's I.N.K.T. fortress guarded by elite Inky soldiers and massive ink turrets.Key Game Features:de Blob- Flip, bounce and paint your way past the all-powerful I.N.K.T. Corporation to launch a revolution and save Chroma City from a future without vibrant color.Long Live Color!- Join the Color Revolutionaries in the resistance against the evil Comrade Black and his diabolical array of hot plates, electric shocks, and ink turrets.Free the Citizens- Free your friends from a black and white world by dodging ink cannons, flattening I.N.K.T. tanks and outsmarting Inky soldiers.Save your City- Remix Chroma City&rsquo;s towering skyscrapers, expansive bridges and massive landmarks in your own style using custom paints, patterns and soundtracks.Make a Mess- Super-size your blob as you splash, spray, and splatter everything you touch in sprint, race and combat challenges.Multiplayer- Compete for control as ink levels rise and wind cannons fire in eight multiplayer-specific gameplay modes.Plenty of Play Modesde Blobfeatures both a deep story-driven singleplayer mode where players get to dig into the Raydian's struggle against all-powerful I.N.K.T. Corporation, as well as a diverse range of multiplayer options. These multiplayer campaigns support up to four players, come with street and sewer maps and include four player split-screen functionality. Just a few of the multiplayer campaigns include:Paint Match- Paint as many buildings as possible and steal points from opponents by re-painting the buildings that they've already covered.Blob on the Run- A variation of 'Capture the Flag,' in this mode only one blob can paint and is pursued by opponents who attempt to slam him into submission and gain the ability to paint and accumulate points themselves.Blob Race- In this mode buildings can only be painted once and are indicated by in-game arrow. With time limited it's a race not only to paint the town but also to keep opponents from doing the same.","reviewerName":"Don Walton Jr.","summary":"Support Good Games...","reviewText":"DeBlob is a game that has always LOOKED great.  Through screenshots and early gameplay footage, it's always looked like a very promising title.  Even the box art LOOKS great, but with the power of current gen consoles, a lot of games can look great, and play horribly.  DeBlob thankfully lives up to its style and graphical prowess.  The game is just as fun as it looks like it would be.You play the part of a paint ball, jumping around a gray world, painting the town red (or green, yellow, orange, etc.)  Meanwhile the evil 'Inkies' are dead set on keeping things dull and rubbing you out.  The people of a the world are depressed and oppressed, and it's up to you and an underground group of rebels to set them free.The game is just FUN.  It's great fun jumping from building to building slopping paint around everywhere you go.  Even on the load screen, you can point the wiimote at the screen and doodle while you're waiting.  The game just oozes with personality.  It's got the dry sense of humor of the Rabbids games, or early Lucasarts titles.  There are lots of challenges set up along the way (ie. paint 50 buildings yellow in 60 seconds, etc.) to keep things interesting, or you can just explore and try to paint all the tree, buildings or townsfolk before the (generous) timer runs out.My only knock is the lack of a jump button.  It's something many players have mentioned.  You jump by flicking the wiimote down, and while it works, its just not as accurate as a button press.  The controls are very responsive however and this is only a slight setback.DeBlob is easy enough for children, and at the same time offers enough extra challenges for any level of gamer, and is an all around great family game.  It's a clear 'must own' title for the Wii and one that should not be overlooked.  I hope gamers will choose to support DeBlob so publishers will take more risks with titles like this!  No more shovelware!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00008DHNL","reviewerName":"Miketheratguy","summary":"Fun, free-roaming urban action for a cheap price.","reviewText":"THE SHORT: A free-roaming game similar to Grand Theft Auto but with enough personality and uniqueness to stand on its own. A clich&eacute;d storyline and some control issues mar things, but its addictive gameplay and flexible mission style make it worth playing.THE LONG: When this game was released, some unfairly called it a GTA clone. Sure they're both about grabbing any car that comes along and moving about a large city, taking on missions and causing havoc. But True Crime is definitely different. To begin with, in TC you star as a police officer, and your missions revolve around trying to solve an increasingly complex case. And unlike GTA, your role as a \"good guy pushed to the edge\" allows you to play as a good or bad cop depending on your actions. Being good (not killing people or attacking innocent civilians, etc) earns you higher rewards that allow the purchase of dozens of upgrades to your character, guns, and cars. But being bad takes away those points, and if you want any of the better stuff you have to work back up. The nice thing about True Crime is that you're allowed to play both ways, whenever you choose. Street crimes happen regularly, and it's up to you how you handle every one of them.Similarly unique to this game is the mission structure, which is actually better than GTA. In that series, once you're on a mission you either fail or succeed, and while there are sometimes more than one place at a time to get missions, if you can't beat them then you're stuck to keep trying. In TC, you're often given the choice to keep playing the storyline even if you fail. On these occasions you're given an alternate cinema scene and may even have a slightly different next mission. This will eventually usually lead you to one of the more negative endings, but it's way better than just hitting the wall of a tough mission and playing it repeatedly until you get it right. It should also be noted that, unlike GTA, you can replay any mission in the game at any time.One similarity to GTA is the way these goals are set up. In both games you are introduced to the mission by way of a cinema scene, and then you are given control to access your next goal, usually at your own pace. In both games you're free to roam around and steal cars or rough up civilians, but this is another instance in which TC is, at least, more flexible than GTA: In this game, events such as driving to a bar, having a fight, then chasing a fleeing suspect are each their own individual events. This means that, with the option to replay a level anytime, if you got killed chasing that suspect you can just replay that part instead of starting over all the way back at square one, the \"driving to a bar\" segment. And being that the game auto-saves after every successful mission segment, you're constantly making progress and can pick up where you left off and leave chasing that suspect until after dinner. Some would argue that this makes the game a little too easy, which is true- Vice City and San Andreas are more difficult. But they're also more frustrating sometimes.Aside from the story, the meat of the game boils down to what you're doing between missions. Personally this is my favorite part of the game. For one thing, you get a giant scale version of Los Angeles and all its suburbs. I'm not from California but I was stranded on an L.A. street corner at 3 am, and I was able to locate this very intersection in the game, looking very accurate. In this large city, you can pat down citizens for contraband or attack them outright at the touch of a button, or if that's not your bag then you can wander on foot or in a car and take on the random street crimes. About once every thirty seconds or so, there will be armed muggers to bust, stolen buses to stop, street races to interrupt, and so on. And again, it's up to you to either do it right (shooting that mugger in the arm) or get some bad cop points (shooting the mugger in the head through the victim's torso). The freedom to roam and have this power and take on these endless crimes is, in my opinion, addictive thanks to the fluid animation, smooth controls, and unpredictability of each situation. Sometimes that catfight will turn into a full-on gun battle, and again, it's up to you how to handle it. A stat menu keeps track of your every action, so you can see just how many of those people you frisked were carrying (with a percentage display of how good your guesswork is).Lastly, the game's presentation. The graphics are pretty good and the animation smooth, even though it's a couple years old at the time of this writing. There's loads of dialogue that's synched up well, though much of it is straight out of B level hard-boiled cop movies. It's tongue in cheek, but I couldn't help laughing when an important character leapt in front of me in dramatic slow-mo while yelling \"Noooo\" and taking a bullet. The sound effects are pretty crisp, but the music is straight-up rap unless you get the Xbox version and use your own soundtrack. The controls are decent (with a much more thorough martial arts fighting system than anything out of GTA) but the camera is almost always a pain. It's movable, but it almost never seems to stay where you want it as you run around the streets changing directions.In all, if you're a fan of action games or GTA then you should give this game a shot (Spider-Man 2, by the same team, share some similarities with this game as well). It's older now so you can find it for ten bucks or less, which at 10-30 hours of gameplay is not bad at all.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2005"}
{"product_name":"B001CRM3RI","description":"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Warsis the highly anticipated first game in theGTAfranchise designed for play on the Nintendo DS. But although it comes in a small package, this is a full-fledged game that stands on its own. With an all-new, deep story that approaches the familiar sights and sounds of the infamous Liberty City from a different perspective, an innovative control system and multiplayer options,Chinatown Warscaptures the tone and flavors of the long-runningGTAseries in unique ways that both longtime players and those coming to it for the first time will find hard to put down..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Grand Theft Auto:Chinatown WarsPlayers:Offline: 1; Online: 2Gameplay Modes:Single player; competitive &amp; coop multiplayer via Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.Kick some tail as Huang Lee.View larger.Use the DS stylus like never before.View larger.Reconquer Liberty via PDA.View larger.The Story: Left for Dead in the Worst Place in AmericaFollowing his father&rsquo;s murder, Huang Lee is given what seems a simple mission: to deliver an ancient sword to his Uncle Kenny to ensure his family retains control of the Triad gangs of Liberty City. Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement. While driving players also have access to five in-game radio stations and use of their weapons. Your PDA provides efficient management tools for your growing crime empire, including quick weapons switching, a running total of available cash, in-game e-mail and Internet access and nearly instant game saves any time. The control scheme inChinatown Warsutilizes an easy to use and comfortable to play combination of steering via the D-pad, choice of action through the face buttons and/or stylus taps and manual and automatic weapon locks and unlocks via shoulder buttons.Key Game Features:The Largest DS Game Ever- Contemporary Liberty City is a massive world complete with pedestrians, weather and traffic patterns, five different radio stations and four different sprawling boroughs to explore.Endless Gameplay- Mature storyline with over 70+ story missions; plus dozens of side quests, collectibles, contextual mini-games and the all new mission replay feature.Street Economics- Addictive drug dealing side game with 6 different drug types, 80+ drug dealers and a supply / demand driven narcotics economy.Play with Friends- Nintendo Wi-Fi mode for head-to-head and co-op multiplayer mayhem.Bragging Rights- Chat, trade guns and commodities with your friends, and compete for glory via online tournaments and leaderboards on the Rockstar Games Social Club.PDA Interface- Use the touch screen as a PDA device to set GPS waypoints, change radio stations, communicate via e-mail with in-game characters and order weapons on the Internet.Online Bragging Rights and MultiplayerCare has been taken to ensure that players can share theirChinatown Warsexperiences with friends and fellow players in different ways.

Ramos","summary":"Best God of War Game Yet!","reviewText":"I never thought I'd say this, but after playing Ghost of Sparta for the last 5 hours and completing it, I can honestly say I think this is the best God of War title yet in the whole series! It might sound crazy to even think about comparing it on the same level as it's home console predecesors, but it really does stack up and here's why.Gameplay:The gameplay in the game was phenomenal in every way. The enemies were tough and relentless, and the finishing moves were brutal. The new Magic was actually useful, while in the other titles I rarely used them in battle. The extra weapons (or weapon in GoS' case) is fun to use as well as refreshingly original in feel. The boss fights felt titanic, yet flowed well and offered very satisfying climaxes. Overall the gameplay was fluid and smooth, with no rough patches or annoyances to speak of.Graphics:Let's be honest, it's the PSP, there's only so much it can do. But for all it's limitations, Ready At Dawn has made good use of the PSP's graphics processor and must have done all they could to exhaust the framerate. It looks amazing for a PSP title, but it can in no way compare to it's PS3 brethren. That said, GoS is still sure to please with it's mix of scenic landscapes and brutal up-close finishing moves.Story:Now here's where this game truly shines. I've played a lot of PSP games and so far none of them have had any memorable storylines, until now. The story in GoS can only be described as cinematic. It plays and feels like you're watching a movie. A good movie with great acting and interesting characters. I tend to play games for short sustained periods of time, usually cause I lose interest in about an hour. But GoS compelled me to continue playing to see how Kratos' story would unfold. Without a doubt, GoS has the best storyline of any GoW game or any game in general I've played since Uncharted 2, and that's saying something.I enjoyed this game immensely, but the thing I loved the most when I finally finished it, was the fact that it showed that a good developer can make create an impacting gaming experience on any system, despite technical limitations. So there's no excuse for developers to make shoddy games just because they're on the Wii or the DS or the PSP. This game shows that a truly talented game designer can create an awe inspiring game on any platform.

It's loads of fun, and you play different battles for a change.  I'll list some good and bad below.Bad Stuff:1) Short: As other reviews have noted, I was surprised by the short game time.  I wasn't paying attention, but I beat in two days (let's say 10 hours of play, tops).  After finishing the epic Half Life 2 lately, this was pretty bad.2) Not much of a sequel: This game seems to follow the Halo 2 system of sequels.  Much as Halo 2 really was just a short, over hyped attempt at a massive Halo online game (and just a short, cheap rehashing of the first Halo for the single player), COD2 feels the same.  The multiplayer is a BLAST, but it feels like that was the real design here instead of the single player stuff.Middle Ground Stuff:1) Graphics: The graphics aren't bad, but they didn't blow me away. I liked the look of it, but again, recent efforts are a leap ahead of this graphically.  The smoke effects are AWESOME and very helpful for game play, so the game isn't without innovation, but they lacked the crisp texture of Half Life 2 (not to be a fanboy).2) Linear Game Play: Some reviewers are complaining about linear game play.  Well, guess what, it's a shooter with a story line, so I didn't expect anything different.  You have to follow certain cues.  The levels are rather large with a short load time, and if they were more expansive or the story harder to follow, the game play would suffer.  The action is great, and the objectives are always crystal clear, so no complaints about the linear game play.  I hate shooters where I'm wandering around wondering what to do next, and this never happened here.  I always knew where to go, and if linear game play is the price I pay, it's a welcome price.  This genre doesn't lean to open ended game play, so I think this like complaining there's not enough violence in a romantic comedy.3) AI: The AI is mixed.  At times, you get pre-generated Nazis perched out waiting to ambush you, but sometimes if you charge a building, the flank you and pull off some nasty surprises.  If you charge the same building on a re-play, you'll not they use totally different tactics.  Even throwing grenades isn't a sure thing since sometimes they throw back.  You get a mix of good and bad AI here pending on the level and circumstance.Good Stuff:1) Health System: COD2 avoids the unrealistic magical health packs that heal you and put you back in the fray perfectly healthy (where's the realism there?!).  Instead, you can suffer a certain amount of damage right away and still live.  If it's too much damage all at once, you die (a grenade, a torso or head shot, etc).  However, if it's a small wound, your vision gets screwy, and your aim gets worse, and you recoup in a few seconds if you can take cover.  Repeated hits, though, and you die on the spot.  It enhances the crouch, lay, stand system by making cover make a real difference.  It feels rather like a Halo \"force field\" system, and it works well.  Instead of watching a health bar and scrounging for band aids, you use your head and stay frosty, and you'll survive a firefight.  The health system makes you think instead of waste time doubling back for that health pack you left at the Nazi desk three building back.  Well done, great game play.2) New Battles: While staples such as Stalingrad and D-Day are there, you play a different part of those battles.  You do a lot of the African campaign and some unique European battles you haven't done before.  The battles on Hill 402 at the bunker are pretty awesome.  I've seldom been as engaged by a WWII shooter as I was killing mortar teams and fighting a mounting Nazi advance, scrounging for ammo during brief lulls.  Well done.Overall, this game is great.  It's short, so you may wait for it to drop 10 bucks, but the online play more than makes up for the brief nature of the single player.  If you're a WWII shooter fan, this is a must for your collection.  You'll have a good time and enjoy some COD2 mechanics.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2005"}

Its gives off a great vibe as you play them. No one can ever match this. Yes, all other game systems and games not made by Nintendo are GREAT, this is true. But they still don't feel the way Nintendo feels. They always put effort into their releases, and you know what I have never been let down. So when they drop a game, you bet your ass its gonna be good, so go ahead and pay full price. Because trust me honey, Nintendo games never drop in price. Hit up eBay if your smart.Wario Land: Shake It is no exception to Nintendo's quality. Released on the Wii in September 2008, it actually went under the radar. That's right, this first party Nintendo game, which is very good, just breezed by gamers. Most don't know it exists, and that's a damn shame, because this game is truly a fun gem. You got to add this fire to your collection.Its actually a remake of a GBA game. Yeah, sounds horrible. But Nintendo are great at what they do, and they made the game wonderful. Everything is redrawn, and the graphics are beautiful. The bosses look insane, the levels are diverse, and Wario's movements are fluid and colorful. It's a side scroller, and you hold the Wiimote on its side and use it like an NES controller. The directional pad moves you left and right, 1 does Wario's smash, and 2 jumps. You will shake the Wiimote for everything else. And shaking you will do... The game is full of opportunities to shake that thing like never before.It's a side scroller, and you just go from one end of the stage to the next. When you make it to the end, you have to shake this cage that releases this fairy thing. Then you race back to the start of the level before the time runs out to win. Don't worry, its not hard at all. In fact, other than a few annoying boss fights, this game is quite easy. That is, if you just wanna make it to the end of the levels. When you start trying to do the many missions the game offers, that's when it gets HARD as hell. The game changes from casual to hardcore in a matter of minutes. Only the most truly dedicated will be able to tackle all of this game's challenges. I know for one I didn't bother with most of them as I was getting frustrated far too often. I still had fun just beating the levels though, and that's what its all about.There are 5 worlds, with 4 levels in each world, as well as a Boss fight at the end of each. There is also a final boss at the end. The levels take from 5 to 10 minutes to beat. There are many coins to get in the levels, and you will want to do this. Instead of just adding to your score, you need to collect coins to continue on in the game. You see, you must enter the Pirate shop and buy the new Area map to go to the next world. This is a feature I found rather annoying as many times after I beat a world I wouldn't have enough coins so I had to go back and play old levels just to get more. Not that big of a deal, but it still should have just been like classic Nintendo games, where after you beat a world, you go on to the next. Not having to backtrack throughout the place like we're playing Metal Gear Solid! Haha.Each stage has its own music and its not very memorable. Its not horrible, but the music isn't something you will remember about this game. The sound effects are cool though. As you shake bags of money, a shaking sound will come out of your Wiimote. Now that's technology!There is obviously a lot to do if you want 100%. I have read of a few people achieving this and their patience must be on a high caliber, because you will fail and fail again. But if you can stop yourself from getting so mad that you quit, then go for it I say! I just know the missions weren't for me. The actual game, however, was great and I don't regret it one bit. Add this underrated gem to your collection and let Wario have his shine.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2010"}

But since this is a review I have to say more.  MvC series goes back a long time to PS1 and I loved those games, so my expectations were very high for this game.  And this game is absolutely wicked, first of all I have to talk about the game has the same tag team feature like the past games so no worries on that.  This time the fighters are 3D which really set them out from the stage and environment , the gameplay is slower than the ones of the past and you have 3 attack buttons like Tatsunoko vs. Capcom if you have a Wii.  When playing this game the fighters and their moves are so fluid and precise, I can imagine if these people were real that's how they'd do it because they look so good doing it.  Now for the fighters there's 36 of them plus 2 if you got DLC for preordering so the list is shorter than MvC2, the list is awesome some fighters made it that I didn't think would like: Taskmaster, Super-Skrull, Albert Wesker and Chris Redfield from Resident Evil and I can't forget one of my favorites X-23 she's better than Wolverine and they dropped fighters such as Venom, Captain Commando and Gambit but it's hard to focus on the negative.  Of course you got your usual fighters like Ryu, Hulk, Captain America and Chun li.  The combos are incredible the whole linking, juggling, tagging in and out and the versatility of the combos are spectacular. Then the Hyper Combos how they have improved are really great even linking them are cool and how some of them make good counters and anti-air attacks like Iron Man cannon now can be angled for a jumper as well as Ryu's hadokens.  I can't spoil it for you because I can talk about this game for hours. You know Capcom is truly on a hot streak with fighting games they hit hard with SF4 then SSF4  and of course Tatsunoko vs. Capcom on wii all of these were perfect.  So for my review:  GAMEPLAY 5stars this feels/handle better than previous MvCs and the combos are better too , GRAPHICS 5stars this game is 3D and looks beautiful, FIGHTERS 5stars they improved on an already great roster, ONLINE 5stars some minor drops here and there but what multiplayer doesn't have that.

However, if you are really into gaming or you constantly find yourself entering sequences of keystrokes, this mouse can save you a lot of time.Every button on the mouse is programmable. Sure, you get the expected buttons - left, right, and middle mouse buttons, as well as two buttons pre-programmed to forward and back - but even these can be reprogrammed via Logitech's easy-to-use utility, which is a ~50MB download you get from logitech.com (the exact address is included with the mouse). I often use copy/paste (CTRL + C then CTRL + V), which I can now do with two mouse clicks. I also appreciated not having *another* driver/utility disc to keep.I found the mouse itself very ergonomic, and the plethora of buttons takes some getting used to but eventually feel comfortable. The one thing I'm not a huge fan of is the scroll wheel - after almost two weeks of using it it still acts like it has a mind of its own, sometimes continuing to scroll for a split-second after I've stopped, and the force required to press it (for the middle mouse button feature) is far greater than any other button on the mouse.Setup was incredibly easy, but when I went to use the online registration this model of mouse wasn't available yet (as of 5 p.m. May 9, 2013) and there's no \"other\" option.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2013"}

I'd read the reviews for this game and thought it might be interesting.  Now I can see why the \"Just Dance\" games are so popular, they're so much fun!  Up to four people can play or you can just play by yourself.  You just follow the dancers on the screen and do what they're doing and earn points when you get it right.  There are 30 some songs so it'll take a long time to learn all the routines well enough to get lots of points and to not look silly trying to follow along.  Some of our favorites were, Who Let the Dogs Out, Fame, Mashed Potato Time, and Surfin' Bird.  It's really fun to get four people playing (you need 4 Wiimotes) but it's even more fun to watch, especially when they all get it sorta right.This game is great exercise and a great aerobic workout. I had sore shoulders and arms the next morning.  (And a bruise on my shin from running into the coffee table).  It would be a great party game or fun even if you're by yourself.  It's easy enough for anyone of just about any age to pick up a Wiimote and play, kind of like some of the early sports games that came with the Wii.

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Vicente Drago \"Shaun O'Donnell\"","summary":"A canidate for game of the year","reviewText":"Kingdom Hearts is one of those ideas that many gamers question why?  For one thing you ae merging Final Fantasy with Disney, two very opposite entities with one thing in common, the ability to tell a story and do it well (although both are on a slight slide).  This combination however is brilliant.  We have inside a very deep game with a story that is disney style (as in good feature films such as Beuty and the BEast, Aladdin, and Tarzan).The story revolves around Sora, a young boy who lives on an island.  His best friends are Riku and KAri.  Also on the island are Selphi, Tidus, and Wakka.  They are a group of friends who enjoy life.  But when the mysteriouse HEartless attacks the island Sora becoems the Key MAster.  He later teams up with Donald and Goofey to search for King Mickey, Sora's friends, and the Princess's.The graphics are nothing short of Spectacular.  The music is very well done, and the story is amazing.  The combat system is very well concieved as well.  YOu have full control at all times and it's like an action RPG.  THis game reminded me after a short while of another underrated square game, Brave Fencer Musashi.Over all many will agree with me by saying that this is nothing short of spectacular.  As for the one guy who stated that this will turn off die hard RPG fans, let me say this.  I have played Dragon Warrior Series, Secret of Mana, and all the Final Fantasies, I have played Might and Magic, Zelda, Wizardy, and numerosue other titles on the PS1. But this is the best RPG I have played in the past 3 years, the last tiem I had this much fun with an RPG was when I first got Final Fantasy 7.  A true gamer does not discriminate because of what it is but gives it poor review if it is truely a piece of garbage (Grand Theft Auto 2).Square created magic once again, and I hope it stays that way.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2002"}

Players fought human beings and alien hordes and other various types of opposing creatures as they explored a secret base called Black Mesa. The popularity of Half-Life sparked many new talented developers. In 2000, the action video game genre was defined with the Half-Life modification of Counter-Strike. Counter-Strike featured an extremely addicting and superior gameplay that before hasn't been seen since the release of Pong. An entire culture seems to have been formed because of Counter-Strike as it's seen today, and now it is the most popular online action game in the world. Half-Life 2 featured stunning graphics and physical gameplay which gave Valve the signal that their new game engine, Source was a huge success. The next major project Valve decided to work on is Counter-Strike: Source, a completely overhauled and remade version of the legendary Counter-Strike with the Source engine. However, Valve knew that it would be a challenge both carefully keeping the sensitive gameplay intact that has been released years ago and both upgrading the way players play without the game becoming a failure. So, how did Valve do with the late 2004 release of the highly anticipated release of Counter-Strike: Source?Before any quick conclusions are made about the game, players should know that it is actually still in development. The game is frequently updated by Valve with content additions and enhancements and maps that have not yet been ported to the Source engine yet. However, players will be happy to know that the major maps such as Dust2, Aztec, Office, and many others have already been ported to the new game. Only the least popular such as Siege have not yet been added to the game as of August of 2006. Players should be rest assured that the remaining maps should and most likely will be ported to the game.So, why did Valve decide to release the game only partially developed publicly? There has never been an official answer to this but most players speculate because Valve is eager to know the public reactions to the game. When Counter-Strike: Source was barely released it only contained several maps available to play. Valve seemed to want to know what players thought of the game before they finish completing it. If the game appears to be a failure to the public, Valve would know if they had to scrap the project, but if generally positive reactions came from players, especially veteran Counter-Strike 1.6 players, Valve would happily continue with the remaining development of the game. With this said, the positive has happened. Generally, Counter-Strike: Source was accepted by fans, and Valve continues slowly with the development of the game.Counter-Strike: Source as already very much known continues with generally the same gameplay of 1.6. If it did not, it wouldn't be deserved to be called \"Counter-Strike: Source\", but \"Counter-Strike 2\". Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists face off in map skirmishes with an arsenal of weapons available for purchase. Depending on either what of two possible map types they are playing in, the terrorists will either have to plant a bomb in one of two bomb spots in the map, or in the other game type the terrorists will have to protect usually four hostages that are in a specific area of the map from the counter-terrorists rescuing them and winning the round. Or, in both types, a victorious team can be declared simply when one has completely killed the other opposing team. As Counter-Strike 1.6, Counter-Strike: Source is a highly fast-paced shooter.Unlike the Halo series where players will often both explore landscape and at the same time take on enemy foes, in Counter-Strike you can expect to be on your tiptoes the complete time you are playing. It only takes a few shots to the chest and only one to the head to die in Counter-Strike, which can sometimes be the focal point of the anger in the game but also helps drive the addicting gameplay of you having to always be on caution and keeping your reflexes sharp to survive the round. Counter-Strike is a very skill-orientated game, a newcomer can expect to easily have only one kill per ten deaths, but a veteran and highly experienced player can easily produce up to thirty kills with only one or two deaths.While both Counter-Strike 1.6 and Counter-Strike: Source have a fairly large community, as a whole, the community is one of the rough parts of the game and at times is not very \"newbie-friendly\". Cheating using out-of-the-game programs called \"hacking\" is on an all-time high. But thankfully, Valve's VAC2 anti-cheat system does a fair and adequate job of catching cheaters and permanently banning them from the game. The VAC2 modules are frequently updated and are becoming more and more intelligent everyday, and if this goes at this rate, players can easily expect for the VAC2 system to catch virtually every single cheat in existence.As from Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike: Source contains the same technological advancements of Half-Life 2. Players will see both physics and the upgraded graphics from the Source engine. To set the answer to the first question straight, Counter-Strike: Source as Half-Life 2 is a major technical accomplishment. From the definition of the textures, to the particle effects and to the ragdoll physics, Counter-Strike: Source as Half-Life 2 is a benchmark in PC gaming. It is without doubt that players will enjoy and be amazed at what Counter-Strike: Source has technologically to offer. The first time a player under a bridge shoots and kills an opposing player, sees the body dynamically and fluidly drop down the bridge and adjust its skeleton to the irregular landscape, the player will drop their jaws. Valve's physics portion of the engine both contains an enormous amount of dynamicness in objects and the bones of models. When a player throws a grenade down an alleyway that is filled with barrels, bottles, and other objects, the objects will fly into the air and drop down into a unique position that before has never been seen in video games. The engine's ragdoll physics also contains an incredible amount of fluidity and dead bodies can die an infinite amount of ways. Over a ledge, down a slope, or simply just drop down on the ground, they will always have a unique position.The Source engine also as known in Half-Life 2 before features eye-popping graphics. Valve completely remade the textures that were used in Counter-Strike, and this is the major difference graphically of the 1.6 version of Counter-Strike and the Source version. The textures now really look more lifelike and clearer which makes the game look a lot more attractive. Valve also did a good job developing special effects in Source. From particle effects from bullets to the vivid volumetric smoke, it has all been carefully created. Whether you are standing behind a metallic surface or a soft sandy surface the proper effect on the texture will be created when bullets are fired on it. Players will see the bright-white ricocheting effect on metal plates or the dust that pops out of weak, stony surfaces. Players will also see that there is a nice smoke effect that comes from both an after-effect of a grenade, but more specifically the popping of a smoke grenade. The smoke actually has volume and depth to it and players can walk and notice that they are actually walking through a field of smoke rather then just a cheap dust effect that has been seen many times in past games.Another quite noticeable and somewhat controversial change in the Source version of Counter-Strike is the displeasureable effect a player experiences when he is affected by a popping of a flashbang. In 1.6, players would be blinded and only see white for a few seconds, but still be able to hear and could more easily retreat by thought before the enemy rushes out in the open. However, in Source, a flashbang is much more effective in disorientating the enemy. A flashbang is not only much longer in Source, but also completely disables your hearing with a high-pitched scream. This entire effect can easily disorientate an entire enemy team with just one flashbang and can easily completely confuse a new player. In addition to the disorientating effect of the Source flashbang with the extended flashed time and the loss of hearing, players will also see that a flashbang continues to try and confuse a player by before returning his hearing and vision, an early image of where he is standing will bleed onto the screen making the player think that he has recovered whereas he will then move, but then notice that he has been tricked because he has not fully recovered, his senses will then finally return and he will notice where he now is.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2011"}

I wanted to write this review as parent.Let me start of by saying that I'm not really into shooting games with extreme violence or profanity. Although I do think that some of those elements add to the overall story and realism, sometimes I feel that it's not really necessary for certain games. I like games that let you choose (at least to a certain degree) the amount of violence you get to see, such is the case for Watch Dogs, you can play through this game in a very cool, not so violent way. Profanity is still there but it's not all over your face, at least not to me.In my opinion, graphics are not as top notch as I would have imagined them to be for an Xbox One game, I think it probably has something to do with it being in multiple platforms including the older generations: PS3 and Xbox 360. I would say that GTA 4 has better graphics than this game, but that's just my opinion.As you may have imagined, this game has references to sex and drugs (some of the mini game are based on you getting high) but I'm not the type of parent who thinks that my son will get influenced into doing drugs and trying to kill somebody based on a game, he's smarter than that and most kids are. My son is a straight A student and games such as this have never impacted his performance at school activities or his ability to know right from wrong. It's just a game! I don't go on jumping on turtles just because I like Super Mario games!My son is 17 years old and he loved the game, he started playing it on Saturday and passed it by Monday morning, of course, there's still many missions to complete, he just went for the main plot at first. He claimed it was very entertaining although a bit short and driving a little hard to get used to.

From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

However, despite having poorer graphics than FF X, and being that there is no voice acting in this title when there should have been, at least for the FMVs, its easy to avoid going back to this title for those who have yet to play it. This however, would remain a mistake. Like Star Trek, the best Final Fantasy games end in an even number, and FF VIII is no exception. The graphics were the pinnacle of Playstation graphics, and the sound track remains arguably the best of the franchise. The story is where the game really shines. It's a romance, something that Square hadn't done effectively in the past. This game excels at the romance aspects of the story where all other FF games have failed. More importantly, for me, is that the main character is not an overly perky blonde hair blue eyed happy dude, but one much more like myself. Darker, moodier, and misunderstood as being distant and cold. Squall has a great deal of objections to overcome in identifying and getting a firm grip on love, and even then he has trust issues making him a character that is much easier for me to identify with as Squall and I are a lot alike. (Not easy to admit, but true.) It was also nice to see an FF game without the generic overly happy personality. It was also nice to see a lead male in FF without blonde hair.The game play was where this game left many people wanting. The junction system had quite a steep learning curve, and no matter how much work I did with the cast nobody ever did 9999 damage without the aid of a GF summon. While I enjoyed the Guardian Force Summons and never tired of them many people did not and wanted to skip them. The option to do so would have been nice. I also wish that the characters could learn skills and such without having to have a GF equipped. The game is too reliant on summons and it would have been nice to have the characters have strengths and weaknesses on their own.Although I love this game, I would like to see a remake of the game in the vein of Resident Evil for GameCube. Using similar Technology Square could easily upgrade the graphics; sound and game play to put this game on par with the recent Final Fantasy X. If they really wanted to, it could look as good as Resident Evil if they made it for the GameCube. Earlier some websites reported that remakes of VII, VIII, and IX for the next Gen consoles were being considered. Being that FF VIII could have been much better, even though it was great, its fun to imagine how it could be on next gen consoles if square realizes the true potential of this epic masterpiece.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2002"}

Well black ops disappointed but it's playable. It's basically resistance burning skies with a crappy single player and a cod coat of paint. All the resistance sound effects and issues are present in the game. In a nut shell the game is ok. I will do a full review of black ops on the page for the game. The vita is better then i remember it due to PS1 compatibility and a few features added to the PSP like touch screen mapping. I like the ability to map Ps1 games any way you want. PS1 is my favorite system. ^_^ The system is nice but to me games make the system and there are few games other then psp and ps1 games that make this worth the purchase however my digital library of unused psp games i bought for this as well as all my ps1 classics just sitting there on the psn needed to be used again. I wanted my psp game on a vita for the second analog support. Oh and nfs mw was making me drool. I like the android version on my nexus 7 but it was no vita version. I want to grab mortal kombat and uncharted again. I honestly think the vita is too expensive for a system that is struggling but if you can get it cheap it's worth checking out. Black ops is laughable and the memory card is nice seeing as it's needed to start playing games. However i needed a bigger memory card.

Everts","summary":"Take note of the tracks.","reviewText":"If you're interested in picking this up as a new guitar player or even someone with a small amount of experience under your belt, I would recommend it only if you enjoy the songs you are able to play.In my opinion this is a great way to familiarize yourself with a guitar and learn to play the songs that are included.  This is truly not a replacement for a real live lesson, but to me it can really compliment real lessons, as it is a great way to see progress whereas, when learning to play traditionally the progress comes over much longer periods of time. (Depending on your natural abilities to pick it up of course.)The way the game dynamically raises and lowers the difficulty is a great idea yet it can be sporadic in how far it swings from hard to easy, but you get used to it over time.I also find that transitioning from playing a song in the game to actually trying to play it myself without the game showing me what to hit can be a bit tricky, but if you practice you can do that as well.If you truly are eager to learn the guitar, this is a great supplementary tool to the proper regimen. I think that if your already willing to spend money for a guitar and lessons, then picking this up on top of that, especially at the current price is a no brainer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2013"}

The action seems too fast. Even if I put the damage to low the fight is short. This game is boring when I play with my nephew because he always selects simple mode for his team and so I have to choose the same or he will beat me. And in simple mode all a player has to do is press the Y button and it does a special move. Many of the characters blast a powerful blast that reaches the opponent across the screen. And so it&#8217;s really a game of who can press the Y button faster and probably first. But on regular mode a player actually has do press down forward LP or whatever to do a special move. In simple mode, you can&#8217;t even jump or do anything but try and press the Y button first. It&#8217;s a silly bonus game for some that&#8217;s gets boring quickly, but for me, that&#8217;s all my nephew picks, and so the game is more boring than some other fighting games for me. However, others could have move fun in the regular mode. I might try to beat the whole game in simple mode, but I&#8217;m not sure if I can get achievements.his game has a lot characters, but it should probably have more since it combines too main companies together. There&#8217;s no Cyclops, no Ken, for example. I&#8217;m glad there are some goofy interesting and also cool characters from Capcom, other than just the SF ones, though.

{"product_name":"B0050SYLRK","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Strangest AAA Game I Have Ever Played...","reviewText":"The Main Quests are horrible, but the rest of the game is pretty fun.  So, if you're the kind of person that wants to blow through AC3, you will hate it.  If you take your time, go hunting for bears in the deep woods, engage pirates in ship battles, and go treasure hunting, then you'll have a great time!  Here's a breakdown!Concept:  10/10A sequel to Assassin's Creed 3 set during the American Revolution during an election year!  Add Hunting, Ship Battles, Guilds, a new graphics engine, incredibly smooth combat, and polish Multiplayer with a ton of extras!  This sounds awesome!!! What went wrong?!Story:  FAILThe story begins with a British Spy who travels from England to the Colonies to aid a network of spies.  The story then jumps to young Connor, then worthless Desmond, then teen Connor, then Desmond, then adult Connor, then Desmond again, while trying to cover all of the important events during the American Revolution.  You see how this might be a problem.  To make matters worse, the cutscenes themselves are disjointed.  You speak to a character for 20 seconds, then for no reason they make you walk down a hallway for 10 seconds, then you speak again for 20 seconds, then they make you walk up some stairs for 10 seconds, then you speak to the same character for another 20 seconds...  I'm assuming there's some sort of streaming limitation with the gameplay engine because this was ridiculous.  And let's face it, Ezio is a tough act to follow.  That guy was like a Renaissance Bruce Wayne (without the emotional scars) he had tons of charisma and was popular with the ladies.  Now we have Connor, who basically says exactly what is on his mind.  He's not terrible, but he's seriously lacking in charisma.Gameplay:  Main Quests FAIL!The first half of the game is a tutorial where you are micromanaged and you don't learn anything.  The mission objectives are things like, sneak past the guards without being seen.  Optional Objectives include - Don't kill anyone.  Well, the game doesn't tell you that if you do not have a weapon equipped, you can choke guards out if you sneak up behind them.  Then leave their bodies in the bushes.  Without this useful tidbit of information, you end up failing a few times before you figure out where you are supposed to go.  Most of the Main Quests are trial and error.  Now here is the worst part... When you fail these missions you almost never die.  Instead a message saying, \"Desynchronized\" appears on your screen and they reset you back to the last checkpoint.  So, you are killed by the HUD.  This has all of the dramatic impact of an Out of Memory Error - Reload.  When I get killed in a game, I want the enemies to kill me.  I want to go down swinging like a champ.  Maybe I make a mistake.  Maybe I get overwhelmed.  But I should never get killed by the HUD.  It ruins immersion.  Why bother spending time on AI, enemies, animations, etc... when you're getting killed by TEXT MESSAGES?!  It's ridiculous.  You also get killed by GIANT TIMERS and B BUTTON Prompts.  I'd rather see myself get killed in an explosion or mauled to death by wolves.  Sigh...Gameplay:  Side Quests - 7/10There are forts you can take over, there are assassination missions, there are \"liberation missions\" where you can free zones of the cities from Templar influence.  These are pretty fun because you can handle them creatively.  You can use stealth, weapons, brute force, traps, etc...  They're fun because they actually feel like open ended gameplay and if you do get killed, it's by enemies.Gameplay:  Combat - 8/10Combat has been streamlined a bit, so here's the gist.  You have a parry button.  You have a quick attack button.  You have an attack button.  There are two types of enemies.  I'll call them Grunts and Elites.  When Grunts attack, you can PARRY their attack, then kill them.  When Grunts are standing nearby, you can kill them with an attack.  It's very simple.  Now with the Elites, you must use a quick attack to knock them off balance.  This is a jab to the throat or a kick to the knee...  When they're off balance, they're just like Grunts.  Easy to Counter, Easy to Kill.  Once you get the hang of it, Connor can easily take down 30 Bad Guys.  Occasionally enemies do fire muskets at you and if you're quick, you can use an enemy as a human shield, which is fun.  The animations are great, but the combat does feel like it's missing some depth.Gameplay:  Stealth - 6/10Connor is so powerful, there's no reason to use stealth unless it's an auto-fail mission.  There are some new stealth moves like hiding in bushes, or hiding behind a corner and whistling to draw the attention of a guard.  When he comes close you can take him out.  But when enemies see you, there are a TON OF THEM.  It takes a while to run to safety.Gameplay:  Ship Battles - 10/10Epic, Beautiful, Clear Rules, Cinematic!  The Ship Battles are awesome and your ship is upgradeable.  (This is the only real money sink in the game.)  You usually do battle with other ships on the high seas.  The faster you move, the larger your turning radius.  You have 3 speeds.  Stop, Half Sail, and Full Sail.  So, the slower you go, the sharper your turns.  In Combat, you can ram ships, fire your cannons, or aim smaller guns to do minor damage, sink small boats, or hit an exposed powder keg to destroy a ship.  Defensively, you can avoid damage by pressing X when the enemies fire at you.  Before they fire, you can see a red highlight, marking the path of their cannon fire.  For your cannons, you see a white highlight.  So, watch your turns, get the enemy in your white and try to stay out of their red.  It's pretty simple, but feels EPIC!Gameplay:  The Homestead - 6/10Connor can recruit artisans to help out on his land.  They have their own quests and when you help these people, you get upgrades.  These upgrades help with your crafting.  There are dozens of recipes in the game and you can get materials, make goods, and trade them with the cities.  Once you figure out that there's really nothing to buy in the game, you stop doing this.Gameplay:  Multiplayer - 9/10Multiplayer has been revamped and it's a lot smoother.  You basically hunt down enemies while enemies are hunting you.  Try to assassinate them as inconspicuously as possible.  The better your technique, the higher your score.  Blend in with crowds, ambush them from rooftops, hide behind cover...  As you are playing, there are tons of upgrades to buy for your multiplayer character.  New abilities like smoke bombs, poison darts, disguises...  There are team and solo modes.  It's really easy to get hooked for days!Graphics: - 9/10The Assassin's Creed series has always had great graphics.  AC3 is no exception.  The environments, effects, characters, weather effects, animations are all great!  There's only one flaw in the entire game.  It looks like every character is wearing contact lenses with white paint on them.  Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes takes on a whole new meaning.Sound: - 7/10The action is highlighted by great sound effects, but the soundtrack is a bit lacking.  In AC2, there were some great tracks with memorable music.  In AC3, the background music is just sorta there.Maturity:  Older Teens  There's no nudity or anything, but there's some strong language and violent assassinations.Replay Value:  9/10This is a fairly huge game that you can blow through in 12 hours or do all of the fun side quests and enjoy it for 24 hours.  There're also some really fun and addicting Multiplayer Modes.Overall:  6.5/10Assassin's Creed 3 can be a fun experience, but you have to go out of your way to find it.  If you start the game and realize that you aren't having fun, forget about the main quests and join the Hunting Club, Battle Pirates on the High Seas, Search for Treasure, or play Multiplayer.  The ending of the game is pretty awful too, don't force yourself to stick to the Main Missions if you aren't enjoying them.Buy it cheap if you want to get the most out of the game and enjoy all of the side missions.Buy it cheap if you liked the Multiplayer of AC2 and want more.Rent it if you have 12-15 hours to blow through the main quest (but this is not the way to enjoy the game.)Avoid it if you need a good story or a charismatic main character.Avoid it if you hate insta-fail missions (like Splinter Cell 1).Avoid it if you need immersion.  The death by HUD stuff will really annoy you.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2013"}
{"product_name":"B002I08UGQ","description":"","reviewerName":"AlexJouJou","summary":"Bigger than I thought with same DSi functions!","reviewText":"Firstly I'd like to say I'm a 43 year old mom. I got into gaming several years ago and my kids and I have a lot of fun with the Nintendo DS. We have had the original DS, DS Lites, DSi's, and now the DSi XL. I got an XL for myself. My son has many GBA games so he doesn't want one (because the DSi XL cannot play any GBA - Gameboy Advance- games) and my daughter thought it was too big to be portable. She likes something that fits easily into a backpack or jacket pocket. Although I think the XL could I'd probably agree if you are going for portability then the regular DSi should do you just fine. The reason I chose the XL is because I play primarily at home and I play a lot of puzzle games. Someimes these types of games are hard to see, especially the seek and find. I'm hoping this larger sized one helps that.Even though I knew it was larger it is LARGER than I thought. That's a good thing because it is almost more like a PDA or something as far as size. Nice and substantial. It is also heavier than I anticipated. This is the only thing I'm a little concerned with as I like to play laying in bed at night and sometimes I'll play for a couple of hours. I would not want my hand getting extra tired holding the unit up. Additionally it is not as easy to hold this one handed and put the stylus in the other. It might be a fine line but it doesn't quite feel as comfortable as the DSi in that regard. It feels similar to how the PSP would feel if you held it one handed. Slightly off balance. Edited to Add: Played for 2 hours last night. Although it took a while I did find a comfortable position to hold the XL. It is not as comfortable for extended periods as the regular DSi but it did not get too heavy and my arms did not get sore. I'm quite relieved!The top part actually has an audible click when you open up the unit. The DSi did not have this click although one of our DS Lite units did. The regular DSi opened smoothly without any catches--this one does not. There is definitely a click. The hinge looks strong enough. We lost one DS Lite to the hinge crack issue so I'm glad to see these hinges look sturdy. The other thing regarding the hinges is that the top piece moves a little when you move the unit. It is not super floppy but it does move when the unit does. I tested it against the DSi and the DS Lite and it took more effort to make those cover or top pieces move. It may be the weight itself which causes this. I will be keeping an eye on my hinges though just to be sure.It connected right up to my internet with no problems. I went into the DSi shop and I didn't notice any difference between the XL and my regular DSi. Flawless. I must say, though, that I HATE that I could not take my DSi games with me to this upgrade (Nintendo is so far behind the ball on this and it is one of few complaints I have of Nintendo). Lame Nintendo. Seriously lame!I got the bronze. It has a nearly black top and the inside is black. The bronze is only on the bottom and sides and it is definitely bronze. From the pictures online it looks more chocolate brown but it is not. I wavered back and forth with this and burgundy. I have not seen the burgundy out of the box but suspect it looks gorgeous. The glossy top looks like an overcoat similar to what is put on cars and trucks. Not like how the DS Lite covers were (although in two tone color this one is nearly exactly the same as the DS Lite Crimson or Blue with the colors in the same places and black in the same places except for the top because this one has the bronze color around the edges and the DS Lite's had the crimson or blue).It does not feel \"matte\" on the bottom.It has a slightly grainy feel--not sure how to describe it. Kind of like how the non shiny cover of my printer feels. I remember when I got the DSi it almost seemed grainy and powdery. Not so with the XL.Overall I'm very happy with the color-its classy!Screen: This was my big worry. So far those worries are fairly groundless. I've tested out several types of games and in most apsects it is absolutely as good as the regular DSi. For the most part I get no pixelation or stretching and I definitely haven't noticed any ghosting or lines. While I was playing Bejeweled Twist I did notice that the gems were not as crisp as they are on the regular DSi. For me it was noticable but not bothersome. They were not blurry just a little more fuzzy than normal.Edited to Add: I've tried several additional games and haven't noticed any issues except on games like Lunar Knights which already had a more pixelated look even on my DS Lite and regular DSi. Just slightly more noticable here but again not enough to impact. If I wasn't such a video game addict I likely wouldn't notice but I play every day.My original DSi had several problems (Nintendo sent me a replacement)-this one has none of them. The battery cover does not \"cave\" in like my DSi and the insert window around the touch screen is solid--no light shows through. This XL feels as if it is a much higher quality console.I've played with the regular stylus and the bigger pen type stylus. Either is fine but I prefer the regular stylus. The pen stylus might be good for someone who likes to hold the stylus like a pen but it is not a make or break for me.The other functions (camera and the settings) worked well. No problems encountered. The charger looks to be the same as the regular DSi and this unit fits fine in my G Pak organizer. Edited to Add: Sound--it is actually slightly better sounding than the regular DSi. It feels as if it almost has a deeper sound. More like surround type sound. Also if you have a regular DSi there is a point when you are adjusting sound where it goes from quieter to regular and almost seems like it skips a step. The XL does not do this -- the sound progression is very good. I put in my Dragon Quest V as the music is very majestic and it felt more like it was enveloping me in the sound than a regular DSi (tested it with my daughters).Overall I'm very happy and will update with the weight issue if it becomes a problem. Other than that I'm excited to go play my games and see them on the big screen!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2010"}
{"product_name":"B007M6W3A0","description":"","reviewerName":"Joe Rhodes \"JR\"","summary":"Funner, but faultier than ever","reviewText":"When I first played 2K13 (which was actually the demo), I was excited because I felt the gameplay was improved and I had a great time playing it.  But when I got the actually game, which I of course played for hours and hours, I was disappointed by a few things.First of all there is a freezing problem, mostly on MyCareer, but other times too.  I never had this freeze up thing happen in the previous installments and it was actually a pretty consistent thing that hasn't been patched yet (at least on PS3).  I know this is not just my PS3 because I have friends with the same issue.Another thing I don't like is some of the same issues that have never been addressed yet.  The passing is a constant problem as it always has.  Sometimes a guy can be 20 feet away from you and the pass will end up in the in the crowd.  It's pretty infuriating sometimes.  Some things in MyCareer don't even make sense, such as calling for passes when your wide open and getting your team mate grade lowered.  You can also get it lowered just by trying to swipe the ball.Another aggravating thing is the strategy of making high % shots is not really applied as much as it should be.  For example, I have played people online who chuck up 3s with their best 3 point shooter even with defensive settings on tight and with a hand in their face and they still can easily make them.  That really should be adjusted because it is annoying to lose to people who just shoot 3s every possession.A few other things I wasn't so crazy about was the soundtrack kind of sucks in my opinion, mostly Jay-Z songs, no Drake, I'm sure since he's been dissing Rihanna.  No retro soundtracks, just some of the crap you hear on the radio everyday and a few others.  \"Mercy\" is edited and censored almost beyond recognition.  Another thing is the graphics didn't really improve much as far as the players' details go.  Uniforms, lighting, contrast, however was definitely improved.Now that I've laid out the things I was disappointed about, let me talk about what makes the game great.  Well, MyCareer has been evolved into a much better feature.  It now allows you to gain virtual currency not only as skill points for your player, but many other things as well, including buying clothes for your guy.  The great thing about virtual currency is that instead of only getting it while in MyCareer, you can get it doing pretty much anything and the more you play, the more you get.There are now special individual \"signature skills\" that can be applied to your player, just as real NBA players have in the game.  I was really glad 2k did this and got rid of the special skills you have to use massive SP to improve on.One feature I really liked was the training camp that teaches you all the basics.  It really comes in handy for learning how to do new moves and reinforce old ones.  The moves are really very handy to get down, so you can get by your defenders, create shots, and make plays.  The moves and the control you have is definitely one thing that has improved in 2k13.Another feature that I really like is NBA Blacktop which online you can use your MyPlayer to play 3 on 3 pick up games as if you were to go down the street and play a pickup game yourself.  You can do a Team match 5 on 5 as well (with real players), but I like the simplicity of the 3 on 3 match up to 21.  It is reminiscent of NBA Street.  It's a blast because you can play the way you would in real life and actually team up with people as they would play.Overall, I love my 2K13, I just have to take a star away because it is not a slam dunk so to speak.  It doesn't have to be perfect, but it is simply not as good as it can be.  2K13 definitely has room for improvement.  But this is a step forward for the most part.  The technical issues NEED to be solved, it is just not fair to pay almost $70 for a game that is not functioning properly.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000059Z7G","description":"When longtime Sega mascot Sonic the Hedgehog made his debut on the Dreamcast console inSonic Adventure, gamers were stunned. Sega had not only used the game to show off the tremendous possibilities of the then-new hardware, but they had reinvigorated the platform-style arcade adventure genre with massive, intricate levels, gleefully distracting minigames, and even a new kind of virtual pet, called a Chao, that could be combined with other pets, traded with friends, and even exchanged over the Internet.Sonic Adventure 2ups the ante of its predecessor with all-new puzzles and levels, and even faster action reminiscent of the early Genesis-era games. Knuckles and Tails are back, as are the Chao pets (who can now talk!).","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"One of the best Dreamcast games ever made","reviewText":"One of the last great games to send off the Dreamcast, Sega pulled out all the stops in this sequel to their top launch title.  Sonic Adventure 2 takes everything the first game was, and refines it and tries to top it as much as it can.  The levels are huge (although some are not as vast and distinct as those in the original) and the action is super fast, but the ultra smooth frame rate never drops and the graphics are sharp and some of the best to ever grace the system.  Sonic Adventure 2 is not as challenging as the first, and some of the harder and more challenging aspects of the first game have been made more simpler (raising Chao is easier than ever) and the game is easier to get into than ever before, even if you've never played a Sonic game.  All in all, if you still have your Dreamcast then there is no reason why you don't own this as well.  Sonic Adventure 2 is one of the finest games for the system, and it is a fitting farewell for one of the beat and most underrated systems of all time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2003"}

Obviously because the game is more about nero than dante and i thought it was supposed to be the other way around. It doesn't seem anything like the anime and the secret missions can get frustrating at times. Overall it's a good game to rent, but I wouldn't buy it only because they went to far with the females.

{"product_name":"B0050SYV70","description":"","reviewerName":"Scottypiper \"Scottypiper\"","summary":"Another great hit from Ubisoft","reviewText":"I haven't played any of the previous Far Cry games but decided to take advantage of a lightning deal and try this game out. At first, I noticed a lot of similarities between this game and Assassins Creed but it's not a surprise since Ubisoft made them both.First, if you are a parent reading this to find out more about the rating: It's rated M - Mature. It has violence, blood, lots of swearing and a scene of partial female nudity.Story: You are on a vacation with your two brothers, your girlfriend, and some friends. While in a club, you get talked into skydiving onto a remote island. Upon landing, you find out the island is run by pirates who kidnap people for ransom, slavery, and other things. You escape from your prison and set forth to free your friends and family.Gameplay: Open World, exploration, stealth, shooter. You control your player from first point of view. The gameplay plays out like Assassins creed meaning you have main missions to advance the plot and loads of side quests. Side quests include hunting animals with specific weapons, assassinating wanted pirates, timed medical runs with different vehicles, history of the island quests, collecting letters from WWII Japanese soldier's corpse, finding loot chests, finding memory cards and collecting 120 relics. There are two other main side quests which I consider more of the main quest which includes climbing and unlocking radio towers and taking over pirate camps. More of your map is uncovered when you unlock radio towers and map zones surrounding pirate camps turn from Red (when they have control of an area) to Green when you defeat and claim the camp. The game also has crafting which utilizes skins from dead animals and turns them into bigger wallets, weapon holders, ammo holders, backpacks, etc. As you progress, you unlock skill points. Skill points can be spent on a variety of options including health, stealth take-downs, healing ability, swimming and running ability and multiple weapon upgrades. These are applied as tattoos to your arm. You can unlock all the skills in a single play through. During exploration, you come across tons of animals. They can be predator type such as sharks, tigers, cheetahs, komodo dragons, bears, wild dogs, etc. or non-predator type such as pigs, deer, goats, etc. Your weapons in the game include knives, hand guns, shotguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, grenade/rocket launchers, bow and arrows, etc. These weapons can be purchased with money (earned by searching corpses, finding stashes, and looting chests) or can be free by unlocking more radio towers.Conclusion: While I enjoyed the game, I was a little disappointed by the ending, but that doesn't take anything away from it. You do have two possible endings that I know of so I will play through it again and try the other ending. You can continue the game after you beat it and try to accomplish more of your side quests if you prefer not to start a new game. The game overall is easily 9.5 out of 10. Great controls, excellent graphics, and enjoyable gameplay make this title one not to miss. The other great aspect of this game is that you can choose your preferred style, I.E when trying to take over pirate camps, you can be stealthy by shutting off the alarm and stealth killing every pirate in camp, or shoot the cage of caged animals to free them inside a camp and let them attack the pirates, or you can take the aggressive approach and go in guns blazing. You get this freedom throughout the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2013"}

This game started the next generation of videogames. Before Grand Theft Auto 3 came out, we always wanted to do things in the videogames like rob cars and free-roam and shoot random people instead of going level-by-level. With Grand Theft Auto 3, it introduced a whole new type of genre of videogames, free-roaming violence, and nobody does it like Rockstar.But anyway, these people have to stop complaining about the violence. Past games had violence in it, and because it is a hot series people want to ruin other people's lives. That one reviewer said he was 14. He is probably some 40 year old concerned white mother that her little baby couldn't see inappropriate content. But anyway, it isn't that bad. The language is nothing on a scale of San Andreas, and what are they talking about having sex in the game? The girl gets inside the car and it shakes. Whopdee Doo. So inappropriate. No nudity, some violence and semi-mild language. Give me a break.But anyway, this game is a masterpiece. The graphics are not pretty and the crappy Ps2 hardware doesn't help. There are countless glitches, but what do you expect from a game that came out in mid 2001, right when Ps2 was catching on.

{"product_name":"B0000DJX7I","description":"Praised for brilliant scripts and open-ended gameplay, vilified for unapologetic violence and mature themes,Grand Theft Autohas deservedly become one of the most popular game franchises in history. This double pack contains the full versions of bothGrand Theft Auto IIIandGrand Theft Auto III: Vice City, enhanced for Xbox. Xbox gamers can rejoice that the grand king of video games--The Sopranoswith a gamepad--is finally available on the big black box.Grand Theft AutoWithGrand Theft Auto IIIRockstar proves that not all developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games. This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking more structure can embark on dozens of missions driven by a genuinely interesting crime-story plot or steal cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and you can go on vigilante missions. Grab a cab and you can play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi. Take a fire truck and you can earn money putting out fires. The minigames are a good way to unwind after a particularly difficult mission. With so much to do, the game just never gets boring.As you'd expect, there are consequences for criminality. As your random acts of mayhem mount up the police start hounding you, eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic, pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing. Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerGrand Theft Auto III: Vice CityHow big is this game? Even publicists for other games end up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto IIInever dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action.

Rockstar did not submit advance copies of the Grand Theft Auto Double Pack so that a review could come out at the same time as the game. The company knows, as gamers do, that if you've been waiting for GTA III and GTA: Vice City to come out for the Xbox-especially after months of rumor-mongering and poorly kept secrets-you're gonna buy them regardless of what anybody else says. You want them, and Rockstar wants you to want them. So maybe the GTA Double Pack wasn't worth the fuss, but for Xbox owners, it's certainly worth the money. Grand Theft Auto III gave Rockstar's franchise new life with a seedy 3D celebration of New Yo...um, Liberty City's crime underworld; its follow-up, Vice City, threw in motorcycles, a chainsaw, and a 1980s nostalgia trip, complete with pastel suits and Florida drug lords, but plays more or less like an expansion pack. Both games offer mission-based scenarios within an autonomous, \"living\" environment, where pedestrians fight back, police try to run you off the road, and numerous hidden challenges and surprises await any explorer curious enough to seek them out. More than the violent content (yes, you can light cops on fire and hit prostitutes with baseball bats), those free-roaming elements are what make both GTA games such addictive (and historically important) games. Besides the two-for-one price, what do Xbox owners get for waiting? Shinier cars. The games also support hi-res 480p displays and custom soundtracks (almost a shame as the radio stations are a large part of the games' personality and atmosphere-for the true experience, stick with the original soundtracks), but the rest is more or less unchanged. Actors like Joe Pantoliano and Ray Liotta lend their voices, and sharp controls are nearly identical to those in the PS2 edition (triggers are used for gas and brake). The original gameplay has been preserved, but you'd think Rockstar would have enhanced the games further-or at least fixed the infamous pop-up, which still plagues every high-speed cruise through the city. There's also some choppy animation at times, such as on Vice City's RC beach track. In other words, aside from visual upgrades, it's the same great gameplay that PS2 and PC owners have already enjoyed-and it's still must-own material. If you're an Xbox owner who waited, here's the reward for your patience. But you probably already bought it, so...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2003"}

Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience.

As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new proprietary &ldquo;Hedgehog Engine,&rdquo;Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other next-gen technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.","reviewerName":"N.

But make no mistake, this is not a kid's game, or a bad game.  It is a very good game, very long, and I definitely feel like a got my money's worth, for sure.  I don't know why some commercial reviewers gave this a low score; I think sometimes they forget there are games that aren't Call of Duty; EA has pumped them so full of money, etc.I'll break this review down into a few different areas:First graphics:  This is definitely one of the most beautiful games to date.  I don't want to stereotype, but there's something these non-US developers do that, I guess accessing lower level processing (in programming terms), having higher math/algorithmic skills in general in other parts of the world, are able to crank out more than the others.  While Mark Cerny wrote and directed the game, he speaks Japanese, and worked with Sony's Japanese studio to develop the engine.  It looks and plays just like you're watching a PIXAR film on Blu-Ray, but, you're actually playing it... in real-time.  Along with Killzone: Shadow Fall, you can see where the added processing power of the PS4 allows for an insane amount of realtime particle effects, animation-like shaders (in this case), great realtime lighting, and super high resolution textures all at 1080P.  You can see the dimples in the characters' clothing; stuff like that.  It's got a very movie-like appearance and maintains it throughout the entire game (no dropping to low-res cutscenes where you can see the pixelation, etc, like on the old 360, where the DVD space limit limited the size of movie files, content, textures, etc).  Basically, it looks jaw-droppingly good.  The color is incredible, as well; that really stood out to me.Gameplay:  There is a lot of good, and a bit of bad.  Basically, the plot is interesting and keeps the story going, and you're there to beat 'em up and occasionally solve puzzles; it's a platformer.  I think this is basically Sony's answer to (and a combination of) Mario, Crash Bandicoot, and Jak and Daxter, Katamari Damacy, with a touch of God of War; and that's pretty much how Mark Cerney expained the gameplay in various conferences.  So the core gameplay itself is solid, the platforming, the fighting (based around the right-stick-dodge/block maneuver), and puzzle solving.  I have only three complaints.  1) The hidden items-there are so many of these, you can never get them in one playthrough, and with the highly varied textures of the environment, ANYTHING and EVERYTHING looks like it could be a secret door.  Yet most of the time, it's not.  So you punch a lot for nothing.  They should have stuck with more known gamplay mechanics for the placement of hidden items so you wouldn't have to spend so much time punching through every single wall.  Of course, you could always just look online to find the places, but that's no fun.  2) The pieces/size thing kind of only makes sense half the time; sometimes you're just going to be small knack, sometimes you're giant knack.  You DO grow/shrink along with your health, but in some sections, it's not as much of a difference as one would expect.  3) It's great that they used the speaker on the PS4 controller for item pickup sounds; I just wish they would have used more of the buttons and the touchpad; these were wide open and available; only about a quarter of the controller was really in use throughout the game; kind of weird, but it works for a beat 'em up game.Sound and everything else:  GreatMy only closing issue is, after you've beaten the game, it says your items/gadgets/collectables have been saved and can be carried into a new game.  Yet, when you start a new game, you don't have them!  The only way to do it is to use the same save as the one you just beat, but that won't let you change the difficulty level, so you can't go back and beat it on hard with the same items after beating it on normal, same for \"very hard\" which opens up after you beat it on hard mode.  Kind of a bummer they overlooked this; it would mean huge replay value.  Probably it'll get fixed.Overall, it was a great game, and one I would buy again if I had to do over again.  It was well worth it.  It kept me busy for quite a long time (it's not a short game), and always managed to add something new and interesting along the way, while challenging hand/eye coordination.  Well done!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2014"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers.

Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner.

As always you are the lone soldier in space sent to annihilate goat headed monsters, imps, zombie soldiers, arch viles and spider masterminds. But new to the Doom saga are very intelligent enemies and upgraded graphics, which look smooth and not pixilated like the PC and other versions. Also new are three new weapons, to help you tear through dark creatures on your way through 30 levels. The good part is that they are action packed and challenging, the bad part is that some of the levels take you an hour to get through them. Which sets Doom 64 apart from the Quake games for N64, because in Quake it is obvious what to do... go straight and kill whatever gets in your way. With Doom you use your mind to uncover things. However, this is a stereotypical shooting game where you can only point your gun forward and you cannot jump. Fortunately in this game you will not find yourself fighting monsters on staircases, ramps or shooting at them from miles away like in the other versions of Doom. All of that being said, it is a good game, but it will not keep your interest, because of all of the extras that the PC versions had, such as making your own levels, this game does not have.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2001"}

The weapon wheel returns in all its glory and the guns have nice weight to them. There is little in the way of exploration but there are the usual journals to pick up. A nice touch to the weapons is the fact that you can level them up and upgrade them to make them more powerful. In terms of graphics, the game is beautifully designed. The environments are completely fleshed out even if the action keeps one from admiring it. There are issues with audio sync and mouth movement but it isn't too distracting.Multiplayer doesn't offer much new to the FPS genre but it still is fun.

However, I got a good recommendation for it and praise that it was far superior to the first.  That's pretty much exactly what I wanted to hear.  \"Battlefront I\" is really cool in concept, but it was lacking a ton.  Co-op was practically useless, too fast, and virtually no story.  It was just boring!  Luckily just about all these misgivings I had for \"Battlefront I\" were fixed in \"Battlefront II\".I'm personally more into co-op based games than the online multiplayer scenarios and when it came to purchasing \"Battlefront I\" I felt like they forgot about the fans that play co-op.  Not so with \"Battlefront II\".  My friend and I spent quite a long time playing through this games campaign setting.  It was absolutely awesome!  Not to mention quite challenging at times.  Basically you play as part of an elite squad of Storm Troopers called the 501st.  You go with them on their campaigns as the growing empire sends them out to squash dissidents.  It starts off around where \"Episode III\" leaves off and brings you into parts of \"The Empire Strikes Back\".  It's really interesting because you get to see where the empire started to make a decisive stranglehold on the various systems we're all familiar with.  My favorite part was being able to participate in the battle at Hoth from \"The Empire Strikes Back\".  Yes! You get to drive an AT-AT, one of my favorite weapons of the Empire!  My only disappointment is that I could not fly a Star Destroyer... although I imagine that would be clunky and I would've crashed it into all kinds of things... like planets.Anyway, the missions are pretty fun to play.  They're almost way too chaotic at times though.  You have defined goals and points to conquer in each mission area and you have to complete all of them in order to move onto the next mission.  So in mission one you could be asked to defend a location and they have a marker there for you to stand next to.  When you succeed at that objective you get more orders to complete another task and so on until that particular mission/campaign is completed.  In most cases you have a finite number of troops so if you keep dying and have to keep using bodies you will fail the mission.  Once you get the hang of it, it's pretty fun.  Usually at the start of any new area you're pretty confused until you map it out in your head what you're supposed to do and where you're supposed to go.  One mission that was especially confusing was when you play the part in \"A New Hope\" as Darth Vader's storm troopers board Leia's ship.  At the end you're supposed to find Leia, but there's no marker and enemies respawn infinitely, so my friend and I were insanely confused on that level for a little while.  It was really fun to play as Darth Vader though.  Anyway, aside from intense amounts of chaos it was really fun and the maps you get to explore are huge!Now judging by my rating you can see there were some things that I didn't like about the game.  The chaotic factor in the battles can get to you after a while, but I think that's a pretty realistic feature, so my gripe really isn't with that.  The worst part of this was the space battles.  Luckily it gives you the option to skip these, but I would have preferred not to, honestly.  The space battles are simply the most confusing thing I've ever come across!  They're absolutely insane and I found the ships fairly hard to control.  I could rarely figure out where I was going half the time.  Maybe I just have a natural aversion to flight simulator styled games, but I was very lost on these.  For another perspective, my friend who actually does like flying games hated this part of the game too.  He also got lost and incredibly confused, so I guess it doesn't work like other games of this nature.  Other than that the only things I wish I had access to were more character options and more access to force powers when playing a Jedi.  They do give you some options to play as different storm troopers, but I think it would've been cool to have the option to play as various aliens and so forth.  Maybe the game was already too big with what little they had so they had to limit it.Anyway, as you can see this is far superior to \"Battlefront I\".  If you're thinking about getting a Star Wars game like this, definitely get this one.  You won't be disappointed and if there are parts of the campaign you don't want to do the game allows you to skip them without it hindering your ability to complete the full campaign sequence.  Of course if you skip it you don't get to see the story or cinematic sequences for that level.  This is also really fun because you play entirely from the Dark Side!  If you really liked that part of Star Wars you'll love this.  All hail the Empire!Overall Rating: 3.3 out of 5","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2008"}

{"product_name":"B000F1YGMM","description":"Hunt like a pack, or die like a dog, in the Xbox 360's first mech warfare game. / Rated T: Teen Incredibly realistic next-gen effects Hundreds of items to earn","reviewerName":"DarkDan \"DarkDan\"","summary":"Chromehounds: A little rusty under the hood.","reviewText":"Although I'm not a die-hard \"Mech\" fan, I have finished Mech Assault and Mech Assault 2 on the original Xbox. As of this writing, I have completed the Chromehounds single-player missions and have played online for a few days.There are two types of single-player activities in Chromehounds, Story Mode (not connected to the Xbox Live service) provides 43 missions which average about 5 minutes in mission length and Individual Missions (available when you're connected to Xbox Live) offers an additional 11 \"search and destroy\" missions which are 10 minutes each.One thing that other reviewers have not mentioned is that -although it is short- the Story mode offers an incredible amount of variety. When tackled in order, this mode will take you from being a \"grunt\" (a Soldier mech which is on the frontlines of every battle) to the Commander mech (where you monitor the war from behind the battle lines and guide other units on missions). The Commander role is unique because it adds an RTS (real-time strategy) component to the game, where you're actually ordering other units to engage in the battle, rather than piloting a mech yourself. Along the way, you'll also be piloting mechs with different equipment specializations, like sniper, defender, scout and heavy gunner.In addition to the variety of gameplay, you can also customize your mech. Unfortunately, this can lead to an incredibly uneven fight online and I've found myself slaughtered by users that had created the \"ultimate mech\" when I entered the fight with a weenie mobile. Sadly, losing that battle also cost me a considerable amount of mech cash, which is needed to better equip yourself for battle.As a next-gen game, Chromehounds excels in some areas and is surprisingly lacking in others. Load times are amazingly quick with the pre-game briefing and the entire levels (which are quite large) loading in less than 15 seconds. The graphics, for the most part, are quite impressive, but the developers have sometimes \"cheated.\" For example, a wheat field looks like it's blowing in the wind when you're far off, but once you walk into the field, the poorly designed texture looks flat. One nice touch is that your mechs will leave footprints in sand and crack any roads you walk over. Smoke, explosions and other effects are top-notch, but one odd feature is that there are no menus while you play. For example, if you embark on a single-player mission, and press the Start button, Chromehounds just pauses the game. You don't have any options to quit the game or even restart the mission. This is incredibly short-sighted, since I wanted to restart many times and couldn't, or you may wish to leave a game prematurely.If you enjoy earning Achievements, this is probably not the game for you. Completing the single player missions only nets you 140 of the 1000 possible GamerScore. Once you complete the Story Mode, there's an additional 20 points for earning a \"perfect\" score on every level. And, there are many \"secret\" achievements out of the 49 available, including some random ones you can earn just by aligning with a nation online. When your nation wins a war, you earn a medal, even if you've never fought a single battle online.All said, Chromehounds is the only mech-style game available on the Xbox 360. And, for all its faults, Sega has created a unique and interesting model for online warfare. But, in doing so, they ignored some of the most basic principles for creating a solid game. Dedicated fans of this genre and those who enjoy massive online play should pick up this game without hesitation. Gamers who are looking for a rich single-player mode should probably look elsewhere.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2006"}

Skylanders Spyro&#x2019;s adventure involves real life toys, which players will have to place on the Portal of Power to bring them into the game. The three toy characters that come in the starter pack are: Spyro, Gill Grunt and Trigger Happy. We have some information and some short clips where players can see all three characters in action.","reviewerName":"Angela Streiff","summary":"A step up from the typical video game","reviewText":"I picked up the Wii version of this Skylander Spyro's Adventure pack and so this review is regarding that version.Set up was so easy, my 10 year old son set up with our Nintendo Wii himself. I had planed on doing it, but he was so excited he said, \"I can't do it mom\" and so I let him try to see if he could. If you know how to sync a Wii remote to the Wii you will have no troubles syncing the Portal of Power peripheral. You get 3 Skylanders with this set, Trigger Happy,Gill Grunt and Spyro. These Skylander figures set on top of the Portal of Power and let you control which character you play during the game. Each of these characters has different abilities so the game plays unique to each one. If you put 2 Skylanders on the portal, you can play 2 player and battle each other.As you go through the different levels, some are easier and better completed by each of the different Skylanders. There are actually a total of 30+ different characters for the game, however with this starter pack you're beginning with just 3. So you can imagine how once you get into the game, you find yourself ready to pick up several more sets to have maximum playability of the game.Bright, colorful graphics and tons of fun, this game will keep you entertained for hours. What makes this set so unique is being able to purchase the other Skylander action figures to play with it. The game definitely will make any fan of the series want to pick up the other packs, since the figures act much like expansion packs for a game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2012"}

I don't remember. I bought it recently to continue where I left off and wow, I am impressed with the deep story of this game. The gameplay isn't bad. I like it and there is a vast universe and many locations in the game.I wonder if the writing for Mass Effect was developed from 5 years before the game was released. I have never seen such creative dialogue in a game before and it had to be a time consuming task for such amazing storyline and interaction with other characters. you can develop close relationships with your squad members and ultimately someone will die before the end of the game and you can transfer your data to the Mass Effect 2 where your past actions in Mass Effect envelope into the setting.The human character models look like they can be real people and they probably are! The game does have some flaws but that will not impact my review because it makes up with the story that keeps you gripped. You feel like you are part of the universe because your actions dictate on how things play it. maybe this is why many people disliked the ending for Mass Effect 3.

After a friendly mining ship losing communications with headquarters, you and your crew are sent in to investigate the problem. Upon arrival, your ship loses control and collides into the friendly mining ship which causes serious structural damage and eliminates your means of escape. Shortly after, you find out that the ship is infested with a wide variety of disgusting creatures who all seek to kill you. Throughout the game, the story develops into a complicated series of strange relationships between yourself and those who you arrived with as the gameplay gets increasingly intense and new and more difficult monsters begin to appear.The game sports an upgrade system which is done with items called nodes. Nodes can both be found through the game, as well as purchased for an expensive fee at the in-game store. These are then used to upgrade both your weapons and armor in a grid-like interface. To top that off, the 7 weapons in the game are all a blast to use and really help make the game fun in the long-run. However, the game does have some issues with close-range combat which can make some portions of the game annoyingly difficult. Another feature in the game is the stasis system. Early in the game, the main character learns how to use both stasis and telekinesis abilities. The stasis ability freezes enemies in front of the character, and telekinesis allows you to throw around objects. The stasis ability require stasis energy which is sometimes hard to come by, but its use is required in solving puzzles throughout the game, and both stasis and telekinesis are incredibly rewarding to use in combat if used effectively.Controls:The controls of the game have a sense of weight to them. Movement and turning is a little slow, but truthfully it fits the experience and isn't as much of an obstacle as it seems at first. One issue with the game is the close-range combat, which seems to be the one real weakness of the main character. If an enemy gets right in your face, it's really difficult to fire at the monster, and the melee attacks are practically useless. In some of the really difficult portions of the game, it creates somewhat of a problem, but the use of stasis to slow down the creatures is a great way to counter the issue. Overall, the controls are very precise and despite the shortcomings of the close-quarter combat, the game does a great job.Graphics:Graphically, Dead Space has a lot of strengths and a couple weaknesses. The lighting and shadows in the game are really spectacular and at times help make the game one of the scariest gaming experiences to date. Although the game features the same metal ship look throughout the game, the fine detail of the areas really helps give the environment life which therefore draws you into the experience. Another thing to note is that there are a few points in the game where you must exit the ship and enter zero gravity space. These sequences are really intense and feature some stunningly beautiful visuals. On the other hand, the textures throughout the game are rather low resolution, and even the character models aren't too friendly-looking either. All in all, the variety and environmental detail helps balance with the medium-quality textures to create a really terrifying experience that doesn't sacrifice frame rate.Sound:One of the most important things about any horror game is the sound. Visceral Games has hit the nail on the head with this game, and has delivered a terrific sound experience. The ambience and environmental effects are remarkable and really help make every portion of the game scary and immersive. The sound effects are really great and shooting in the vacuum of space has never felt so good. The voice acting is nothing to brag about, but it is definitely passable and has its great moments. In the end, the mixture of environmental effects and terrific sound effects from both the weapons and enemies create an incredibly eerie experience that will make you jump from your seat.Replay Value:Dead Space is a single-player only game that lasts roughly 14-17 hours. Some portions of the game are rather repetitive but a good portion of the game is scary and a lot of fun. The sheer amount of upgrades for your character are too much for 1 or maybe even 2 play throughs, so many will come back for more. The story is also hard to fully understand on the first play through, so a second play through is definitely warranted for many. Overall, the game doesn't last too long, but the terrifying experience is definitely worth the purchase.Rating:Story: 8.0Gameplay: 8.5Graphics: 9.0Controls: 8.5Sound: 9.5Replay Value: 8.0Overall: 8.6","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2009"}

No, it's not GTA or Saints Row, nor is it trying to be. Sleeping Dogs has a more theatrical and story driven feeling to it than other open city games. Taking place in Hong Kong, the game follows Detective Way Shen, an undercover officer who is instructed to infiltrate and become a member of the Triads, Hong Kong's most elite gangsters. What follows is Way battling with his internal and external struggles with both the law and the Triads as he moves up the ranks. The story really pulls you in and you start to care for Way as you learn more about him and his past. The cinematics and writing rivals Red Dead Redemption (really good).Gameplay is most similar to the Batman Arkham series; mashing buttons, doing blocks, and performing crazy combos. Sleeping Dogs incorporates both martial arts and standard street brawling that is brutal to watch (snapping peoples limbs and watching them react to it is extremely well done). Also included is minor gunplay and driving, but the star of the show is really brawling with the environment. Special environmental attacks have been scattered all around the city, such as being able to throw foes into garbage cans, slamming them into aquariums, and face first slams into electrical appliances. I really liked these as they help balance the odds. The driving is very arcady, taking from the Need for Speed series, and is far more realistic compared to GTA in that the more reckless you become, the more responsive the police are.However, once you beat the game it offers little to nothing to keep you playing. Sure, you can go find the rest of the collectables scattered around the world, but that's it. I really would've liked something after the main story. Also, there is ZERO multiplayer. Having an open world to fool around with is always better with other people.

{"product_name":"B00019HNNM","description":"The close of a trilogy is a touchy thing. Miramax's slasher pic Scream 3 highlighted the role of each part: Chapter one sets the rules. Chapter two bends the rules. And chapter three throws them all out the window in favor of taking the story full circle.Which brings us to the third part of the Onimusha trilogy, subtly titled Demon Siege. In the first of many switches from the franchise's usual MO, there are three playable characters &#8211; Jean Reno's Jaques, the first Onimusha's Samanosuke, and Parisian military woman Michelle. Each offers wildly different play mechanics, and this coupled with the game's time warp storyline (more on that later) offers needed variety to a survival horror franchise that was never really know for its fear factor.Each character will upgrade their weapons and skills through the course of the game (much less so for Michelle, as she's playable for far less of the game than the other two) in the usual fashion&nbsp;&#8211; collecting souls. Without a combo-laden combat system, Demon Siege relies heavily on timing and strategy to master each of the three warriors. This mechanic is very reminiscent of Enter the Matrix for two reasons: minimal button presses result in onscreen action that looks very, very cool. Two, the timing of action is far more crucial than combos. The difference is that Demon Siege is just a much better game &#8211; the enemies offer more variety, the control is more precise, and the elemental weaponry is extremely varied.While some action hardcores will likely fault the game for its simple control scheme, most will appreciate it for the satisfaction it brings to the screen. Kicking a demon away so you have better range with the Ball and Chain of Doom (my name for it, not the game's) is quite cool, after all. Just keep in mind that plot and combat play equal roles in the Onimusha universe, and each are doled out fairly.On the story side of things, Demon Siege has that dual time period hook. How well is the idea executed? Well, Paris really looks like Paris; and without being able to experience feudal Japan firsthand, all I can say is that it looks beautiful in the game. The plot unfolds at a lightning pace and requires players to use one character (in one time period) to do something, which has an effect on the other character (in the other time period). Switching frequently, the game's pace is so well crafted that there are few places that seem to be a pause &#8211; you'll always want to do that next thing.What I really like about this game is that I always felt like I was getting a new weapon, going to a new area, or fighting a new boss (most of which are ferociously tough, by the way). There was no drag for me. That, and kicking Genma butt made me look badass. Personally, I wouldn't want anything else for my favorite samurai/horror sendoff.Concept:Craft a compelling, edge-of-your seat action game to conclude the Onimusha seriesGraphics:3D backgrounds don't mean that players have camera control, but it does mean that everything looks really greaSound:The score alternates between totally inspired and super cheesy &#8211; but it does fit the gamePlayability:Timing is the key to success and I rarely felt robbed, so it did what it was supposed toEntertainment:Demon Siege is one of the most cinematic games to date, and I soaked up every second gratefullyReplay:HighRated:9 out of 10Editor:Lisa MasonIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:The final chapter of the Onimusha trilogy radiates excitement and is the very definition of epic. The opening CG cinematic is so detailed and explosive that I wouldn't be surprised if George Lucas started handing out pink slips to the ILM crew. I know this clip is only a few minutes in length, but it is worth the price of admission alone. Further justifying that you absolutely need to add this title to your library, the gameplay is equally exquisite and is brimming with non-stop intensity. The methods with which you dispose of your assailants remain simplistic and true to the series. Plus, the battles are much larger in scope, the pacing of levels is relentless, and the visuals that you breathe in are all the more majestic. This truly is game development at its finest. While I would have liked to see more interaction in the environments, and depth in the combat, I really couldn't ask for a better conclusion to one of the PlayStation 2's finest series.Rated:9.25 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Tim","summary":"No jump button, No kick button","reviewText":"Before I purchased this, I thought that it was going to be one of the best action games ever. After playing, I was disappointed. It's a very \"AVERAGE\" game, that doesn't have anything special to make it stand out from other games.I found it very weird that there is no jump function. The only way to kill air-born enemies is to shoot them with a bow n arrow. This can be tedious since you have to stop and stand still, then use the lock on target button.And since there is no jump, you can NOT jump in the air and perform hard landing attacks.There is also no kick button. Kicks would have added a little more variety to the attacks.You should buy God of War instead. It's a LOT more fun and exciting than onimusha 3.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2005"}

{"product_name":"B002BRZ6UE","description":"","reviewerName":"G.P.","summary":"A FPS with a twist","reviewText":"Let me start off by saying that I'm not a PC gamer so I never played the original Crysis. When they announced that Crysis 2 would also be released on consoles, I was definitely interested as I remember the original game got high review scores and everyone also raved about the graphics. From my limited time playing this evening, this is a very good FPS and incredible graphics (I'm playing the PS3 version & I would put the graphics on the same level as Killzone or Uncharted). With most shooters, you can pretty much jump in and get the hang of things because they are mostly similar and have almost identical controller layouts. Crysis 2 is different. I made the mistake of jumping straight into multiplayer without playing the single player campaign so I had no idea how to use the various powers associated with your nanosuit. In short, I got owned in my first game. I then went and played the single player campaign for about an hour until I was comfortable with the nanosuit and activing it's various powers (stealth, armor, power, etc.). When I jumped back into multiplayer I was able to do a lot better. Armor and stealth are the two nanosuit powers that people seem to use most in multiplayer and they are conveniently mapped to the L2 and R2 buttons to activate. I prefer to use armor myself but it seems like most people use stealth. Up and down on the d-pad also activate your nano-visor and infrared vision (I forget what's it actually called in the game). I haven't come across any need to use the nano-visor or infrared vision in multiplayer because it's pretty fast paced, but you will use them a lot in the single player campaign. Power on your nanosuit is automatically applied when sprinting (you sprint faster) and jumping (holding the X button makes you jump higher to climb up ledges). R3 is your basic melee command but if you hold down R3 you can perform a power kick (kick cars down the street, etc.) The nanosuit powers are pretty balanced because they drain the energy level of the suit, so you are only able to use them for a brief period of time. The energy level is drained depending on how much you are using a certain power. For example, using the stealth power while sprinting will drain your suit energy much faster than using stealth while moving slowly or standing still. Overall, this is a very good futuristic/sci-fi type shooter with fun multiplayer. Other reviews I've read have also mentioned that the campaign is about 11-12 hours long so you'll definitely get your money worth with this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2011"}

On the PS3 that basically puts it up against Gran Turismo and GRID. Can it make enough of an impact to get your pocket money? Probably.The saviour of the PS3 is the ability to download game demos. Without this, I would never have bought Need For Speed: Shift. The reason? The last 3 or 4 NFS games have been simply terrible and I didn't expect this to be any different. I'm pleased to say that's not the case this time around though.GameplaySo what do you get with NFS:Shift? Well it's basically a single-play linear career mode, and online play. Whilst the career mode aims to be free-form, it really isn't. Race, win, buy, race, win again - that's what it's all about. In 'easy' mode, even the most mediocre driver will come first every time. You really need to set the game to 'medium' before it starts to become challenging.If you've read any of my previous reviews on racing games, there are two things which bug me: the other driver AI, and the damage model. Gran Turismo is at one end of this line - the AI is abominable and there is no damage model (although we still wait to see if GT5 manages to pull this off). At the other end of the line is GRID, where the AI is actually pretty good and the damage model is extremely effective. NFS:Shift straddles the line almost dead centre. The AI is certainly better than GT5, and in some ways I actually think it's better than GRID too - the other drivers do make mistakes - big ones sometimes. But they won't swat you out of the way if you're on their racing line. Having said that, if you get testy with them, they will retaliate in kind - so don't go barging them around and expect to have a free ride. One negative point about the AI vehicles - whilst you will slip and slide and slow down when you go gardening, they don't. They can rip across grass and through gravel traps without slowing down. It makes for an unbalanced racing experience especially if you are in an endurance race. If you go off in a collective crash, whilst you're fussing about trying to get back on track, the AI vehicles will simply drive off leaving you in the dust.The car damage model is also better than GT5 but doesn't go far enough. There's dings and scratches, and occasionally you can rip off the hood, but the wholesale destruction of GRID just isn't there. You can jam a Pagani Zonda R into a wall at 200km/h and it will bend and scratch and bounce off, but still be driveable. This isn't right - obviously. Look at GRID. Look at Forza on the Xbox. These games know how to do car damage properly. NFS:Shift is good, but not good enough in this area.In career mode, you progress by winning races, earning stars and increasing your driver ranking. Cash is needed for vehicles and upgrades, whilst stars and driver ranking determine your overall progress through the game. Stars are awarded for set tasks within each race - for example reaching a preset speed, or earning a certain number of experience points. Experience points are earned for just about anything but are broken into two categories - precision and aggression. If you drive close to the racing line, hit the apex on every corner and do clean overtakes, you get precision points. If you constantly end up smashing into other cars, drafting them and trading paint, you get aggression points. Depending on which you have more of, that determines which invitational events get offered to you. More precise drivers get invited to hot lap and timed events, whilst more aggressive drivers get invited to last-man-standing and knockout events.You'll find a handful of different types of race available all through the game from straight pack racing, to manufacturer specials, to drift events to one-on-one races. Special attention has to be paid here to the drifting events. Whilst the car handling in normal racing is quite competent, the handling in the drift events is borderline retarded. It's so bad that not even the AI can control your car properly - after you finish and event and the AI takes over whilst the scores are displayed, your car will be spinning wildly in a circle or slamming into the wall. Which is exactly how you'll be playing - spinning wildly or slamming into the walls. They've made the car so loose for the drift events that the slightest touch on the throttle results in the car spinning. It's completely unrealistic and totally ruins the whole point of drift events. They should have made it so that it takes effort to get the car into a slide, and skill to keep it there. Instead, the cars are so willing to slide that they're simply uncontrollable. The first time you try the drift events, you'll have all the review complaints in the back of your mind and you'll be thinking \"surely it's not that bad\". Minutes later, you'll be thankful that the career progression doesn't require you to actually complete the drift events to complete the game.The cars in NFS:Shift are an eclectic bunch from older VW Golfs all the way up to Veyrons and Zondas. There's about 60 in total - nowhere near the count of some games, but enough of a selection for most people. Each car can be upgraded with cash in several categories - aerodynamics, brakes, engine etc - the usual stuff.  Although the way the career mode unlocks new cars, you'll often be partway through building up your current vehicle, only to be offered a top-of-the-line Ace of Spades. It becomes annoying after a while and removes the incentive to stick with one car and fettle it until it's a winner - just go any buy the top-line car straight away.The cars can be customised with different rims, paint jobs and graphics, although why they bothered I don't know. The paint colours are easy enough but you'll die before you manage to get any graphics on the car in anything like the style you want. There's no alignment or coordinate grid, no copy and paste - it's all done manually. There's not even a 'mirror' option, so if you get one side of your car looking how you want, you then have to manually do the other side too. Frankly though the chances of even getting one side looking how you want are slim at best. Fortunately there's some decent pre-built paint and vinyl jobs that you can choose from.GraphicsLets get this out of the way right up front. Yet another \"next generation\" game that really isn't. That's right folks - it's a 720p game, not full HD. And whilst it's better-looking than (for example) FUEL, it's nothing like the eye candy that the PS3 is actually capable of. Once again, coding for multiple platforms means that the PS3 owners take it in the pants because the games house has to code for the lowest common denominator - Xbox.So taking the low resolution into consideration, the graphics are adequate. The in-car views are by far and away the best in any non-HD game so far and thankfully, the default camera is in-car. There's a couple of other views - hood view, fender view, and the always present and always useless above-and-behind view (why do they still bother with this one?)All the tracks are nicely represented and instantly recognisable to anyone into motorsports. The corkscrew at Laguna Seca is very nicely turned out, and the London street racing circuit passes by a ton of very recognisable landmarks. It's not full-on simulation though - there's some artistic license here and there, but it's done well and done for effect, and never detracts from the game itself.The car modelling is also adequate. Not as good as Gran Turismo or Forza, but all recognisable makes and models. The on-car vinyls and graphics are a bit sketchy though - very blurry and the entire game suffers badly from blurry texture on oblique surfaces. For example on the sides of buildings, or the sides of the cars in replay - the graphics fuzz out very quickly. Also the level of detail modelling on the cars is very abrupt. When they change from the lower level of detail to the higher level of detail, there's a noticable 'pop' in the shape and shading which can be very distracting at times.What is very well done are the in-car driver effects. The view bobs and shakes with every corner, dab of the brakes and sideswipe. Rather than the classic rock-solid head-in-a-vice view that we're used to, NFS:Shift gives us a far more dynamic experience and it is so much the better for it. Layered on top of all the motion are G-effects - blurred vision, tunnel vision, G-loc, blackout - all very convincing representations of the frail nature of the human body. Slam your car sideways into a wall at 100mph and you'll get blurry, grey vision for a few moments. Very clever and very effective.Sadly, all the good points are marred by the choppy framerate. Everything's fine when you're out in front, but if you're mid-pack, the framerate is all over the place. Sometimes it drops so suddenly that it actually interferes with the gameplay itself - almost like the game is spending so long trying to draw the next frame that it's ignoring the input from the player. This is inexcusable on a machine as powerful as the PS3.Replay/photo modeLike all racing games now, there's a fairly comprehensive replay and photo mode in NFS:Shift. The replay isn't as fine-tuneable as it is in Codemasters games (GRID, DIRT2, FUEL etc) in that you can't go into super-slow-motion and soak up the view, but it's useable at least. The one oddity is that when you take a snapshot in-game, rather than do the logical thing which would be to store it in your pictures folder on your PS3, it uploads the picture to the NFS website instead. There you have to navigate a ton of bloat just to find the darned pictures. Why?AudioThe audio in NFS:Shift is a high point. Whilst it gets a bit choppy in some places, the overall effect is great. You get the impression they went out and sampled the engine noises from inside the car and did it properly. All sounds are very well represented, from squealing brakes, to rattling bodywork, turbo blow-off valves, supercharger whine and induction roar. If you're one of those who plays racers in the above-and-behind camera view (why?) then you'll miss most of the audio in this game.Another good point to note - there is in-game music, but by default it's turned off so you can actually concentrate on the act of driving and the sounds of being in the car.ConclusionWell we're still waiting for Gran Turismo 5. It's either going to be the best racing game in the history of forever, or it's going to suck big time. In the meantime, satisfy yourself with NFS:Shift. Sure it's not HD. Sure the graphics are blurry and the framerate is choppy. Sure it's not really a next-gen game. But that's not the point because to use a well-worn phrase, it's so much better than the sum of its parts. Whilst all the cons are very irritating on their own, when you're mid-pack fighting for position in the Eau Rouge corner at Spa, frankly none of them matter.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2009"}

Thick mud, tangled undergrowth, swift flowing rivers, choking volcanic clouds and searing lava pools all test the drivers to their limits and beyond. Expect a rich festival of off road racing, along with a host of game modes and rewards. It's brutal, dangerous, relentless, and unpredictable and more than a game -Motorstorm Pacific Riftis a way of life.Even More Vehicle Classes and TracksPacific Riftships with eight car classes: the seven from the original game (Bikes, ATVs, Buggies, Rally Cars, Racing trucks, Mud Pluggers and Big Rigs) all reproduced in new forms, as well as the new Monster Truck class. Big, but not as big or powerful as a Big Rig, Monster Trucks are surprisingly fast for their size and are able to roll over most other classes of vehicle and virtually any vegetation they encounter.The game's list of playable tracks has also been doubled to 16 and are categorized along the lines of the elements and the different environmental zones are found on the island. These zones are:The Air Zone- Tracks high up in the mountain and featuring lots of big jumps.The Fire Zone- Track oozing with new land and pools of lava that come from the island's resident volcano.The Water Zone- Here players will find courses laid out along the the beaches and other water sources of the island.The Earth Zone- The typical rough, rocky mud-filled off-road courses similar to the tracks found in the original game.Multiplayer ModesIn addition to the wild, anything goes singleplayer festival mode players of the originalMotorstormgame will remember and relish,Motorstorm Pacific Riftalso provides addictive multiplayer modes for both online and local play. These include the same rampaging, music injected, 12-player online support as the first game, as well as multiplayer options for local action up to four players. Play in local multiplayer modes are further enhanced by new four-player split screen functionality that when used in conjunction with the game's 720p HD video output ensures clarity no matter how fast racers are moving or how much mud they are throwing up.Key Game Features:The Island- A brand new radically different location for the festival.Unpredictable Events- Never the same race twice. Events will take place to change the race on a lap to lap basis.Split Screen Play- Play with up to 3 buddies on the same screen.The Monster Truck- An all new vehicle class added to the core vehicle selection for a total of 8 different vehicle classes.Immersive Online Experience- A radical re-look at the wholeMotorstormonline experience, focusing on ease of use and breadth of gameplay all while tearing it up in races up to 12 players.Improved Actions- A new level of control; punch, duck and ram using a new control layout.Free-play- Race how you want by creating your own race tickets.Photo Mode- Snap your greatest victory or your most visceral crashes and share them with the world.New Rating System- It's not all about winning; it's also about how you perform.Bells and Whistles: Tunes and XMB FunctionalityAs was the case with the originalMotorstorm, the driving experience inPacific Riftcan not be separated from the music that accompanies it. The game comes with a thumping 40 song soundtrack and players will also have the ability to pipe in their own playlists saved to their PS3 the ability to access others saved on your PS3's Hard drive. In addition for players who want to relive their moments tearing across the island, the game also features PlayStation 3 XrossMediaBar (XMB) functionality and Photo Mode. XMB lets plays create movies of their races and access them from the PS3's main menu, while Photo Mode allows you to take snapshots while within a race.As you roll into theRift, expect a rich festival of off road racing, along with a host of game modes and rewards.

I wasn't immediately taken by it as racing games are not really my thing. But this whole time the 0% tally on my trophy list taunted me. I just had to get it and play it properly to get the percentage up.It was a worthwhile investment as the game features quite a lot of escapism. Set on a gorgeous Pacific Island the races take place across four different types of environments with eight different types of vehicles. The races themselves are in the style of Road Rash with a no-rules-to-be-broken attitude. It can be very exciting, but a few of the courses are punishingly difficult and will surely end up with you chucking your controller through the screen. The vehicles vary in speed, shape and size, but mostly all of them suffer from poor handling. You'll often see hazards coming from way off but you'll be powerless to do anything about them.For a superficial burst of entertainment Motorstorm: Pacific Rift is good for about 10 hours. More than half of the trophies are online-based and since the game is three years old at this point no one else is playing online anymore. You've no chance of getting the Platinum now. I only got up to 16%. For a similar game with still plenty of online action you ought to go forBurnout Paradise.Graphics ASound A (your own tunes do come through at a significantly lower volume than the in-game music)Gameplay BLasting Appeal B-","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0038N0A24","reviewerName":"Libertarian!","summary":"Better than Expected, but not Great","reviewText":"Disney has quietly worked to revamp their gaming division, ending their practice of outsourcing game development to THQ and, instead, hiring gifted developers like Warren Specter to build up an excellent studio.One of their first, if not their first, movie tie-ins is for the newly released Toy Story 3. And the game has a weak story mode...but a borderline inspired sandbox (well, toy box) mode.It doesn't seem to follow the movie's plot...I certainly can't claim to have a clue about the plot after playing the game. You play as Woody, Jesse, or Buzz, each with their own special ability to solve puzzles. In the story mode, the story jumps from bit to bit so abruptly that you cannot really follow much. You simply engaged in a rote collectathon with little inspiration. One can almost tell that the developers stopped caring about the story mode early on and focused their energy on the reason to get the game.The toy box mode, though, is where the game shines. The world is surprisingly large, there is a ton of stuff to do, and the story is... OK, the story is pretty unmemorable. Let's not get insane here. You have to unlock new areas, unlock vehicles, find and unlock character models and outfits, unlock vehicles, etc. There are photo based missions, decorating based missions, races, bandit capturing, etc. Its a rather busy world.This is the first sandbox game that I can think of that is good and aimed at children. You have tons of stuff to do and the controls are solid. Sadly, the camera isn't nearly as good and you can spend lots of time fighting the game to see what you are doing (it is bad in story mode as well, so it is not a problem with toy box mode).There is an impressive amount of stuff to do here and you are seldom bored. Its not at the level of top notch open world games, but Toy Story 3 absolutely warrants some consideration as a solid title worth the time to play.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2010"}

{"product_name":"B007A7UJ4S","description":"","reviewerName":"El Loro del Fuego","summary":"Everything comes together","reviewText":"This is one of those uncommon gems in gaming where everything in a huge game comes together to create an amazing experience.  I just completed the game today(not the post-game content) and I felt compelled to write a little something regarding it.The main character, Oliver, is a seemingly typical young boy who lives in a small USA town called Motorville.  The game spends a little bit of time introducing you to Oliver, his mother, the town, etc. at the beginning of the game.  My expectations of the visuals were met as the game opened and I got to spend a little time wandering around town.  It really captures the feel of an anime film.After a tragic event happens that involves his mother, Oliver is introduced to a beautifully realized fantasy world that is parallel to his own.  He meets a fairy named Mr. Drippy and he asks Oliver's aid to save the fantasy world from an evil power.  Oliver also learns that he has the chance to save his mother in the process.What transpires afterwards is one of the most heartwarming tales I have experienced in a video game in a long time, if not ever.  Along the way, Oliver meets many interesting characters, a few of which accompany him throughout his travels.  He also travels to many parts of the land via the overworld in the game that has its own distinct look and feel.  Parts of the land are covered in snow while others are covered in desert sands.  Each part of the land is beautifully realized and exploring the towns and other areas within them in a treat.Oliver eventually learns that he has the potential to be a great wizard.  Along the way he learns dozens of spells to aid him in his adventures and also gains the ability to use familiars.  Familiars are magical creatures quite similar to pokemon that are created from someone's soul.  Oliver can attack on his own but a familiar may have a strength where Oliver may have a weakness.  Some have stronger physical attacks while others have stronger magical attacks.  Others may have great defense but may lack offensive capabilities and so on.  Adding to this is the affinity of each one regarding the different elements.  Oliver and those that accompany him can have up to three familiars with them at one time while the rest are sent to a familiar retreat until they are selected by you to be put in your party from one of many points throughout the world.  Capturing and finding the familiars that compliment your style of play best and leveling them up is extremely satisfying and addictive.  Constantly swapping between Oliver and his familiars to best handle the situation at hand during a battle is very exciting and rewarding.While the game certainly has a cartoony aesthetic to it it does not mean this game is only for a younger audience.  There is a lot here for people of all ages to enjoy.  While the game isn't one of the most difficult JRPGs I've played it definitely does require some thinking and strategy especially during the later parts of the game.  The story does have a lighter tone.  Even the most sensitive people won't be able to find anything remotely offensive here.  That doesn't mean the story is any less powerful.  There are many touching moments throughout the game along with some narrative twists and turns that cause suffering for the characters and their world that they must overcome.  I don't want to go much deeper than that for fear of spoiling anything but I will say that I loved the story and how it was presented.  While the dialogue can get a bit sappy and cheesy at times, i easily overlooked it since this kind of dialogue was usually coming from the younger and innocent characters in the game.I can't recommend this game enough if you're a JRPG fan.  It's truly an amazing game.  The combat and exploration draw inspiration from the fantastic Tales series and the Pokemon games.  The game also reminded of some elements from the Zelda series as well, mainly the fantastic music and the variety of the different dungeon-like areas you explore during the game.  I hope these games continue to do well here so I can continue to have great gaming experiences like this.If I have any complaints about the game they are: There could be more spoken dialogue in the game.  These segments of the characters being fully-voiced were too few and far between in my opinion.  Mainly because I loved them so much when they occurred.  It brought that much more personality to the characters.Also, Oliver's AI companions could be a little bit smarter.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2013"}

From here the action builds, but despite the massive amounts of gore, the horrifyingly cruel ways you can kill your opponents, and the terrible torments you inflict upon all, the substance of God of War is just plain satisfying.What saves God of War from being a cheapened button-masher is its scope and its depth:  you have clear goals, just the right amount of cinematic tie-ins, and puzzles that, while not incredibly hard, are also rather satisfying to complete.  You also have to think your way through your combat:  not knowing when to block or dodge, and which techniques work best, will be your doom.  By the time you reach the end, you feel like you've really accomplished something--you work for your achievements, and they truly feel earned.The only title better than God of War...is God of War II.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0038MUCPK","reviewerName":"Koala1356","summary":"Fun for Kids and Adults","reviewText":"I am an adult gamer, but not hardcore.  I like fun things, and \"Toy Story 3 The Video Game\" fits into that category perfectly.  There are several modes of play, including the two big ones, \"Story Mode\" and \"Toybox Mode\".\"Toybox\" is the open world sandbox where you are the sheriff of the town.  It's your job to do just about everything, including catching bandits, building new businesses, recruiting civilians, and taking missions (quests) from various inhabitants of your town.  There is enough here to keep anyone busy for hours.\"Story\" is, well, the story.  Here you relive and play through scenes from the movie.  I confess I have not delved into this too much as yet.  I find \"Toybox\" too much fun!Being kid-friendly, there are no \"deaths\" in the game, just endless amounts of respawning when you fail to do something.  (IE: unlimited penalty free do-overs).  There are also no guns; ammunition is in the form of small colored beach balls, which you toss at the bad guys to knock them out/knock them over.  You also use your beach balls to hit  targets that need interaction, for example: hitting a target to lower a bridge so you can cross it.Money is in the form of gold coins, which you can endlessly earn by breaking barrels and crates (they respawn after just a minute or so), or using your pickax to mine gold-flecked rock, or by completing quests and missions.  You'll need lots of it to buy new buildings for your town or new toys, but fortunately, it's easy to come by with just a little work.The control system is well thought out and works well.  It's easy to pick up and play, even for kids.  Items are scrolled and selected via the D-pad, L2 locks on a target and R2 throws a beach ball.  Face buttons preform the other various functions.  I recently bought PS3 Dual Triggers to enhance my triggers and I must say that it was an investment well spent.  Since Toy Story 3 uses the trigger buttons rather than shoulder buttons, it is a perfect match.Overall, Toy Story 3 is one of the better \"movie games\" I have played, and I would recommend it to gamers of all ages, from kids to adult, who just want to have some fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2010"}

It's as much fun as modern warfare 2's campaighn, and that IS saying alot.  The awesome thing is that they pack every minute of the short campaign with tons of fun, and the whole feel of the game, the graphics, the gameplay, it's all pitch perfect for the batman universe.  I hope they make the sequel a bit longer, but with a game this awesome, it's really a minor complaint.  There is also replayability abound in this title, and one playthrough simply won't do.  There's a reason this game took nearly 2 years to drop below the 20 dollar price point.  That's an honor most games don't get.  You can usually find almost any game for under 20 bucks within a year of it's release.  But this game is truly an elite game, and has me extremely excited for the sequel.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00002STH5","description":"It's taken a while to get here, but Nintendo's 64-bit update to the old SNES classic, F-Zero, is here. F-Zero X is a stunning achievement in that it's truly the first racing game that runs at a brisk 60 frames per second, even in multiplayer. In fact, more than anything else, it is this feature that is F-Zero X's claim to fame. Does the rest of the game stack up? Well, it depends on what you're looking for.Instead of trying to compare it to its 16-bit counterpart, we'll dissect F-Zero X purely on its own merits. After all, the bar has been raised for racing games in general over the past few years. So what does the game have to offer? Well, first of all, forget any kind of simulation aspects. This is twitch gaming at its best. Although you can tinker with the basics, like acceleration and speed, that's about all you get to do. Everything else is just about driving. Playing like a Wipeout without weapons (which was like playing F-Zero with weapons), F-Zero X's only added enhancements are the inclusion of dash plates located at various points around the track. When you run over one of these plates, you get a severe speed boost that doesn't cost you any energy (after the second lap, you get boost power that you can use at any time, but it takes away some of your energy), enabling you to blast past some of your opponents. However, they too can use these plates.That's not to say that you can't dispose of your opponents though. By using the Z-button or the right shoulder button you can either crash into your opponent making his energy meter drop, causing him to explode if his meter is low enough. Or, you can try to shove him off the track if there is no barrier keeping you in. A number of play modes are available, including practice, death race, time attack, and vs. battle. However, the majority of the racing will be done in the grand prix mode, where the cup levels await. Each cup increases in difficulty, naturally, but with each additional level conquered, more and more racers are made available to you, adding replay incentive. If you make it to the final secret cup, you'll uncover a random track generator that offers you a fresh challenge every time.So what's the problem with F-Zero X? For starters, with up to 30 different racers onscreen at any given point, some sacrifices had to be made in order to keep the insane frame rate so high. Polygon counts on the vehicles are very low, giving them a particularly uninspiring look. The track detail is also very limited, giving the track a spartan feel to it. In its defense, the tracks are cleverly designed, especially the twisty corkscrew tracks that speed by at a blazing pace. One feature that's lacking is a first-person view. If speed was truly supposed to be on display here, a cockpit view would definitely have helped, but alas, there is none to be found. Control is pretty good, although the analog stick can be kind of touchy in places, leading to a few inadvertent fender benders. The sound effects are very good and actually add to the feeling of speed in the game. Unfortunately, the music can be pretty annoying in a cheesy synthesized-metal kind of way and doesn't really add much to the whole experience.As a game, F-Zero X is certainly thorough in its execution; unfortunately, there just seems to be very little in the game to keep you coming back. Sure, Nintendo incorporated all those funky characters to give it... um... character, but the game erases all that good stuff with its overwhelming blandness. Yes, the game can be fun in multiplayer, being supersonic and all that, but the game just lacks those certain intangibles that make a good game great. Practically flawless from a technical standpoint, the biggest thing missing from F-Zero X is that it lacks a soul. It's yet another stunning update to the legendary Nintendo catalog, but it's games like this that make you wonder: Where's Metroid 64 or Donkey Kong 64? Back to the drawing board it seems. --James Mielke--Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Resident Evil 4 took a chance to reinvent the franchise and did it perfectly, aside from some goofy writing and a few blurry textures. Now about 4 years later, Capcom decides to build on the foundation that RES 4 made for the franchise with Resident Evil 5 for the next generation consols. Sorry, no wii version this time :(To start, the graphic are some of the best ever seen on the 360/PS3. The cinamatic effects in the game and in the cutscenes are totaly wicked! The textures are great, the animations are amazing, and the lip sincing is dead on. The graphics also compliment with the sound. The voice overwork is good and the music fits perfectly with the game. The game's biggest inprovment is the co op addition, which is an AWESOME thing. Unfortunatly the inprovements end just about there, as the gameplay is basically the same as RES 4 except now you can straff, which is a big help.In terms of story, its pretty good. I won't go to much in it so i don't spoil anything. To start, it barley has anything to do with RES 4 so you don't have to play any of the Resident Evil games to understand the story. It's full of action, some good writing, and some great cinamatics. It feels like what a really good movie should be. In terms of gameplay, its just a prettier looking version of RES 4, which is good because they already have a good thing going for that gameplay style. If it aint broke, don't fix it. But sadly, this is where the small problems begin to bug me.RES 4 was about a 15 hour ride of awsomeness. RES 5 is about halve as long so it doesn't feel as sastifying once you beaten it. Chapters are signifigantly shorter and sections of the chapters are so brief, you barley felt like they even started by the time they end. To make up for this, you get a ranking at the end of each sections, making you wanting to replay them for a better score and you have 3 different difficulty settings to choose from. Each level is designed pretty well and the same goes for the shop. You can buy or upgrade guns, buy items to help you, and sell stuff for money here. You go here before each level begins and after you die; and most things are reasonably priced. The game's biggest issue is the fact that it is not as scary as you think. That's saying quite a bit, considering the fact that the franchise created a genera called SURVIVOR HORROR.The spookyness has been replaced with pure action, which is ok, but you play a Resident Evil game to be scared, not to be enthrolled into heart pumping action sequences. You can read papers placed around the levels as well as examine the enviorement, much like RES 4, but the text at the bottom of the screen is hard to read sometimes. Not to mention that the emblems that opened every important door in RES 4 have been removed for the most part. Emblems were a big part of the franchise and not having them around as much just irritates me.After the semi long story is over, you have a few extra options to keep you busy, like online modes and unlockable costumes. The costumes are selfexplanitory and as for the online modes, you can play the story online with and random person or dowload the versus mode, which you can play against or with other people in online mini games, which can get very addicting.In conclusion, Resident Evil 5 is a good game that suffers from minor problems that could've been easily avoided. The problems aren't game destroying by any means though. This is one of the best games of 2009 hands down, but the only problem that really annoys me is the fact that this game doesn't feel like a Resident Evil game should.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2009"}

I of coarse have heard of the series, but I never played one. My buddy Gary bought it and we played through it together with the splitscreen mode. The game was fun but at times frustrating. I loved the co op component. Every game should have a splitscreen, its so fun to play a game with friends while those friends are in the same room. The graphics are another strong point in this game. The cutscenes look great and the in game engine looks very good. The color palette for the game has a gray dull look. This is intentional in order to add the horror element that the series is known for. The game has a nice length and will last you a few days. I'm not really sure how long the game is, but it took us a week to beat and we played it an hour or two a day. The final compliment I have for this game is the quick time events. During some boss battles there are a few button combinations that pop up on the screen, and you must hit them in order to stay alive. It's a great way to keep you on your toes. Also you can upgrade your weapons in between missions which is pretty cool. There are a lot of weapons though so I didn't find it necessary to improve many guns other than my trusty pistol.Now onto the complaints. First off you can't move while you shoot. You have to be completely still while you shoot zombies. This is frustrating because your enemies can move while they attack you. This is even more frustrating with melee weapons as you swing and hit nothing because you can't move while you swing. Your enemies don't have this problem and can run and hit you without remorse. Also the aiming system is broken. You don't have the traditional cross hairs instead you have a laser pointer in every gun. For close range shots it's not that big of a deal, but for the farther distance shots it can be hard to tell where your gun is aiming. The story is another disappointing part of this game. The story isn't bad it just isn't that well developed. Basically there is one bad guy and you chase him throughout the game while killing hordes of zombies. Also the last level is a joke. I won't ruin it but wow it really went of the deep end. The last level involves a volcano and moving a rock with your bare fists. The ending of the story isn't that good either as you are expecting something to happen at the end to keep you hooked for the next one, but instead feels like the end of a series, even though its not. Just nothing at the end even intrigues me to play the next game. There are some other problems like the item slots being limited. There are nine slots which you think would be enough, but there are a lot of items and guns to pick up in this game. The most annoying part is that the gun and ammo take up different slots. They should both be in the same slot so that you can carry more items.Overall this game has potential, but unfortunately because of an ancient combat system it fails to reach it. I do recommend it to fans of the series as I would guess you are used to this system. To those of you who are not fans of the series like myself should rent the game, because when you beat the game you won't pick it up again. Where long time fans will dissect every scene I don't know the back story that well so there is no reason for me to study it in depth, because as I said before the story is a disappointment. I really hope they can refine the game play mechanics for the next title, because this series has a chance to be a great one it just misses the mark this time.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2010"}

Boy was I glad I did!Allied Assault presents some of the most realistic feeling, immersive war-time experiences ever incorporated into a video game. While the game itself is not realistic as far as damage and equipment carrying goes, etc.., the sound, graphics, missions and locations are incredibly well detailed and produced.  The atmosphere is very immersive and the attention to detail regarding 1940's WWII locales is tremendously recreated.The Normandy Beach mission, straight out of \"Saving Private Ryan,\" provides one of the most memorable PC gaming moments ever. Your mouth will remain open as you dodge explosions, watch your men die and fall around you as you approach the beach and run for cover from the German fortifications.The cut scenes are done a-la \"Half Life\" where you are able to control your character's point of view while they are running, a very good choice.Most importantly MOH:AA provides a lot of varied missions, preventing it from getting monotonous, lots of action and intense gun fights, and using natural elements as obstacles make for a realistic experience despite the run-n-gun style of the game. At one point I was driving a tank blowing up buildings full of snipers, in another I was running through German countryside using tomb stones as cover from a nest of Nazi's holed up in a bombed-out church (see the SP demo).The game is a bit short in duration, but has a significant replayability factor in that you can go back and play on 3 different difficulty settings, and pick and choose which mission you would like to play over again. Every time you complete a mission, it will be done slightly differently depending on your weapon(s) of choice, strategy, and ability to shoot accurately.The multiplayer mode has serious potential, but has yet to reach it. The ability to play in co-op mode through the single player missions with others would be a great addition to the game, and a MOD is already available which does just that, covering the infamous Normandy Beach Invasion (D-Day).Medal Of Honor: Allied Assault, is certainly one of the best First Person Shooters ever made, and if you enjoy games like No One Lives Forever, you'll love Allied Assault as well, an instant classic from EA Games and 2015 (ID Software). You will need a Pentium III 600mhz processor or better, and a 64MB video card of high quality to run the game at respectable rates, keep in mind, in my opinion. The game's requirements are indeed quite high, even at lower detail levels.I play a lot of different PC video games, RPG, Adventure, Sports and FPS genres, and Medal Of Honor is definitely a game I can recommend without hesistation.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2002"}

Also the use of the Wii remote was pretty swag, but it's just flat in comparison to other RPG's on other consoles. The story was mediocre and characters were not that likeable. Also the lack of equipment was a nightmare. Playing a game with the same armor with only 6 more sets to chose from was pretty lacking in my opinion. Compared to games like Monster Hunter where you get endless amounts of goodies to mess around with. If I had to put this RPG up against another I'd say \"Infinite Undiscovery\" on the xBox 360 was just as good as Last Story.

The controls are obnoxious: I want to draw the string on my bow,but instead I kick. I want to unsheath my dagger,but instead I take out my club.Many times the game will tell you what buttons to push (push down on the crosspad to draw your weapon) but even when you do,nothing happens.Also the spell casting is even more horrid than the melee and ranged attacking.2.)Glitches... so many glitches: The \"hero\" of this adventure will walk around in short circles and pace back and forth when the game switches to a cutscene with another character.It's hard to take the game dialouge seriously when the main character looks like he is doing a wee wee dance.C'mon!At least have the camera and the character centered correctly.Also another glitch happened to me early in the game that I have to report.When I was on my way to see the prophet,there is a bridge that must be brought up with magic.But because the hero walks off on his own when talking to another character,I ended up falling off about twenty feet!Funny thing is that the game still tried to carry on the conversation with the character at the end of the bridge wayyyy up above me.So to try to fix the situation,I just pressed a button;next thing I know I am in a crypt trying to burn up skeletons with a crappy magic system that doesn't work.3.)Motion blur: I don't know who the ad wizard was that came up with this one,but it is terrible. I'm sorry but it doesn't look realistic,it just makes you want to barf and gives you a headache,and there aren't any options to shut it off.4.)Teleporting when you \"aren't going the right way\": This seems like a feature that would have been added on in a game that was made ten years ago. At first I didn't understand what was going on,but then after walking a short distance in the same area for about fifteen times....oh I see,going to this spot is a no no.So much for open exploration!All this game really has going for it is some nice graphics,but that's like wanting to watch someone throw up a rainbow.The orc chick was kind of hot too,but I don't know about the others;to me they just seemed like Shrek with anger managment issues.Also the whole satanic pentagram on the throne room's carpet in the opening scene was a bit much for my taste,but that's just me.My advice is to save your money and try your luck with something like Trinity, Hyperdemension Neptunia or better yet,wait for Dragon Age 2.If you absolutely MUST play this game;rent it first or borrow it from a friend.This could have been a really great game (two stars for it's potential) but unfortunatley 2W2 isn't much better than the original.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2011"}

Probably a faulty assumption.  But I make it anyway.  Thus I will be brief.Everyone knows Final Fantasy IV (known as Final Fantasy II on SNES), and its cast of characters.  This collection contains that game with minor modifications as well as the interlude and the After Years.  The main game mostly stays true to the original except for name changes; I again assume you've played one of the other many re-releases of the game to be aware of these name changes.  I didn't have very many complaints about the remade Final Fantasy IV.  The difficulty is definitely greater than with the SNES version; beyond that it's a like-for-like experience mostly.The Interlude is an introduction/transition to the After Years.  It details the period of time shortly after the end of Final Fantasy IV, Rosa's pregnancy, the creation of the Mysterious Girl, Kain's disappearance, and other characters being introduced.  It's short, but entertaining.  It's not required in order to play The After Years, but it does help.The After Years is exactly what the name says it is: years after the events of Final Fantasy IV, the Mysterious Girl shows in various places; the Crystals are yet again in jeopardy, and the Eidolons are being captured one by one.  Nobody understands what is going on, and Golbez, last on the moon, is sent back to earth by FuSoYa to investigate what's going on.  This game introduces many new and some old characters to the mix, and by the game's near-end, you'll basically have free reign with just about everyone from Final Fantasy IV, new and improved (Tellah, I believe, is the only exception since he died), as well as new characters who are either students or children of the previous generation.  On the surface After Years seems like a dream come true for fans, and it is, from a storyline perspective.  I won't dig too deep into it, but my only real complaint about the After Years had to do with what I can only describe as \"Star Ocean: Second Evolution type obscenity\".In other words, the difficulty on After Years is abnormally ramped at times.  You'll have to grind to survive, and if there's one thing I dislike, it's a game where grinding is forced in order to get through the game.  Ramuh, anyone?The second thing, still related to this obscenity, is the final area referred to as The Depths.  I'm not going to spoil the events of the Depths.  Just know that it's OBSCENELY LONG.  For those who playedParasite Eveand actually played through the Chrysler building, it's basically the same thing...except that every floor has at least 1 boss; some have up to 4 bosses.  These aren't piddly bosses either; the first group of 12 or so aren't too bad, but then they get progressively worse.  It almost feels like an optional side dungeon but it isn't.  You have to go through each and every one of these bosses in order to get to the final boss.  I could maybe see one boss per floor; but four?  And like I said, they get tougher.  I mean Kraken (same boss from Final Fantasy I) was dishing out 2000 damage with a regular hit to my strongest character, and one-hitter-quitters to one of my healers who had 4000 HP at level 99.  Really, Square Enix?I didn't get to count how many bosses there were, because I stopped at Depth 14.  Reading online I see that there are over 30-something floors to the Depths.  Maybe my math is off, but that's a LOT of bosses.  What's worse is the fact the encounter rate is through the roof, so it's not like you're just cruising through the thing.I give them credit for trying to have some fan service in here, but too much is too much, you know.This collection is great for fans.  It is hurt by an unbalanced difficulty at the last dungeon that makes it a downright chore to finish.  It's fine to have multiple bosses as long as you mix things up and keep them interesting.  Unfortunately it was just an exercise in tedium, downright boring, and it really hurt the game experience.  Loved the story, but that last dungeon is just not cricket.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2011"}

Overall, this case works very well. I personally use it for my 3DS XL, and it still fits perfectly. There are elastic straps inside to hold the system in place, plus a padded flap to hold 3 DS games. As a first case for a new DS owner, you can't go wrong for the price. I would however prefer to have a bigger game capacity- there definitely is room within the case for more, but only 3 elastic loops are sewn in.

Symphony of the Night (SOTN) was an awsome PS1 game, mixing incredible RPG elements with classic Castlevania style.  Plus the difficulty was at a medium to where any one could play it.  Than came Circle of the Moon (COTM) which had the same style (and did a good job at that) but was flawd at that it was way to difficult.  More often than not you would find yourself killed by a sekeleton or a slime.  Now we have Harmony of Dissonance and it is just as great, but it is way to easy.  How, I beat it in less than 2 days.  Virtually unacceptable.The story of HOD is that Juste Belmont finds his friend MAxim injured after being gone for training for many years.  Juste is the Grandson of Simon BElmont star of Castlevnaia 1, 2, and 4.  Juste also finds out that his and Maxims lady friend Lydie has been captured.  So they venture into Draculas Castel to rescue her.The style is the same as SOTN or COTM so for those who played the 2 will get the hang of it quickly.  However the new change is that you now have spell books that modify the sub weapons and thus virtualy eliminates hearts and focu on MP.  I wll say that the best combo (and your invincible while doing this) is the Knife and Wind book.Overall this is a fun game, will include some additional hours plus you also have the Boss Rush Mode, SOund test, and play as Maxim to keep you busy after you win.  SO this is a must buy, but like I said, a little easy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2002"}

Fallout New Vegas is a great concept with some great ideas.  I mean concept, because it is apparent this game was never finished.  The game has many glitches and freezes constantly.  Just figure every time you start getting somewhere, it will freeze.  As I understood it, the developers promised all the glitches from Fallout 3 would not be present.  I guess they were wrong.  With all this in mind, for some reason you still push forward even after restarting the PS3 several times to get through it each time you play.  There is something in this game that compels you to play on.  I have talked with my friends who have this game on the 360 and they have the same problems, but they still play on.

Anyone who played the abysmal Sonic 4 when released in late 2010 will know what I mean. No matter how many times they crank out another Sonic game Sega just don't seem to learn what makes the game great and what makes the game bad. This self-congratulatory 20th-Anniversary pastiche of his so-called 'best bits' transports across all of Sonic's strengths and, unfortunately, all of his crippling weaknesses.The story has Robotnik/Eggman ravage Sonic's world with a time vortex, leaving him stuck in a Limbo that only high speeds through various levels can repair. I've said it before, and I'll say it again, Sonic just does NOT belong in a 3D world. His best stuff is 2D. Sega have had many chances at getting the 3D presentation right but they just don't get it. It's incredibly difficult to keep control of Sonic, as a weird inertia pulls him in directions you don't want him to go, and if you get the timing wrong just once you'll pretty much have to quit the level and start over as you're always being judged on speed; something that this game consistently prevents you from achieving. Even with the 2D sections in this game they don't seem to understand that hurtling the character down a declination at a furious speed, the screen unable to keep up with him, only to hit an unforeseeable dead end, is ABSOLUTELY INFURIATING!My biggest complaint is one which ALL Sonic fans will be familiar with. The one where Sonic is on an ever-so-slight inclination but just cannot get up it because he needs to build up speed. This character, this hedgehog, is sold on speed. GIVE US SPEED! Stop giving us dead ends and cement shoes! What don't they understand? And can anybody, anybody at all, explain to me the purpose in giving us tokens that knock 5 seconds off the counter when it takes about 10 seconds to reach and collect said token? Is it no more than a sick joke at our expense.Graphically, the game is very intense, and it may take a while for you to get used to it. The soundtrack is, as usual, absolutely brilliant and features many unlockable classics from Sonic's history, but I think they really missed a trick by not including the Lava Reef Zone theme (undoubtedly the best Sonic tune), Bridge Zone, or even a new version of 'A New Venture' fromSonic Rush Adventure. The games they chose to pay homage to are a curious assortment too. I expect reincarnations of stages from Sonic 1, Sonic 2, and Sonic & Knuckles but why give us re-hashed levels fromSonic the HedgehogandSonic Unleashed- games that were universally hated and practically disowned by Sega. They should be ashamed of those titles, not referencing them. The Sonic Advance games were far better, as was Sonic Rush. Why were they not remade instead?The game also features 50 trophies, but there's no way I'm going for the Platinum, I've got better things to do with my time than play the same levels over and over and over and over. I got to 52% and I'm happy with that.Sonic Adventure DX Director's Cut, despite it's flaws, was a better game, which is quite sad it's 12 years older than Generations. I really wish Sega would initiate stricter quality control with their mascot. The one thing that brings Sonic down again and again is the controls (and frequent agonizing slowness).Pros:Lots of sunshine, blue skies.Brilliant soundtrack by Jun Senoue.Cons:Unresponsive, sluggish controls.Lots of slow sections.Graphics ASound AGameplay CLasting Appeal C","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0002A6CPK","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Great Potential - Mixed Message","reviewText":"Killer 7 is a mature title that combines film noir, horror, and first person shooting in a game that is extremely artistic and unique.Set in a futuristic but very bleak cel shaded world, you have the ability to morph between a number of gun-wielding individuals all named \"Smith\". There's Kaede Smith who is the only female, who wears a dress that barely covers her underwear. Garcian Smith is tall, dark skinned and handsome. Dan Smith is the forceful one, there's a blind Smith, a masked Smith and so on. As in most games of this ilk, each Smith has his (or her) own strengths and weaknesses, so part of the puzzle of the game is to figure out who to use in each situation.There are a few puzzles, yes, but primarily the game is about shooting enemies at the indicated glowy yellow spot. A zombie-like creature staggers towards you. Their leg glows yellow. You shoot it and it explodes. In comes another, with a yellow glowing neck. You shoot the neck and it goes down. A larger glowing spot requires a powered up shot to take it out.I found the graphics both impressive in an artistic way and a bit old school in how they were rendered. It definitely showed an artist's touch in the design of the characters and locations. However, the group which transferred them from the drawing board to the in-game system lost some of the shine along the way - many of the scenes looked \"clunky\". I've seen several other film noir style titles on the GameCube that didn't have the clunky problem, so it stood out. I actually felt sorry for the artist, that he had a great vision that you could appreciate, but it wasn't quite put up properly.I got the same sort of feeling from the sound and dialogue. There were snippets that really had a film noir feeling going, and drew you into the feeling. But on the other hand, you had characters who kept saying the same thing Over and Over and Over again, until you were ready to look for glowy yellow spots on them. Much of the time the 'voice acting' involves reading subtitles while mechanized gibberish comes from the screen. To me, that's just not scary or dramatic. If the characters had a gnarly, spooky voice, or a manic, high squeaky one, or *something* with personality, I think it would have added a lot to the feeling.Gameplay itself is an odd combination. On one hand, it's very directed. When you walk into an area, you get highlighted spots - people to talk to, items to interact with, places to go. Unlike most games that simply have arrows or circles around those areas, here you get splinter-like shards pointing you at them. Once you actually find a monster to kill (with yellow glowy target areas) you're in a more normal combat situation, where you aim and shoot. You do actually reload, too.What I find odd about this all is that it's very much laid out as a \"simple game\" - which you would expect in a game aimed towards newer / younger gamers - but the content is VERY mature. There is a ton of blood, violence, swearing, sexual situations, etc. If the game really was meant for younger ones, it needs a lot of cleaning up before that would be appropriate. If the game was meant towards older gamers, I would expect the puzzles to be a bit more challenging, and the exploring to involve more thought.Still, I don't mean to take away from the great effort put into this game to make it \"different\". With so many cookie cutter games out there, it takes an effort for a company to break the mold - and an effort to find enough gamers willing to open their minds and give the game a fair try. Far too many gamers get comfortable in a game style and immediately discount any game they try that doesn't fit into the mold.So, lots of credit goes to these guys for their vision - but I think they didn't take quite enough time in testing and implementing it. I think if they come out with a sequel for the Wii, that has the much better graphic ability to really show the graphic vision, that it will become a true classic.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2006"}

Live the most popular moments from The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. Episodes I to III come to life -- and you can become a part of the story!","reviewerName":"Ian","summary":"A suprisingly excellent game","reviewText":"Star Wars is one of the greatest movie sagas of all time.  Period.  You can't deny it.  It's part of culture.  So are those disturbingly fun Lego toys.  So it's a good thing that someone in the videogame world decided to team these two enormously popular brand names together to create a suprisingly good game thats fun for all ages.As you probably guessed from the title, the star charachters in Lego Star Wars are those adorable little lego charachters, who look like thier counterparts from the movie.  We have lots of the first trilogy charachters set here in lego form.  Obi-wan, qui-gon, Watto, Sebulba, Count Dooku, Yoda, the battle droids, General grievious (cool!), and almost anyone else you can think of.  Even kit fitso (the tentacled guy who smiled in the area battle in episode 2) is in here, in lego form.  My favorite charachters?  The wookies.  They're just so damn cute and cuddly!The gameplay in Lego Star wars is incredibly simple.  You can run, jump, attack, use the force, and thats it.  Nothing to it.  So simple a child can do it (which is the point!).  I really have no complaints or issues here.Because this game is based on the first three movies in the star wars saga, you play through the biggest scenes from the movies.  In episode 1, you escape the federation ship, leave Theed, podrace, return to Theed and fight Darth maul.  Episode 2 (which is the shortest section of the game), has you going to Kamino, going through the droid factories, the arena, a gunship, and fighting Count Dooku.  Episode 3 is the longest, putting you in many situations from the movie, including the explosive ending battle on Mustafar.There are many amazing moments within these levels.  The big one on one fights are cool, and the scale of some of the battles is amazing (the Kashyyk beach landing comes to mind).  One absaloutly amazing moment is the first level of episode 3, where you are piloting a space fighter in the middle of the biggest space battle in star wars history.  Though it's a rail shooter (you go on a certian path while things happen around you), it's an incredible level, with things blowing up and fighters engaging one another.  At one point you blow a seperatist ship in half!The graphics here are pretty good.  Not too bad, not too good.  They simply get the job done, but they look good at the same time.  Some levels are amazing to look at, but i'll let you see them for yourself.The sound is equally good as well.  John Williams brilliant musical score is present, and it's still as good as ever.  The charachters don't talk, but they do squeak, groan, grunt, shout, or say other things (the droids say \"roger roger\" and \"Uh-oh!\".  Jar Jar says \"Ahh!\" upon being blown up).There's almost no violence in this game, which makes it great for kids.  When charachters are defeated, they simply explode into tiny lego pieces.  If your charachter is destroyed, they simply come back in a few seconds.  There are some lego limbs cut off (hands, legs, etc), but there is never any blood or screaming.  Even when charachters die, they simply have little \"X\"'s for eyes.I also liked the games sense of humor.  While I don't really want to give anything away, there were many moments where I was giggling like mad at a paticularly funny joke or gag.  I love how the clone troopers just waddle away as they jog around a level.  Rest assured that this is one game that doesn't take itself so seriously.When you finish the main part of the game, you can then get to work getting all the extras.  By collecting studs (the game's version of currency), you can buy new charachters, cheats (such as the enormously expensive invincibility), and fun stuff (such as replacing lightsabers with broomsticks).  Overall, there's quite a good amount of replay value here.  And let's face it, unlocking new charachters adds to some pretty wacky \"what if\" combinations, such as Darth maul and Chewbacca teaming up to defeat Count Dooku in episode 3.Unfortunitly, there is one big problem with Lego Star Wars, which keeps it from getting a five star rating.  It's simplicity.  Whiel its simple gameplay is nice, it eventually makes it very repetative.  You do the same things over and over and over again.  No matter what charachters you play as, no matter what level, its all the same in the end.  Because of this, i've found that the best way to play the game is in short bursts, maybe an hour or so.The game is also quite short.  I completed all the levels in less then two hours on my first go!  It's not a gigantic problem, but it is questionable.But aside from that, this is a really fun game that i'm definitly going to buy.  Though it's a kids game, the fun and simplicity makes it a great game for all ages.  Highly recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2005"}

The graphics, gameplay and customizable outfits make it a game well worth buying!We really enjoy fighting games and have played most that have been released. It can be easy to start comparing them to each other and to look for the best of all possible worlds in each game. Tekken 5 really does a great job compared to most of what is on the market today!First, of course, the fighting. There are 20 characters to start with - plus a number of unlockable. The game does a GREAT job of offering you male and female, young and old, a variety of races. And unlike some other modern games, the females are actually clothed and earn your respect. You fully get the sense that each character has a background, a style, an attitude.Every character has his or her own moves and combinations. You can master one character, and move on to learning the next character's talents. The more you learn about each character's style, the better you get in any of the combat situations. There are plenty of moves to keep you entertained for weeks, and each executes flawlessly on the screen.Which brings us to the graphics. I really have to say that this is one of the best looking games I have seen on the PS2. Normally I give the XBox the edge on graphic quality - but there are some arenas that are just stunning. The dark chapel with orange stained glass stands out in my mind. Yes, the backgrounds are in action, the clouds move, birds fly by. You find that in just about any game in modern times. But the quality of the scenes are sometimes just amazing. Sure, there are some arenas that are a bit boring and look repetitive - there's one with dirt, dirt piles and dirt tornados which isn't graet. In general, though, someone spent a lot of time on the worlds you play in.The graphics for the characters is also quite well done. The braids move with your action, the scraves blow, the attack moves are smooth and flowing. When you slam into the ground or a wall, it creates impacts. Sure, being a PS2, there are some limits. The ground-pieces that fly up are sometimes rather jagged looking. Still, it's about as good as I've seen.The game has a wide range of difficulty settings, and you can choose characters that are easier or more difficult for you to play with.  There's a challenge even in the easiest modes though - don't expect to button-mash your way to victory. It really pays to spend a fair amount of time in training mode, to learn the specific talents of each character.I do have to say that when you are fighting a tough boss, it gets REALLY annoying to have the boss laugh at you - to have to sit through 5 long seconds of a replay of your failure - to then see and hear \"YOU LOSE!\" and then another few seconds of start-up before you try again. It's fine the first time or two, but there should be a way to skip it after that. We know we lost, already. There isn't a need for the game to grind your face in the dust for 15 seconds.That being said, even the main boss is beatable once you learn the counter-moves to his attacks. It's a matter of study, and learning your character's unique talents. There is definitely a way to win with every character. Again, button mashing won't do the trick. It takes strategy.Also, even though you have a 'circular world' to fight in where you can side-step left or right, it's a very close quarters game. You can't back up to set up a strategy, you can only mince a step or two back. There aren't other levels to jump down to or take advantage of. It's sort of like a sumo match, with a narrow circle to mince around in.The sound is fast-paced fighting music. There are different styles, to go with the different arenas, but all of it is generic and repetitive. I really like some of the other games that have \"real\" Chinese and Japanese music, say, for temple battles. But I realize of course that some people ignore the music completely, so it all depends on what interests you. I happen to appreciate having a great music track with my game.There are a nice variety of game options to keep you playing for months. There are of course the story modes where each character goes through stages and meets their friends and foes. There are one and two player random matches. There are all sorts of unlockables, customizations, and even a bunch of mini-games.Highly recommended in general!Rating: 4.5/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2005"}
{"product_name":"B0047TG2R0","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"Pretty Good Game with a Horrible Story","reviewText":"After finishing the game, I can say that while I had fun playing it, I was pretty disappointed; mostly by the story. I feel that, very similar to the differences between Mass Effect 1 and 2, this game was much simplified compared to Dragon Age: Origins while the graphics and actual gameplay were greatly improved. The only difference from the Sci-Fi Bioware offerings is that Dragon Age 2's story is much worse than ME2, and it isn't quite as polished. I'll go further into my problems with the story (spoiler filled) later in the review, but here is my problem at its most basic. The whole game just feels like a series of side missions, there isn't any over-arching story or conflict. I can boil the story down to the following 7 parts:1. Spend hours and hours earning money to go into the Deeproads2. Go into the Deeproads for about an hour or two3. Kill more time waiting for the Qunari problem to boil over4. Fight the Qunari5. Kill some more time waiting for the Mage vs Templar problem to boil over6. Pick either crazy side and kill the other7. Game OverRegarding the gameplay itself, while the responsiveness of the action is greatly appreciated, it quickly turns into a button masher, especially for fighters and rogues. There are very limited skills, basically they were all copied and pasted from DA:O. The skill trees are very annoying, as some things are completely useless but you have to purchase them if you want the better skills in that tree. They started a good idea by allowing you to upgrade skills, but I wish they had further developed this. In battle, I generally only had 3 or 4 skills I used in battle, then I'd wait for them to refill while spamming the A button. I wish there were more special attacks or combos, instead of the multitude of attribute changing skills that take up an exorbitant amount of stamina, and even uses percentages to further eliminate any benefit of leveling up your stamina. One addition I'd gladly welcome in the next dragon age game, would be some sort of leveling system for the basic attack animations. It'd be nice to have different patterns you could choose and upgrade, to reduce some of the dullness of the button mashing gameplay.There were surprisingly many glitches and problems, most glaringly with the save system. I'd say that almost every other save would fail. These fails were best when the system realized some sort of problem and gave an error message (happened very often). The next worse, was when it appeared the save succeeded, but when you tried to load it the file was corrupted. The only way to tell this has happened is to look at the save, and if the text is blank the save failed (happened often). So if this is your last save, make sure it worked before quitting your game. The last and worse save problem is when the autosave fails, and the save bar just keeps turning and turning (happened seldomly, twice for me). Because of this, you can neither save nor load a game, and your only option is to turn off the system of go to the dashboard. Thankfully, you can save very often (I think I had over 300 saves) so all of these problems weren't too bad. There were also other problems with the animation, where some characters merged during conversation (I noticed this with Merril and Isabella in the Hawke Estate) and some weird stuff with Hawke (most notably his arm disappearing into his body). There were also a few problems with the story choices you made conflicting with each other, but I'm not sure if these were errors or just bad story telling. There were further glitches where the Exiled Prince DLC Achievements do not work at all, and the items you were supposed to get from DA:Legends and other offers didn't work. The Special Deliveries chest, while always having the quest insignia above it, could never be opened.One of the most annoying and sloppy parts of the game, was the level design. The developers went crazy with the copy and paste button, with every type of dungeon, building, and outdoor area being exactly the same. Now I understand that this needs to be done in certain cases to minimize development time and cost, but they were just so sloppy and even lazy with the details. Specifically all of the maps for every area, it's always the same exact map. To provide some variance between the areas, all they do is lock doors in buildings, put up little rock road blocks in the outdoor areas, and pave over holes in caves. Yet the map still shows the area you can't go to. Now how hard would it have been to cut those parts of the map off, and copy and pasting the wall next to the door to make it look different. Related to this issue, why did Bioware take this apparently huge Dragon Age world, and limit your gameplay only to Kirkwall? Either Hawke suffers from some form of agoraphobia, or he had some magical ankle bracelet that won't let him/travel 1 mile away form the walls of Kirkwall. It's not like it's an amazing city, the location quickly becomes stifling and boring, for no benefit except to limit the design team from Bioware.On to the enemies, I really liked when you faced the weaker enemies and their bodies would explode upon attacks. Conversely I hated the big boss battles, as instead of making them difficult and very dangerous, the developer gave them an insane amount of health and high defense. So you'd just be chipping away at the giant health bar, for at times (I didn't actually time it) around or over 30 minutes. This is made even worse by the fact that stamina regeneration is very slow, and you usually get refilled when you kill your enemies but you only have one big enemy so that doesn't help at all. Combine this and the new combat, and you get a half an hour of just banging on the A button and every once in awhile using a health potion. Related to this, unchanged from the last game, actually made worse, only one character (Anders) can bring back other characters from death/unconsciousness. They have a new item where if you drink it and are killed you come back to life immediately, but it's practically useless and expensive. Add to this, the second Anders is killed you're screwed as no one can bring him back to life, and all of the magic users aren't known for their health and defense. Would it be so hard to have a potion the main hero could use to revitalize his/her companions? Every boss battle usually ended up with all my companions dead except for the dog which you can call back a little bit after it is killed. One last thing about the enemies is that especially near the end, because almost all of the enemies are humans (unlike DA:O), why in the hell would every single bandit or poorly equipped street thug be attacking the Champion of Kirkwall and his very powerful friends? I know there needs to be random enemy encounters, but this was really pushing it.***Starting here, my review will be interspersed with some spoilers.***There are some good characters in this game, but they are a bit limited, especially for women. I don't see why the developer had to kill off Hawke's brother and/or sister (depending on your choices) as there are less characters than in Origins (or around the same). I would have much preferred if they were made full characters. It was really annoying for the romances, that there were only two women (my favorite was Bethany but that relationship would have been too controversial) one being the very annoying elf Merril(?) and the very cool/funny/hot but very slutty Isabella. I had sex with Isabella, but ended up in a relationship somehow with Merril even though at every chance I went against her (rival, though I did every once in awhile use the heart dialogue option), however at the end of the story the dwarf said the only character that stayed with me was Isabella. Furthermore, the conversations between the characters seemed like a step back. I really missed the camp site from Origins, and I thought it felt forced having to go to every characters home to talk to them, even if they were currently in your party. Also, I felt like the characters were underdeveloped in comparison to all of Bioware's other games. With the characters, I felt like they were much weaker than Hawke, because they couldn't use any of the armor other than upgrades that allowed you to add a rune (combined with weak AI). I don't know why they simplified this part of the game, though I assume it was to make the animations easier. It was also annoying that even though no one could use it, I kept getting a lot of useless mage and rogue armor.Onto the critique of the story, at its very basest, I have no idea why they decided to have the dwarf telling the story to the seeker. It's contrived, useless, and to me it harmed my immersion into the character/avatar. Right from the beginning, I would have liked to know more about Hawke and his family before they were on the run. I just didn't care about the brother Carver dying because I didn't know him at all. Then when they got to Kirkwall, I'm not sure why they skipped a year of adventuring, especially when all you end up doing are a bunch of side missions at the beginning of the game. With the Deeproads expedition, it felt really short yet later it's stated that the mission had went deeper into the earth than ever before. I also found it really cheap that if you take your sister/brother with you they have to either die or become a warden, and even if you leave them home they leave your party for most of the game. Add to this the early dead sibling, and later brutal killing of your Mother, it just feels like the developer gods hated Hawke. Then that stupid Idol, which is essentially the only great evil involved in the game's story, and even then all it does is makes the dwarf brother lock you in the vault and then later makes the Templar leader go crazy, with no apparent end game. They never explain what the idol is (other than pure Lyrium that is somehow evil) or how it works.Later, the Qunari problem is pretty lame and doesn't really make any sense. They basically had a book stolen and can't leave, so they then obviously want to take over city for some contrived reason. This is the big evil you have to fight, except they really aren't evil at all. They may be a bit stubborn, but they aren't something that makes you want to fight to save the world, you're barely even saving the city. The second main conflict seems a bit tacked on, and involves two sides that are both annoying and have very large ethical problems. This may seem to be a welcome departure from Fantasy/RPG story cliches, but you'd be wrong, epic battles between good and evil are used because they work. Also, for the final battle, it didn't really make any sense. I felt like there were things I wanted to say or do to change the outcome, but couldn't. First, Anders performs a horrible terrorist act, to which your only option is to kill him, let him go, or completely forgive his actions. What he did was horrible, and didn't make any sense, yet because he was one of my regular characters I welcomed him back with open arms (I wish there was another option where he would face consequences for his actions at a later date). I ended up siding with the mages, as their cause seemed the best of two evils, but I still faced a bunch of abominations. Related to this, the head mage guy performs some sort of horrible blood magic so he can fight against the Templars and win, yet he immediately attacks the player. It really felt like the developers spent time creating a cool boss battle, so they had to have everyone play it even though it didn't make any sense (I wonder if something similar happened if you sided with the Templars). The story was just so simple and weak, I find it hard to believe this game was made by Bioware.In general, I enjoyed playing the game, but after looking back and writing this way too long review I have to give it 3 stars. Now I have to decide whether to keep the game and replay it later (which I've done with every other Bioware game), or just trade it in. I still love Bioware, but I'm beginning to lose a little faith in the developer. I can only hope they make a good game with Mass Effect 3, and maybe try another foray into the Fantasy world of Dragon Age, but with a much better story and more polish.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2011"}

Nonstop heart-pumping action combined with outstanding graphics bring the true spirit ofHunter: The Reckoningto life, and give players a taste of the World of Darkness.","reviewerName":"Gradient Vector Field \"subjectedtometal (dot)...","summary":"Definitely more fun with friends","reviewText":"I'm a pretty big fan of Role Playing Games, I tend to try and experience all the varieties that are offered, just to at least experience something new and different.  Hunter: The Reckoning is a little different by RPG video game standards, but it's hardly a revolutionary game.  I think this is the first time I've come across a table top RPG converted to video game that did not allow the users to upgrade the characters on their own.  Now, I haven't played the table top game, so I'm not entirely sure how that system worked, but I'm willing to try it out.On top of this the story line involved demons, and I tend to like things of that ilk, so I thought this might appeal to me.  I must say the story line wasn't as well done as I thought.  It certainly can't compete on the same level as something like Diablo, which is really the premeire game for killing demons in my book!  The background story felt kind of random and thrown together, but the game play and challenge factor kind of saved the game.The background story basically consists of this: There was apparently an incident at a prison many years ago and your characters were there watching a murderer be executed (no idea why) when all of a sudden people around them turned into monsters.  They faught their way out and boarded up the prison, today they have returned because the ghosts/demons or whatever have returned to feast on the souls and bodies of people throwing a rave in the prison.  Seriously... who throws a rave in a prison?  A fairly loose premise of a video game, but in the end your characters have to lock the spirits back up and save the world!As a single player game Hunter: The Reckoning sucks and has virtually no value to me, but play it with a few friends and it actually becomes pretty fun.  The game is challenging in some areas and you have to sit down and strategize with your friends.  I don't think this game has endless hours of fun, because after beating it, you're kind of done with it.  The game took only two evenings for my friends and I to conquer, and the shortness is the only reason why a replay is viable.  I would say, in terms of replay value, you can only go through it twice before it gets really boring at the most.  The camera control really does kind of suck, I saw some reviewers touch upon that.  I do realize that as a game designer camera control problems are tantamount in a multi-player overhead RPG.  I really think the programmers could have handled it a lot better and really should've gone in a different direction.Overall I thought this game was pretty fun, but only when I played it with a few friends.  I gave it a three overall because of some design flaws, the weak storyline, and not being able to level up your character on your own.  Maybe I'm just picky, but I've come to expect a lot more from RPG's thanks to very epic games like Diablo, Knights of the Old Republic, etc.  Pick this up you're looking for a multiplayer game to get together with a few friends and delve into a different world.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2008"}

These new game dynamics change the way you have to experience the game, and it's quite a fun experience as a result. The developer commentary wasn't as involved as the original portal commentary, and lacked observations from the voice over talent.

Its complex plot and setting, in conjunction with exciting gameplay and absolutely breathtaking design, makes for a game that initially seems good. However, the unfolding story and various mediocre levels take the wind out of its sails enough to turn it from a great game to a middling game.Nier is a fantasy action game with a few RPG elements. It's based largely in the \"beat-em-up\" genre; as the titular character, you fight through huge crowds of enemies with swords, spears, and magic. Nier handles extremely well, and has some really satisfying acrobatic dodges and combo attacks. The game's spells are one of its centerpoints - rather than being distinct spells with different elements and so on, the spells use the same generalized energy but manifest it in different forms. For example, one spell creates giant lances of energy, while another shoots out homing blasts. One spell creates a large wall, while another creates a doppelganger of the main character to strike at enemies. The spells work extremely well for their own purposes, and feel like a natural extension of the swordplay in most cases rather than being entirely separate.However, action isn't Nier's only draw. A few dungeons switch things up; one dungeon is highly puzzle-centric (by putting you in rooms with certain restrictions and forcing you to work around them), while another is actually a text adventure. A few dungeons, on the other hand, are monumentally boring - essentially just hallways full of monsters to fight through, with no defining features or charm. This is made worse by the fact that you visit each dungeon at least twice over the course of the game. While normally it would be okay to just have a bunch of combat rooms, the fact that it's such an unavoidable slog pushes it over the brink to be fully annoying. Still, the few cool dungeons and memorable boss fights make up for it.The game's design, including its graphics and sounds, are probably its strongest point. The game takes place in a far-off post-apocalyptic world, where civilization has started to regrow in some capacity. The maps and dungeons are littered with the remnants of the old world, from conspicuous escape pods used as housing to giant wrecked railroad bridges. Many of the areas have a very \"Shadow of the Colossus\" feel to them, combining monumental structures and areas with an overwhelming sense of emptiness or abandonment. The music helps foster this feeling with the use of ominous choruses and orchestras. While in technical terms the graphics aren't great, the presence of \"jaggies\" makes it seem in some ways closer to games like Ico or SOTC. The spell effects, at least, are great, and the design of the locations, characters, and enemies is enough to overcome technical limitations or failings.Of course, Nier has its bad points, as well. In addition to the aforementioned slog dungeons, a lot of the quests and story advancements are just \"run from here to point x\". While the quests are fairly interesting, story-wise, in gameplay terms they amount to an annoying amount of running back and forth delivering stuff to people. In addition, the story starts out strong and intriguing, but generally fails to deliver in later areas. Supplemental documents answer some questions (especially about how the game relates to Cavia's previous game, \"Drakengard\"), but overall the plot twists seem eye-rolling and overwrought.On the whole Nier is a fun action game that it's easy to get caught up in. The incredible delivery of the game, however, is marred by repetition and padding, and so the experience as a whole is somewhat tainted. Still, it was an enjoyable game overall, and definitely worth at least one playthrough.Rating: 7/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2010"}

I had to get BioShock because everything I've heard or read said it's like the best game ever. I guess my hopes we set too high or something because it just doesn't feel like the game everyone talks about, and it kind of lets me down? I think it's cool and all, but it just doesn't grab me in like everyone else.I've played video games since the days of Pong, so I've played my share of games. I usually don't start another game until I finish the one I'm on, but that is not the case with BioShock. I have put it on the back burner so I can start up Borderlands GOTY, and I must say, I don't regret that move at all!! I will eventually get back to BioShock as well as BioShock2, but I'm in no rush to do so.The world itself is pretty amazing, and you do have pretty awesome plasmids and weapons. The enemies are challenging as well, and it is a cool game. I would definitely recommend it for any gamer because it is cool and one of the all time greats (I guess). But for less than $20, you really cannot go wrong. After finishing Borderlands, I might get back to BS, and if/when I do, I really hope it sucks me in like Skyrim and Borderlands has done to me. I really, really want to love this game, but I just can't say that right now. Don't let my review stop you from getting this game because everyone else seems to love it, so pick it up, and I hope it sucks you in like everyone else!!

The first Max Payne was even better than this for a few reasons. One of the reasons is the gameplay was unique at the time, and it was the first game that had bullet time, and argubly the only game that didnt use bullet time as a gimmick (i.e. Dead to Rights and Enter the Matrix). Another one of the reasons was the storyline was better. This time the gameplay just doesent feel as fresh either. Its still a fun game though. I'll tell you about the positives now that i've got the negatives out of the way. The gameplay, while not as fresh, is still fun and this is one of the best action games around. The storyline also has interesting plot twists. The bullet time is still here, and its better than ever. It also has pretty good graphics. Its short, but its good while it lasts. You can probably beat it in a weekend rentle. If you were a fan of the first game(like me), you will enjoy this game. If you werent a fan, you wont like this. Its a good action game, and one of the most intense. Check it out. Play the first one first though.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2004"}
{"product_name":"B001CRQY1E","description":"Cross the Bridge Between Dreams and Reality On his deathbed, the famous composer, Chopin, drifts between this life and the next. In his final hours, he experiences a fantastical dream where he encounters a young girl facing a terrible destiny and the boy who will fight to save her. On the border between dreams and reality, Chopin discovers the light that shines in all of us in this enduring tale of good and evil, love and betrayal. Developed by Tri-Crescendo and featuring the music of Chopin, Eternal Sonata for the PLAYSTATION&#xAE;3 computer entertainment system delivers amazingly detailed 3D graphics, a captivating storyline, an innovative action battle system as well as new playable characters, quests, music and more.","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Bizarre idea but good game","reviewText":"What ever inspired someone to make a cutesy RPG based on the life, music and death of Frederic Chopin I will never know, but someone did, and here it is. Eternal Sonata is based on a colourful world that has seemingly been entirely invented in a fever dream by the composer Chopin as he lies on his deathbed, fading away from tuberculosis.  Chopin seems to have invented an imaginary world inhabited by twirly castles, rolling green fields, ice caves, volcanos, villages and cliffs. The characters living here include a sombre young girl called Polka (everything here has a \"musical\" name), who is suffering froma  terminal illness. This condition has given her magical abilities, but sadly, the people here knows that using magic signifies that you are on the verge of death so she is shunned by everybody, which makes for some touchingly sad scenes as the game gets underway. This game spends a lot of time ruminating on death, but more of that later.Anyway, Polka soon meets up with two rascals called Allegretto and Beat, and together they set off on an adventure. On the way they meet Frederic Chopin, who realises he is dreaming and comments about it all the time (although none of the other characters believe him). The plot involves the gradual mass poisoning of the whole population by the sale of an addictive and initially curative drug, which eventually turns users into souless zombies. You soon come to realise that although a lot of this game is candy coloured and bouncy, some of it's themes are pretty serious! Anyway, our heros meet up with some other characters and work their way through several predicaments in their way to stop the peddling of the evil powder.So first off, let's talk about the fighting. As with some other RPGs, enemies are visible on the screen, and can be avoided, but when deciding to fight it is highly advantageous to run into them from behind because as as soon as you touch one, the screen switches to \"battle mode\" and fighting commences. The first turn is taken by whoever had the best tactical position when battle was initiated, so if you are the one caught from behind, this can seriously damage your chances of winning, which I enjoyed a lot. Fighting is turn based, with movement on the field taking up as much importance as the action you take. Attacks can be long-ranged or close up, and starting postions seem to be randomized, so each (timed) turn can mean you spend precious time running across the ground to reach enemies and get a hit in before the timer runs out. And yes you can miss - if you are not quite close enough, your character can launch a load of swipes and punches and just hit thin air, which can get really annoying, especially if you can't see clearly enough to work out where everyone is (the battle screen does not have a user-controlled camera view, but a set of three fixed viewpoints, all of which might leave something obscured from view). There are \"super attack\" moves as well as the standard ones, and each character has their own, and they are all quite fun to try out. The key unique feature of the game is that battle skills can depend on whether you are standing in sunlight or shade, and this did add a bit of extra tactics, but not a lot. Some monsters change shape when standing in sun or shade, which added some fun - as did the fact that standing in another characters SHADOW also changed the shade, which could be very unexpected as you run up close to enemies ready to do your strongest light attack only to find that it's suddenly been replaced by your \"dark\" attack when you launch it!Anyway, the battles are great fun. The monsters are all pretty cute looking, which does not lead to much sense of purpose, although it is very satisfying to pound them into oblivion. But the game is not easy, despite looking so bright and chirpy. Some boss battles had me floored several times before I could beat them. Luckily you can grind, and there are lots of types of equipment and items to change your parameters in lots of fun ways. On that note though, the names of the items is awful...an early health item is called a \"Peach Cookie\"...blurgh, please can we leave such names to My Little Pony games?Between fighting there is a fair amount of running around to do, some very well hidden bonus treasures and side quests that I actually missed, and a lot of items to buy and try out. What I really didn't enjoy, though, was the \"score pieces\" mini game, in which random NPC's can be found who ask to play a duet with you, and the better you do, the better the reward they give you. The reason I didn't like this was because of the (for me at least) random selection of musical accompaniment you have to make each time, hoping to pick something that harmoizes with that person's style - which meant reloading the mini game countless time trying to pick which \"score piece\" the person is going to like the sound of. For me that was just boring. Something else that took me aback rather, was the sheer number of playable team members, I think at it's maximum, I had TWELVE team mates to choose from, and the battle team only holds three. But trying them all out was entertaining.I mentioned the odd framing structure of the game at the beginning (that the game is all Chopin's dream), and it does make for a rather bewildering plot. The fact that Polka  - who is probably the true central character - is suffering from a terminal illness at the age of just 14 makes for quite a serious theme, which does seem at odds with the very bright coloured graphics. Chopin himself is also one of your team members, and he too is depicted as a whimsical Disney-esque character. Having said that though, the graphics in general are superb, rich and detailed. But to my annoyance there is NO manual camera movement whatsoever, which I found very frustrating.The game returns to the theme of death repeatedly, and at some points it becomes far too ponderous. One important scene involves a central character being uncovered as a spy and killed soon afterwards, and this death scene sees the character deliver an impassioned, \"dying breath\" soliloquy, which is so long and drawn out it becomes almost ludicrous. At other times, the game pauses while a genuine piece of Chopin music is played on the soundtrack, and a text-only lecture about the life of the real Frederic Chopin is displayed over a montage of pastoral images. These interludes were actually fairly interesting, but again I come back to my original question: why make an RPG about the life and death of Chopin? I can only assume somebody at Bandai games had an intense interest in the composer and was determined to share it. To be honest, the whole game could have been set in the fantasy world, without any reference made to it being a dream whatsoever, and the experience for the player would not have been diminished. But things progress along nicely until the game ends very abruptly - seriously abruptly - and there is a very long end movie that deals with the topic of death to another exceedingly drawn-out degree.All in all, a cute looking game, the RPG and battle elements are solid. Worth a try.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2011"}

Chaos sets in when breaking news informs Americans that their President has been killed and the Russians have invaded the country.Players take on the role of a blue-collar worker who evolves into a charismatic and fearless freedom fighter obsessed with finding and freeing his brother, who has been taken hostage along with other New Yorkers by the Soviets.

I ordered it that very same day.  I have always loved games where you have teammates supporting you and Freedom Fighters delivers that experience.You take on the roll of a plumber in an alternate reality where the Soviet Union has been slowing taking over most of the world.  They invade your city and you're forced into becoming a guerrilla solider and ultimately the very face of the counter offensive.  The city and characters look good not great, but considering the number of guys fighting at once, the snow effects in some areas, and the draw distance, all with no slowdown at all the graphics are very impressive.  I did find it hard to tell friends from enemies at a distance.Controls are tight and make use every button on the controller, including L3 and R3.  Command over your allies is pretty good, but you can only order them in sequence.  This can be annoying if you put a guy someplace strategic and then place the next guy at the wrong spot.  You have to issue your position orders all over again to get everybody in the right place.  Oh and yes you can invert the Y-axis or not, which is my biggest concern with this type of game.  Woo hoo!During a level you're given one or more areas to visit to complete objectives which usually break down to free the prisoners, blow up an objective, or raise the flag over a building to capture it for your group.  In theory you can take them in multiple ways, but in practice if you don't complete the missions in specific order you're not going to be able to finish them.  Don't worry though, it's pretty easy to figure out the order and you're given hints.  The only level I looked to a guide for was an assignation level where you're on your own and you'll be playing the level over repeatedly if you don't know what to expect.My only real gripe is with the length.  I've only been playing it a couple of days and I'm already over half done.  It think it'd be a fun game to replay, but it comes in on the low end of the amount of play time I expect out of a title.  The good news is that nowadays the price is really low so you can get it cheap and not really have to worry about how much length you're getting for your money.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2010"}

Upon every turn they face a devious foe salivating to engorge itself in the taste of human flesh.  Loaded with only a pistol and the force of teamwork, these survivors must do the impossible and find a way out of the insanity.  That's the scenario that Left 4 Dead places the player in.  It's quite a predicament, and the chaos never stops.  Nonstop action is the name of the game.  Surrounded by hordes of zombies in levels that change with each repetition, Left 4 Dead can easily make someone spend hundreds of hours playing through its various levels.  The AI director makes sure that no two levels ever playing exactly the same way and that each encounter is unique to each new play-through.  Just because you discovered a \"Witch\" behind that door the last time through does not mean she will even be in the level this time around.  It's this kind of variety that makes the player continue to come back to Left 4 Dead over and over again.  Up the difficulty to Expert and play with three other humans and the excitement is immeasurable.  Valve did a great job of creating suspense through the usage of lighting and sound effects.  You can hear a \"Witch\" crying from several rooms away; you can hear a \"Boomer\" making grotesque belching sounds before he is even visible; the \"Hunter\" shrieks with a sound resembling some species of dinosaurs; and the \"Tank\" makes both the screen and the controller vibrate as he approaches.  Recognizing these sounds that indicate which \"special zombie\" is approaching increases your adrenaline, many times it even makes you want to locate them just for the sheer pleasure and excitement that the encounters entail.  I can't tell you how many times I've purposely activated a \"Witch\" just because of the way the game makes you feel as you try your hardest to defeat her before meeting an early demise at her hands.  The game supplies the players with first-aide at the most essential locations, and items such as the dual-wielded pistols greatly turn the tides in your favor, unless you encounter the pure colossal nightmares that are the \"Tanks\".  Playing offline with friends, or online are both great ways to experience the game.  I even have a blast playing solo as well, a truly remarkable game worth owning if you're an Xbox 360 owner.  This game is one of the reasons why I chose to purchase an Xbox 360 even though I already own a PS3, simply amazing and pure addictive action.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2009"}

Research has demonstrated now that the problems do not have to be difficult - just something to keep the mind active.  The neuroscientist has come to the conclusion that persons with some form of cognitive impairment who participate in some of these exercises can prevent worsenign of the condition and actually improve brain function (taken from game insert).  With that said, the simple calculations are designed to help improve your own brain function by challenging the player to perform such activities as quickly as possible.There are a variety of activities to choose from for this purpose and it is recommended that these exercises be performed on a daily basis albeit for a short period of time - training can be completed in a mere 15 minutes.  Certainly, practice makes perfect and players may find themselves improving in simple calculations to the point that they are second nature.A very nice addition is the Sudoku puzzles - what's nice here is that for novel players, the option of having the game tell you when a number is wrong is very helpful (albeit the player can only make 5 wrong guesses).All in all, a very simple way to keep the mind active!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2007"}

The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"Doom","summary":"All the fun of the original, and lots more!","reviewText":"With almost 30 stages and 25 secret characters, along with more than a dozen modes of play, this game will be worth every penny. The original did not have many modes, and not nearly as many characters or stages, but it was still a lot of fun. Melee will be fun for years to come. Among the new character additions are Bowser and Mewtwo, who are the strongest characters in the game, also my favorites.  Ganondorf is as strong as them, but he's not as fun.  Anyhoo, there are a few things that have changed from the original that bug me.  It's harder to see the action up close and personal, the bob-ombs aren't as &quot;Kaboom&quot;-ey sounding as they should, and that damn flower item... grrrr... Also, I find myself pausing waaayyy too often to check out a cool special attack. Those minor flaws don't take away from the fun all that much, and in the heat of battle, you'll be too busy to notice because the computer players put up much more of a fight than they used too.

One that I'd probably end up getting because Rare made it. Then I saw the first set of trailers for it on IGN. Boy, was I shocked. Blood galore. Violence at every corner. It was actually funny. Singing poop. And language that would make a sailor smile. This wasn't another Rare kid's game. I don't remember how, but I ended up with several copies of the game. Afterwards, I sold some of the \"still packaged\" games to Special FX (Waco's finest game trading place) who gave me enough to buy a ton of new games. I beat it over a friend's house and was almost tear jerked because I wanted to find out what happened to a host of the characters. You'd understand if you played it.Conker is now redone. Reloaded as they say. It has much better graphics. For instance, Conker actually has fur instead of a decent polygonal orange... red... surface. The sound quality is a ton better. Best of all, the game host a few new surprises from the original. The game is just hysterical, even after all these years. The Matrix scene is awesome. The Gladiator rips are to die for. The Saving Private Ryan parody is just the apple in the pie. It's all a riot for not only the player, but friends watching. The graphics and sounds in this remake have been so well redone, it's literally like playing a new game.The game has a host of new options too, some which I wish all games had. For one, there's a profanity filter. I prefer to play my games with one on because I just don't like to hear certain words flowing out of anythings mouth. Although, even with the profanity unlocked, you won't hear any F-bombs or anything. Another new feature I liked was the multiplayer. Then again, I also hated it. The original multiplayer was more of a mini-game style. It really didn't last too long, but it was fun sometimes. The best modes being the military modes and the heist, as well as raptors vs. cavemen. However, the new multiplayer is a lot more lasting, even to include stats and a nice ranking system. I just wish they could have kept the originals in there for kicks.Overall, Conker will have you splitting your sides, as well as wishing the game would never end. It's a perfect video game for those fans of platformers, comedies, or just war.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0050SX97I","reviewerName":"Tim Janson","summary":"METAL GEAR RETURNS IN HD","reviewText":"The old saying \"better late than never\" certainly applies to Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater 3D.  This remake of 2004's PS2 game Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, is the first Metal Gear game to appear on any Nintendo platform for a number of years and while it is only a remake, it's a very good one.  The move up to the 3DS platform has allowed developer Kojima Productions to delivery a game that is more visually attractive with some great cut-scenes and well designed environments.To the uninitiated, the game is set during the 1960's Cold War era and thus the elements of stealth are emphasized even more than in the more modern games in the series.  This was a time when one stray shot could have ignited World War 3.  The basic plot hasn't changed; you are still Naked Snake, a top-secret operative infiltrating the Soviet Union during the Cold War. You creep through jungles, quietly taking out enemy operatives, as you unravel a plot that threatens the safety of the entire world.  If you're not crazy about stealth games then you'll definitely want to pass on this one.  You're rewarded for successfully moving undetected and all Hell breaks loose if you are.  Snake has a camouflage index that gauges your effective invisibility to enemies from a negative value which means you're seen and have been compromised to 100% which means you are completely unseen.  One improvement is the addition of the crouch walk, which allows Snake to retain a degree of cover while moving and aiming.  Because of the emphasis on stealth, the game is really more of an adventure game than an action shooter.The game's controls have their good and bad points.  Snake moves fluid enough for the most part, particularly when he is trying to be extremely, umm, sneaky.  The camera and aim control can be frustrating at times.  The game features a gyro-style control when you're walking across narrow bridges or tree branches, leaving the play to balance the 3DS.  However, the menu system has been improved for the better, allowing you quicker access to your food, camo, and first-aid items.The game isn't particularly difficult in terms of its missions and boss-battles and I liked these all a great deal.  But other elements are made unintentionally difficult for other reasons.  The landscapes can look a little muddy and thus sometimes enemies can get lost in the much and be difficult to find.  This isn't by design mind you.  The frame rate is also choppy.  While this might not affect the gameplay, it's still really annoying. The campaign can be completed in 5 - 6 hours but you can stretch the game out to two or three times that if you look for every hidden item and unlockables.Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater 3D has some issues but its definitely a welcome addition on the 3DS.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00004SVS7","description":"GAME CARTRIDGE CLEAN WITH CASE, NO ORIGINAL INSTRUCTIONS. [A FUN GAME]","reviewerName":"Joey Pimkowski","summary":"The most Underrated Megaman game.","reviewText":"Mega man 6 was released in 1993 right at the end of the original nes's lifecycle when Nintendo was trying to breath life into their 8 bit machine with the top loader and some last minute quality games. Really, some of the best 8 bit games arrived at the end such as Kirby's adventure and this game right here.Capcom didn't have enough faith in the blue bomber to release this in the U.S. so Nintendo went ahead and published this themselves. At this point with all of the sequels already out, everyone knew what to expect from a new megaman game, a quality well balanced game. There aren't any really new ideas and the formula is pretty much the same as the other five but if it ain't broke?One big change is that Rush (mega's robot dog) is effectively gone. He combines with megaman to transform into cool powers that help you progress such as a punch that crashes through obstacles and a jetpack that lets you accelerate into the sky to reach places you otherwise would be unable to get to. You also get the powers of the defeated robot masters like before and they are actually useful this time unlike the last couple entries of the series. You can collect parts to create a bird sidekick that helps you fight but it's not really required to finish the game, instead it gives you some incentive to replay levels you've already passed.The graphics and sound are top notch here and are on par with what you would expect from an nes capcom game. Everything is beautifully animated and the colorful backdrop is almost super nintendo quality.The robot masters and their levels are challenging but never too hard and are well designed. The game really plays around with gravity by creating springs and fans that throw you all over the place. Another nice touch is when you replay the levels, they change in subtle ways. For example, in tomahawk man's level, the first time through there's a full sun in the background but when you come back there's a sunset and the color altogether has changed. The music is another a highlight although the tunes aren't quite as memorable as the first three, they still rock anyway.Overall, this is a great game. Every Megaman fan always debates which is better, part 3 or part 2 and this game really doesn't match those two. While not as spectacular as the first three, this is still much better than part 4 and it retains some of the difficuly that was lost in part 5. But all of that is nitpicking, with an nes controller in your hand and a megaman cartridge fired up, you really can't go wrong, buy all six while your at it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2010"}

Last week, however, my brother brought home this game and wanted to play a few games.  I obliged, and quite surprisingly was sucked in from the opening tip-off of that first game.Though I can't comment on the \"frills\" of this game (career mode, practice, etc.) as I will never use them, I have now played dozens of exhibitions against friends and have immensely enjoyed the experience.  The biggest reason?  The control scheme is very well designed (the key structure of any successful sports video game franchise).  The controls are simple enough for beginners, yet \"deep\" enough for the seasoned vet to perfect his/her game.Thus, I was pleasantly surprised by this game and foresee more hours of fun with it in the future.

Boeshaar","summary":"Status Quo for Battlefield EDITED 11/2/13 Crash problems","reviewText":"EDIT: The game has for some reason become an absolute nightmare. It crashes constantly killing any progress you've made for leveling up and the servers get very laggy during peak hours. Until DICE fix these problems I'm taking my review from a 2 to 4 stars. At the moment it's just an exercise in frustration. Extremely disappointed by DICE.Here are my impressions of Battlefield 4 after approximately 15 hours played in both the beta and the actual release.Battlefield 4 is not really a true sequel to Battlefield 3, the game is largely identical to its predecessor with improvements and gameplay tweaks making it more of a Battlefield 3.5 than 4. This is good in the sense that it retains and refines Battlefield 3's excellent gameplay, and bad in the way that the game is not really revolutionary or much different from the 2011 release.The gameplay is a lot smoother than it was in Battlefield 3, especially in infantry combat which makes it a lot more enjoyable. I hate to say it, but it actually feels a bit Call of Dutyesque, nevertheless it's for the better as the game retains it's open world and vehicle combat which has made the series so popular.The multiplayer is, and almost always has been in the Battlefield series, the main selling point of the game and it remains fun, frantic, and an absolute blast. You can choose anything between 2 to 64 player servers in brand new maps which have some very cool destruction which really brings the game alive. Unfortunately, though I have only played a little bit of it, the single player remains somewhat lackluster. I expected DICE to improve their campaign after what was a rather mediocre experience in Battlefield 3, but it seems that once again it is somewhat of an afterthought.There are some kinks to be ironed out, the sound seems to go in and out at random times, there have been complaints of texture popup, the jets seem to need re-balancing, and I am still not a big fan of having to use a browser based server list (but I doubt this last complaint will ever be changed). Based on DICE's track record I have faith that they will eventually fix most of the problems and the game will continue to progress. Keep in mind that you require Origin, the Battelog browser plugins, and Punkbuster to play this game, these are all things that were required in Battlefield 3.IN CONCLUSION: Battlefield 4's single player is okay but not great, it might not be the revolutionary sequel some people were hoping for, but it is an excellent multiplayer game that will keep you hooked for a long time. In that regard, Battlefield maintains the Status Quo.Definitely recommended for fans of multiplayer FPS.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2013"}

The quest is huge in terms of the number of missions you can do and places you can visit. The battle system is unique and challenging and gives you a lot of latitude for customization - you can hand pick which soldiers you want in your army and how to group them in squads. There is alot of exploration and many secrets too, you can find whole hidden towns and dungeons for instance. The graphics are very impressive - the enemies look great and when you are adventuring there are some truly breathtaking vistas. The high mountain plane of Dillmoor for one offers excellent views of a valley far below and distant peaks. The story is kind of meh but the real focus of the game is on exploration and combat.As critics have pointed out, the game has longish load time as well as frequent slowdown and texture loading every time the scene changes. I didn't burn the game to my hard drive so these problems were definitely noticeable, but they didn't bother me too much. I much prefer this game to more traditional rpgs like Lost Odyssey which offered little challenge and just became too tedious to finish.

There are 5 levels which consist of gaining stars. The only way you can gain stars is to play through the normal mode (not the easy Feel Eden mode). For the Kinect, you have 2 ways of shooting. Whenever you see a pink ball of light, you use your left arm to rapid fire. For the rest, you use your right arm to lock on, and when you gain enough items, you push forward with your right arm to get the multiplier going. The controls work great.A tip that I found out about is to use the regular controller to beat the level. Once I beat the level with the controller, I'd go back to unlock other levels. My settings are using the right trigger to rapid fire, while using the A button as the lock on (many controller options are available though).

Violence, gore, steroid men fighting not-so-steroid men, and cool music. This game is none of that. Aside from the mild violence.The game starts out with you, John Conner, learning how to maneuver over an obstacle such as a wall. You're in Los Angeles, California, and things look about the same in 2016. You take your battle across the street to fight aero units. They fly, shoot at you, and make easy targets with the shotgun that you'll find soon after. I'd explain the story but I guess we could just sum it up into man versus machine.The game sort of goes downhill from here. While the first level isn't that bad, the game just progresses in a spiral downward until you don't want to play anymore. The best bit of the game is actually all in the first level and where you get to control a giant mech. You hardly run into any cool terminator machines though. You will battle 60% of the time these stupid aero units. Again: they fly, shoot, and explode. Other than that, the T-600s (skeleton-looking machines that carry mini-guns) and T-7-Ts are the only things you fight. Sure, maybe two other enemies appear in the game, but that's still lackluster. Let's not even mention the boring vehicle missions.The controls aren't horrible, but the game overall feels very generic. It plays much like a Gears of War-clone, but just not near as good. In fact, most of the time either your team mates are going to get all the kills, or you're going to see the load screen more times than you need. If anything, I'd say that the actual gameplay is decent enough to save this game from being a total disaster. It plays the way it should. It just feels they didn't touch up on the overall handling of the game, and then ruined it by not going anywhere in regards of enemy units or an epic boss battle.I never tried the game in co-op. I never got the chance. No one wanted to play with me, and I don't blame them. The game is just not fun. If anything, it works, and doesn't crash, so I guess that's a good sign.

If you just want to have fun and enjoy a great set of songs on your own or with one friend, rock it out with GH3. When you end up facing songs like Raining Blood or Through The Fire And Flames before battling Lucifer himself, it's just an unbeatable experience in gaming history.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2010"}

Good luck downloading Uncharted on one game card, or BlazBlue, it's not worth paying $60 and $55(With the $46.84 price point) to be able to avoid physical media. And the Tester videos, just watch them on your PS3 or get a 32GB card.They really need to release higher capacity cards, 32GB is plenty for a lot of downloaded content, but thank god for physical media so you can get more for your Memory Cards. However I am not a fan of wasting bandwith and having to delete/download constantly and I hate buying multiple cards to get around this, 16GB should be plenty for most casual gamers that do not plan on putting many games from the PSP, especially if you are going the physical route for Vita games.  However, if you are going digital, 4-8 games at a time seems like a fair amount since most people do not touch a game once they beat it, however you have the option to re-download the games at any time.Star Rating:1 for the Price, once this is around 29.99 this will be more reasonable.2 for the Storage Capacity, it's a decent amountUpdated: February 13, 2013, all games, movies, patch/dlc data and PlaystationMobile games updated","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I0HCNI","description":"","reviewerName":"Noname","summary":"Not very responsive","reviewText":"I'm a huge Star Wars fan and was so looking forward to \"Star Wars Kinect.\"  I was a little disappointed with the responsiveness of the game to my movements, especially with lightsaber duels.  The characters don't mimic my movements at all.  When I want to attack with a lightsaber, I swing my arm wildly until my character attacks.  That's about it.  This should really be the best part of \"Star Wars Kinect.\"  It's not.The podracer pretty much goes where it should as long as my arms stay in front of me.  I learned not to try to steer, because I just go the wrong way.  Keep my arms in front and I run the course.  My son, of course, is flailing his arms beside me, but I think I do better in the race for not having any motion at all.  Not too exciting.\"Rancor Rampage\" is a little better with detecting my movements, but I don't enjoy playing a rancor.  We get to stomp around destroying buildings and throwing people around.  It's like being King Kong.  No fun.By far the best player responsiveness happens in \"Galactic Dance Off.\"  It's like any other Kinect dance game, except we get to dance with Leia, Lando and Han.  The dance movements are Star Wars themed.  Have you ever wondered how to do the Chewy Hug or the Mynock?  Now's your chance.  Of all the games, I like \"Galactic Dance Off\" best.On the positive side, my ten year-old son really loves this game.  It gives me a good workout and he moves around more than I ever see him move with any other Kinect game.  If you want your kids to get something physical in while playing video games, this would be one way to do it.\"Star Wars Kinect\" can be played by one player, but it's more enjoyable with two players.  It is fun to play \"Star Wars Kinect\" with my son, mostly because I have someone to listen to me while I complain.  Just wish it was more responsive.  That would make worlds of difference.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2012"}
{"product_name":"SteelSeries Sensei Wireless Laser Gaming Mouse","description":"","reviewerName":"Jen \"Geek Girl\"","summary":"Fabulous mouse!","reviewText":"I wasn't sure I was going to like this mouse given that I've been completely spoiled by all the extra buttons on my Razer Naga. That said, however, this mouse is by far the best for any game that doesn't require the extra buttons that the Naga offers. The battery lasts longer than any gaming mouse I've ever owned, and recharging is so ridiculously simple. I love the charging base and not having to switch cords around to switch from wired to wireless. With the battery life on this mouse, I can play for hours without having to worry about it dying, and then just plop it on the charging base to ensure it's full and ready to go the next time I play. I never have to use the wire as a back up when the battery dies suddenly and unexpectedly. Love!!The mouse is also just the right weight, not too light but not too heavy. Just enough to keep your hand from tiring but still have precise movement. The shape is also very ergonomic and hand cramps have yet to be experienced here, even after several hours of playing. The mouse and base just look beautiful, too. I don't buy gaming products for how cool they look as I prioritize performance above aesthetics, but I won't lie, they are very nice to look at. The ability to change any color of the rainbow is also very much welcomed. More mice are doing this these days, but it's still nice to have a wide range of colors to choose from with an interface that is intuitive and easy to use on all fronts.My favorite feature, which goes right along with the battery life, is the auto sleep function. After 15 minutes without activity, it goes to sleep to preserve the battery. A simple click of any of the buttons wakes it up, but this is very nice for preserving that already epic battery life. Well done, SteelSeries!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2014"}

{"product_name":"B002I0H0FS","reviewerName":"James F. Briggs","summary":"Best only for those who have not played the previous games.","reviewText":"As the title says ME3 Special edition is most suited for those of you who do not have the previous two games, but wanted to get into the series. It's akin to watching Return of the Jedi before the Star Wars and Empire Strikes back. On the plus side you get the N7 Collectors edition DLC From the Ashes with it. (Ten dollar buy.) And the Mass Effect 2 Genesis comic. (Comic is slightly interactive to allow you to make some of the major decisions from the previous two games. Downside is, that it still doesn't let you make a good number of them, and gives you a default setting. This is especially telling in the Mass Effect 2 portion which feels much more rushed than the Mass Effect part.)To me the main downside is the Wii U's controller itself. Maybe after I use it a while I will grow accustomed to it. (this complaint probably is more specific to the system than this game.)Another nice thing about this game is you get all of the DLC mentioned above, on disc. No downloading and waiting for it like it is on every other platform. (In fact the Xbox Version is a 2 disc game with some of the worst disc swapping I have ever seen. I think a typical run through on that version requires 3 or four swaps for me.)Multiplayer works well enough. The Wii U MP section is nowhere near as large as either PS3 or Xbox, but I had no trouble finding others to play with for it.The Extended cut ending is included on disc. This is a MAJOR positive here because the original endings deserved the backlash they got. I was amongst those who despised it, and felt it pretty much ruined the overall experience. (think of the game as a great party, and the ending as the hangover you get the next morning.) However when I decided to try the EC endings they provided I was more or less content with them. (Personally I still hold to the belief that the endings were place holders until they could get the extended cut finished.)Edit:I have found a fairly annoying flaw in the game. I am not 100% sure if it is something on my end or in the game itself. During four scenes Shepard's voice has been absent during dialogue. I know the voice is there on the Xbox version of the same scene.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2012"}

Thiel \"John P. Thiel\"","summary":"The perfect balance: All that's best about Tomb Raider is in this game","reviewText":"Those of us who have played the best--No. IV in my opinion--and worst--Angel of Darkness--of Tomb Raider know that they've done it all.  They've given us richer environments, more moves, better equipment, made it stupid easy in Legend, and driven us to near madness.  I, who barely watched TV until I graduated from college, have found myself suddenly at sunrise on a Saturday having played Tomb Raider all night long.This is the best there is, challenging but not too difficult; playable but not childishly simple. Legend was technologically great, but too simple to play, and I'm glad that the designers saw fit to make this Anniversary edition more game and less plain dumb entertainment as many shoot-em-up games are these days.Why bother even mentioning the graphics or 'the engine' or any of the other techno-babble.  We know what computers can do.  This is about design, and in this case about puzzle design--which in this case is absolutely brilliant.I imagine they could have gone a bit further, made it more of a challenge, but held back for the sake of playability by the general player--yet without dumbing it down so much that people who know the series would be disappointed or unimpressed.The Journal was also a nice touch, far better than the PDA.  I was also glad that I could, once again, carry multiple types of weapons--where in Anniversary I couldn't.I did kind of miss having grenades, flares, and especially some kind of binoculars.CON: The only real con, they need to bring back story-line.  I also miss non-essential but hinting information being literally carved into the walls in some scenes.  Tomb Raider is a mystery, so bring on the mystery.  It has to more than flavor the action, story line has to be part of the game itself.BOTTOM LINE: Wonderful.  Bring on the next one!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2007"}

I would not say it does not have a lot of faults, but it is a very enjoyable game, the one that you can play after a workday, it is very distressful just to throw things around.Update: Just finished the game, and I confirm 4 stars, maybe 4 stars and a half.

First of all the voice acting is top notch with Claudia Black as Chloe being the best of the bunch. The graphics are very well done. The story is also superb. The game mainly consist of exploring and shooting. You don't need more! Playing this game is like being in an actual movie. My only grip is the amount of treasure to be found. Way too much treasure to be found. Other than that, this game is a must have. Buy it!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2011"}

Lustig","summary":"Best FPS game ever","reviewText":"I've played this game over 300 hours and am still playing it now.  I just went through story mode at Veteran difficulty and I have a new-found respect for real Marines.  This is the best First Person Shooter (FPS) game ever made.  The graphics are ultra-realistic.  The gameplay is smooth (except for a few minor areas) in both story mode and online play.  My main complaint is that you can't mute other online players -- so you have to listen to little Timmy ordering dinner from Pizza Hut.  Nevertheless, in comparison with anything from EA/Ubisoft, this is 10 times better.  Drake's fortune was fun but there's no online play.  If you only buy one game, this is the one.  I'd buy a PS3 just to play this game.  BTW: I have the PC version too but I can't master the controls.  If you get a modded PS3 controller, you get a big advantage.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2008"}

{"product_name":"B003R783IY","description":"","reviewerName":"Fani","summary":"The NFS magic is back","reviewText":"Wow.. I can't believe I needed to wait so many years to get back in the wheel of really exotic cars - Lamborghini's, Bugatti's, Shelby's and Cop cars (sadly I didn't see any Ferrari's ?). The last game I enjoyed in this series was NFS:HP2 on the PS2. Now that was spectacular. They lost that magic by giving us NFS:Underground, Most Wanted, Undercover, Shift(which was actually good btw, Carbon, ProStreet etc.Those games didn't capture my interest. Who wants to drive cheap $10K-$15K cars and spend hours customizing it to get performance. It felts like an el-cheapo's game. I wanted to drive cool, exotic $300K cars (that I sadly cannot afford) and drive fast... I wanted to feel the need, the need for (exotic) speed.Now with this game, we finally have it. The cars handle well with slight differences between them as expected. The courses look gorgeous and there are lots of shortcuts. It does seem a bit easy though. The autolog feature is great. Playing as a cop or racer is fun. The weapons (spikes, emp's) are powerful but don't cause instant game overs. You need to deploy it a few times to really see its full effect.A few things I loved about the original missing here is - no voiceovers for the cars?. Game feels more Burnout'ish with crashes and handling etc. but this is in a good way. No split-screen although that doesn't bother me as much.Overall, you get to drive super fast and its pretty awesome.4/5Edit - few more things I noted after playing more time1. the rear view mirror is funky. I don't like that negative mode type view. I'd have preferred the actual rear view2. there is voice over for cars by some woman although it doesn't sound as magical as that movie-guy voice from the PS2 version3. in the PS2 version of NFS:HP, you could hit a button to see the road for a certain distance ahead (some fiery ball would light the trail ahead for several hundred yards. Thats missing here sadly )4. game is feeling more like Most Wanted which is a good thing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2010"}
