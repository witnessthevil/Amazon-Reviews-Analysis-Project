It went along all the same lines: \"Holy hell, this game is hard, mike\".  Yet I payed no attention. a good challenge can keep you going for a while and makes the experience more addictive, which is what we're all looking for, right?  Well, i played thru the first level and a half with little to no difficulty and just assumed that my friends were horrible at this game.  Then it takes a dramatic increase in difficulty, forcing you to take out wave after wave of shotgun toting goons with a couple of pistols and kill seemingly invincible bosses with your bare hands.  To give you a slightly better idea of how godd*mn hard this game is, i bought it in december 2002 and have not beaten it to this day (I think i'm on mission 8/15 or something...barely halfway thru).  Everyone enjoys a challenge but this game reeeeeally pushes it. I hate having to redo things in exess, which you have to do thanks to the FANTASTIC save system this game has, being that you can only save when you get to the next part of the level and if you die, you go back to the beginning of the part you are on.  you'll get a little farther each time you die, you'll die again, start over, repeat.  I'm sure if you're some kind of freaking game wizard, you will have more fun with this game than i do, but if you are a mere mortal like myself, go for something else unless you're REALLY patient.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2003"}

It is hard to get a wife,there r three people u can marry and each one is either eaisy medium or hard to get. They each have a diary and it says how much they like u. U can buy animals and all sorts of things. U can also plant crops. Even though every second is a miniute on the game that is why the seasons go by fast.

There were a lot of positive things that were attempted, but I think the time crunch of getting out ahead of COD caught up to them. The game has a GREAT campaign mode which I enjoyed more than MW2. Yes mine did skip once in a while but that was a minor issue to me. I do wish you could have played the campaign as a coop however. That was the good and now to the multiplayer. The maps are smaller than other FPS and you about have to be a sniper to stay alive more than 2 minutes. The gameplay is fine, but you have to play a certain way. That is really the beauty of COD in where you have so many options of how you can play and counter what the other guy is doing. These maps have WAY too many chokepoints that will get you killed quick and in more than one game I played in, our team was spawn killing 80% of the time. Add in the limited weapons and class system, the inability to mute other players, and poor melee detection and the on-line is underwhelming. A good try in all but this bird needed more seasoning.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000O5FUKQ","description":"Prepare to experience an evolution in the first person shooter. Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"Movieskinny \"WayneG\"","summary":"Dino Crisis 4??","reviewText":"I haven't played this yet, but if it is like Dino Crisis, count me in.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

The Gamecube can also link games from the Gameboy to itself allowing you to load data and unlock new parts to your game. Splinter Cell, Metroid Fusion, Sonic Advance, Allstar Baseball 2004 and Madden 2004 are a couple of the 'linkable' games. Now, you see, the Gamecube is no 'kiddie' system or a system laking good games.

{"product_name":"B000GHLBUA","reviewerName":"J. Hoover \"chicagojosh\"","summary":"You'll get the hang of it... trust me.","reviewText":"When I first bought my Wii I was torn between what game to get along with Zelda: Twilight Princess. It came down to Rayman: Raving Rabbids and Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz. Ultimately I went with the former and decided to make Monkey Ball a Gift Card post-Christmas purchase.First off, the nunchuck is only used for certain mini-games (more on those later.) In the main \"storyline\" (read: had to throw something together so there'd be a reason for monkeys in balls racing around a track collecting bananas and slamming into gigantic monsters heads and belly buttons,) the controls are simple enough - the Wiimote acts as a sort of extention of the playing field. When you tilt the controller forward, the playing field tilts forward, sending your monkey-in-a-ball in said direction.It took me awhile to get the hang of it, and I was partially thankful that I had sharpened my Wiimote teeth on other games so I could get used to the intricacies of the motion sensitivity. If you're not careful you could very easily send your poor monkey... ball... falling to his or her demise.A nice behind the scenes feature of the control scheme, again for the main game, is that it's based on the actual controller movement, so you don't have to worry about jacking everything up because you moved out of the way of the sensor bar (or your cat jumped up on the coffee table... stupid cat.)Gameplay wise, the pace is pretty tight, with very little in the way of lag time between finishing one level and moving on to the next. The gameplay mechanics actually are such that you have to force yourself to stay calm to make sure your moves are accurate, even though your monkey is bouncing around and ricocheting off things (stop laughing.)You can choose between a variety of different characters, each of which have their own special abilities. It will be up to you to figure out which one to use in order to 100% a level.The mini-games, at least for me, leave something to be desired. Yes, there are a ton of them. Yes, they offer a boat load of multi-player possibilities. Yes, I'm going to kill someone if another Wii game comes with some crap-tastic version of wack-a-mole. I'm still impressed Nintendo built full 3D controls into the Wii, but I'm not impressed with its use in the SMB:BB mini-games. While it can be cute (ex: playing a trombone, using the Wiimote as the slide,) it's extremely frustrating to get exact to the point where I just didn't feel like playing them. Good on paper, but lacking in real world product.With around 100 levels of main game, SMB:BB is sure to offer you plenty of replayability. A solid buy for Wii owners.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2006"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYYEK","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Kennedy","summary":"Great Update to the Series... Except some of the Playlist","reviewText":"There is little info out there about the game (compared to the spam ads of Dance Central, the original) I figured I should add some info. I was a bit skepticle with the lack of news on this game. But I loved the original so I bought it, and definitely don't regret the decision.To begin with, if you liked Dance Central you are going to still like Dance Central 2. Its pretty much the same game with a different song list (plus the old list if you pay the $5 to import it), and a lot of new and updated features.The Menu:Similar to the last game, the opening sequence and menus set the vibe for a fun interactive game. The Menu is easier to navigate, and the menu for purchasing new songs now allows you to see more than one song at a time. The song list menu also shows a demonstration of the dance if you wait on a song enough, which is helpful for deciding the skill level required to perform it.The Song List: (I'll include it at the bottom, because it isn't posted anywhere else.)While it's expansive, its hard to say I really like it. The list is very hit or miss. It tries to hit all demographics between 80's, 90's, and today's top 40 music. As well as random tech to mix things up. The problem is I find myself loving half the songs, and being annoyed (or feel uncomfortable dancing to) some of the others ex. \"Venus.\" So if you plan buy the game definitely definitely look the list over, or import the old songs so you can use the new features on the songs you love.The Crew Challenge:I think this is definitely a step in the right direction. Instead of having specific challenges on the setlist, it is it's own feature on the main menu. Obviously this game would be a bit weird to have a true story mode, but without some kind of story a lot of gamers would have no reason to replay the songs after getting the achievements. In crew challenge mode you meet the characters by dancing 9 songs to join their crew. Until you meet the last new crew member. Didn't add too much to the game, but overall it gave the game something more than a party or fitness aspect.Break It Down:I am so glad they fixed it! While break it down can be useful, it was boring trying to go through each dance move until you got to the one you really needed. Plus if you passed it once you had to go through the song again to get back. Before and after a song, you are able to choose whether you want to learn the whole song, or focus on specific moves, which makes it a lot easier to perfect the moves you actually need help with. You also have the option to record video of you dancing and have it play next to the character to see where you may be having trouble. Voice Commands have also been added to help navigation of a song in break it down mode, so you don't have to hold your arm out for 45 seconds as you fail a dance move.Fitness Mode:I've met people who used the first game religiously for exercise, and it definitely gets people active so I can see why. The biggest addition are pre-made setlists for every part of a work out, whether it be a warm up or a cool down. I feel like this is a nice feature, and they did a decent job at matching songs to build or slowly drop your heart rate. They've also added new features to help track calories you burn outside of Perform It Mode which is convenient if you want it to track all the calories you have lost in other modes.Two Player:I haven't tried it yet (not enough room in my room :P), but I'll update as soon as I try it. The interface for it looks efficient, allowing for a second player to join right in at anytime If the kinect can effectively watch both people, I am sure it is amazing. I can't wait to try dance battles now that you don't have to sit through the song twice. My friends no longer will need to dance in the background or take turns.Unlockables:I was hoping for a few more venues, characters, and outfits. There are very few extras. Luckily none of these unlockables really affect gameplay, other than personal preference, so the addition or subraction of them doesn't really matter in the enjoyment of the game.New Characters:They no longer have Eliot, Oblio, Dare, or McCoy, instead they added counterparts to the other old characters to form dance teams. They added seven new characters: Glitch, L'il T, and Bodie, *spoiler* Jaryn, Kerith, Cyph -56, and cyph-78 *spoiler*. Glitch is kind of my problem character, because his shorter limbs make it harder to tell arm movements, similar to the robot in the last game. Other than that characters again don't matter other than their stereotype catch phrases.Voice Commands:Originally I really didn't like this concept, but after failing songs in the last game (because you have to hold your arm out 45 seconds) I can see why this was added. Voice Commands make it fast and easy to pause in the middle of a routine, or change how break it down mode is helping you. This is a very nice and useful addition. Unfortunately, if you are quick to skip instruction screens, you will miss the directions to use them. So I didn't know the commands or all of the features voice command could regulate (If you skipped it, check the instruction manual).Pros:Updated Menus - make it easier to jump into the game and get new content from the marketplaceLess annoying characters - (sorry Dare and McCoy)2 players at the same timeExtensive playlist (by this I mean a lot of songs, especially if you import the old ones)Fitness Mode - new features and playlists that combine well to make an effective work out.Break It DownVoice CommandsCons:The Playlist - while there are some good choices, most of the songs are really hit or miss (why have you still not added Thriller!!!)Paying $5 to upload the old songs - plus you need the code from the manual from your first game to do thisInstructions hard to find for voice commands if you aren't looking at the manual (I did trial by error and figured it out)Overall:This game is a lot of fun with friends, especially allowing for two players at once. Its a better version of the last game, with a different set list. Between all the updated features and the ability to import old songs, this has become my new favorite kinect game (over the original). My one qualm is the set list... I feel like they spread the variety too thin, leading to a bunch of unwanted songs that I have to beat to get 5 stars on everything and beat the crew challenges. This goes for the DLC bundles which do the same thing, each one has one song I like and the rest I don't care for.One final remark is that this game does take a couple songs before you are used to watching the player and the flash cards, but once you figure it out its by far the best kinect game on the market.Comparing Just Dance 3 to Dance Central 2:Just Dance 3 is fun if you want a mindless party game that takes little effort to succeed at (watch youtube videos of people standing in place and doing better than those actually trying). Dance Central is a lot of fun, but takes some time to get used to. Plus, in the end only one teaches you real dance moves (I'll give you two guesses).Song List:Sandstorm - DarudeMai Ai Hee (Dragostea Din Tea) - O-ZoneReach - Atlantic Connection And Armanni ReignReal Love - Mary J.

W. Mullins","summary":"You can not defeat the Metal, the Metal is too strong","reviewText":"I had heard great things about this game, its gotten good reviews, and so after seeing in at the military exchange for $20 I figured I pick it up. And I am glad I did. The first think I should point out is that this game is a platformer/Real Time Strategy game. Many of the fights you partake in during your adventures you are directing, recruiting and improving the various units you are able to summon from your 'Rock Stage'. The recruitable units are unique and interesting and you get a lot of funny banter from them. As you upgrade your stage, and gather more fans, you can call stronger and more expensive units. You do all of this to fight NPCs who are building their armies in the same way. But you also have the option of dropping into the action at any time and swing you axe yourself if you wish. To do well it take a little bit of both and that really helped to break up some of the grinding missions from the stage battles. Control is pretty good for a RTS game on the console, and the story is good too. Of course what makes the game great is the world you get to play in. If you could add every cool, and some not so cool, elements from every awesome Metal album cover and gave it life, it would be the world you play it. The entire game is a homage to Metal and the soundtrack is like a history in Metal, a good one. A number of the characters are played by famous Metal musicians, Ozzy, Lemmy Klimster, Lita, Rob Halford, and the list goes on.Jack Black voices the hero, Eddie Riggs and he is the perfect person for the job. The story isn't epic, the character development isn't fantastic, but all things considered with all the different play elements, what you get is a really fun game. You can play through the entire game just doing the story line and make it through in a day of gaming, two at the most. But there are also about 30 alternate missions you can explore to upgrade gear and the like. They aren't required but it does add some play value to the game. I was very happy with this game, its not going on my list of 'greatest games ever' but I enjoyed for being a bit of a guilty lark. I wish the missions were a little more diverse and that the game was slightly longer with a better more conclusive ending. But at its new prices I recommend anyone who enjoys RTS, platformers and Metal to pick this up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"Alessandro Viani","summary":"Lots of Fun","reviewText":"I have never played a Diablo game before, but after playing III for several hours, it's become one of my favorite games; running around and just annihilating any mob that comes near is simply amazing. The quest system is fun, and although it's kind of strange to have a general chat but no one around, it doesn't bother me. I did not buy it to be another WoW. Thus, I only have played single player so far, so I can't opine about any multiplayer aspects. One thing I will mention is that the box is very nice. The box seems very sturdy, and has some weight to it, but not too much. The box opens up to a glossy cardboard sleeve with the install DVD inside and the serial number to register on battle.net on the outside. Underneath the sleeve are 3 Diablo III guest passes and a WoW guest pass. Also included is a nifty notepad which is underneath the passes; very nice.OK, let's talk about the elephant in the room; the DRM. The game is tied to your battle.net account, and thus will not run without an internet connection. Folks, this is nothing we didn't already know. We've known for months that Blizzard would require a constant connection. I can, however, sympathize with the people who were unable to log in on release day. One of the reasons I waited a week to buy it. Much has been said about the \"Real Money Auction House,\" that it's the reason for the server instability. I for one really don't care about the \"RMAH,\" and I don't know anyone else who cares either. Ultimately, it is up to you to pass up this game due to the online only thing, that is your decision. I have been on 11hr plane trips, and it would be nice to kill some mobs, but if I really want to game, I can plan ahead and bring something else. The music is fantastic, and the graphics look really nice on my mid-range Radeon HD6870.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00005BW7Q","reviewerName":"Marc Ruby&#8482; \"The Noh Hare&#8482;\"","summary":"&quot;My external appearance is down five percent.&quot;","reviewText":"Imagine that far in the future a small group of people is driven together by a shared interest in preserving the existence of humanity in space.  Strange aliens that can cross from the spirit plane to the real in a moment, who have an abiding hatred for humans and their creations, are the enemy.  Their opponents are 'people' range from the apparently human Shion Uzuki, to COS-MOS, Shion's creation and a deadly battle android.  In between is every variation of the concept of human imaginable.This turns into a battle that rambles across known space, with an array of scenarios linked together by an amazing amount of lengthy cut scenes.  The battle system, which involves human and mech fighters and a large number of weapons, skills, and spells, is complex and a bit frustrating as well.  It is never easy to make basic leveling up and power decisions.  Game puzzles abound, but the real focus is the fighting and everything around it.Did I mention the cut scenes?  They are well done and acted, but there are so many that they can be tiresome if one decides to go back and re-fight some key battles.  It is hard to criticize an RPG for having too much plot, but Xenosaga may be the one.  Especially since the 'real' plot is still a mystery to be resolved in later episodes.  For now, what we get is continuity and strange hints about the past and future.Characters are excellent.  Shion, a young woman scientist, is sublimely irritating as a heroic figure.  Her supreme interest is COS-MOS, sometimes to the exception of the rest of the human race.  COS-MOS, is a beautiful and efficient killing machine who is more concerned about her looks than her body count.  I also fell in love with MOMO, another android, this time built as an 11-year-old girl with a charming smile, who cheerfully apologized to dealing enemies crushing  blows.  The rest of the team is equally interesting, with many secrets and many of the supporting cast are allowed full development as well.On the whole, the game has two flaws.  The first it that it over-delivers.  There is simply too much of what it does do well, making it difficult to form an effective development strategy.  Since this keeps the game from being simple-minded, it is a good thing.  However, novices like me find the possibilities hard to manage until well into the game.  In addition, despite the battle complexity and cut scenes it is still essentially a linear story with a small number of side quests that can be done out of order.The other problem is the player interface.  It may be luck of the draw, but Xenosaga uses several controller presses exactly the opposite from the past three games I played.  If it did this consistently, I would not mind, but often the reversal is haphazard, causing redundant and nonsensical controller moves.  I was still fumbling and cursing well into the game, and this contributed heavily to my problems with the game.All in all this is a very good game with a couple of minor flaws.  I wish every game tried to be as much as Xenosaga does.  The interface, which was my worst problem, can be overcome.  If Namco maintains this level, there is much to look forward to in future episodes.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2003"}

Once the gold has been destroyed, you get reenforcements for a longer game.  Now they have control points which are 5 flags that your have to capture which can be downloaded for free.  Once all 5 flags have been crontrolled, the game ends and not to mention that their are 3 new maps to downwoald for free but only for this portion of online.  Thier are different classes to choose from like assault, special ops, demolition, sniper and heavy machine gunner.  Playing online and ranking up gives you a point after so many times you have ranked up for the ability to unlock certian items like the injector for assault, med packs for machine gunner or C-4 for special ops.  You are also able to unlock other weapons and each class has about 3 weapons to unlock.  Their are special weapons that you can unlock but only 4 out of the 5 can be found in a gameinformer or the web.

You do carry an injector that brings your health back but their is never any downside and its unlimited.

In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use.

Overall, at 15 minute quarters you get unrealistic gameplay, as I was allowing opposing quarterbacks to throw for as much as 500 yards on me. My running game was getting in excess of 200 yards a game. Overall, a decent game but too unrealistic when using 15 minute quarters.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2009"}

The campaigns aren't any different from the actual game at all.  A big problem is that the maps are too small for aircraft to enjoy the joy of flight.

You can control a character on either side of the spectrum; be a clone trooper for the republic or a super battle droid for the empire.  Some of the locales are stunning, namely places such as Kashyyk (home of the Wookies), and Geonosis.  The AI is pretty good for this type of game, although I did occasionally run into the odd moment where someone on my side ran in front of me and got shot, or attempted a suicide attack on an AT-AT all by himself.  For the most part, however, this game is true to the Star Wars theme, and occasionally you will find yourself running alongside other Star Wars heroes (Chewbacca, anyone?).  Perhaps my only real gripe with this game is the same gripe I have with Battlefield: 1942.  When you die, your character respawns on the other side of the battlefield.  This essentialy means that you miss most of the remainder of the fight because of the necessity of having to run all the way to the action again.  With that being said, Star Wars Battlefront is awesome, and it is a must have for any true Star Wars fan.Overall = Excellent","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2007"}

They're the best yet of the series and the characters look 3D while still retaining their 2D spirit. Street Fighter wasn't meant to be played in 3D and gladly, they keep this tradition going. There's one word for the graphics: spectacular.The sound. Surround sound ensures that you hear the hits connecting all around you, especially when an ultra combo is involved.The characters. Some of them are kinda goofy but for the most part, just about all the characters you know and love return. Fans of Street Fighter 2 will be the most pleased I think. You get 16 to start but that number grows once you unlock the rest. Actually, I have a bone to pick regarding the final boss but I'll save that for later.Unlockables. Lots of stuff to unlock, guaranteeing multiple playthroughs. You can also download costumes online.... for a fee of course.THUMBS IN BETWEEN TO:The gameplay. It's classic Street Fighter with a couple of additions to it, namely Ultra Combos and Focus Attacks. I think for the most part this game plays well with the standard Xbox 360 gamepad but some of those specials are nearly impossible to pull off in the heat of battle with it. This game practically cries for the arcade joystick but the question remains: Do you really want to drop that much cash on a joystick, no matter how well made it is?Online play. For the most part, its lag free and controls quite well. Still, you'll have to contend with some pretty cheesy tactics from online players. No different from playing the game at your local arcade except now you can get cheesed in the comfort of your own home.THUMBS DOWN TO:Seth, the final boss. Wow. I mean, it's Street Fighter and I expect a little bit of cheese but this character is literally one of the biggest blocks of pure cheddar that I have ever faced. This guy does things that are so unfair that it almost feels like a joke that you're not in on. And he looks like a cross between the Silver Surfer and Dr. Manhattan from the Watchmen, only with a spinning Yin-Yang in his midsection. I didn't feel like he was too inspired in all honesty and his cheesy nature just makes me want to throw my controller through the screen, Wii-remote style.Anime cut scenes. Badly produced with horrendous voice acting. Thankfully you can switch the voiceovers to Japanese but c'mon its Street Fighter! The series that took everyone's money for years! You mean to tell me that they couldn't have delivered some slick anime type deals to head and tail each characters storylines with some decent work?VERDICT:I'd recommend this game as it caters to both the newbie and the expert Street Fighter player. The CPU can be downright ridiculous even at the medium levels though to that point where we've all reached, where we look up at the ceiling and ask, \"What is it you want from me, huh? My blood? My life? My firstborn?!?\"Still, the game is loads of fun to play and offers some very decent online play to boot. The graphics and effects are fantastic and on the right setup provides a visual and aural feast. Just be prepared to keep from chucking your controller once Seth comes around.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2009"}

It was an excellent and break through game back in its day and even today it can be a fun simple experience. Controlling 13 different characters in the game (one main character and 12 others) it makes the whole game a fresh and remarkable experience. You are a character to finds her grandfather dead and must find out the secrets in his mansion. She comes across a book called the Tome of Darkness and as she reads it you play each character in the chapter and have to solve unique, yet simple, puzzles and fight many different zombies and baddies. What's different here though is that the combat is very simple yet is very customizable since you can lock on and de-limb enemies and even cut off their heads. Yes its very rewarding and neat to see.You can pick up many different weapons throughout the game and you can even cast magic spells. I LOVE the way this game does the magic since you have to find Runes and them Tomes to decrypt them and Runes can be inside enemies that you have to defeat and you find Tomes in many different ways. I also love how when the main character reads each chapter those spells you learned go to her and its amazing how each chapter coincides with the next and how it all ties together. I have never seen a game do something like this so well. The score isn't as great as it should be is because its 2007 and you can see ALL the flaws in this game and it's just too shallow compared to games we play now. Even so, its good for a quick, you can beat it in about 10-12 hours, and unique experience. The game does give you a few quick scares but is nothing close to scary or creepy really.

However, since a lot of people might be thinking about whether or not to get this for Christmas, I thought I'd give my early impressions!This version of AC is a lot like the Gamecube version--with a very similar beginning---work for Nook for a while, pay off your house, etc.  Even the dollar amounts are the same.  The animals at least in my town are new to me, but along the same lines of the old animals!  The main differences are the controls--it's SO much easier to walk around with the DS, and to fish and especiall to design clothes.  However, the small screen is annoying to me in that I can design some great outfit and then you can barely see it on your character, as they are so darn small!  I wish the upper screen was used much more, as it would be fun to see things enlarged there, or to have it give more extra information.The wireless connectivity aspect of the game appeared to me, but I haven't yet been able to get it to work---I do have wireless internet, but the DS seems to be having trouble getting a good enough signal.  I do think I'll work that out, but you have to know a friend code to use this feature---you can't just look around randomly for towns to visit.  I don't know that many other people (especially my age!) into AC, so I don't know how that will work!  I did do a DS to DS connection with my son's town, and that was fairly fun.For big AC fans, it's just so exciting to have a new game to play!  I'm not sure this will grab that many new fans, though.  The bigger screen of the Gamecube seemed more suited for the game to me.  I'm not complaining about the game---I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a non-violent, fairly educational (lots of reading and writing) and fun game for their kids, and for anyone who loved the original!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2005"}

New Super Mario Brothers combines the best of both worlds, bringing in the cool moves introduced by the 3D games while giving a gameplay experience that's on par with classics like Super Mario Brothers 3 and Super Mario World.The plot of the game is familiar, to say the least. Princess Peach has been kidnapped yet again, this time by Bowser Junior, and it's up to Mario (or Luigi, who is accessible through a code) to save her. Like the Mario games of old, there is a world map and plenty of secret items, giving lots of reasons to go through the levels multiple times. The 3D graphics look excellent, and the variety of moves including the butt-stomp and the wall jump are welcome additions. In addition to the usual power-ups of the super mushroom, the fire flower, and the invincibility star, the game adds a mini-mushroom that allows Mario to enter special areas and walk on water, a blue shell that allows extra protection and the ability to rocket yourself across the screen like a koopa shell, and -- my personal favorite -- a mega mushroom that makes Mario grow to enormous size and allows him to smash anything on the screen for a short time. These power-ups are so fun that they even manage to make up for the fact that there's no leaf or cape that allows for flight.The game is relatively short, and can be beaten straight through in just a few hours. However, as I mentioned earlier, there are many secrets, including two entire worlds, that can be unlocked after Bowser and son have been defeated. Additionally, the array of mini-games is an entertaining diversion, even though they're the same games from the DS's version of Super Mario 64. The versus mini game is worth special mention, as it features Mario and Luigi fighting against each other across a variety of levels. That mode can be quite fun, especially when crazy items like the mega mushroom come into play.All in all, New Super Mario Brothers provides some classic gameplay with the refreshing twist of new tricks and better graphics. It easily stands alongside the best games of the Mario franchise, and serves as an excellent introduction for young players who may not have experienced a side-scrolling Mario game before.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2007"}

Yes, entertainment value is wonderful but if you play the game, beat it, and then don't have your world view at least shaken a bit by the game it's just an empty shell with pretty visuals.That said, Final Fantasy XII is a fun game. It has some interesting side quests such as the hunting quests (you're given a task to hunt down some beast which is generally much harder than normal beasts) and it all around keeps you somewhat interested from the get-go.The characters, however, are rubbish. The only really interesting character is the pirate character who seems to have a larger part in the story than even Vaan who is is the main character. Vaan's character in general will remind you somewhat of Tidus from Final Fantasy X although he whines a lot less. His whole character motivation, and this doesn't change at all throughout the story, he wants to leave the town and be the captain of a ship. The leading man in this story is a boy who whines from time to time but has no real impact on the story.The story is also very predictable and while there are lots of interesting things to do and places to explore you'll find yourself guessing what's to come prior to it happening.Graphics and sound are wonderful and so is the gameplay so the game is not a huge loss. It's a very pretty game and perhaps it worth playing if only for the innovative parts of it but, again, you won't walk away feeling like the game was a huge addition to the series.The battle system is perhaps the most unique piece of the game though. Instead of pulling you away from the world map or forcing you to face random enemies as historically done by the franchise the game has real time fighting with a semi turn based core. You still have the same menu you've historically had but you'll just have to select the enemy and your attacks will hit as it's your turn again. There are two drawbacks to this system, in my opinion, however.The first is that the fighting, at times, seems to be a lot less frantic as in the other games in the series. From time to time I'd die, yes, but in the former games in the series there were always battles where the enemy would unleash something devastating across my whole party but with this system it's usually avoidable and less dramatic.The second is that the game feels like a MMORPG at times (if that was the intent?). I just thought it was kind of weird but some people may enjoy that feeling.The rest generally has been said in other reviews so I'll leave this at this. All in all, it's a fun game with lots of innovative new changes on the core Final Fantasy system. It's nothing too great, however, story wise so while I do suggest playing it I just want to warn it's nothing on the level of the other Final Fantasy games in the series.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2008"}

The combat system is very well done in which you choose your armor, weapons, magic rings/amulets, and spells in a menu and can change these based on what you go into combat with.  The countless possibilities of combinations are numberless, and there is a slight variation in quests each time you play.The theme is basically a medieval one in which you venture deep into an underground labyrinth to battle monsters and such that you've heard about, and you end up having to face monsters of mammoth proportions (The Butcher), Magical Skill (Lazarus), and a combination (Diablo).  The game really shouldn't be intended for kids that are at an age where gore and such could sicken one, as there are themes of death, sacrifice, and unholiness in the game.I found the game very enjoyable however, and at the moment it's at a bargain price.  If you have played Diablo II already, you'd probably like the first Diablo, although Diablo II is much better.  I'd still suggest playing the first one before taking on Diablo II.  There are numerous spells and such that you can learn to aid you on your quest, and items appear randomly after battling Monster bosses (regular monsters with special powers...i.e. one with magic resistances).  The game implores you to learn the lay out of the dungeon, and you begin to press deeper into the valleys of heck.The degree of difficulty is not too bad, where after you get used to the game, you realize that all you really need is time to beat it, and plenty of saves.  The usefulness of the shops and magic items also turns the tides against darkness in your favor.  I'd recommend this game to anyone who's out of elementary school and doesn't mind the gore and violence to reach a game with great gameplay and a relatively detailed storyline, with interesting quests.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2002"}
{"product_name":"B004L4G8UC","description":"","reviewerName":"me!","summary":"Not a shooter, yet still exciting and fun","reviewText":"When I bought this game, I thought that I was getting a top down style 3rd person shooter (It was an impulse buy without research), at least that is what it looked like on the box art. So I was suprised when I found out that it is a turn based game like X-Com or Fire Emblim. I like turn based games, I just would have never guessed that Ghost Recon would be one. But after playing it for a while, I realized that it works well. To break it down, you command a team by selecting a soldier and moving them to a position within their parameters to either attack, advance, or defend. After each team member is in their desired position and you end your turn, the enemy will take their turn to do the same, and you keep going until all of the goals are met, or a member of you team is killed, which brings me to the only downfall I have of the game. If a member of your team is killed it's game over. I would have rather seen that on each mission you have perticular people that must survive and others that are expendable, with all of your soldiers gaining rank and skills along the way, but if you lose one of your expendables, you have to recruit new soldiers and they start out fresh. I.E. your Demo Tech has to survive in missions where demolitions are required, but in missions where your Demo Tech is not needed, If you lose him/her you have to start the next mission with a new Demo Tech at the rank of Private that has less accuracy with weapons and demolitions, and less life. Other then that, the game is really fun and addictive. One nice feature (like in X-Com) if it is the oppositions turn and they attack one of your soldiers, your soldiers will fire back if they are in the position to do so.I would definately recommend Ghost Recon to anyone that owns a 3ds, especially if you are like me, with an itchy trigger finger that is waiting for a 1st or 3rd person combat based shooter to come out for the 3ds.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"Pretty good for its time!","reviewText":"I played this game way after it was released as I did not own original Xbox. As there was a huge hype built around Halo 3, I felt obligated that I check this game (and the Halo 1 ) out.To start out, I was happy that they kept all the things that got Halo 1 huge. Namely awesome 1st person mechanics, variety of vehicles and weapons, decent story, great multiplayer and of course Master Chief (a strong solemn character which really gets you curious about his past).As for improvement, of course it had better graphics, more weapons, improved character design, I liked the story a bit better than the first and also introduction of a new interesting character with different abilities and combat mechanics. And how can any one forget the dual weapon combo.Saying that I really did not like how they made this game as redundant as the first one. Also, I know that is not the goal of developers of Halo, but man this series can really use some kicka## bosses. It will truly bring experience to a different level.Nonetheless, I would say for the time it was release, it was a SPECTACULAR game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2010"}

The graphics are beautiful (when they're not playing all the movie scenes that we've already seen), but there was a problem. IT WAS TOO HARD! I beat the first to levels, but on the Mines of Moria, I died at least 3 times before realizing the game was on \"Normal\". Yes, I always play video games on their easiest form (the first time, then when I beat that mode, I move up a level). Even set on \"Easy\", the game was a bit of a challenge. The reason for this was I wasn't killing my enemies correctly. I was pressing the 4 main buttons (Triangle, Circle, Box & X), when the only bottons that damage the enemies are the strong attack (Triangle) and X (the swift attack). Then I taught myself how to use the bow (by pressing and holding L1 and firing it with X). I beat the level up to the Watcher (the giant octopus), in which I died twice, until realizing how to defeat him. Once I beat the level, I went into the \"Expirence Earned\" section, in which you learn curtesy in the form of exp. points. When you kill enemies, you get rated on how good your combat was on defeating them: \"fair\", \"good\", \"excellent\" & \"perfect\". You get points for each one, but you get more points for (example) good to fair and \"perfect\" to \"excellent\". What can you buy? New combos (which you pretty much have to force yourself to remember), powered up arrows & axes (what Gimli throws), increased health & more.As you know, you can play as these three characters: Aragorn, Legolas & Gimli. Each has their own special combat features. Gimli's strong, but slow. And he's short, too, so it's a fr reach on enemies like Urah-Ki. Also, when he throws axes, it takes him longer than Aragorn & Legolas. Still, he's my second best fighter. Legolas, who I would've thought would have been my second, is my third best fighter. He fights merely on speed, and has hardly any strength, which is bad when fighting enemies like Cave Troll. He can hold the most arrows, though, a total of 60, and he shoots the fastest as well. My best character, Aragorn, is a mixture of both speed and strength. He can hold a maximum of 50 bows.Now, the reason this game's hard is because there's TOO many enemies. You can walk out into a field, and all of a sudden 10 sword-swining Urah-Kai can pop out and kill you instantly. Most levels take at least three tries even on \"Easy\". But, if you're unlike me and like extremely hard games, then you'll like this. But, if you're a Tolkein fan, that's an exception. It'll still be hard; but it'll be fun.P.s.: If you haven't already beaten the game, the secret character is Isildur. Man, I thought it would be Gandalf or even Gollum or someone...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2003"}

Blizzard","summary":"A Game for RPG Fans, Shooter Fans Not so Much","reviewText":"Alpha Protocol is the new espionage RPG from Obsidian Entertainment. This game has had an interesting development cycle that started almost four years ago and has been sitting on a shelf, finished, for over six months. Obsidian should sound familiar to RPG (Role Playing Game) fans in particular. Prior to becoming Obsidian, many of the key people worked for Black Isle Studios. That company created some of the highest regarded RPG's such as Planescape: Torment, Icewind Dale, and Fallout. They also worked with BioWare on Baldur's Gate. Now, Obsidian has finished a new game in an area of the RPG genre none have yet tried.Story: This is the meat of Alpha Protocol, and you can send the story down varying paths based on what you choose during the game. The game allows you to drastically alter how the story progresses, however, the backbone of it remains the same. The game is set in recent times, a terrorist as acquired cutting-edge missile technology and brought down a commercial aircraft. You, Mike Thorton, have been selected to join Alpha Protocol to put a stop to them. Alpha Protocol is a super-secret government organization where missions are handed out and the agents have free reign on how best to complete them. The program is not on any balance sheet and few people in the United States government are even aware of its existence. If it is discovered, the program is shut down and restarted as something else, somewhere else. As a spy, you can approach the story in a myriad of ways such as the professional route, the hot headed \"shoot first\" route, the suave James Bond route, or any combination thereof. In every key mission, you can take actions which alter how the story continues. For instance, you can keep a terrorist alive by faking his death, then calling in a favor for sparing his life later on, or you can terminate him. You can also select who you want to send your intelligence to, such as using it to blackmail a company, post it in the news, or sell it to the black market. Your choices affect which missions you get to go on, who your handlers are, item availability, who your enemies and allies are, and major key story events. The story evolves based on what you want, there are over 30 different endings and they can be very different. Dialogue sequences flow differently. Instead of other games, like Mass Effect, which this game gets compared to frequently, where you have unlimited time to make a dialogue choice with a very specific answer, this game merely allows you to take a stance from aggressive, suave, or professional and you only have a few seconds to make a choice. You also have the option to take action such as execute, spare, or bring up specific points with the person you are talking to. This allows the sequences to flow more naturally and remain suspenseful and not every character will respond to a particular stance the same way as others.Though the story is largely generic, the cast of characters is memorable and bring the game to life. You have Mina, who acts as your primary handler for most of the game and is a by-the-books sort of character, Scarlet Lake, who is a journalist with a deadly secret, SIE, who loves aggressive men and is a domineering one woman army, Albatross, who is elusive and favors stealth approaches, you also have Steven Heck who is a sociopath that likes to blow stuff up and cause chaos, and Madison Saint James, who is just a bystander that got roped into everything thanks to you. There is also a large supporting cast that alters the story is a more peripheral way. Because the game allows for so many different choices, you may not be allies with all of the main characters and you may find yourself having to make difficult, split second decisions as to their fate. This game rewards you based on choice, good or bad. You gain perks during the game based on those choices, so, for instance, if you romance characters, you gain permanent bonuses. There are over one hundred perks you can unlock that provide a number of special bonuses from increased health, increased damage, to better evasion abilities, and more. The game takes itself seriously, but also has a sense of humor with the occasional cliche or funny mission debriefings. I like the \"Veteran Attitude\" perk which gives an experience bonus and additional dialogue choices, but upon closer inspection it reads \"You've saved the world once, you'll do it again, and anyone who questions you can go ... themselves.\" There's also the Star Wars inspired \"These Aren't the Agents You're Looking for\" perk you get for talking your way past guards. You can also view television news stories which show your various missions and other stories. The developers made the news broadcasts similar to a popular cable news channel famous for its sensationalistic stories and politically motivated news actors, err, anchors.Gameplay: Alpha Protocol is an RPG, not a shooter. It says so on the box and the game should be approached as such. With all good RPG's, you can customize yourself to a large extent. As with the guns and armor, everything about Mike's appearance can be modified with the exception of gender and bone structure. You can level up your character in a manner similar to that found in the first Mass Effect. You have a wide selection of skills you can level up, with four gun-based weapons, stealth, sabotage, toughness, martial arts, and tech as choices. At every level up, you are given advancement points to spend on the skills. Obviously, the more points in a given skill, the better you are at it and the more you can do with it. There is a level 20 cap and you cannot advance every single skill to the max, in fact, at a key moment in the game, you can select three skills to specialize in which will allow you to advance beyond the standard, non specialized, skills. Those three skills should be ones you use most often, if you use martial arts, for instance, you want to specialize in it to do greater damage and unlock high-level abilities. All skills require more than one point and the game gently pushes you towards the more spy-centric skills by having a lower point cost on those. Thankfully, the game gives you a sort of trial period. During the first set of missions in Saudi Arabia, which act like a tutorial, you play with the skills you chose when you started. But, if they aren't working out for you, when you're able to select your specialization, you can also redo all of the skills again to better suit your play style. As a spy, you have access to all sorts of gadgets from standard grenades and flashbangs, to more exotic items like radio mimics and EMP charges. Your tech rating will determine how good you are with the tech-based items and it will also determine how many you can bring on a mission. Spies also have various abilities they unlock during level up. These can be passive such as allowing you to evade detection for a few seconds, should you be detected, or active like remotely hacking terminals or fury which slows down time during martial arts attacks. When you are sent on a mission from one of your handlers, you can approach it any way you choose from a stealthy approach all the way to the more loud and violent one. Depending on the mission, you have to select your loadout before you leave, do you go with heavy but loud armor or quiet and weaker armor, do you go in with shotguns or pistols? Guns and armor can be heavily customized with a variety of add-ons and all of which will be needed. You have a number of guns to choose from such as pistols (Low damage unless fully aimed, close range and can be silenced), sub machine guns (Inaccurate spray and pray weapons with low damage on each individual bullet, medium to short range), shotgun (High damage and it can allow you to move without losing much aim, but the shots go everywhere, short range), and assault rifles (Can be highly accurate and very damaging if appropriately equipped and aimed, long to medium range).The gun mechanic in the game is unusual for people accustomed to shooters. You can fire your weapon without aiming, but the bullet can go anywhere in the rather large reticule if you do. You must aim your weapon by holding a button down, the longer you hold it, the smaller the reticule becomes and if you let it shrink all the way, you get a critical hit which, on most enemies, will take them out. If you move or stop aiming, the reticule expands. The speed at which the reticule shrinks is determined by your skill in that weapon. Even if you don't have any skill points invested in a given weapon type, you can still use it but you will not have access to abilities or special bonuses until you spend points. Because of this slower take on gunplay, you cannot run-and-gun effectively, nor can you go into a situation with your guns blazing like Rambo and expect to survive for very long, thus forcing you to strategize. I found that guns can be a more supportive element and I favored using martial arts whenever possible. In battle, you have endurance and hit points. The endurance is determined by perks, skills, and largely by armor. Endurance regenerates after several seconds of not taking damage, however, hit points are permanent until you heal. There is also a cover mechanic, but, if you aren't covered completely, or choose to hide behind something an enemy can see through, like a chain link fence, guards will be able to spot you if they get close. In this situation, it is best to stay out of sight completely and then jumping an enemy with a martial art skill when they get near, or setting a trap. My preferred method of clearing a room was to isolate a guard, and make some noise for it to come and investigate. I would then jump out and K.O. the guard then hide again. Another guard would hear what happened, but not see me, and when he got close, I repeated the tactic. Sometimes it worked, sometimes not. There are also a number of fun minigames, the lock picking minigame can be tricky since you're on a timer and you have to use the pressure-sensitive triggers to move tumblers into place and lock them. The hacking minigame can be aggravating. You are given two lines of code and you have to match those two codes to randomly changing lines of codes. If you're able to find the code that isn't changing and matches the code you have, you must quickly move it into place and lock it down. This minigame is on two timers, one is the overall timer and the other is a shorter timer which randomizes the location of the static code after a few seconds.Technical: This is an Obsidian game, great story and gameplay ideas, but buggy. Alpha Protocol uses the Unreal Engine 3. This engine is known for problems on consoles and doesn't have anti aliasing for the PC. This is a Games for Windows title, but not a Live-enabled game even though it is a multiplatform release on the PC, PlayStation 3, and the Xbox 360. This means there are no achievements and updates will have to be downloaded manually. The game allows for the Xbox 360 Controller to be used, though you need to change a setting in the options menu to enable it. The graphics are passable and would be good if it were 2007, but nowadays, they look dated. Not bad per se, but dated none the less. It seems as though the art department had some great ideas but the programmers were limited in what they could use or ran out of time. The Italian set of missions, for instance, look great, especially the museum, but lack polish. The character models are a little bland and wooden at times, but there are moments when everything clicks into place with them and the voice acting, where their expressions and actions closely match what they are doing. Case in point: Mina. Her voice actor is very good and the model can show a shocking level of emotion at times. The main character, Mike, isn't as fortunate with so-so voice acting and a generic model. Speaking of voice acting, Nolan North makes a required appearance as Heck's voice. As noted before, this game has bugs. I encountered two technical bugs, a mouse stuttering issue, which is eliminated with a 360 controller, and graphics popping in or flickering. The graphics flickering was common but pop in happened about five times and lasted a second or two. Both of these can be resolved with patching or future driver updates. I didn't have any show stopping crashes at all. A gameplay bug I encountered from time to time centers around enemy artificial intelligence. If the enemies see you, they come storming in, but if they just hear you, they walk in circles with one or two coming to find you. AI problems are most noticeable during boss battles. I was fighting a boss that chased me with a knife but he got hung on scenery directly in front of me as his path finding is anchored to me and not on a trail avoiding obstacles. This allowed me to stand in front of him and shoot away without resistance while he ran in place. During two other battles, the bosses just seemed to have given up. They ran to the other side of the room and just stood there. Even though I was being pelted by supporting enemy units, I didn't waste an opportunity and opened fire. I didn't dare move from my location in both cases as that may have reset the AI and the bosses may have restarted their rampage.Most PC releases have Digital Rights Management (DRM) software (For this game it is Uniloc: SoftAnchor), and this is no exception. Thankfully, the game's distributor, Sega, has made the DRM forgiving. There is no disc check, you will have to activate the game over the Internet but there are exceptions if you don't have an active Internet connection when the game is installed, the system works similar to SteamWorks but does not use that software even on Steam installs. You are granted up to five licenses and can reclaim them during an uninstall, again, if you are not connected to the net or your PC is somehow wiped, there are alternate means of reclaiming licenses. Unlike Ubisoft's system, a constant Internet connection isn't required. After 18 to 24 months, Sega will release a patch to completely remove the DRM altogether. The game will check in with Sega's servers occasionally, giving them limited anonymous gameplay data to further tweak the game in patches or add-on's. This communication is not required and the game will not harass you if an Internet connection is unavailable. The game simply won't check in and the process happens entirely in the background. Given the bugs in Alpha Protocol, I think Sega should have some kind of data to iron out the problems. No system-level DRM drivers are installed, either. The DRM is focused on Alpha Protocol exclusively and does not blacklist programs, it will also uninstall itself when the game is removed. Given the draconian nature of some DRM schemes, the method and permissions Sega allows are very lenient and customer-centric. It's not as good as no DRM at all, but it is fair. I experienced no slowdowns with the game and was able to run it at 1920 x 1200 resolution on an Intel Core 2 Quad 9450, 8GB of RAM, and two 9800 GTX's in SLI. This is a more high end system, but as of this writing, there is no SLI profile specifically for this game so I'm limited to one graphics card with Alpha Protocol. All four CPU cores are probably not in use, nor does the game use much RAM even though it is 64-bit compatible. This game will not push your hardware very much if you have a modern system with a decent graphics card, 2GB or more of RAM, and a reasonably fast dual core CPU.Misc.: This has been an interesting game for me to play. I usually like most of Obsidian's RPG's, even before they became Obsidian. Initial reviews on the console versions of the game left me very concerned. After reading the reviews, both bad and good, I eventually got the game. I've never seen professional reviews vary so widely, both in quality and score. This left me with a number of impressions: The PC version of the game was better than the console (Unreal Engine 3 problems, maybe? The PC could be better at overcoming bugs? PC gamers could be more tolerant of bugs as they are accustomed to them and patching?), the game plays like an RPG first and a shooter a very, very distant second or third or fourth (It is spelled out on the box, it is an RPG.), some reviewers didn't understand the gameplay mechanics or had little patience for it (Alpha Protocol is not to be played as a third person shooter, it is not Mass Effect and should not be treated as such. The game's mechanics reflect this.), a false impression was developed from trailers (They were fast paced and action heavy, not reflecting actual pacing which can lead to a wrong impression of Alpha Protocol.), the story was usually decent (Even here there was disagreement as to how good it was. Some said it was standard fare but well executed, others panned it. One reviewer even contradicted themselves saying it was unique in one paragraph and generic in another.), there are plenty of bugs (This happens in all versions of the game, but Obsidian is known for this and for patching constantly.), it is designed for the PC but controls are for the console (True.), and finally the graphics aren't that amazing (RPG's typically don't have jaw-dropping graphics.  Obsidian games are not BioWare games, and certainly not Square-Enix games. People play these games for story and ideas mostly. Becoming obsessed with the graphics and ignoring everything else, except problems, is just sad. This game looks about as good as Dragon Age, and it too drew complaints.) My biggest problem with how the reviews is that many just aren't that well done. One can dislike a game yet appreciate certain elements. For instance, one reviewer at a professional gaming website (I won't mention it, but it is obvious once you read it) tried playing the game as a shooter, even though it isn't one, failed, then tore into Alpha Protocol's shortcomings. Some of the rage was warranted like the increased number of bugs on the console versions, but some it wasn't. For instance, don't flashbang yourself, take a screen shot of it, then put a caption that says it is a constant visual effect because it isn't. Other sites make one review, even though they review games across all gaming platforms, and simply copy and paste the review, along with the usually low score, across all platforms. This is a game whose quality varies widely across platforms and reviewing it on each is suggested. This long rant about reviews is justified as they will leave gamers totally confused since many aren't well done with reviewers who didn't take time to learn game mechanics, who don't like this type of game at all, or are focused on what was done wrong rather than right.Personally, I liked the game, but I knew what I was getting when I bought it. It is a very Obsidian game that is ambitious with many interesting elements and some glaring issues. The story is well crafted and its path is determined by the gamer, same thing with character development. I enjoy a good RPG with plenty of customizing rather than an action heavy game with a light story. This is probably why I enjoyed Alpha Protocol. Gamers who are debating whether or not to buy this game should keep this in mind: I cannot emphasize this enough, Alpha Protocol is an RPG not a shooter. The story takes center stage here rather than combat. When combat is warranted, the fact Mike is a spy and not a soldier comes into play. If you love RPG's and don't mind a slower combat system, Alpha Protocol is worth it. If you view stories as filler between the killing, look elsewhere because this game will not satisfy you. Alpha Protocol is available for the PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. If you have the choice between a PC and a console, I strongly suggest the PC as it seems to run more smoothly and the bugs can be more easily overcome. If you can only get it for the console, pick your poison as both don't run very well until patches are released. If Obsidian stays true to form, they will release a large number of fixes which will make the game much more playable on all platforms. Sadly, PC gaming is more of a niche nowadays, and with all the problems the console versions have, plus bad reviews, I don't believe the game will do very well. Alpha Protocol will likely have a small but dedicated fan base who enjoys this type of game and will want a sequel or expansion to see what Agent Thorton gets into next. Whether or not the game will be successful enough to allow for this is in question.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2010"}

I finally got my XBox360 last spring, and I started with Kingdoms of Amalur and Dragon Age Origins, because I have always liked medieval RPG style games.  I suspected that Skyrim was probably going to be the best one for me, because of all the 5-star reviews, and also because in addition to RPG's, I also just like Vikings, dragons, Nordic lore, etc. in general.Wow, Skyrim is everything I wanted and more.  It actually exceeded my high expectations and re-set what I thought a videogame could do.  I had read the 5-star reviews but was not sure it could live up to the hype.  It did.The graphics are great, and you can get lost for days in a beautiful Nordic mountain world.  The first dragon I fought was the single coolest battle I've ever had on a video game.  I got chills it was so cool.  The character leveling is both complex and intuitive, you really do level up exactly those talents you use the most.  I'm also enjoying the alchemy, smithing, and enchanting activities.  I love walking new tracts of wilderness I've never seen before, looking for plants to harvest for alchemy potions, while hunting beasts and discovering new caves/dungeons/lore along the way.  The archery is really enjoyable too.  You can stalk prey such as cave bears or giants with stealth and arrows.  I find that I'm gravitating toward an archery/stealth/mage build, with emphasis on destruction and conjuration spells.  There are a thousand different ways you could take a character, though.  I'm level 20 and in love with this game.If you are wondering whether you should play Oblivion (or any other game for that matter) first, don't worry about it.  Get this version and jump right into Skyrim.  This is the best.  You install Disc 2 on your Xbox360 first, then use Disc 1 when you play the game.  It comes preloaded with Dawnguard and all of the other Skyrim expansions already set for your game, so your first playthrough will enclude the entire gamut of Skyrim locations, spells, monsters, lore, etc.  Don't even bother with other versions, this one is the whole enchilada.As much as I loved the combat and graphics of Amalur and the characters and plot of Dragon Age Origins, I am loving the entirety of Skyrim so much more.  I love every hour spent on this game, and I find myself thinking about it when not playing.  Get this one, it is the best.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2013"}

The game had a great story, the voice acting was superb, the graphics incredible...it really felt like (in movie terms) a summer blockbuster type of game.  That said, the game does have some faults.I think there is entirely way too much shooting action, and not enough climbing/platforming and exploring/puzzle solving (and the puzzles that do show up are way to easy to solve).  Really though, as great and detailed as the levels/chapters are, it got really annoying that every section just ended up in some giant gunfight with the same 4 or 5 enemies...and the game really puts you at a disadvantage when they have numerous enemies coming out of every nook and cranny shooting at you (expect to die a lot in this game - luckily you have unlimited lives, you just respawn at the last check point).  By the time I got to chapter 18 or 19, I was so over with the whole shoot-out aspect, that I just wanted the game to end really.So yeah, story and visuals are great, the climbing around is really fun, but expect to get tired of having to shoot the same dudes in every level over and over and over and over and over (get the drift?)...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2011"}

How about if you haven't purchased this yet do yourself a great favor and purchase it now. I bought my copy in Dec. 2007 and paid $50 for it and thought I was getting a spectacular deal because at the time it was easily selling on the secondhand market for $57 and up. To see this game going for $30 smackers a year later would be an irresistible deal if I didn't already own it. The fact that it's holding it's value so well after a year is a clear indicator of what an amazing game it is.I played through this game twice in one week when I first bought it. Since, I have played through it 4 more times. That's a rarity for me to play through a game that much. To sum this game in one word: FUN!!!!!!! Everything from the locales to the gunplay to the characters is phenomenal. The main character, Nathan, controls like a dream. What makes it so fun is the adventuresomeness of treasure hunting and exploring. Add in Elena and Sully as your occasional sidekick and you've got a summer blockbuster popcorn movie in video game form.Replay value? Yep, it's got plenty of that. With several levels of difficulty(crushing be the most difficult....it will crush you to.....I finally got through it), 60 treaures to find, and 47 trophies to unlock you'll be at this one for a while. It's a fairly long game too. We're talking 20+ levels. I think the first time through it took me about 20 hours to go through it on normal difficulty, but I was taking my time trying to find all 60 treasures.Diversity? Ditto again here. Many different locales you will visit all presented in beautiful detail. Some of the views in the game are breathtaking! Character models are sterling. Level design is brilliant. Vast array of weapons to choose from and use. Aiming is a cinch. Even got a couple of jet-ski levels and a jeep driving section to mix things up.Sound? Got it going on here, too. Great voice acting and music round out this mega-awesome game. Superb gun sound effects! The character interaction between Nathan, Elena and Sully is timeless. At times they will make you laugh(great humor.....Nathan can be so sarcastic at times) and at others they make your jaw drop. Yes, there's a nice little twist in the game.To sum it up, this is by far the most fun I've had with a game ever. It ranks in my top 5 games all-time. That may sound like a profound statement, but play through this game and you may see why I made that statement. If you need more encouragement to buy this game just look at the average score of 292 or so reviews right here on Amazon. We're talking a 4.7 average!!!! How many games can achieve that? Not many!In short: GO BUY THIS GAME NOW! NOW! NOW! AT ONE HELLUVA PRICE AND HAVE A GRAND TIME!!! FOR ALL THOSE PLAYING THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME OR WHO HAVE YET TO PLAY IT, I TRULY ENVY YOU!!! I GIVE IT A PERFECT 10 OUT OF 10 OR A PERFECT 5 OUT OF 5 STARS!!!CAN YOU UNLOCK THE PLATINUM TROPHY?

There were times I wished they went with M for the gore effects but they accomplished what they needed to without disembowling people.My only con might be a spoiler:- I found myself wishing the monsters would take a more Lovecraftian turn.

{"product_name":"B00008URUA","description":"Join Yuna in mission-based, non-linear gameplay, as she and her companions travel across Spira in this epic Final Fantasy adventure.","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"Super fast, super sleek, and pretty good too!","reviewText":"Starting this title I was initially turned off by the &quot;disasteriffic&quot; dialogue of the game. It kind of scared me to see some of my favorite Final Fantasy characters using dialogue so bad that it made Charlie's Angels look good... Thankfully, early into the title the lame dialogue comes to an end and the story begins. Although the story isn't as deep and meaningful as its predecessor it is filled with a truly innovative tale about searching for lost love. Yuan leaves Besaid Island along with Rikku and newcomer Paine to join the Gull wings in search of Spheres. Although it takes some time (depending on how many side missions you do before hitting the hotspots in the mission menu) to understand why. Essentially, you learn that Yuna received a sphere that contained images of a man who bears more than a strong resemblance to Tidus. It seems that she is searching for that man, while having to sort out the political unrest of Spira while the new religious sects of New Yevon and the Youth League go at it. Its a very good story, but does not reach the levels of greatness that was achieved by numerous entries in the Final Fantasy story. Never the less kudos to Square-Enix for finally taking some favorites and doing more with them. FF VII-2 and FF VIII-2 would be great. (Of course so would ground up remakes in the fashion of Resident Evil and Metal Gear Solid would be nice too.)The game play in this game is where the title really excels. Fast, on your toes, quick thinking. The enemies do not wait, and your characters often attack simultaneously, or one right after another which makes for some really neat combinations and chains. One flaw however is the long animations as the girls change costumes... like the summons of FF VIII they're long winded, and as far as I can tell cannot be skipped. Square needs to implement a policy that in battle animations like that should be skipable, but not go too far like the did in FF IX where you seldom saw the animations because the computer cut them short most of the time. I'd like the option to watch the animations at my whim. There are occasions where I'm in the mood for it, and others when I'm not.Graphically this game is a mixed bag. Yuna, Rikku, and Pain look absolutely amazing, as does Nooj, and some of the few other main characters. However, the majority of the characters (residents, and secondary, and tertiary characters) look simply horrible by today's standards, featuring low poly-counts, and low texture quality... basically looking like N64 characters. With PS2 kicking out incredible graphics as seen in Resident Evil Outbreak, and Silent Hill 3 this is disappointing.Sound effects and voice acting are only so-so as well, but the game does retain most of the original voice actors. Over all though the reason to play this game is for the incredibly fast paced game play, which brings a new revolutionary twist to the FF series in much the same way that FF X did.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2004"}

He assumes that everyone has a general idea of what the game is about and how it's played so you'll only get  his views on the game.___________________________________Little big Planet is a great game made by creative people that think outside the box.The game is about getting your little sack person through levels and getting as many items and look as best as you can on your way to the ending by dressing it up and by collecting items. There's always something new if you explore and the more stuff you visit the more staff you can use to build your own level and put stickers on things.Story mode is an ok part of the game, the levels are very creative and the graphics are some of the best I have seen. The puzzles are always changing with many fun things you could do to solve them. Story mode overall can keep you entertained until you finish it.The two-player mode was a good idea at first but soon it got really competitive and started to mess other people up. The 2 player puzzles were a good idea but if either one of the players got greedy then it would take both of them a while to complete it. If there were two screens then it would be a lot easier and then the players could go as far away from each other as possible and not mess each other up.Multi-player mode is a lot better than the two-player mode because the people that play are not usually competitive and they want you to be their friend. Also when you are in two-player mode you can follow the hosts around and even look at their unfinished levels before they are published into the game. If they are more experienced than you then they can give you plenty of tips on story mode and in building mode. If you are the more experienced one then you have a chance to feel like the professional and teach them many things that they didn't know yet. Overall the multi player mode was a great touch to the game.I would recommend this game to children with creative minds but it can be played by people of all ages.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2008"}

{"product_name":"B002I0F5M8","description":"","reviewerName":"Leohlyon","summary":"Can't quite put my finger on it.","reviewText":"Honestly, I HAD to buy Batman Arkham City. After playing Arkham Asylum, I really had no choice. It's something really special about both of these Batman games, I just can't quite put my finger on it.  There are things about this game that I let `slide'. If these problems occurred in other games, I would deduct a star without any hesitation. But like I said, something about this game is special, just can't put my finger on it.The fighting mechanics and such are pretty much the same as the first installment of this series. You can perform awesome combos as usual, and you'll see most of the same weaponry. With that being said, there are a few new additions, with one of those additions becoming my favorite weapon to use! I'll start with my favorite, the gun that Mr. Freeze gives you (if you've ever read any of my reviews you'll know that I never know the official names of any weapons. Not that I don't care about the names, but in actuality, I just don't care...) This gun freezes enemies on contact and once I obtained it, it was the only thing I used! Another new weapon is this device that temporarily electrocutes or shocks enemies. I'll admit, it was cool, but not as cool as the Mr. Freeze gun (no pun intended). The smoke grenade is also a newbie to Batman's arsenal and helped when he was in a jam, and needed to escape. But I didn't have a need for it, when I was in a tight spot, I just froze everyone, but that's just me. There may be one or two more new weapons/devices, but if I can't remember them, they're not worth mentioning anyway.The bad guys are just about identical to AA. Usually, if I encounter the same bad guys over and over, that becomes a problem for me and I'll consequently deduct a star from the overall rating. In this case, I was ok with it, each fight felt fresh and `new', I have no idea why. Some of the bad guys are armed, others were not. I did have a tougher time beating the enemies in this game than I did in AA, and that's a good thing. The boss battles were just ok to me. There was one epic battle in my opinion. I don't want to spoil anything for those of you who have not played it yet, so I'll just say it involves a little hide n seek. As far as boss battle difficulty goes, the battles were of moderate difficulty, just about what I'd expect from a game of this caliber.If you start to get tired of the main mission, you will find plenty of other distractions to keep you busy. One of the aforementioned distractions is playing as Catwoman. At certain points throughout the game, you'll get a chance to play as her as she works through her own storyline. She plays differently than Batman, and it's quite the change of pace. For me, her fights were a bit more challenging because I couldn't use Batman's trusty Mr. Freeze gun, oops there I go talking about that gun again. Also, you'll have your choice of side-missions to complete. They'll come in all shapes and sizes. Some will be annoying, while others will be quite the adventure. Or, if you need a break from the main story, you can just free roam and go sight seeing. I'll openly admit that the free roam aspect was a bit overwhelming at first because there's so much to get into. Once you get used to the city it will be fine, unlike games called *COUGHS assassin creed brotherhood COUGHS* My apologies, that's what happens when you eat and type at the same time.....Overall, this was a fantastic game. But as always, I'll have to find something to gripe about. My only issues were the silly weapon wheel and some of the side-missions. I wish weapons were easier to select, although you can quickfire many of them. I had the hardest of times selecting the Mr. Freeze gun, it was in a weird location on the wheel. Dangit, I mentioned the Mr. Freeze gun again. Some of the side-missions confused me because I had to set off certain `triggers' in order to complete the missions. For example, side-mission `A' appears on my map, yippee! I complete what I need to complete, but then A.2 appears, and I have no idea what to do, so I turn to youtube and Amazon reviewer extraordinaire D.G.M., only to find out I have to walk past a certain area on the map in order for the needed `evidence' to materialize. Sighs... Since side-missions are not required, I don't think it's a big deal. If you've played Batman AA, and liked it, chances are that you'll love Arkham City! It's everything that was great about the first game, with some very welcomed additions. Something about this game is truly special, just can't quite put my finger on it. Happy gaming all.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2012"}

It has everything you'd expect from Sony technology along with a lot more bang for your buck. I bought the Kinect day 1 and it was one of the biggest disappointments I've ever had. So I decided to try Playstation's motion controller and boy was I not disappointed! It the most responsive of the three (Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo) by a landslide. It's also the most accurate and features the least lag of the three. It works great for casual games (ie Sports Champions) and it greatly enhances shooters (ie Killzone 3). Overall, if you buy this, you will not be disappointed. It's the most impressive of the three motion controllers on the market, and by far the one with the most promising future. I look forward to playing future titles for the platform, but for now I play mostly Killzone 3 since it's an amazing game and the first true AAA title to include Move support (keep in mind there are no \"killer apps\" out yet on the Kinect... just sayin).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005B8G1","description":"The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

Thief has a classic style game play which is lost in many new games these days. This classic style is what us gamers asked for, and they pulled it off perfectly. It is just like the original Thief game in so many ways. They really took their time and made this as faithful to the original series as possible. With that being said, so much has changed over the past 15 years in the gaming world that I feel Thief has let us down a little as we have experience so much more in games.Pros:+ Decent Graphics. Went more for style than intense detail.+ The sounds are perfect! From little noises in you surrounds to eavesdropping on the sometimes hilarious conversations of the guards.+ There is so much to do as you progress through the game. Many side missions and side objectives in main story missions. The areas are large, and there is much to explore.+ The ability to save at anytime is a nice feature. Auto-saves are fairly often as well.+ Perfect Thief Environment and Dialog. Really brought back memories of the original Thief.+ There is a lot of re-playability. Between going back for items you didn't have the gadget for the first time around, to simply realizing you missed some loot when you thought you got it all. Also replaying a level a different way, maybe more stealthy.+ The AI is basic, yet very good. If a guard hears you or you cause a distraction, he'll change his usual walking pattern which makes getting around him more difficult.+ While the maps and missions are linear, there are many little secret places where you can find additional loot. You can take your time and search.+ The story is good, but takes a while to spike your interest. The further you get in the game the more interesting it gets.+ Aside from the 8 main story missions, there are 25 or so side missions, plus other missions as you meet/find new characters. Doing them will all greatly extend your play time.Cons:- Weird interruptions to load or have a video. Too many times where the control is taken away from the player. I want to play a game, not watch the game play out a scene for me.- There are too many times where you open a door or window or drop down and are then locked out of where you just came from. Yes they want you to progress further in the level, however this is frustrating if you are trying to get all the loot or complete the extra level objectives.- The game is quite linear. There are ways to approach enemies to kill or simply try and sneak by them, however there is only one way to get to where you need to go. I expected more adventuring and open world capabilities.- Sometimes it feels it's unavoidable to have to take a guard out. I want to be able to go through the game and not be noticed and not kill or knock out anyone, which is a trophy, but it's not always easy.- The story lacks at times making the game play a little slow and lifeless.- Sometimes platforming is frustrating as you can only climb and drop at particular times in particular places. Also basic control mechanics is a little wonky.- I hit a major glitch where a rope was not where it needed to be and I didn't have any rope arrows on me and none were available in my area, and I could not complete the mission. I had to revert back to the city (which is an option when you are in missions) and almost 3 hours of progress was lost. When I played it again the rope had loaded, which is very frustrating. Others have claimed the same glitch on multiple consoles. The game also locked up and shutdown (the game, not the PS4). Also I once got stuck in a wall and I saw a guard get stuck in a wall and start twitching until I got closer, then he killed me.- The map is very limited, by not utilizing symbols or a legend. It does not show starting points of the missions or where other areas open up. Very frustrating and the use of the internet to find what you're looking for is a must.Over-all this is a great game for classic gamers who played the original Thief games on the PC. If you liked the original games you'll love this because it is the same simple style. New comers will be thirsty for more and something more spectacular, especially on a new next-gen console. Those gamers new to Thief will probably get bored easily. Thief is a game where you need to be patient and take your time, something most kids these days don't have. Though there are times where the game seems to be holding back from how amazing it could be, it still is a solid game with an enjoyable game play experience. You can complete the game in under 15 hours or so, depending on the style in which you play and if you do any side missions. I took my time, did all side missions playing some twice to get all loot or thief challenges and ranked in just under 45 hours. My second play through I picked up no loot, didn't kill or knock-out anyone and simply ran through each level to complete the game on Master difficulty. It took me about 6 hours. Over-all, as I have already played through it twice and have 94% of the trophies, I won't be in a rush to play through it again. Maybe one day.I would have liked to see a little more creativity used in some spots throughout the story, however it is a very enjoyable game. Those on the fence may want to wait for the price to drop a little so they won't be disappointed, however faithful fans of the series should not hesitate. I must say, due to all the secrets and hidden loot, this is one of the few games where a walkthrough book may be useful.Highly Recommended!PSN: adrielaugust","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2014"}

{"product_name":"B0050SWVIQ","description":"","reviewerName":"P","summary":"A game that tries to hard to be something its not.","reviewText":"First off let me say that dead space 3 was a good game that I enjoyed for the most part, however I feel like it was a step backwards in the series and I will try my best to explain it in my review. Also beware of a few spoilers.First off I would like to talk about the things that I liked. I think they really did a good job on the graphics both in space and on the planet.  It really looked and felt like I was on a space ship floating in space as well as an ice cold planet with the wind blowing snow around. Each building was very detailed and looked amazing. The buildings actually looked to be old with rusted and decay in some places. I thought the work beach was a pretty good addition to the series for the customization but to me it was a double edge sword which I will explain later. I loved making new weapons and trying them out to see what works best and what didn&#8217;t. I thought that they did a good job on the new necromorphs with them being faster and stronger and some even sneaking up being you every now and then for a surprise attack. It was great to finally be able to have the option to explore for side missions. I loved running around looking for these missions for extra parts as well as learning what happened on the planet 200 years prior.Now with a heavy heart I will list the things that I didn&#8217;t like about this game.First off let me start with the bench. I thought it was a great addition to the series but took something away from it as well.  With two weapons in one it made fighting necromorphs way too easy.  Besides the ones that snuck up behind me I hardly ever got hit at all since I had a weapon that could blow them back as well as killing them with an up close shot. Because of this is I believed the developers added more enemies in the game. I found myself fighting wave after wave after wave of enemies in some areas which really got annoying. I do understand why they did this though because what is the point of having this new shinny gun that is tricked out only to have it sit and collect dust throughout the game. But from my point of view it was a step back due to it killing the horror and survival elements in the game and only focusing on the action instead.Some of the new features and uniologists I found more of a joke than anything else. I thought the new duck and roll abilities would be more like gears of war but they are not even close. The cover system is more of a hindrance than anything because you can still be shot even in cover. The roll was really no use to me since I couldn&#8217;t roll very far and would still get hit even when I used it. I understand why there had to be unitologists in this one but they could have made them somewhat more of a threat. One head shot or blast would always kill them off. For some of the side missions they used recycled areas liked they did for dragon age 2 which was just as bad for reusing areas.Next I am going to talk about one of the things that pissed me off the most and that was the save system. Honestly I have no clue why they would want to change it but they did and I believe it was for the worse. The game now saves automatically instead of at a save station like in the last two games.  There were a few instances where I had to restart an entire chapter due to back tracking for an optional quest and when returning I would be locked out of the room I needed to catch a shuttle to complete the chapter. An example is in chapter 5 the side mission called &#8220;Conning Tower&#8221; I had just finished it up when I realized I didn&#8217;t complete a previous mission &#8220;C.M.S Greely&#8221; so I decide to back track so that I could complete the mission and collect some extra parts. After I had completed the side mission I returned to the ship I needed to go through in order to progress in the game and for some reason the door I need to go into was now shut down and locked. I tried everything I could to try and find a way through it but couldn&#8217;t find a way. So I decided to reload the last checkpoint in hopes that it would allow me to go through. Well the check point took me all the way to the start of the chapter so I had to freaking do everything all over again.  I just sat there with my jaw dropped because if I had a saved game I could have easily just reloaded to a point in time right after I finished the previous side mission and save myself the hassle of doing everything all over again.Finally I want to talk about the characters and storyline. The storyline has never really been a strong point in the dead space series however I felt that this one was the worst and confusing of all of them.  First off I can&#8217;t believe what they did to ellie. In the last dead space she was a feisty tough female who kicked ass. I remember  the first time I saw her in dead space 2 where she had locked herself behind a security gate and was blasting any and every necromorph she saw while yelling &#8220;You want me, come and get me you bas#$%*!&#8221; She also got her eye pulled out with a screwdriver and STILL went after stross beating him with a metal rod. In dead space 3 they took everything that made her great and turned her into some kind of damsel in distress the entire time. Not once did I ever see her firing off a shot or even trying to make any kind of stand against the necromorphs or unitologists. She was also completely useless in this one where in the second game she was a lot more helpful with advice and her personality.  The whole love triangle between her, issac and Norton was absolutely ridiculous and I felt it took away from the game as a whole. Nortons whole jealousy fit as well as having them fight over her just seemed to be more out of some romance novel then a horror game.I was really looking forward to the new characters that they were adding to this game but that also turned out to be a disappointment. I thought by adding more characters to the game it would be a great experience to see issac  interact with them and see how they would aid him in his mission to stop the markers.  I am going to start with carver. I couldn&#8217;t tell if the developers wanted you to like him or hate him in the game. He was suppose to be this tough hardcore solider who only cared about the mission and no one else.  Throughout the game he showed this hardcore mentality by the way he talks to issac and even at one point in the game where he sends another character to their death.  But at the end of the game he has transformed into this compassionate person who all of a sudden cares more of the lives of his team mates than the mission. I just could not figure him out at all which is why I can&#8217;t say if I liked him or hated him.Out of all the new characters the only one I actually though I could like was buckell since he seemed older and wiser than the rest of the crew. He was one of the only ones who seemed like they respected issac for what he has been through and actually had helpful advice in his mission to find and repair a ship. But I really felt they cheapened his character with the way he was killed off. The whole time in space they are suppose to be this team trying to survive and make it through but all of a sudden they just leave him on the planet to freeze to death alone? No one bother to start up the machine that was right next to him to provide heat to save him? By doing that it made no sense whatsoever and completely ruined him as a character. As for the other new additions I just couldn&#8217;t feel any attachment to them at all. They all just seemed like throw away characters that in the end were all easily forgotten.Sorry for the book long review, I really tried to keep it short but I guess I had a lot of things I had to say about the game. All in all I thing dead space 3 was a fun game at times but because of some of the new features and characters in it the game seemed to suffer more because of it instead of being better for it.Awaking DLC: 4/5 starsFirst off I would like to say why didn&#8217;t the developers make more of dead space 3 like this dlc? I thought the atmosphere of this dlc was amazing and fit the whole dead space universe than the entire play through of the main storyline.  It had everything that made the previous dead spaces great like the hallucinations attacks as well as feeling like you were desperately trying to escape the planet and make your way back to earth. The necromorphs and new unitolgogists both popped out at all of the right places to give me abit of jump. However I feel like for $10 this dlc was way too short and didn&#8217;t add too much to the storyline. If you are going to buy this I would say wait until the price lowers because it only took me a little over an hour to beat it and the way it left you another cliff hanger of an ending only made it worse.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0056WJA6M","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Cooper","summary":"A Completionist Review: For Better and Worse  - But Mostly Better","reviewText":"FOR BETTER:---------------Darksiders 2 is an impressive follow up to THQ and Vigil's apocaplyptic journey.  Even if you never played the original, don't have any reservations about picking up the sequel. Death is an extraordinary character: well-acted, well-animated, enigmatic and engaging.In this installment we take on the guise of War's brother Death, one of the four horsemen, who has undertaken a quest to absolve his brother from the punishment of the Charred Council for destroying humanity.  Realizing that his brother had been framed, Death vows to do whatever is necessary to restore the balance between angels and demons.Like its predecessor, Darksiders 2 does an EXTRAORDINARY job of pulling concepts from other licenses and making them feel original within a common theme (the battle between Heaven and Hell at the End of Days). This time around the primary draw is Ubisoft's 2008 Prince of Persia.  Death will perform wall runs, extended climbs and other free-running tactics that are visually identical to the unnamed Prince. Yet despite references to other genres and titles (Portal, Shadows of the Damned, Legend of Zelda, God of War, Devil May Cry, etc.) Darksiders 2 manages to move beyond the driving concepts to deliver a wholly unique experience.  From background art, puzzle implementation and narrative framework - Darksiders 2 manages to mold its own identity by successfully working RPG elements into a visually striking hack-and-slash world.This time around Death can choose between his primary weapon (scythes) set to the [] button, and a secondary weapon (armblades, gauntlets, hammers, axes, glaives, and claws) which is set to the /\\ button.  Attack combinations can be purchased by trainers, and are easy to execute during battle.  Although most sequences are little more than a mix of both buttons with pauses between inputs, the simple commands belie Death's flashy and intense moveset.  There are an extraordinary number of different weapons to find, each with their own perks (damage types, stat bonuses, exp. increases etc.) that can radically change your playing style.  In addition, these weapons are found based upon your character's current level and come in increasing rarity: white - common, green - uncommon, blue - rare, purple - unique, and gold - legendary.  The most interesting addition are \"possessed weapons\" which can be upgraded by \"feeding\" other items to them.  These weapons can be enhanced a set number of times before reaching their maximum potential by taking on the attributes of the weapons and armor that are fed to them.  With each new progression you have the option to choose a perk that will subsequently improve with further item leveling.  In most cases a fully upgraded possessed weapon will be better than a similar level unique or rare one.  In all cases combat is visceral, fast paced and exciting.Armor is likewise found in differing rarities, although there are no legendary or possessed pieces of armor.  Based upon the attributes you use with your playing style, your version of Death may greatly vary from your friend's.  Both weapons and armor can also drastically improve the effectiveness of skills chosen from the Harbinger and Necromancer skill trees.  Although the diversity is not as great as in a game like Dragon Age - it is still enough to keep your character evolving throughout the duration of your playthrough.  The best part is that the demon merchant Vulgrim can respec your character for a very low fee, so you can try any other skill combinations at your leisure.FOR WORSE:--------------Despite all of my praises, Darksiders 2 is not without faults.  It pains me to list them, because I TRULY LOVE the direction of the game.  The real problem that keeps it from becoming a masterpiece is overambition and not enough time to see it through.  Darksiders 2 makes multiple trade-offs from the original and unfortunately not always for the better.Graphically the sequel takes a hit in texturing and even character modeling.  Things are not quite as smooth as the first time around, and you will notice some \"near-polygonal\" edges on some of the characters.  When swimming or in confined areas walls look bland and occasionally dip to PS2 quality.  Fortunately this is not the norm, and most vistas are gorgeous and stunning.  Despite some pixellation when viewing further draw distances, the artistic design and bold coloration of the sequel TRULY save the day.When I first started playing Darksiders 2 I was blown away by the sweeping orchestral movement and striking vista of a foreboding icy fortress.  In retrospect, I feel this cathartic moment at the game's onset might have set the bar a little \"too\" high for the rest of the game. After 35 hours, I can safely say that both the narrative and bosses take a back-seat to those in Darksiders 1. All too often the story is revealed via comic book style cutscenes, rather than full out CGI. There are also not very many moments that ramp up emotionally or deliver sweeping orchestral keynotes like the first game. Although there is an attempt to tie in to War's tale, Death's episodic journey also seems to be much more flash and less substance.  He has relatively clear motivations for why he is going somewhere, but the enemies and challenges he faces are more often typical RPG fare than the \"ultimate battles\" faced by his brother. Prepare for a lot of fetch quests set between largely open areas (Unlimited quick travel saves the day!). There are also more dungeons, but less differentiation between areas in a similar zone.  Dungeons are also MUCH smaller, and require less coordination or logic when choosing between various tools.  In addition, because of the revamped combat system the enemies and bosses are more like those found in God of War/Devil May Cry than Legend of Zelda.  These are no longer \"puzzle bosses,\" but more hack-and-slash.Yet most of these issues are a matter of creative opinion, if not the results of time constraints.  The real commonplace issues are the small bugs and technical flaws you will find along the way.  I had to hard restart my PS3 8 times while playing Darksiders 2. Several of these were due to complete freezes during combat or platforming, but even worse were the several \"almost\" game-breaking glitches.  Thank God the developers had the intelligence to insert fail-safes when a save was reloaded from initial start-up.1.)I had a NPC who was supposed to carry a heartstone for me get stuck on a door, and I could not get him to pick it up until I restarted the system.  Thankfully it reset the heartstone to a point where I only had to complete a small portion of the dungeon, and the character did not get stuck again.2.)I had the audio completely cut out when speaking to the Lord of Bone.  I had to do a hard restart and erase my dungeon waypoints to get it to trigger properly.3.)I completed several Forge Land dungeons later in the game and was not able to recover a special item required for an earlier quest.4.)A contextual button that was supposed to appear and allow me to place a lantern on a statue would not trigger.  This was the first time said puzzle was used.  Thankfully, I understood the level design and realized that something was supposed to happen here.  The button prompt allowing me to progress through the dungeon only appeared after shutting down and restarting the PS3.5.)One of the primary bosses known as \"the Wailing Host\" froze mid-strike for about 20 seconds with its health bar half depleted.  During this time Death was still able to circle around the battle arena and attack as normal (further reducing the boss's health bar).  However, the boss became invincible after the temporary freeze and would not die when its health reached zero.  This is because the battle is actually punctuated by several button prompt actions that were not triggered after the glitch.  This was the only major glitch that inexplicably resolved itself without having to fully restart the PS3, BUT I had to restart the boss battle from a checkpoint three times before it was fixed.NO GAME MANUAL:----------------------THQ also decided to cut down on cost by NOT including a physical game manual.  They didn't even include an in-game manual like the one in Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning.  Instead, they give you a web address for finding the contents online. This wouldn't be a terrible problem, but many of the finer details regarding collectables, locating/setting quests, and the HUD are not directly explained.  Be prepared to do a few internet searches before fully understanding the game.TIL DEATH DO US PART (Summary):------------------------------------I wish Darksiders 2 had more CGI, better music, a more focused narrative and more/bigger boss battles.  Yet when all is said and done it is still an EXCELLENT addition to the franchise.  I feel that the pressure to release the game by mid-August after an initial delay hampered the artistic and technical design of the game.  THQ's president even released a statement saying two things:1.)The game had to release this summer because he felt it could not compete with games like Assassin's Creed 3 and Call of Duty.  Obviously this drove the decision to cut out the more difficult to develop aspects like full CGI.2.)If Darksiders 2 fails to perform up to sales expectations, he will reallocate all of Vigil's staff to other games, effectively ending the series before it really had a chance to take off.So, Death's journey may not be a perfect one.  It might not even be quite as good as his brother's before him.  HOWEVER, it is still a journey worth taking in every sense.  Breathtaking landscapes, multitudes of loot, New Game +, hundreds of collectables, memorable characters and stellar voice acting await.If you have any interest whatsoever in the material or genres that Darksiders 2 represents - do yourself a favor and purchase both Darksiders 1 and 2.  Keep the series alive and give Vigil the chance to craft a truly epic game in Darksiders 3.  I spent 35 hours trying to find out what happens next, and I feel Vigil deserves the chance to tell me.THQ, Let's see this war through to the end!(8.5/10)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2012"}

Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"If you are not adversed to old school rpg antics this is a reliable purchase or rental!","reviewText":"I made sure I played this game thouroughly before I did this review. With RPGs a gamer has to at least invest 10-15 hours into it before they can grasp the overall merits and flaws of the game. First let me say if you judge fantasy role-playing games solely by flashy graphics and a real time in-your-face combat engine this may not be the game you are looking for. Once again you'll be treated to random battles and a turn based battle system. Furthermore to add to your angst this is a whimsical 3D cel shaded anime styled world with designs done by none other than the same artist responsible for Dragon Ball.To be frank these things would normally make me disdain an RPG. I've long said I'm not a fan of stereotypcal cutesy cliches or tired old plots of kingdoms in peril and \"the hero\" running off to save the world. Yet despite my inner rpg scrooge this game made me smile. It was subtle at first and I tried glowering through each humorous wacked out boss monster and each predictable plot twist and yet regardless my reservations I couldn't put my controller down. It was the strangest thing in gaming I ever experienced.The point is like a 2D fighter Dragon Quest 8 is not trying to revolutionize its genre when it comes to mind blowing meta physics, fights in real time, or a dystopian dark reality filled with seedy adult themes. Rather it appeals to the crowd that can appreciate when RPGs had an innocence about them. That golden age when characters were all lovable, believable, and didn't try to be metrosexaul pretty boys with angst problems or girls decked out in lingerie and black lip stick trying to look like hot topic vampires.To start you of you are the silent protagonist. An evil Jester wizard enveloped your home town in thorns, killed all your friends, turned the king into a pitiful monster, and turned the princess into a horse. Being an all around nice guy you set off to free the King and daughter from their cuse and stop the evil Dhoulmagus.Along the way a ruffian bandit Yangus tries to accquire your purse of coin but in a turn of events he is left hanging from a thread and you save him. He swears his undying loyalty to you and off you go!You'll also be joined by the spirited aristocratic sorceress Jessica who is having family troubles and the charismatic Templar Angelo that is into gambling and women despite constant reprimands from the holy order he serves.I say all this because it is unveiled quickly. I'm not giving you spoilers because the truth of it is the plot is straight forward, at least in the very beginning.As you would suspect every character has their own skill sets to raise. Some of these are common such as boosting different weapon proficencies but some have a humorous or social slant to them like Yangus's humanity and Jessica's upgradable sex appeal.To add to the nostalgic cheese the enemies are usaully wacked out, creatively portrayed, and often enough can make you split your sides with laughter. Their are dancing devils that give you the urge to gyrate around like a disco super star. There are fuzzy one eyed little beasties in a boot that slow your agility. There are bunicorns (a mix of rabbits and unicorns) and even those adorable non intimidating looking blue slimes. If you are a Dragon Quest veteran you'll definetly recognize your favorite monsters from the franchise.To top this all off King Trode eventually reveals his alchemy pot. You can mix rare components in it to create rare weapons and armor. Found recipes in towns tell you what you need so at least it is not an aimless goose chase most of the time. The Alchemy system in this game is simplistic. If you were overwhelmed by Star Ocean 3's unnecessarilly complicated creation system you will be delightfully content with this one by comparison.Despite the games deliberate simplicity do not expect it to be lacking challenge especially if you go into battles unprepared. This was a first time an earliar  boss handed my rear to me due to my flawed over confidence. You need to go into scraps with good equipment and alot of healing herbs. Furthermore you need to plan your strategies carefully.Besides that the voice acting is wonderful, the orchestral tracks in the game are beautiful, and there are alot of side quests and places to explore off the beaten path.In conclusion if you are completly smitten by dark edgy RPGS or those that are live action you might want to pass on Dragon Quest 8. However if you an RPG fan tired of doom and gloom who would like to have your inner child emerge again definetly pick up this gem! You can now get it for around $20.00 and I assure you it is worth every penny.Pros+ Sprawling 100% explorable landscapes. If you can see it you can go there!+ Characters are cliche but in a quirky lovable way that endears you to them immediatly.+ A hidden series of boss trials and another ending will keep  you curious long after you have beaten it the first time.+ Despites its simple menus and battling sequences the game is challenging and encourages you to be smart.+ Random modes of transportation make even the toughest of trials alot more easy on you.+ The game prides itself on substance as opposed to image. Trust me it is easy to drop 100+ hours into Dragon Quest 8 without having seen every secret it has to offer.Cons- For those obcessed with originality and the cutting edge Dragon Quest 8 will look like a horse that has been beaten many times.- The turn based battles are a bit too generic and with the exclusion of the better  3D cel shaded graphics this really is like playing any other outdated Dragon quest game.- At some points you are forced to level grind._ The story while very charming is still very predictable for the most part.- You can only save if a priest is present. That is however a minor gripe considering certain spells and items can teleport you to towns very quickly and mostly whisk you back close to where you left off.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2008"}

Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"Excellent","reviewText":"The dead have risen and the world has been thrown into ruin. A band of survivors gathers together to try to escape the chaos, but find that their greatest enemy may not be the walking dead, but themselves.Much has been written about Telltale's computer game adaptation of Robert Kirkman's The Walking Dead comic series, usually involving such words as 'amazing', 'intense', 'emotional' and 'cried like a three-year-old'. They are not far off. With The Walking Dead, Telltale have achieved what may be the finest computer game adaptation of a pre-existing franchise in gaming's history, something that supports the original story whilst also standing completely on its own two feet.The Walking Dead takes place in the same world as the comics (but not the TV series, which is an alternate reality) and is canon to them. The developers - working alongside Kirkman - take advantage of this to show off the backstory of comic characters Hershel and Glen, but for the most part the focus is firmly on the original characters created for the game. Chief amongst these is the player-controlled protagonist, Lee Everett. Lee is a criminal who was on his way to prison when the zombie apocalypse broke out, and some of the game's tension comes from whether he is honest or not about his background to his new-found friends.The core relationship of the game is between Lee and eight-year-old Clementine, a young girl he rescues from a zombie attack on a house. A long-term goal of the game is to reunite Clementine with her parents (if they are still alive) in Savannah, Georgia, but as the game continues Lee becomes convinced that the chances of her parents still being alive are very slim and takes on a father-figure role himself. The relationship is well-portrayed by the writers and actors, with the apparent oddness of an unrelated non-parent (who is also a convicted felon) caring for a young girl he just met being addressed. The characterisation is extremely strong, though to so more of it may risk spoilers (a problem for any review of the game).The game has echoes of events from other incarnations of The Walking Dead, such as whether it's a good idea to teach young children how to use firearms against zombies or not, but Telltale puts their fresh spin on each idea as it comes up. Particularly well-handled is the way that the same major worldbuilding bits of information from the graphic novels are discovered by this group of characters, but in a rather different manner to the comics. For example, the knowledge that everyone will become a zombie when they die (regardless of whether they are bitten or not) - a major revelation in the comics and TV series - comes up almost immediately in the game, whilst a more minor piece of info about the zombies that the comic series threw in almost immediately takes a long time to come up in the game, and is much more decisive (and horrible).The Walking Dead's storyline is impressive, with the zombies acting as a catalyst for how the characters interact with one another and deal with the pressure of a crumbling civilisation. The game hits many of the same beats as the TV series and the comics, but in a much more immersive way due to the way your decisions have lasting consequences, and some events can be changed. The dialogue is well-written, with each of the five episodes having its own self-contained plot and thematic arc as well as contributing to the overall storyline of the game. Given the lack of time (even at 15 hours, there a lot of characters to get through), Telltale achieve an impressive amount of depth for each character in the game as well. In terms of writing, structure and pacing, The Walking Dead is excellent.Where the game comes off the rails a bit is the gameplay. Simply put, you spend the majority of your time watching The Walking Dead, rather than playing it, and most of your controls are based around choosing dialogue options. The sections where you get to take control of Lee, talk to other characters at leisure, explore areas and solve puzzles are the most fun in the game, but also the rarest (roughly boiling down to one or two such sections per episode). There's also a significant number of irritating Quick Time Events as well. It's a tribute to the writing skills of the team behind the game that these issues are not the total game-killers they'd be in other titles, but it does make The Walking Dead less of a game and more of an interactive comic (though still a very good interactive comic).More problematic is the fact that the game is sold as one where your choices matter, but the truth of that is up for debate. At one stage you choose to save one character or another and this leads to some different character scenes and dialogue for a while, but ultimately has no long-term ramifications. The major beats of the plot and most character deaths also happen regardless of your dialogue and choices, with what you do more impacting on other characters' reactions to you and what they do rather than anything substantive in the storyline. Oddly this doesn't seem to matter: moreso than in most games, it's the journey that matters much more than the resolution.The Walking Dead (****) is an intense, well-written and extremely atmospheric adventure game, but one where you do not have as much control over what is going on as what is promised or written. How much of an issue this is will be up to the player, but I found it easily ignored in favour of the smart writing and the fascinating character relationships. The Walking Dead: Season 1 is available now on PC, X-Box 360 (UK, USA), PlayStation 3 (UK, USA) and iPad/iPhone. A second 'season' will be released later in 2013.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2013"}

I was looking forward to another cool action/platforming adventure. But that was NOT what I got.From the very beginning, the lighthearted, madcap-cartoon tone of the first game is lost. Instead, characters are constantly angry, scowling, and generally put you in a bad mood. I hated Jak's new personality. I would rather him be a \"mute\" than this \"angry young man\" type.In the first game, once you entered an environment, you could wander freely, grabbing Power Cells in any order that you wanted to. Not so in Jak II. Instead, you are given \"missions\". Now, mission-based gameplay is a pet peeve of mine, since I'm used to games where you figure out your objective on your own, so it may not bother people who are used to this type of thing. It does, however, make ME angry.If the missions themselves were good, this wouldn't matter, but they're not. They're lame and repetitive to a fault. Shoot this...shoot that...beat this time...what happened to the creative objectives of the first Jak and Daxter?The most grevious issue to me, however, is the controls. In the previous game, the simple platforming and combat let me concentrate freely on my goals. Here, you must use unwieldy guns and vehicles. What is this, Grand Theft Auto? With the vehicles, I was constantly crashing into things. Then the guards would come after me and shoot at me (yet another GTA copy). With the guns, targeting was terribly slow and clunky. I found it easier to just rush the enemy and punch it, which kind of took away the strategy.I was just so disappointed with this game. After the fun I had with Jak and Daxter, I thought I would have another great series to play. Sadly, I was wrong.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2005"}

Ever since I got it to install, I have played this almost every day I've had it up.Game:I am playing the single player campaign and am the Hunter (Mordecai). I like that he has the bird. You can send the bird out to do damage and make enemies drop more items. It's sort-of like casting a spell.At first I was not happy to not have a developer console on a PC game but hey, it's not a hard game (as a sniper). Plus, once you get a vehicle, don't try to shoot everyone. Just roll over them.You'll die but not only can you save at outposts, it usually autosaves before big fights. Yay for someone getting \"saves\" right for once.When I first installed it, the video specs were auto-lowered and I was thinking these were the worst graphics I've ever seen but I pressed (ALT+TAB) then told my Radeon 5550 video card to use the highest/best details and then (ALT+TAB) back into the game and the game looked great! It didn't effect my frame rates at all. Graphics are sort of cell shaded and cartoony but still similar to other games like fallout but not as good.Negatives:The only real negatives I can say are the constant respawning of the same monsters/creatures and repeatative quests. I guess the respawning allows you to go back and get some exp points but if I have to go find gun parts again, I'm going to shoot the person for sending me. Usually the guns you have are already better than the gun you went hunting for. But..the exp are welcomed.If you've been a gamer for some time, you most likely already have securom on your system. It sucks but if you want to play, you'll do what's needed. I have NEVER had a computer crash or had programs decide to \"not work\" because of securom.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2011"}

BTW, it is a jasper, came with 150W power brick, TEAM: FDOU, mfg 10-23-2008, Lot 0843x (package was picked up by carrier from Phoenix, AZ).This is my first XBOX360 console. I never had one in the past due to the bad reputation it had from the RRoD issue. I did have a PS3 but sold it a few months ago due to financial problems. I was regretting it until now.Now the review:I have to say I'm impressed by the size, looks and feel of the controller (which BTW is wireless). I like it much better than the PS3 controller. Although that was much lighter it didn't provide the same accuracy in FPS games - I can tell the analog sticks really make the difference. One annoying thing though, the controller anaglog sticks start squeaking after playing less than one hour (I bought the Orange Box and Fallout 3).The console didn't come with a HD cable so I bought a component cable to go with my 26\" HDTV.The graphics on this are gorgeous. It's been a while since I played on my PS3 but I can tell the images look crisper on the XBOX360 (might be due to contrast). I didn't experience any hickups while playing the orange box unlike on the PS3 which was unplayable at times (frame rate drops).I also purchased a separate 60GB HDD that came with a 3-month XBOX LIve GOld subscription. From what I can tell, there's no more waiting unlike the PSN which was very very slow. I'm not going to renew the subscription since I rarely have time to play.Now to the bad part:Let me start saying the console is fairly quiet WHEN playing from the HDD (the new update allows you to install games locally), as quiet as my previous 40GB PS3. It does not overheat either. I played three ours both Half life EP2 and Fallout3 and the console was amazingly cool - no slowdowns or hangs).HOWEVER, the console sounds like a vacuum cleaner when playing from the disk. It is very very annoying. I don't know if it scratches disks yet but we will see in time. BTW, I thought it scratched my disk for a second but then I realized that circle who looked as a scratch was present on other disks too (which were unopened at that time)Overall, I like it a lot and don't regret buying it. I don't care about blu-ray anyway, the movies are so expensive so are the games and if it breaks it will cost a fortune to replace/repair. I'm not going to start about the game selection which its huge. I can finally play some oldies like Doom3, Quake4 which are unavailable on the PS3.Now that It's confirmed Amazon has Jaspers you could hunt for one of your own. (God, I was so lucky being able to cancel my order for the 60GB bundle and getting this)I'm not giving it five stars due to the controller squeaking issue and DVD drive noise.Cheers!PS: I'm keeping mine horizontal.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2008"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Too Old for Games \"casualgamer\"","summary":"Good to average FPS with some tense moments","reviewText":"I played the original Fear and never finished it because it got too long and tedious for me because all the NPCs and environments looked the same.  Fear 2 is much better in terms of giving more diversity to the action, but the overall feel of the game is essentially the same for better or worse.  I did finish the game and it was a fun play-through.  I felt myself tense up at certain moments during the game but I wouldn't say it's a scary game. The mech parts of the game really didn't belong at all because you are essentially invincible as you mow people down.  This game is good for one run through only because there just isn't anything amazing to it.  Some games offer memorable moments that you want to replay every now and again because they were just that amazing and fun that you don't mind doing it again and again.

{"product_name":"B000SSPH3E","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher Barrett \"Evil Corgi\"","summary":"A great update of an old classic!","reviewText":"If you remember playing through the first Final Fantasy Tactics on PS1, then you have a fond memory for all the game contained, both good and bad. Remember the text when you went on a mission? &#34;I had a good feeling&#34; &#34;I guess this job was a big success&#34;. Or even shoddy translations in the middle of story battles. &#34;What's a cellar? A cellar is a rat's nest...&#34; Though nothing as horrible as the infamous Zero Wing (Ssome one set up us the bomb! All your base are belong to us!)Despite the translation and total lack of challenge vs the last boss, this was a fantastic game. Worthy of being mentioned among the five best PS1 RPGs and strategy RPGs. So how does this game fare with the PSP release? Well... better in some ways... not really an improvement in others... and just a couple of weird cases where it is not quite up to the PS1 version. I still have my PS1 version of FF Tactics, and have been recently playing it when this appeared for $9.99 on amazon. I figured why not.Improvements include the addition of multiplayer, though I am not a fan of multiplayer in RPGs or Tactical RPGs. But the missions are optional, so not a big loss. Though it would be fun to take these on, sadly you may only do so with another person (boo...). The translation has been massively improved. Also due to ease on censorship in video games (mainly with regards to games like this and Xenogears, where mentions of 'God' were often changed to appease those who might have been offended), the story holds truer to the original. The root of the game remains unchanged though, and that is a good thing. The game is tough. You will probably die. Or like me, restart a few missions because you're pissed one of your characters got 'crystal-ed' and lost forever... But it's a difficult game, especially if you are not regularly engaging in random battles to beef up experience and JP. This wasn't nerfed like the Final Fantasy remake for PSP. Thank goodness!The screen has been expanded, but it works. As other reviews mention, it has a softer look to the background, but I think that may have been intentional. Playing the (original) game on my PS3 on a 56&#34; LCD you really see the pixellated character of the PS1 graphics. Perhaps the programmers for this version wanted a softer look and used the very advanced PSP graphics engine to give a better effect?There are some issues with sound effects, but it's minor. Some were changed, but it's not a big deal, even for someone like me who has played through the original several times.So in my opinion, there is nothing that really detracts from the remake, but nothing really to be overly excited about if you have the original, other than a vastly improved translation and the ability to go portable. There are a couple of new classes, and that is a bit of an addition.Oh, and you can download the original on the PS Network, so you can actually play the original on the PSP, bad translations and all.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2012"}

Webb \"Trajedi\"","summary":"Touch Screen is a nice compliment to I Spy style gameplay","reviewText":"My 7 year old was excited to see an exotic looking adventure title for the DS, he was even more thrilled when we found out that core of the gameplay mimics the ISPY series of books where the reader spots hidden objects in a picture.  What is neat here is you get to poke around the various screens with your stylus and are rewarded with a shimmering sound effect when you poke an item from the randomly generated list each level throws at you.  The gameplay is sharp as it takes away from your score if you are just tapping at the screen blindly.  Also nice is the gameplay timer as optional if you don't want to feel the pressure, as well as a save feature that lets you quit in the middle of the adventure anywhere.  The minigames that follow the poke and seek adventure are basic but oddly addictive, particularly the memory match games.  Each of these games can be unlocked for unlimited freeplay outside of the adventure,(with a little effort).  This game was a sweet find as it feels and plays like a more grown up version of one of my sons fav DS titles CRAYOLA TREASURE HUNT. The excellent artwork/design and solid concept make the stylus controls shine in the decently written main story, and side games.

{"product_name":"B000ZKA0KA","reviewerName":"Sky","summary":"Run & Gun = Run & Die","reviewText":"Socom is a very cool game. I was (and perhaps still am) aCoD4online junky. Now I have some fresh new junk to get addicted to.Why would I need Socom if I already have an online shooter that I'm addicted to? Because Socom is truly different. This is a team tactical shooter and CoD4 is run out into the map and kill as many people as you can shooter.The key to success (for me anyway) in Socom is \"stick together\".You play as either a Commando or a Mercenary. Once in a lobby you can switch teams and during intermissions the game will regularly switch your whole team back and forth from Mercenary to a Commando. You can create about 5 Mercenary profiles and 5 Commando profiles; and you can change the weapon loadouts in game.There are assault rifles, submachine guns, light machine guns, shotties, sniper rifles, and one extra rifle from a group of 5 that are available depending on whether you're in a clan and what clan you're in (Spain, France, Germany, UK or US).All of the rifles and the following gear and stuff are available to everyone; I don't think there's any unlocking or leveling up needed. Your rewards for quality play instead are status, medals & stars.The gear is kind of cool, but I'm pretty sure that the best loadout is the simple one: M67 frag grenades. The missile launchers are effective, but cumbersome. The claymores have to be detonated versus the CoD4 kind that blew up if an enemy walked near it. So for now, I'm sticking to the grenades.One thing to note is that each weapon needs to be equipped. In other words, there's not a dedicated button on the controller to throw a grenade or switch to a launcher. You need to bring your selected secondary weapons up on a display by pressing O. Once a secondary weapon is selected you can switch back and forth between it and a primary weapon by pressing L1 (no, L1 is not your sight button; sight is up on the D pad...and to get off your sight you must press down on the D pad). (You can custom configure the wireless controller to your own liking if you don't like the default or other presets.)The attachments for your weapons are plentiful: scopes, regular and laser sites, silencers, bipod and grenade launchers. Each attachment is not available on every weapon. And be careful, a laser sight will give away your position in night games.Oh yeah, night games...you'll need your nightvision goggles for those. Navigating the maps takes a little getting used to, but as I said earlier, you should be pretty much sticking together with your team...follow them and take a position. That's right...there's some camping to be done here...but be smart: stay in one place too long and you'll be dead faster than you can say WTF!And speaking of dead, I believe that you only get rewards by playing \"ranked\" matches. Friendly fire is on and there is no respawning. There are 4 v 4 matches, 8 v 8 and higher; so when you play Socom, in some matches you'll be atop the leaderboard with 2 kills. I personally have enjoyed the two smaller group matches, but that's a matter of preference.So communicate with your team! Someone on your team is probably familiar with the map. Ask where to go. There's no stupid or noob questions here; the players that I've met got more mad when their team members didn't communicate and use their mics than they did when someone says \"what should we do?\"Speaking of the mic, I bought theStand Aloneedition of Socom, because I have thePlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headsetand it works great. But if you want to take advantage of all of the perks (like on screen volume and stuff) that were in the PS3 2.5 firmware update, then you should probably go with this edition that includes the new official PS3 Headset.This game rocks. Some of the maps according to some of the folks that I've played with are carry-overs from past Socom games. That gives Socom vets a bit of an early advantage. But it won't be long before I'm navigating these maps on point instead of following my team.Buy Socom if you play online.Side note on initial game installation: If your PS3 is set to auto-start discs you might need to disable that the first time you plug in the disc. After you put the game in, you'll see two icons on the XMB for Socom; one installs the game, the other starts it. Install the game first. For some reason even after you run the installer, the game installer icon doesn't disappear; just be sure to start that game with start icon going forward. After the installation I got an error message that said my \"saved data\" was corrupted....so I deleted the Socom saved data from the XMB (NOT the \"game\" data...the \"saved\" data) and the error message disappeared.Another side note: As of this writing, there are major server issues. Load delays. Freezes. Choppy action and more. Slant 6 Games NEEDS to fix these.

The graphics presented on the PS3 version were simply stunning.  Hands down, one of the coolest titles I have seen on PS3 so far, for sure.  That being said, the reason I own a wii is that the controls are innovative and add a new dimension to game play.... this is where SWFU on wii comes in.  Playing this game with the wii's controls is amazing.  Granted, the graphics on the wii console are not on par with other next-gen consoles, so don't expect it to keep up in this arena...but despite that fact, this games graphics are surprisingly well done, and the physics engine is strong as well.  There are stormtroopers and wookies rag-dolling all over the place!  Several reviewers bashed the games graphics, but I was genuinely pleased.  The graphics are, to be honest, on par with a REALLY good PS2 game. I get the impression that, rather than focusing on pushing the system to it's graphical limits, they focused on the overall gameplay experience.  The controls are SO WELL DONE!  I really can't imagine playing through this game with a xbox or ps3 controller... it would be a waste of time and BORING.  If I wanted HD graphics, I would watch the movies!  Using the wii's controls, you really feel like you are in the game.  I know that sounds kinda lame... but the controls make all the difference with this title.  The feeling you get when using the wiimote as your lightsaber and the nunchuck for your force powers/movement... it just works. period.  You are able to chain together some really devastating lightsaber/force attacks, and it just feels natural... grabbing a felucian with the nunchuck, throwing your lightsaber at him with a flick of the wiimote, and then with a downward swing of the nunckuck, slamming him to the ground... it just feels so right.[smile]  Also, I love that the speaker on the wiimote emits that awesome lightsaber sound whenever you swing it.  Nice touch for sure.Some people complained about the camera, but I got used to it quickly, and it worked well.  I would say that this is easily the best star wars game to date.  Lastly, let me mention that the versus mode is really well done.  My only gripe is that there is no CPU player, so this mode is really only available when you have a second human player available.  Me and a friend had a chance to play through it for a few hours yesterday, and we had way more fun than 2 grown men should be able to have playing a video game!  My wife walked in to find me devastating him with a sith lightning attack, only to choke him to death and win the match... needless to say she was not impressed with my darkside prowess [lol].So, please, do yourself a favor.  If you own a wii, buy this game!  You will not regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2008"}

And as demands change, Nintendo has adjusted accordingly. While the tablet controller is the primary interface for the Wii U, there is only one of those and not ideal for every game, plus you'll eventually need more controllers if you want to play multiplayer.The Wii is compatible with both the Wii remote + and the classic controller, and those function in the capacity they are designed for. They were meant to be compatible with original Wii software and in many instances are compatible with Wii U software. So for full compatibility you will want to purchase those first as they offer more functionality across the board.But moving forward onto Wii U software, the pro controller is essentially designed as a more comfortable alternative to both the tablet and classic controller. So my biggest gripe with the Wii U pro controller it's that it's limited in compatibility. With that caveat in mind let's move onto the controller itself.First off if you've used a Xbox 360 controller or Dual Shock 3, you'll most likely already be at least moderately comfortable with the pro controller. It features four face buttons, d-pad, start and select buttons (plus and minus) home button, power button and four shoulder buttons, the bottom 2 being trigger like. It's obvious that the pro controller takes inspiration from its contemporaries but essentially what it's trying to do is accommodate to core gamers who want to play in a traditional way.As far as the feel of the controller it's quite stellar. The D-pad is fantastic, it's just the right size and clicky. It's almost identical to the one on the pro controller, in my opinion, it's not quite as comfortable as the d-pad on the dual shock, but it's a close second. The face buttons are small, but feel good, a little flat, and not too springy. The ABXY layout is tried and true to Nintendo fans, but if you've been playing Xbox the swapped letters may throw you off until you get adjusted to them. The start and select buttons work well, as does the home button (which is recessed to avoid accidentally pressing it). The power button I feel is unnecessary, the home button could easily accommodate that functionality, and even though it too is recessed like the home button it could cause me to accidentally turn of the system. Granted, this has never happened to me, but that doesn't make the power button feel any less excessive. The analog sticks feel fantastic, they are rubberized and feel very sturdy, it's a vast improvement over the cheap feeling sticks on the classic controller. It's nice that they finally added the ability to click them for another use like the 360 controller, and the wide spacing makes them feel perfectly suited for my hands. The shoulder buttons essentially feel like the 360 controller with the L and R buttons feeling a bit wider. The triggers feel great too, but are not analog. I worry this may cause compatibility issues down the road, particularly in racing games (analog gas and braking) or if they decide to implement Gamecube software that needs analog buttons.As I said before the build quality is top notch. Much in the style of the Wii remote, the front is a glossy black or white plastic. And much like the Wii remote, it's a finger print magnet. The back is a gritter matte finish which does a great job of keeping my hands in place. The sync button is thankfully accessible without removing anything making it much easier to move from console to console. You can sync 4 controllers in addition to the tablet. It also houses the battery compartment which can be remove with a precision screwdriver, should the need arise to change out the battery. Battery life is fantastic, Nintendo claims 80 hours on a full charge, and while I'm not sure the exact amount I'm getting, I know I have to charge far less than I do other wireless controllers. When you do need to charge it, the controller comes with a very lengthy (and well made)mini USB cable that you can use to play and charge the controller.Overall this is a wonderful controller. I would have given it a 4.5/5 but since I've had nothing but good luck out of it despite a few caveats, I find it hard to complain. For a controller of this caliber $50 is a very reasonable price, and I recommend it to any Wii U owner.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}

I'm currently addicted to Just Dance 3. So how does going back to the original Dance Central game compare with the more current options?First, I'm a bit disappointed in the venue options. A school cafeteria? A street? None of them appeal to me much. The venues in the other two games are MUCH better and instantly appealing. In DC2 you also get only a few venues to choose from, while in JD3 each song has its own specific scenery.You get a selection of characters each with multiple outfits, like DC2 and unlike JD3 where each song has a specific matching set of characters. The characters here are very wooden. Some of the outfits like Dare's secondary outfit are quite bizarre in their movements. The characters \"slide\" from move to move making it hard to mimic them sometimes.On the up side, the training mode is great, and there are multiple difficulties for each song. This is something DC2 has. In JD3 there's one sequence per song and that's it. This game and DC2 also get kudos for highlighting the \"wrongly moving body part\" in red so you get a hint of what to fix. JD3 just tells you you're wrong.There's a lot of needless chatter between songs. Especially if you're doing this for a workout, it's a pain to wait minutes between songs. I do like their workout mode which keeps a running tally for you of minutes worked out and calories burned. You enter your weight so it figures this out for you.The moves are fairly forced, to match their robotic figures. It often feels like you're playing a pattern matching game and not dancing smoothly to the music.I do like the reactive audience in this game and DC2. They cheer and light up when you're doing well. You also get a stats screen where the game tracks your favorite song, the time you've played, and so on.Song mix is always a highly personal thing. We all have different tastes in music and that is OK. It just happens that the mix in JD3 is perfect for me, and this one here is less perfect. DC2 comes in the middle. Also, it seems like the songs here are truncated, which always bugs me.So for all of these reasons, if you're looking to get a dance game, I'd either move up to Dance Central 2 or to Just Dance 3, depending on the song mix you prefer. Of course if there are songs HERE you adore, then by all means go for this game. It's not that this game is bad. It's a lot of fun. It's just that, in current times, there are two better options out there and you should give those a solid look. Of course if you're me you'll get all three so you can play the songs you enjoy on each one :)Feel free to ask if you have any questions! I love these types of games :)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B007SRM5MO","reviewerName":"Strategos \"The Guardian of Time\"","summary":"For Better or Worse: The Best Batman Game Ever Made","reviewText":"For Better or Worse: The Best Batman Game Ever MadeArkham AsylumBatman: Arkham City is the best Batman game ever made. Is it perfect? No. But it is VERY good. A while back I played Arkham Asylum after checking it out at the library, and over time I beat it. It was a VERY good game, but after buying it I decided I didn't want to keep it because it was just too dark and horror-ish for my taste (there are limits to how much darker and edgier I can stomach). That said, there was some things that it just plain mastered. The character of Batman had never before been so well capturd (thanks in no small part to amazing voice acting by Kevin Conroy of Batman:The Animated Series fame). From the moment the game started you felt like you were HIM. Police and criminals alike feared and respected Batman. And taking cues from masterpieces like Metal Gear Solid, the game opened like an excellent movie, not just with cut-scenes but with actual gameplay where you walked through the entry gates and rode down in the elevator as Batman, seeing the dialog and scene from his vantage point. I'll never forget when the lights went out and Batman's hand was around Joker's neck when the lights came back on, as if to say \"NO ONE is going to be hurt from you while I'm near.\" That's Batman. His presence makes you feel safe, because his first priority is to protect EVERYONE. And as good as the opening was, the ending of the game was even better, bringing the game to an epic conclusion. I may not have cared for just how dark and freaky the game was overall, but I had to hand it to the game designers...they told an amazing story.The Next ChapterArkham Asylum set the bar VERY high indeed for what it's sequel would have to measure up to. The challenge of course is to make everything bigger, better, and more complex, while not overwhelming anyone with a ridiculous amount of new moves, gadgets, characters, locations, etc, etc. I can say with confidence that, for the most part, Rock Steady has pulled this off very well indeed. Are there missed opportunities? Yes. Are there characters who needed more screen-time and character development? Definitely. But those are minor blemishes. The story picks up pretty much where the first game left off. Overall the game feels a bit more balanced, with the music, graphics, plot and pacing all feeling a bit more like a good action-adventure movie and less like a gothic horror film.There are moments of humor and romance to be sure, but mostly the feel of this game is like a mixture between one of Christopher Nolan's Batman films (the dark and edgy feel and heightened real-world drama) and of Batman the Animated Series and modern comics like Hush(the voice acting, characters, and back-story). I seriously appreciate the change in tone overall, as the first game not only had an excessively dark and creepy color palette, but the music was a bit much for me after extended play. This game on the other hand just has a very strong Batman feel to the world that seems a hybrid of the best of the real world combined with the best of the animated features and comics. Much more color and variety, and compelling without feeling overly depressing or creepy. The music likewise got a shot in the arm and feels more than something from The Dark Knight Rises (play someone tracks from both soundtracks and have them guess which is which). The overall brutality of the game seems to have also been kicked down a notch which I appreciate (less psychotic dialog and people getting killed in various ways (or maybe it just SEEMS that way because of how it is handled). Overall I like this game much better than the first.The High Points of Arkham CityThe best things about this game are (of course) it's combat and gadget systems, the large city to explore, the challenging and interesting boss battles (Mr. Freeze in Particular), the exploration, the cinematic transitions as the story progress, the absolutely AMAZING experience of grappling/gliding from point to point across the map, and...Catwoman. ' I remember watching gameplay videos and thinking that Catwoman would be lame and boring. Then I actually got a chance to play one of her segments and did a 180 on my viewpoint lickety-split. She's voice acted to purrrfection, wears my all-time favorite Catwoman costume (the awesome one from Batman:Hush), and moves and plays simply purrrfect. The combat and gadgets in this game can be a bit overwhelming if you play it in spurts, but thankfully the game makes suggestions and tries to help you if it can see you are getting stuck (if you're having a hard time or aren't used to this sort of game I recommend playing on Easy to start). The combat system from the first game goes largely unchanged, but even if you're no expert some of the new quick gadgets you can use come in handy (particularly in some boss battles). I beat the game with a completion percentage somewhere around 30%, so I know there is a TON of stuff left to do in the game, and I can see completionists playing this game till doomsday to do everything that you can possibly do. But the best thing absolutely has to be the awesome feeling of being able to grapple and glide your way across the entire Arkham City solving problems as you go, dropping down on evil-doers like some kind of awesome avenging angel, disappearing into the night on a whim (or if things aren't going your way). It's simply amazing, and makes you feel like...well, Batman.The Lowest Depths of Arkham CityThere ARE some low points to this game, and while they far from ruin the experience, they keep it from being a five star game in my book. First of all, there's the DLC. New copies of the original edition of this game come with a download code for Catwoman's story arc that weaves through the game. Anyone who didn't buy the game brand new or (heaven forbid) didn't' have an Internet connection was LITERALLY BUYING AN INTENTIONALLY CRIPPLED GAME. I can understand charging for additional parts to a story that are a side-story or unneeded extra features, but when you TAKE OUT PART OF THE STORY just so you can charge extra? That's simply wrong. I'd go so far as to call it stealing from your own customers. Now that the Game of the Year Edition is out you can do what I did and buy that (which of course includes not just the Catwoman content but ALL downloadable content released thus far {and possibly ever} for the game), but STILL....I have a few other minor quibbles with the game.  Unlike the first game, which had a very cohesive story-arc and a very strong plot, I found that the most compelling part of the story in this game...was the preview trailers released for it before it came out. Who is Hugo Strange really? Why is he obsessed with Batman? What exactly are his ultimate plans? Darned if I know because the game never explains this in a satisfactory way! I mean I suppose this sort of thing is kind of glossed-over in the game, but from what I saw in the preview trailers I was expecting an AWESOME story explanation...that I never got. Oh well.  Toss in major story arcs about the Joker and Ra's Al Ghul and you have a recipe for a game that never quite decides who the heck its main villain is. Is the story good? Yes. Is it great? Not really. It needed to be more cohesive and provide a satisfying explanation and conclusion. If the build-up is time consuming and compelling, the conclusion needs to be equally so, otherwise it's just plain underwhelming. I actually couldn't believe the game was over when it was because I had thought I was still hours away from the conclusion (that's how rushed the climax of the game was). \"Wait...what??? That was it??? There's no closure!!!\" The game simply...ends. Fortunately after the End Credits roll you can keep on playing to complete side missions and explore (Yay!!!).Like the first game there are also several departures from the main game that don't really add to it (dream sequences with Ra's Al Ghul and The Mad Hatter come to mind) that could perhaps have been improved or even omitted entirely (and I'm not real crazy about exploring the ancient underground ruins of the city either (I had more than enough of that to last a lifetime in the first game). And to be supremely nit-picky I did not like this version of the Penguin at all (where's the high-mannered Penguin I know and love?). He's stereotypical, crude, and very unlikeable.And yes, there ARE a few nasty bugs in the game, the worst one being that when you in the chair at the very start of the game I spent literally HALF AN HOUR trying to rock back and forth to tip it....that's just plain BROKEN. It nearly made me give up on the game!And lastly there's the hideous game box art...but that's American game companies for you. Maybe later I can find a fan made or European/Asian box art that will be an improvement (As a true collector I've had to hunt down better box art before).Playing till the credits roll...and BEYOND!!!All that said, this game provides enough challenge, variety, innovation, and refinement of the modern gaming experience (to say nothing of the wish-fulfillment of every Batman fan on the planet) to make it a classic. It can definitely be improved upon (everyone seems to be chomping at the bit for a game that lets you explore the ENTIRE city of Gotham) but for now it remains the definitive Greatest Batman Game Ever Made. Just be sure you guy the Game of the Year Edition (especially if you have no Internet connection at home).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2012"}

With that being said, this game had a lot of pressure to deliver a really good story. For the most part, its' story is unchanged: The protagonist becomes stuck in an isolated location and must fend off zombies in order to survive. However, this game took away the whole box system that Resident 1,2 and 3 used. Instead, it let your characters (that's right: you control two characters at the same time in this game) drop off items to make space and then come back and get them at a later time. The controls are pretty much the same from all the other RE games before RE 4. A big weak-point is the variety of bosses. While they are not necessarily easy, they do not take much effort to kill, and they are nothing more than just over-sized insects and other amphibians.

SimCity 2000 devoured chunks of my youth whole. Later SimCity 3000 was the mainstay game of the early 2000's on my PC along other greats such as Diablo II and StarCraft. SimCity 4 was good in it's own ways even if it didn't appeal to me in the same magnitude that it's predecessors did.The pedigree and nostalgia I have toward this series is what makes my ultimate decision to not purchase the game so difficult. Unfortunately, companies like EA have got to get the message that implementing DRM (digital rights management) such as requiring users to be constantly connected to the internet to play a game that is heavily slanted to the single-player experience is not okay. Forcing persistent connections to overwhelmed servers and implementing wait-times to play my game is not my idea of a \"good\" gaming experience. Taking my save files and holding them hostage on a remote server is not my idea of a \"good\" gaming experience.Very disappointed. I will not be purchasing this SimCity and if EA has any thought to the fans of the series - you know the people who buy the games - they'll remove this DRM and stop punishing their fans/customers.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2013"}

It was the beginning of a new era- the Cold War.October 16, 1962. The President of the United States received word   that the Soviet Union had deployed nuclear missiles in Cuba. The world    trembled in fear as the prospect of nuclear war loomed ever closer.   After days of tense negotiations, the Soviets finally agreed on the 28th   to withdraw their missiles from Cuban soil. With the resolution of this   incident, later to be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, it    seemed that humanity had survived yet another threat to its existence.However, there was a secret condition in the deal that put an end to   the crisis. Nokolai Stepanovich Sokolov, a Soviet scientist who had   defected    to the West, was to be sent back to the Soviet Union. The U.S.   government agreed to this stipulation, and returned Sokolov back to his   native    land. Little did they know that Sokolov was to be the designer of a   nightmarish weapon. Now, with Sokolov back in their hands, the Soviets    are ready to resume its development. If this weapon is completed, it   will mark the beginning of a new age of fear.August 1964. Realizing at last the urgency of the situation, the CIA   forms a plan to recapture Sokolov. They dispatch the covert FOX unit    to Sokolov's research facility, located to the south of the great   Soviet fortress of Groznyj Grad. Led by former SAS member Major Zero,   FOX is a    next-generation special-forces unit that operates both as a   specialized combat group and as a covert intelligence outfit.

When I heard about this game coming for 3DS, it was actually quite a promising thought. I never would've imagined Snake returning to Nintendo systems, really, after Metal Gear Solid for Game Boy Color (Which is a tempting purchase). But after trying this out, I'm starting to wonder why I missed out on this series.The game is all about stealth, something that not many games follow. Sure, you are equipped with a gun that can kill a soldier, but if you are spotted by one, a whole bunch will bunch and go kill you (Fortunately, you could still be able to hide somewhere)! It's frustrating at first glance, but it's actually pretty interesting and fun. It also makes for some nice strategy, as you gotta plan your way through certain situations.Along with the cool gameplay, the largely detailed graphics (especially in 3D), awesome soundtrack, and exciting presentation all around make for a fabulous package. And to top it all off, it has a very dramatic and gripping storyline. In fact, the stealth and everything makes it seem like as if you were really involved within it.If this review isn't enough to convince you to go buy this game, try out a demo of this game by going onto the Nintendo eShop and download it. The download may take a while, but it'll all be worth it once you play it. And for a much bigger experience, buy this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2012"}

Do not go in thinking your family will have as much fun with this as they will with Rock Band or one of the Guitar Hero games.  This is not really conducive as a party game.Overall the controller is incredibly well put together and feels rock solid.  One of the best put together peripherals I have ever used, no joke.  Feels solid and works well.  But once you get into the actual game it can be frustrating for beginners and is not as much fun as the other band games.  If you are into DJing I'm sure you will have a blast with this game.  Definitely recommended for those folks or those aspiring to be DJ's.For other people I don't think this game will be as enjoyable.  Doing the fading and volume and other DJ type of simulations just isn't as much fun as playing a plastic guitar or drums.  The songs are basically mash ups and are not as familiar to most folks not on the DJ scene.  There is a guitar vs DJ battle but that was not all that much fun and besides that it's basically a single player game.

Wait for verified customers. Anyhoo. Before anyone jumps me for not playing this game. I ONLY played the 360 version. Not the PS3 version. Historically I usually have played both versions and I can tell with confidence that both games will be very similar and the differences will only be subtle. I prefer the 360 controller, but the game should be identical. Will depend on your game preference.The people trolling these sites are amazing. I assume 75% are Disgruntled Battlefield fans who will do anything to talk this best selling franchise down and the rest are simply people who just haven't played the game. Anyway, for someone who actually played the game. Here ya go. The single player campaign is very good and I was entertained the moment I started up. I found it just as enjoyable as BLOPS 2 was. I think I like the storyline a bit more in this one than I did in Blops 2.  If you liked the SP in that, you'll be right at home with Ghosts. And if you need to compare it to BF go ahead. There is no comparison. COD's campaign is light years better than battlefields which never had a good campaign IMO. The multiplayer is great too. Got a ton of new tweaks and new game modes to have it feel fresh and exciting. New maps galore and some new weapons I came across. Graphics are what you expect, from good to very good. But the engine is feeling dated.One mode I need to mention. Do you like killing Aliens? Than rejoice! Squads and Extinction is probably my favorite mode in Ghosts, and even better, you get to deal with Aliens. I would give this a perfect score if I could score the game separate from the campaign. If you like multiplayer its even more fun. Squads is a new and innovating feature in multiplayer which allows you to create your own team and play against another player's team. You can also play with your team against another team of bots and it also allows you to play survival mode with your team or with another batch of players. If you're familiar with Zombies in Blops, you will be right at home with Aliens. Beware, this is a lot more challenging than Zombie mode is! So that said, if you're also a fan of Zombies, you'll be very very pleased with this new addition to the franchiseActivision is promising lots of future DLC. So hopefully will last us till next year.

I enjoyed Bad Company 2 a LOT but didn't care for Battlefield 3 (on PC) all that much.The single player is pretty weak. It's something you blow through on a lazy Sunday afternoon for the cheevos. It isn't very interesting.  Riley is the best part.The multiplayer is pretty addictive though. We all know the deal about COD, so I won't get into the details. The developers have this down to a science now. There is one thing to mention: initially, the character customization and progression system is just bewildering. I think a large part of COD4's success was that the system was very clear and straightforward, but they are targeting the hardcore fans by now. This isn't a bad thing, it's just a bit unintuitive for newcomers. You will spend a lot of time and points trying out different weapons and features to feel it out.Infinity Ward has built up a decent bot mode to help you learn, though. Instead of a prestige mode where you level your guy to 60, and then start over, you now can build up a squad of 10 characters that all start at level 1. You can customize each one as you see fit, and earn points fighting against the AI. The interesting thing about the AI bot mode, though, is that the bots you face are customized based on other players' squads. Winning matches against the bots earns XP bonuses, and the squads fight even when you are offline (you see the results later). Therefore you have an incentive to beef up everyone on your squad instead of one at a time. I like this mode a lot! I'd love to see it fleshed out in future games.Once you're in the action, it is COD. Fast, quick deaths, smooth 60fps and great response time. Some maps are great, some maps aren't. Frustration is the norm, but the game keeps you coming back. I like it a lot. Of course there is another big FPS that came out in 2013, but I think by now everybody knows what they prefer. People can complain about the lack of innovation or whatever but there's just no point at this stage. It's COD. Lots of people love it. If you haven't tried it by now, Ghosts is a fine way to start it out. If you love it, you'll love this one. If you hate it, Ghosts won't change your mind.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2013"}
{"product_name":"B004CVWETI","description":"","reviewerName":"Shaimun","summary":"Best RPG for the DS!","reviewText":"I have played this game thoroughly and I can confidently say this is the most best traditional RPG game for the Nintendo DS.Characters: The main central character's name is Stocke and he is basically the person you play the POV as. He isn't a generic personality by any means. He can be badass and clever. He's just different from the other main characters in other RPG games. There are another 6 characters that are within in party that will fight along with you. All of them are pretty diverse. The characters in this game have a lot of depth. The main villian NPC is pretty awesome as well and not generic.Story/Campaign: It has something to do with the end of the world with everything turning into sand by a power called flux. I'm not going to go in too much detail. The way the campaign precedes is by chapters. You also have to use the white chronicle to different timelines to change the story for the better end. The only thing menial is when you enter a node in the timeline, you might have to watch cut-scenes and skip lots of texts. I found that annoying.Dungeons/Towns: Pretty standard for an RPG. You can walk around and talk to people and accept side-quests which most of the time require you to go forward in time or back in time. There are equipment shops. When you exit an area you are taken to a world map where you can select a path to take and you enter into the selected area. Sometimes you can fast travel if you have already progressed to the areas. The dungeon design is pretty good. Sometimes there are obstacles to move or break to advance. Of course there are always treasures to be found.Gameplay: You get to use Stocke and 2 other party members in battle. Unfortunately you must always use Stocke. I did not like that because I remember in Final Fantasy games, you didn't have to use the main character in battle so it could lead to more unique combinations of party members complementing skill sets. It is a turn based strategy. Various combos can take place. Every party member has their own differentiated skill set so it makes the game much more better because all of them have something to offer that can not be replaced. The enemies can be found visibly and you can attack them for a preliminary strike which will then flash into the battle scene and give your turns 1st priority. I appreciate the fact that you don't get into random battles like other rpgs where you walk around and flash into a battle. Some level grinding may be necessary as the difficulty accumulates.Re-Playability: The best part is you replay this game whether you know it or not. You can go back to many nodes in the game to pick up lost treasure or just play through it again to fight old bosses and steal good equipment from them.Pick this game up! The most rewarding RPG I have ever played on the DS. I have not beaten the game but you should complete all side-quests if you want to see the true ending.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2012"}

It looks a lot more polished than Doom (due in no small part to the 360's hardware), and it looks much brighter than Doom 3 (although that's not saying it's a bright and cheary game by any stretch).The game follows Tommy, a Cherokee Indian, who is abducted by aliens and must fight his way to save his girl and destroy the evil aliens.  That really is, by the way, about as complex as the story gets.The game play is pretty linear but there are some interesting puzzles.  The physics are really weird in this game - sometimes you'll have to walk on walls or ceilings, which makes shooting bad guys uniquely challenging.But this game is pretty short - maybe eight or ten hours on the story mode.  It's also not anything new.  It's your standard FPS with weapons that basically behave like weapons you've seen in most other FPS.  The online mode is VERY laggy.  To get the last couple of hundred achivement points you'll have to play online.  As bad as my experience online was, I'm surprised anyone is playing this online.The game, like Doom 3, also lacks splitscreen play; i.e. you can't have your friends over to play Prey deathmatch.  This may sound like a small complaint; but since online play stinks, it's really the only way to play deathmatch besides system link (which would work if you have 2 360's).Overall, this game is a good renter - I was able to beat it in a weekend with plenty of time to spare.

I didn't hate it, but it did not feel like it was at all worth the price.  It felt like it was cheaply/quickly made to sell, which they succeeded in doing if one looks at the sales figures.  I look at some of the positive reviews and wonder if people are just giving five stars out of some sense of loyalty to a franchise they love.  I prefer honesty, which is why I gave the PS3 Medal of Honor game a lower score, even though I love that franchise.I won't even go into a \"why do they create video games with the primary purpose to be for online gamers???\" rant.  I tried it briefly and it was not fun.  16 year olds shouting racist things at 12 year olds, constant disconnecting from matches, unoriginal smallish maps, getting annihilated constantly by people who I guess do nothing else with their lives then play online gaming 24/7.To note: I did not have any problems at all with any OFFLINE aspects.  There was no freezing, lagging, or anything else, it all worked fine.The plot had a good overall sort of loosely based on history feel, which I liked probably most about this game.Bottom-line: This game felt contrived and designed simply with the mindset of making money more than being actually fun.  As with any future Medal of Honor games, because of how little this actually WAS fun I will wait a few months to purchase any future Call of Duty games until I read reviews.  I would not pay more than $35 for this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2011"}

While in many ways it's an improvement, it's not the best for people who already have a collection of PSP games.The PSP Go is smaller than the \"normal\" PSP, but this is in large part due to the removal of the UMD drive. The screen itself is not much smaller, and the lightness and size of the PSP Go makes up for the loss of the drive. This is compounded by the PSP Go's sliding screen: normally, the directional pad, analog stick, and main buttons are covered by the screen. The screen is slid up when in use, and slid back down over those buttons when not in use. It slides easily into most pockets, unlike its bulkier predecessor.Due to its lack of UMD support (at least without a peripheral device), the PSP Go gets all its games online through the Playstation Network Store. The hard drive can hold up to 16 gigabytes, but the size of the games varies: MGS: Peace Walker, for example, takes up 1/10th of the entire system. The download process takes a while, but is arguably more convenient than having to go pick up and find a hard copy, especially when it's done right from the handheld itself.The PSP Go is capable of connecting to the PS3 to share images, video, and even games (if you'd rather download from a hard-line connection instead of playing around with the PSP's wireless). It's also possible to use the PSP connection to play the PSP Go through the PS3 (as in, it shows up on a big screen). This is a neat idea, but the low resolution makes this not exactly worth it. On its own, the PSP Go is also capable of internet browsing, internet radio, and Skype.The PSP's price (roughly $200) is probably its hardest selling point. While this current price is better than it was in the past, it's still a pretty penny. The multimedia features seem intended to justify this, but they feel like more of a sideshow than the main event (since it's easier just to buy an MP3 player for those kinds of things). The PSP's library at this point is large enough to make it worth it, and the graphics are generally of a higher quality than the DS. In short, the PSP Go is a marked upgrade compared to the older model PSP, and works well on its own merits.Rating: 8/10.We purchased the PSP Go from a gaming store with our own funds.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000FRS9II","reviewerName":"Cale E. Reneau \"Mound of Wires\"","summary":"Gripping.  A New Era for Console Gaming Has Arrived!","reviewText":"Wow.I have been playing console games since the 80s.  With each new generation of systems, there is a game that will truly define the generation.  Super Mario Bros., Sonic the Hedgehog, Super Mario 64, Halo, Metal Gear Solid, and Splinter Cell all stand out as generation-defining games.  Up until this point, the new generation of games has not differed too much from the previous one.  Aside from extra sparkle and polish, no game released this generation has changed the way we look at and play games.Until now.For fans of shooters, both first-person and third-person, Gears of War is a must own game!  Fans of tactical shooters like Ghost Recon or Socom will fall in love with the cover system in Gears of War.  Though not as complex as those games (you only have to press A), the cover system in Gears of War feels incredibly intuitive and you'll find yourself a pro at the mechanics in just a matter of minutes.  This is great, because Gears wastes no time throwing you into the action of the game. It starts of strong and never slows down, and never feels dull.  Never.  Additionally, the level design in Gears of War is designed to take full advantage of the cover system, while maintaining the realistic feel of the landscape and architechture.For fans of \"more run-and gun\" Halo-esque shooters, Gears of War does not disappoint here either.  As I already stated, the action in Gears is non-stop, so you won't find any moments where you're begging for more action.  In fact, I've found that some points in Gears of War are so intense that it's literally tough to handle.  One scene in particular where your character is forced to defeat a huge, blind enemy had my heart pounding like no other game has ever done before!  I cannot recall a time where I have actually screamed in a game, but this definitely did it for me.  Overall, the game is a rather pleasant mixture of both the run-and-gun and more tactical shooters.  It plays out flawlessly.If you're looking for a killer multiplayer experience on Xbox Live, Gears of War is possibly the strongest game available on the service as of right now.  Players have the option of playing a ranked game, or an unranked game and there are 3 main types of gameplay.  There is no respawning in matches, so when you are dead, you are dead.  But the round system and 8-player limit gets you right back into the action in no time.My only complaint with multiplayer is that if you're new to the game, you will find it increasingly difficult to jump into a game with people of the same skill level.  Unlike the matchmaking system in Halo 2, if you are brand new to the game, you may very well be put up against people who are the best players in the world, without warning or acknowledgement.  In other words, you won't stand a chance.  There is a huge learning curve for multiplayer, so don't be surprised if you wind up getting booted out of several matches by the host due to your skill level.  More consideration by the developers would have greatly benefitted the less skilled gamers out there.  Hopefully, this will be addressed in further Gears of War titles.Graphically speaking, Gears of War is the most visually impressive game ever seen on a home console, bar none.  It's easy to get caught up in the action in Gears, but if you ever get a chance, take the time to look around the environment and see the amazing job that Epic did in creating this game.  The level of detail in every square inch of the playing field and beyond is simply breathtaking.  Spot on character models and fairly decent voice acting rounds out what is simply one of the best shooters ever created and by far the best game to be released on a next-gen console thus far.Gears of War is definitely not for everyone.  The gore and violence in this game are through the roof, and the gameplay can be intense beyond belief.  However, if you're a fan of shooters, you simply cannot pass up this marvel of a game.  Gears of War is definitely one of the best games of 2006 and the first game to set itself apart from the rest of the pack in this console generation.  Check it out!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2007"}

Consider this game the gateway to Civilization. You can pick this game up and play right away and get much of the same experience as (the far superior) PC version.But comparisons don't really fit between strategy games on consoles and PCs. PCs rule this area because of the controls available on the keyboard and mouse and the customization. So taking Civ Rev as it is (pretend there was no Civ on PC) and we would all love it.Sure there are some glitches: not being able to change city production to Gold, how quickly we move through the modern era, etc. But overall this is the best strategy game on Xbox.I can still sit down for a brief Civ game and end up hours later asking where the time went.

{"product_name":"B005B8DRVU","description":"","reviewerName":"Aaron Keating","summary":"If this doesn't kill WOW, it'll definitely Contribute.","reviewText":"So I've been playing Star Wars the Old Republic. (yeah that's where I've been)Troopers story missions are awesome. Felt like a soldier in the kotor period, they are very well written with a minimum of the typical mmo garbage missions.Got to level 20 and discovered most of my guildies are like level 10 or less.So I started rolling a Jedi Knight..... and the missions on the starting planet? Are Horrible until the -very- tail end. They consist of the usual MMO Garbage Busy Work missions. Just with voice acting... woooo great job Bioware. Give the non force guys the great content (smugglers also get really awesome starter missions) and screw the Force guys which -everyone- and their kid brother is going to play as their first toon.I suspect initial reviews of TOR are going to be dramatically on opposite ends of the spectrum.. those that played Trooper and Smuggler... and those that played Force users.I've got some other gripes like the Jedi Knight being nigh worthless compared to the Trooper to the point where missions that me and a buddy rolled over on our first (as Trooper and Smuggler it was still hard too)try took -several- as a Jedi Knight and Jedi Consular. Combat needs to be abit more mobile for ranged characters and I'd like to see an actual cover system put in place along with some more clutter on the maps to break line of sight etc.Overall though, the game is beautiful, and so very well polished that it's hard to come up with serious complaints beyond balance issues, and starter zone quests for the republic Force Users. I think Bioware though took the Too Safe route and I think it's going to backfire. WOW's bleeding subs because people don't want to Kill X of Y anymore. People don't want to grind to infinitely increasing levels. I mention the last one, because with the way the skill points work out in TOR I can definitely tell they plan on upping the cap at some later date. A move that I don't think is going to help them in the long run. No not all sucessful MMOs do it either. That's one of the reasons RIFT did, and is still doing so well, they understand that people want Content, not more Levels and yet more abilities for an already over taxed and over crowded set of ability trays.The game is also quite linear and I think they botched partly what made Mass Effect so great. In ME I could go anywhere and pick up missions on my level in this game.. not so much. It makes it feel like you have alot less freedom (because you do) than in MMOs or even Mass Effect.Also, Guild building, and perks? Non Existent. There isn't even an Events Page, or message wall!  This is Criminal in a modern MMO. Especially when they were doing their damndest to promote guild building, and community building pre launch.Overall though again the game is very good, and if Bioware would just add in, and address a couple of the things I've mentioned this Will Be the Wow Killer, instead of just the Major Contributor to it's demise, just enough flaws to keep me from giving it a full Five Stars, is it better than WOW? Oh God Yes. Is it better than RIFT? I'd say it's about even with it.Now, as for the Collector's Edition. Were the goodies worth it?  I have a 9 inch highly detailed... no very highly detailed statue. A journal, and soundtrack. The statue I think is why the collectors had cost me so much. (by the way thanks amazon for screwing up my order and not being able to fix it... Gamestop got my business because of it and I'm never preordering anything from you guys again) But it really is beautiful. I would have preferred to have a Trooper statue instead or maybe the female Jedi in the opening scene instead. But the actual quality and style of the thing was worth it. Everything else is just a bonus. The collector's vendor in game Sucks, the security key vendor (which induces it's own headache since I need the key fob just to play the game every day. (Gee Thanks EA... Give me something I can lose or run out of batteries for)  is far far better. The Holo Girl was cool, and pair of pets are entertaining. But ultimately I think this stuff has to stay in your inventory to use.... which sucks. The Holocamera... is worthless. The stuff in the actual game box basically is the whole reason to get this game's Collector's if you can still find it. (and I wish you luck!)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2011"}

Howver it changes too much about what was good. I mean the submission system sucks. When you tap the button to get the guy to submit it goes the opposite way and is hard to get them to submit. The submission system were a lot better in the last games and a lot less hard. I mean it's great that Bret Hart is on the game but I have a hard time getting people to submit as him. It's a hell of a lot easier for the computer to  get you to submit. I also don't like the controls in the Royal Rumble, it was much more easier to eliminate people in the last ones.Plus the story mode is a sorta lame too. It was better in the last when you could go on and play as someone else and all the stats and champions were kept the same. In this one it's like all your work in story mode means nothing unless you choose to continue as the same superstar. I  mean if you win the World title as Shelton Benjaman but don't choose to continue as him  then Randy Orton goes back as being World champ and you start all over. I think the Japan Pro Wrestling games had the right idea in their games. You could go for a belt or defend a belt anytime you wanted without a story mode. I've been waiting a long time for a WWE game like that. Plus ok it's cool that Legends like Bret Hart, Mick Foley and The Rock are on it. We don't need Piper, Super Fly or Brutis Beefcake though. If  Undertaker and Kane are on it you should be able to change their costumes to Legend Kane or Taker. Who needs them as legends, it's like a waste of space. They need to keep Bret as one on the next one and have Hogan, Jake the Snake Roberts, Ravishing Rick Rude, Psycho Sid, Stone Cold, and Yokozuna as well. Also you should be able to put Legends into Season mode. Plus if you make someone you should be able to have them in season mode without playing as them. I liked that in the other games. I also liked in the other games how you could play other matches besides your own too. You can't do any of that here and that makes it less fun.Also I don't like that there's no tag belts on it or the Cruiserweight title. The game has more wrestlers that were fired than wrestlers that are actually around now too. It needed La Resistance, Eugene, Maven, Tyson Tomko, Luther Reighns, Kenso Sesuki, Orlando Jordan, Heidenreich, the Basham Brothers and many others. Wrestlers like Chuck Palumbo, A-Train and Rico aren't even around now. Garrison Cade wasn't fired but he has been injured for the last 5 months, same with Matt Hardy. Also I don't like the on-line mode. It's useless for people who don't have it like myself. When you don't have it John Cena  just walks out looking dumb lip sinking with a mic in his hands. This Smackdown made too many changes and not many of them are that good. The last Smackdowns I could play without getting tired of them. I'm tired of this one already....

She then wakes up in a cafe at a shopping mall.It is your job to guide Heather through not only the shopping mall butalso many other places in the game - such as through a subway, sewer,underpass, Daisy Villa Apartments (where a game changing and Silent Hillchanging major event takes place) Part of Silent Hill (you'll be veryfamiliar with some locations both from SH1 and SH2 btw) Brookhaven Hospital,and a few other locations. Some of these include the nightmare/otherworldversions of these places that turn bloody, creepy, nightmarish and hellish.Along the way you'll meet various characters such as; Douglas, a privatedetective in his 50's, Vincent, a rather strange man and Claudia who seemscrazy. You'll learn more about Heather, Harry and the other characters asthe game progresses including through finding memo's and notebooks and such.Heather really does have an attitude like a real teenage girl and actslike one through most of the game yet she is mature for her age as well;think Buffy from Buffy The Vampire Slayer (The TV Series)(On a side note Heather is 17 years old btw)SH3 is a short to medium length game taking around anywhere from 3 to 6hours to complete but probably more for first time players and beginnersof the game.The cutscenes are well done and take place in game. Graphics are really goodfor a PS2 game and the atmosphere is very well done and creepy. Sometimes aroom will turn into a nightmarish/otherworld realm right before your eyes.The sound is good and so is the music and sound effects at times often verycreepy and nerve wracking. The voice acting is ok but could have been betterfor some characters. Industrial sound effects provide for a chilling atmosphere.There are puzzles to solve in the game. Some of these can be solved in an easymanner using logic and common sense. However for some puzzles you may need advicefrom a Silent Hill fansite that gives a walkthrough of the game such as on Gamefaq's.Some of the puzzles are almost impossible to figure out; others don't make much sense.The monsters and bosses are really creepy and seem like something straight out ofHellraiser but at the same time original as well for a Silent Hill game. Some ofthe bosses are tough but the final one is somewhat easy to beat.My only complaint about the game so far is the lack of items and ammo. It seems thereare not really enough health items or ammo compared to the many monsters you'll run intoin the game. This is not too much of a problem as you'll have plenty of melee weapons sucha steel pipe, katana, etc. that don't require ammo (unlike the handgun, shotgun orsubmachine gun does)For every time you beat the game a secret will be unlocked. There are dozens of outfitsto unlock for Heather as well as 3 weapons (flamethrower, submachine gun with unlimitedammo and heather beam), a weapon/outfit combo, and a few other secrets as well (such asgetting a gold/silver steel pipe from a fairy in the sewer system your second time playingthrough if you know what to do to get it)and some SH2 references hidden throughout the game.You can adjust the number of bullets you get every time the game is beat (just reloada saved game from the end then beat the final boss again then save your game results overthe previous game results) up to 5x to get much more ammo throughout the game. You canalso play the game in extreme mode (there are about 20 extreme modes) after beating iton hard.I rate Silent Hill 3 5/5 stars for fun, creepy atmosphere, intense gameplay,great graphics and chilling sound as well as mind bending puzzles and freakishenemies.On a side note: If you have Silent Hill 2 saved on the same memory card you useto play Silent Hill 3 with there will be a few SH2 references in this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00DC7G0GG","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"The Most \"Super\" of Them All","reviewText":"Bleary-eyed, two other people and I finally put this game down at around four in the morning, after a good bit over eight hours of play. In one marathon sitting, we had cleared the game, and were plowing into the bonus levels before we had to call it quits due to the fatigue that comes with sitting in front of a screen for prolonged periods of time. We laughed, we yelled, we gasped, and most of all, we had the time of our lives working together, competing head-to-head, and screwing each other over the entire time. As I almost passed out from my caffeine and adrenaline-fueled binge, many things were going through my head. But one thought predominately kept popping up, and after sleeping and dreaming of the game all night, it was cemented. \"Super Mario 3D World\" is not only perhaps the best game of this year, but the best Mario game since \"Super Mario Galaxy\", and the best Nintendo game in ages.Right from the beginning, players expectations are subverted. Mario, Luigi, Peach and Toad are strolling along during a fireworks show and run into a clear pipe, which in turn leads them into stumbling upon a little fairy-esque creature called a Sprixie. It warns the heroes of the return of their old nemesis, Bowser, who is capturing these little things and keeping them in bottles (perhaps taking a cue from a certain warrior in a green tunic.) Before long, Peach leads the rest of the gang into the Sprixie Kingdom, and they task themselves with rescuing the entire race from enslavement by their perennial foe. That's right, no princess to save, no Toads to free... even with how minimal of a role it takes, the story is very innovative by series standards, which sets the tone for the rest of the experience.That experience is, in a word, sublime. From the beginning of the first level, players know to expect something different from this game than they have historically gotten, with the introduction of a new power-up, new music, new enemies, and a new visual aesthetic. Unlike the past few Mario games, which have passed themselves off as \"new\", before eventually devolving into the same formula, \"3D World\" keeps upping the ante until the very end, to the point where players are being given new power-ups in the penultimate levels of the game. Even bosses which reappear act in somewhat different ways, and pose a bigger threat than before. Up until the very last stage, which is without a doubt my favorite boss stage in the franchise, and possibly one of my favorites of all time, players are kept on their toes, never feeling bogged down in repetition or formula.Which is a really nice thing to experience, considering the core gameplay itself is so ridiculously fast, fluid and fun. Giving a throwback to \"Super Mario Brothers 2\", or \"Doki Doki Panic\" if you prefer, each character feels incredibly distinct and have their own advantages and disadvantages. Mario is completely balanced, Luigi's jumps are high and flutter, Peach can float, and Toad is blazing fast. Playing as all of them, it's clear that no character is \"better\" than the other, but all of them have attributes which help them in certain situations, and if you're gunning for all the stars and stamps in the game, you'll actually need to become proficient with all four mains in order succeed. This prevents players from simply choosing a character and unquestioningly sticking with them, and forces them to experience the true variety that Nintendo has served up here.That variety expands beyond much more than the gameplay. As mentioned above, the sheer magnitude of how different each stage is becomes staggering as you go on, as levels consistently trick players into thinking it will be one thing, then switching it up. Eventually, elements of different levels are merged into single levels, leading to what can only be described as blissful chaos, especially when playing with a few friends. Giant waterslides atop the back of a familiar series creature, a level that references \"Super Mario Kart\" which exhibits speed that would put Sonic to shame, crazy Boo Houses that perform constant visual trickery... all of these stages are incredibly different, and not once did I feel as if I was doing the same stuff over and over again. Levels in certain worlds will even break the world's theming, adding to this feeling of variety. Furthermore, this is the first Mario game where I thoroughly enjoyed every stage, and not once did I end a level with a feeling of disappointment.The new power-ups also lend themselves well to the environment of creativity. Sure, you've got your Fire Flowers and Tanuki Suits. But players are also given the Cat Suit, which allows you scale vertical walls and perform a deadly pounce. Then there's the Double Cherry, which allows whoever's playing to control clones of themselves. And even then there are level-exclusive power-ups, like mobile cannons, hats which let players blend in with Goombas, and lights that kill Boos and other ghost creatures. Add all of that in with other returning powers, like the boomerang suit and the coin block suit, and it becomes clear that \"3D World\" has truly mastered the art of the power-up, with none of them feeling extraneous in the least. Oh, yeah, did I mention you could hop into a giant ice skate and zip around? Because you totally can, and it's freaking adorable.Right about now, this would be the part where I say, \"the graphics are good for a Nintendo game.\" Not this time. The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 might have more advanced processors, but with what they have right now, players are given upscaled version of the same grey, black and brown color schemes they've been pushing for the entire seventh generation. Nintendo, on the other hand, has produced one of the most positively gorgeous games on the market, period. Bright, vibrant colors splash beautifully rendered and gloriously creative stages, producing a beautiful canvas that is a delight to gawk at. In fact, I would encourage players to take a few seconds out of the timed stages to simply look at the the beautiful visuals on display here. While some publishers and software developers are duking it out over what wartorn battlefield they can make look the most realistic, Nintendo has hands-down produced the most next-gen game in terms of visual prowess yet, outdoing even the beautiful \"Pikmin 3\" and \"The Wonderful 101.\"That goes double for the music, which isn't just one of the best Mario, Nintendo, or game soundtracks I've ever heard. This is, with no hesitation, one of the best soundtracks produced for anything. Musically, the game is all over the place in terms of style, yet somehow it all blends together into an effective and forceful series of compositions. Uptempo jazz pieces go hand-in-hand with thrilling rock pieces that sound like they came straight out of the 80's, and synthesizers which have a very New Age vibe transition flawlessly into hauntingly beautiful pieces of orchestral string music. A soundtrack has not impressed me this much since I heard the opening strains of, ironically, \"The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess\" back in 2006. This soundtrack is perfect for the game, but also stands on its own as a perfect work of art.Given that there are a few other games this year which have merited perfect scores from, I almost wish that there was some other scoring system for Nintendo's newest title. Alas, there is not, and hopefully, my words will convey how amazing this game truly is. It is in a league of its own, up there with greats like \"Uncharted 2\" and \"Bioshock.\" This is unquestioningly one the greatest games ever published, proving that 16-player deathmatches, extensive downloadable content, and PC-caliber graphics are not what make great games. Not by a long shot.\"Super Mario 3D World\" has changed my standards for how I review games, and dare I say it, is easily one of the top ten games I've ever had the joy of playing. Young or old, veteran or newbie, this is an experience that has something to offer for every age and demographic. It is a purely sublime combination of innovation and fun, and is the definitive reason to own a Wii U.Score: 10 (Perfect)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2013"}

Since my friend Dan and I enjoy going through a story line as a team, this game seemed like the perfect purchase for us.  It took a little while to get used to the controls in this game, so if you get frustrated after a few minutes, don't worry that's part of the learning curve.I was surprised this game was not a First Person Shooter, because I essentially thought this was a Halo rip off with a different setting.  Instead this is a third person over the shoulder view, which is not the easiest for aiming at targets in certain situations.  Usually I am not a fan of this view, so it took some getting used to with this game.  When we first started playing through this game we thought it was just okay, but before we knew it we had played it until 2:00AM and at that point we figured it must've been better than we thought.  Basically you play as two elite forces people for a contracting company, because the U.S. military isn't as good as going into places covertly and taking out the bad guys.  You spend a good deal of time fighting in areas like the Middle East and fighting various terrorists, so in that regard it's somewhat of an \"up to date\" game.  Don't worry there's actually a decent plot twist in this game that doesn't make it feel like it's that mundane all the time.  The missions are actually pretty challenging and we had to repeat sections together once in a while.I found the graphics fairly impressive for the Xbox 360 and I think they definitely use the higher processing abilities in that regard.  Since this game takes place in modern times you get to use weapons that are currently available.  The weapons selection ability was definitely one of the coolest parts of the game.  As you take contracts and complete them for pay you can take your money and upgrade your weapons!  This was one of the more fun parts of the game for me.  Periodically the game gives you the option to visit your arms dealer so you can switch weapons mid-mission as well.  The only part of this game I hated playing was whenever you had to control the hovercraft.  Talk about trying to control an incredibly unwieldy vehicle.  I wish standard vehicle controls for things like that were the same as the Warthog on Halo, but alas, I spend more time trying to get the hovercraft to move straight than I do trying to enjoy the game in those sections!  Luckily it's not something you have to drive frequently.This game is definitely designed with Co-Op in mind.  I never tried it with just using the AI as my Co-Op teammate so I'm not sure how that works, but based on what I've read, it's not that great.  Personally, I would only pick this game up if you do have someone to play with that also enjoys these types of games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2009"}

You'll find it to be more difficult than it looks and I challenge you to complete the whole storyline the first time you play through it. This inevitably makes the replay value high. Odds are you won't uncover all the different plots and find all of the survivors your first time through.The graphics are pretty good. They could be a little better I suppose but it's nothing that takes away from the game itself. The game is funny and creative with the different ways you can choose to take on the zombie hordes and the storyline is enough to keep you playing it until the very end.This game does have its problems though. The text, for one, was so small that I couldn't even read it. I've heard on an HDTV this isn't a problem but there should've been a setting to make text bigger for the little guy. Also saving the survivors is a daunting task as they are completely without brains and tend to get caught on walls and doors and such. The A.I. could've been better.Also, I think it's rediculous I'm reading phrases at the bottom of the screen when there could be something better. Like voice acting. I figure that would be a no brainer but I suppose maybe this game was kind of rushed to get out.That being said, it's still an enjoyable game and worth picking up.

I found that the game combines a lot of elements, but in a mediocre way.  The strategy in the game ends up being kind of simple and shallow, and so do the RPG aspects.  It?s hard to not recommend this game though, since it is still fun to play, thanks in large part to all of the eye candy.  Still, I couldn?t help but be slightly disappointed in the game that I heard so many great things about.Make no mistake about it.  This game looks and sounds awesome.  Each map is beautiful to look at and sports all sorts of bright colors and features.  The various units in the game are animated brilliantly and in stunning detail.  No two look alike, and that is saying a lot.  Watching your groups move across the screen is, by itself, a treat.  The human Gyrocopter spins and buzzes around, the undead Abomination slowly lumbers, and mounted warriors gallop with their horses.  Buildings share the same attention to detail.  The real experience, however, comes when there is a battle.  Watching the units bash on each other while spells spray fire and lightning back and forth is a delight.  The great sound has a lot to do with this.  All of the bashing and crushing sounds and explosions give you the feeling that there is World War 3 in your living room.  The game?s voice samples range from chilling (for the undead Banshee) to very amusing (for the orc Peon), but they are all great.The single-player campaign leaves a lot to be desired when you get past the production values though.  The campaign crosses all four of the game?s races and takes you through a bunch of small missions that last about 40 minutes, on average.  I like the heroes being the centerpiece in the game, but you get no freedom in choosing them, and not much freedom in developing them.  When you advance a level, you upgrade one special ability.  Each hero has only three or four special abilities or spells to choose from.  There isn?t much thinking or planning for you to do.The whole concept of gaining levels in the game seems kind of pointless.  So do all of the aspects that spoil the game?s strategy, like the way that your army, resources, and advancements disappear when you begin each short scenario.  You start off on a map, build all of the available upgrades, and then go complete your objective in about 35 minutes.  Then, you go to the next map, and you have to ?research? all of your advancements again and repeat the process.  The addictiveness that you get from gradually becoming more powerful isn?t there.  It just doesn?t seems like there is much to do in this game.  You build up your ?army?, which is more like a platoon since it is limited to a small size, and then direct it to a spot on the map.  I found it impossible to get wrapped up in this game, since the usual strategy game flow is nonexistent.The size of the game makes it more like a tactics game (ala ?Commandos? or ?Freedom Force?), but the inability to slow or pause the game limits how much you can micromanage your units in battle.  So, what you end up with in the end, is a combination of strategy, tactics, and role-playing that is simple and shallow in all of them.  That is why I never felt compelled to play this game for more than an hour or so before playing something else.  I would give this game 3 stars, but ?Warcraft 3? is a quality title, and at the very least, you should try out the demo.  But in the end, I don?t think that this game is worthy of all of the accolades being heaped upon it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2003"}

I rented it to see if I liked it, which I did but the downside is, I already beat it.  You control the Prince, who sometimes has smart a$$ remarks to the Princess ... but who wouldn't?  Sometimes, you really do hate her.  The weapons are a sword and the dagger which gives you the power to turn back time with the sand.  I loved the fact that in this game there wasn't really any HUGE bad guy (except the end which was a disappointment but more on that later) ... mostly, you fight regular enemies, only they come in 3s and 4s and are at times extremely difficult.  It would be hard not to use any sand circles.  You will also have to turn back time if the Princess dies in battle.  The game is mostly adventure, climbing walls, using polls to swing from ... a puzzling game.  The puzzles aren't nearly as hard as some in other games but they are still mind boggling and could have you wondering for hours.  There isn't a need for a guide in this game, unless you really REALLY need one, at save points you see a \"vision\" where is basically shows you what is to come.  If you pay close attention to the vision, you should know what to do.  As I said earlier, the final enemy was a disappointment, an old sorceror who is extremely EASY to beat.  Especially after he says 'any last words to the Princess?', he just stands there, I didn't know what to do so I started hitting him with my sword and to my surprise, it worked!  It's a must play, a game you could play on and on and never get tired of it.  Try mastering it after you've beaten it - set challenges for yourself such as, don't use any sand during such and such, and so on.  It's a great game, short (only took me 8-9 hours to beat), but nonetheless a good buy, it's cheap on Amazon so I would recommend buying it, I will.  I cannot WAIT for the sequel!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2004"}

This is good, because the main \"AC\" storyline is so convoluted and confusing at this point that a departure feels like a breath of fresh air. There's still weird story moments that are hard to piece together and follow, but \"Black Flag\" is very much about putting you in the shoes of a pirate named Edward, and seeing what kind of trouble he can get into. As Edward, you gain command of a ship fairly early on, allowing you to sail the open seas and engage in some very exciting naval battles. Some enemy ships are tough though, and require an equally tough upgraded ship to overcome. The gorgeous tropical open-world of \"Black Flag\" is gigantic, with tons of large and small islands to explore, each with an insane number of collectibles and side-content. It can be very satisfying to slowly conquer one piece of the map at a time, progressively upgrading your equipment and your ship to becoming the ultimate pirate. It's also a little too slow at times, with so much to do that the game can feel extremely repetitive toward the end. Having too much can also be considered a good thing, and I might also consider this my favorite game in the series.--- 4.5 STARS ---","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2014"}

{"product_name":"B000JLIXIG","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Great Shooter Title for the PS3","reviewText":"Resistance - Fall of Man is a first person shooter that combines World War II era environments with Doom-like horrific enemies to fight. It also offers great online multiplayer gameplay.The plot is that, around the time of World War II, enemies attacked the world, starting with Russia and moving westward through Europe and England. In the 50s, the US launched a counter-attack, landing in England. You're fighting, at least to start with, with WWII era weapons and outfits through the streets of England.Let's start with the graphics. The game goes for a very Call of Duty style of look - not quite realistic, more \"cartooney\" or stylized. Textures are smoothed out, some objects are simplified. That's not to say this is a Disney kiddie look. The monsters are grimey and nasty looking, the war-torn streets are very gritty. If anything, because this is set in a WWII type atmosphere, much of the game is brown, grimy and shell-shocked.The HUD is reasonably well done and not intrusive. A small series of bars on the left indicates your health. An equally small but useful display on the right tracks your ammo, magazines and grenades.The sound leans towards epic thundering scores, a la Gladiator or Conan. Players who love heavy rock music might not enjoy this, but I actually love this kind of music. I own both of the soundtracks I mentioned :). So to me, this really draws you into the atmosphere. The yells, gun noises and so on seem relatively realistic to help you feel you're really in the middle of a fight. I also like that, during gameplay, it's usually done without music. If I'm trying to sneak somewhere and listen for enemy movement, I don't want that objective made difficult by a soundtrack.Gameplay itself is typical FPS fare. You can crouch, jump over things, zoom in on your enemy, throw grenades, strafe, and so on. Your friends and enemies are rather good about taking cover and not just rushing an enemy head-on. There are a few situations which seem quite scripted - if your pals are meant to die, you could play perfectly and take out every enemy quickly and your friends will still be killed by mysterious off-screen snipers. Still, the game needs to keep you on course for the plot so this is to be expected.Checkpointing is reasonably good, although sometimes it sends you further back then you might like to start again. Healing is done via canisters you find, but depending on your skill you might wish there were more canisters scattered around :). That's why they have 3 levels of difficulty here.The interactivity with your environment is pretty impressive. Say your enemy is hiding behind a car. You can shoot out the car's windows and then shoot the enemy through the open space. Or you can shoot the car to damage it, and have it explode a la the infamous 'red exploding barrels' found in most shooting games. If you shoot at a window a few times, it will first crack, then pieces will fall out.Not only is the game great in single player mode, but you can play co-op with a friend at your home, or online in larger groups with friends or strangers from around the world. This helps turn the game from a play-for-a-few-months-at-home style game to a play-eternally-with-friends-online game.Well recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2006"}

I have seen them go from fairly easy to play intuitive games that younger kids could easily play to a game that even harder core gamers are struggling with. I am not a hard core gamer, but I'm no slouch either. I like a game to be challenging like the next player, but retain that fun element that keeps on giving by way of beatable missions and challenges. In the beginning, Lego games were a lot simpler right down to the dialog which was basically mumbles. Players, especially kids could figure out what to do and where to go without too much difficulty, challenges were fun and beatable. With Lego Marvel Superheroes a new level of difficulty has been reached. Why Tt got away from their roots is a big question for many. Maybe to appease big time hard core gamers who thought the earlier games were not worth the money because they were too easy. Who knows. All I do know is that the Lego games have gotten to the point that they are not much fun any more.There have been many reports of games freezing. I have been fortunate in that I have not had that happen to me yet. I have had characters get stuck in simple areas and not be able to get out. In the free world of New York City this is not too much of a problem as you can just switch to the other character and play on, or return to the Heli-Carrier. Sometimes the other character will eventually free itself and appear where you've gotten off to. Otherwise you have to listen to them grunt repeatedly as they try to get out of where they are. I also have frustrations with characters not performing as expected when needed. Sometimes this can be avoided by selecting a different character. Getting used to the free world map takes a little time but is well worth your effort if you want to understand where to go in most cases. Characters, Vehicles, and Side Missions that you complete disappear from the map generally. So as you play and complete tasks the map gets cleaner. I have had task icons reappear and I would go play them only to find that I only get a stud. There is a bus token for example under the expressway you have to use jumping walls to get to a token up in a box at the top. I obtained this bus yet the icon still appeared on the map. Another is a character token you get by blasting a frozen Spiderman on the roof of a building. This icon reappears as well. There are probably more. Just a small section of New York is visible at first on the map, you should fly all over the whole island including the prison island and Ellis island to reveal all of the map areas and their mission markers.In past games, the developers were very good with giving you hints as to where to go, what to do, and who to select to get the task done. This made the game very intuitive. This is lacking a lot in this game. Many missions are a bit self explanatory, others you have to think about for a while, and others there are some hints by the commend center on the Heli-Carrier. But there are quite a few missions where the player has no idea what to do, and who to use. I have a green female character to get on the east side. I go to the location, and there is a metal platform that goes up to the railroad tracks. The token finder arrow (A red brick extra), shows the character to be under this platform or the railroad. I've used dozens of characters to try to move or destroy the platform to no avail. This character is not in any of the hint guides so I am stuck and cannot figure out what to do. At first I got stuck on the JJ/Peter Parker missions. Getting to a location and not knowing what to do is frustrating. The Trax character wanted a Lion for his show on a roof top. It was not clear at all on how to get the Lion up on the roof. One had to search surrounding buildings and find a ramp that was not exactly obvious unless you knew what it was for. A stud trail would have helped a lot here. Talking about stud trails. These too were poorly designed. In one mission you had to use Wolverine and find dig spots. But the dig spots were not obvious and out in the open, you needed to find the special spot that triggered the characters special ability. But this required you to break stuff near by to reveal this trigger. This was a big area so you could be breaking stuff for a long time. Once you found the first one and dug it up a stud trail was obvious, but when you followed them they abruptly ended in the middle of a large walkway, and you could not see the next spot. Once you found it and dug it up, another stud trail appeared, but the camera ended up behind a tree so you didn't see it, and when you went to search you didn't know which trail to follow as they lined the route with studs on all sides. When you finally figured out where to go because this stud trail ended in the middle of nowhere too, the next dig produced an arrow as a hint, but the arrow was so poorly done you could not tell which direction it was pointing in. This type of poor design was apparent in several areas. There was also a DeadPool character that would show you the way around New York and take you to your next destination once you selected it in the map. Many times he would take you right to where you needed to go and it was obvious. But other times he would stop in locations nowhere near where your next task was to start so you ended up frantically searching for something you didn't know how it looked or what it even was. Sometimes he stopped on a street, and the location was way up on a roof. I still have missions that I don't know what I'm doing wrong or what to do. I have gold statues near Fisk Tower. One is on the roof and several surrounding the building on the streets, and one inside. I've blasted them all and never got anything. Other missions don't work like this either. Up near X-Mansion you have a woman who's dog has buried his toy and she needs you to find it and dig it up. Use Wolverine and follow the studs. I dig up all of the spots and follow the studs back to her and she just starts the mission over. I never find a dog toy to pick up even though the studs lead me back to her.There are missions where its impossible to find what your looking for. On the Heli-Carrier your supposed to find a lost document. The DeadPool guide takes you to the middle rear of the deck. You can look for ever on that deck and you'll never find that document. Its stuck, hidden under debris, on the intake vent under the carrier. You have to fly down off the back edge, see the well hidden debris and remove it, then use a different character to get it out of the intake. Why not make it a little harder??? Another is a crewman on the carrier that has lost a companion during a game of hide and seek. You need to find him. The DeadPool guide takes you to the left front near some guns and that is it. It's not even close to where the character actually is located. You have to go to the edge of the carrier there, and go right and traverse all the way around the engine, there you'll see nothing. You have to somehow know your supposed to use a character to make this guy appear because he is invisible. Ridiculous.Then there are the controls. Touchy is putting it mildly. As your running or flying just the slightest movement of the stick causes your character to go wildly where you don't want them to go. In New York on the streets this is a nightmare as there are people, vehicles, and objects everywhere and they love to get in your way and cut you off. Running is not too bad if you stay on the middle of the road. But driving, forget it, its a lesson in frustration. Its not impossible if you are not in a timed event, and you can crawl little bit at a time to your destination. But a timed event, forget it, you'll be lucky to finish in a dozen dozen tries or more if you finish at all. Vehicles are nearly impossible to control, and aircraft are worse. There sadly are many timed events, mostly races in this game. Some are just running events. These used to be a decent challenge until in this game where they made them so long and complex you cannot finish them in the time they allow. Many times they go from one area or building to others. This is where characters fail to do what you want them to do. They will start to fly instead of jumping down, or they will fail to grab a rope etc. There should be precious few of these timed events and they should be much more forgiving. Then there is flying with characters like Iron Man. Its impossible to properly go up and down. He goes left and right fine, but the controls are so anemic on the up and down, you can forget most flying challenges.Outlined above are some of the frustrations I've had with this game so far. I've completed 75% of the game and I am down to the timed events and races which I have not even wasted my time on. Tt needs to go back to the roots of the Lego games and make them simple and fun like they used to be. A few minikits, a decent grouping of characters to obtain, and some red and gold bricks, maybe 10 Red and 50 Gold. Its obvious that a lot more thorough testing during development is needed as well. Too many things don't work at all or work improperly. Clues and hints are missing, and missions have too many hidden tricks. Is it a good game, yes, but not for $50. Maybe $25 is a better bargain so when you discover you cannot complete it because its too complex then you won't be out so much cash. Is this game for kids. Unless they are master gamers, no, not with this one. Its for kids only in subject matter and title.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2013"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs.

{"product_name":"B0022TNO7I","description":"","reviewerName":"HeavyMetalSushi","summary":"Even Better Than I Thought It Would Be!","reviewText":"I was excited when I first heard about Max Payne 3 being in development, because I remember having played the 1st and 2nd games back on Ps2, and I love most of what Rockstar Games puts out on average.  I remember thinking how it was about time that they brought Max Payne back, and at the very least tied it off in a trilogy, though I'm sure if it's popular enough they'll make another one down the road, which it seems to me that overall it's been a success.After first seeing some screenshots of the game as it was still in production and then eventually some videos, it looked really good, but I wasn't expecting I'd enjoy it as much as I have.  The graphcis & cinematics are more beautiful than I thought I had remembered seeing in video & such.  The voice work is overall pretty good, most especially Max's of course.  I was glad they were able to bring the original voice actor back in, because it just wouldn't have been the same without him, and the narrative is classic Max although even more descriptive and awesome than the original games...love it.  The story seems to be pretty solid, and I like that now they've taken the story in a different direction.  Max is older now, living in a new place, and finds himself in a completely different type of mess than the prior games.  I do like the flashback scenes too, when Max first meets his now partner in private security, Passo and trying to escape the mob.Gameplay is a lot of fun.  I love the return of bullet time (it wouldn't be Max Payne without it), and the addition of shooting from cover and shooting prone are awesome additions, and often times very helpful.  Different situations work best from behind cover, while other times it's better to dive and shoot, especially with the bullet time so you can easily take down several opponents before landing and speed picks back up.  Plus, it's very nice to be able to turn while you're in the air or on the ground to shoot other enemies in a pinch.  That was sometimes a problem in the original 2 games, because after you dived and landed, if there were enemies behind you, you would have to wait for max to get back up and then turn around, all the while they're shooting you full of holes.  Not the case in 3, as you can easily flip around and shoot enemies from whatever direction they're shooting at you from.  It's quite helpful.  2 thumbs up to the exciting, intense gameplay in Max Payne 3.Overall, I would have to say that this game is well done, as if I had any doubt in my mind, being that Rockstar made it...I figured it would be good, but I hadn't realized it would be quite as good as it has been so far.  This review does not contain much feedback on the online multiplayer, as I have not played much of it.  I am typically more of a solo player and tend to prefer story modes mostly, but I have been venturing out of my box a little lately though and trying my hand at a little online play.  I have a friend in Texas who I have played a little bit of the death match with online and it was pretty enjoyable...playing online, I typically tend to prefer playing with friends, whether just with friends or with friends and others.  I don't know if it's just a comfort thing or the fact that I can't stand some of the b.s. from various players online, but that's just my personal preference.  I do very much enjoy coop though, and eventually my friend and I will probably try that out.  What I have tried of the death match in Max Payne 3 though, it does seem pretty awesome.  Those of you out there that like shooters and enjoy playing online would probably love it.  I like it well enough, but again, I am often more of a solo player so I will probably only play onlineonce in a while.All around though, props to Rockstar for yet again making an awesome game!  A own a select number of Rockstar's classics on prior systems and have been collecting their titles on Playstation 3.  I own the complete editions of GTA 4, Red Dead Redemption, and LA Noire...all amazing games...and I venture to guess that I will likely eventually buy the complete edition of Max Payne 3 as well, judging by how much I've enjoyed it.  I think the only Ps3 Rockstar game I don't own is Midnight Club Los Angeles, but then again, outside of Mario Kart or whatever, I really am not a big fan of racing games, so don't take that as saying that Midnight Club isn't a fun game...I just don't care for racers.  The rest of their games though, I absolutely love, and I highly recommend them all to gamers out there who love shooters and quality sandbox style action/adventure games if you haven't played any particular one of them...well worth the coin in my opinion.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"Vynny \"Vynrod\"","summary":"So very nearly...","reviewText":"I'm a Halo fanboy and have enjoyed the franchise since the original H:CE over 10 years ago. Having also played the recent revamp of Halo CE made by 343, I felt confident that leaving Halo 4 in their hands would result in a great game. And it has. So for Halo fans, whether you're and old hand at playing MC or a recent adopter you can rest assured that H4 is well worth your time.Having said that I've been enjoying the company of Master Chief for over ten years as you probably have, and they are several tiny but important things I expect from a Halo game that I feel 343 missed.I'll give you an example - check pointing. In previous Halos the game would checkpoint many, many times in a mission, even if it was just seconds after a previous checkpoint. Why? So you would never have to hear the same audio speech twice if you died. Halo 4 does not do this and with its slightly increased difficulty it resulted in me hearing Cortana, marines and others say the same thing multiple times after dying.Cut scenes is another point of contention; the game seems to be rendering them in real time (for about 90% of the game) using the in-game engine but defaults to the staple assault rifle for MC to hold regardless of what you were actually wielding and the cut scene also wipes any evidence of your play up to that time. Again, in previous Halos the game would remember the battle field's status and say you parked a banshee near a cut scene point, it would BE in that cut scene along with the weaponry and destruction. Not so in H4.Speaking of which, by far the biggest fault I found in the single player campaign was the disappearing weapons. Walk ten yards away from an area and usually (but not always) the weapons will have gone. This is unforgivable. I remember traversing back many times to find the right weapon for the job and sadly now you only have to turn a corner for them to have vanished. Besides you can't really backtrack now as doors often close forever behind you with no explanation other than to trap you in an area full of bag guys.As a final gripe and this is aimed at contemporary games in general, what's the deal with 'playable' cut scenes? Halo never did this and it felt very out of place to follow Quicktime Events in this franchise. Pushing forward - your only choice, to crawl along a floor towards a goal during a cut scene adds nothing. Just passively play the cut scene and then let me shoot stuff and drive around!The campaign itself does start off slow harking back to the original Halo's library with many corridors and repetitious architecture. Thankfully you soon get outside and it starts to get fun. Sadly driving warthogs and scorpions is far too brief and I wished there was more of that.So it looks like this review is just a bunch of gripes and I disliked the game. That's not the case, and despite my pedantic grumblings I really enjoyed the SP of Halo 4 and am already running through it solo again.

At the time I was a little kid playing this demo over and over again. I couldn't afford games at the time. Even though that was a demo this game Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zero is something like that but with more. It's not a full game its a prologue. The price might seem a lot for something short. I didn't mind that. I knew what I was paying for. Once i received it first thing I did was played it. As I played it and notice all the possibilities I knew I could replay this game over and over and still find some fun with it. I past the story part of the game in about 2 hours. The cut scenes in the end leave it open for the later game that comes out next early year. Once the credits rolled I unlocked some game modes I didn't even know it had. This made me more happy because all I kept hearing was once you passed the story that's it. Never new there was more to this game. There is things to collect and unlocked. even cassettes that will give background story to the game. Like I said if your mind the story being short but don't mind replaying some of the side missions and trying different ways to pass them then take shot at this game. if you still skeptical with all this review then wait till price lowers.Pros:GraphicsA lot of ways to pass missionsUnlockables items and collectiblesConsShort prologue storyOverall I gave this a 4 stars because I know Ill be playing this game for awhile. I know the story is short but don't let that stop you from playing this. If you waiting for price drop then wait but it's a most play for Metal Gear Fans just like me. If you played them all games like me you will enjoy this game. This game was made for new comers and fans of the series.

{"product_name":"B00006418I","description":"Wouldn't it be nice to play games without a cord stretching across your  living-room floor, especially if you have little kids or large dogs in your  household? Nintendo's Wave Bird isn't the first wireless controller ever brought  to market, but it's a whole lot better than what came before. You may remember a  brief fad a few years ago with spotty infrared devices. These units failed  because they were a lot heavier than standard controllers, and also because they  required a direct line of sight between the controller and the infrared  receiver. The Wave Bird is much lighter (it weighs a bit more than a regular  controller) and uses radio frequency signals for reliable game control at  distances of up to 20 feet. Unless your playing on a stadium-size TV screen,  that should be more than enough. The unit will last for about 100 hours of use  on just two AA batteries and has 16 channel frequencies, so you'll easily be  able to hook up four controllers without interference.","reviewerName":"Stephen J. Carlson","summary":"The first wireless controller of its kind!","reviewText":"For those of you who have used wireless controllers in the past, the Nintendo Wavebird controller might seem too good to be true.  However, this controller lives up to every bit of its hype.Obviously, the main reason to get this controller is that it is wireless.  Imagine how much nice it would be to have a Gamecube party with four wireless controllers with no cords to get tangled up!  That can happen with the Wavebird.The wavebird includes the two required AA batteries (Maxell brand), that go into the back of the controller.  The sensor plugs into your GCN, but it does not cover up the memory card slot.  The controller itself is almost the same weight as the standard controller.  The only drawback is that the controller has no rumble feature, but I do not miss it too much becuase Nintendo left it out to save battery life.  The controller has a square, orange power light that fades as the battery wears out so you can avoid having your controller suddenly go dead when you are about to beat that last level of your favorit Nintendo game.Nintendo conservatively claims that this product has a range of 20 feet, however, I have tested it and it works much further than that.  The greatest innovation about this for wireless controllers is that it does not use infrared technology like previous wireless controllers.  It uses a radio-like signal similiar to that of a cordless phone, allowing the controller to still function, even when there are things blocking the path to the receiver.This controller is an excellent value and it is a first-party product made by Nintendo which means it meets Nintendo's excellent standards of high quality, and it even comes with a 12-month warranty.  The only improvements would be a rumble feature and maybe more colors (it only comes in gray currently).  ...this accessory is a must-have for any serious Gamecube owners.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2002"}

Okay, he played with it a lot, I joined in for some co-op, and then he played a lot more by himself.  Here's his review, followed by mine.Son's Review:\"This is a very unique game.  I played the Wii version of this game.  As a 12 year old boy I enjoy games like Call of Duty, but I very much so enjoy this game.  The game can be played as single or co op game.  You have to buy other figurines, but the game can be played with just one if you are good.  Each character has its on life, so the more people you have, the more chances to finish the mission you get.  Overall the game gets a 5 stars from me, it is very well thought out.\"Dad's Review:I can definitely see myself spending some bucks to buy some additional characters.  According to my son, there are 8 types of characters, and you only start with 3 types (magic, water, and tech).  Others include fire, plant, and 3 others I don't recall.  I like the drop-in and -out co-op, the ability for character's skills and equipment and cash (coins) to be shared across multiple saves, and that there's NO \"friendly fire\".  Because of this, I was able to join into my son's game, use his character \"Trigger Happy\", and basically shoot at anything that moves (well, and anything that doesn't move, too!).  No ammo, no one gets hurt by mistake, you fall off a ledge, you magically reappear, and my son had already leveled up Trigger Happy to level 3, so I was happy.  The camera moves with you, expanding as the characters move away from each other, within limits, with a slightly skewed top-down angle.Overall, game was fun, and for me, mindless pleasure.  Again, I generally like to shoot like crazy (maybe from my Gauntlet days), and I'm hoping for a machine gun upgrade for Trigger Happy...Generously recommended, designed for younger kids, but older kids and parents can enjoy it as well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2011"}

It has always been a blast for me to play these games in the past even if I was never really any good at them. I picked it up today and thought I would share my thoughts on the changes and general goings on in the game.Gameplay:Solid as ever. And deceptively simple as ever. I'm not going to go into the nitty gritty as most of those interested in Sim City already know how the games work I'm going to more or less focus on the changes.1. Zoning: You don't have to pay for it anymore, zoning is free. You can only zone along a road and there are only 3 types of zones, Commercial Residential and Industrial. Gone are the days of three different types of each zone, instead your choices and city planning can change the land value, which upgrades the zones automatically in that area. To offset the cost of no longer having to zone, roads have gotten quite expensive. It's best to start with a cheap road and upgrade the road later (Which has become MUCH easier now)2. Power/Water: SO much better this time around. Instead of the power and water being moved by a weird pipe system or powerlines that magically didn't have to be everywhere, the roads carry power and water (As they would in real life in general). This is why everything must be connected to a road.3. Roads: There are many different types from dirt road to 6 lane highways. Each road supports a certain type of Zone Density (Low Medium or High) And can be drawn in many more interesting shapes this time. Circles, Arcs, Free line, Squares, etc... It's a lot of fun to build crazy roads, even if they aren't as functional.4. City Buildings: These are the schools, Police Stations, Fire stations etc... These have gotten a massive upgrade in this game. Not only can you build them, but yuou can upgrade them with different add-ons and options to increase their ability to do whatever it is they do. For instance you can add more ambulances to the hospitals to increase reponse times. If you have too much of a service you can even offer it to neighboring cities...5. Which brings me to the Multiplayer aspect, Regions: You do not have to play with others you can chose to do so alone, you still have to be connected (Deal with it). Each region has 3+ cities in it and you can control them all, trade resources and utilities between them, attract tourists from one city to the next with attractions etc... The whole point of this is no longer do you have to have EVERYTHING in one city. You can focus on say a Casino City, or a Factory City or a Power City that provides power tot he whole region. It's a very interesting concept and one i look forward to playing with my friends.6. Last but not least is the Micro-Management and Information Displays. Sim City has outdone themselves on this one. Each screen for information is a visual representation of all the information on the map itself. For instance if you wanted to see how bad Crime was in your city you click the Crime Display, and the whole city will turn white, accept for blotches of color where the crime is worse. If you wanted to see the happiness of your Sims click the Happiness layer and a 3D Bar Graph will appear on Every Single House, Shop and Factory, showing their happiness, and likelihood of upgrading. It's a fantastic tool and I do very much enjoy it. However, if you liked the old Spreadsheet look that isn't here this time around and you may not be as pleased.Graphics:The Graphics aren't ground breaking, but they are charming and fit the game perfectly. Buildings have a nice amount of detail on them, you can see what every single sim in the game is thinking about and/or doing if you click on them. It's fun to watch the cars moving back and forth on the roads, see giant buildings built from the ground up, etc... This means the game will not have much trouble running on lower end computers. They have also added weather effects like Wind, Rain, Night and Day, and others.Random Thoughts:I am once again not surprised dozens of folks here and on MetaCritic are giving it a 1/5 just because it's online only and they haven't even played the game. But one of them did have a complaint that I have seen others talking about which is City Size. They are smaller than the largest cities in Sim City 4 there is no denying that. However in the video I watched Maxis mentioned that each city is the same size, and is twice the size of the smallest area from SC4. This works for me since I never built anything bigger than those tiny cities (LIke I said I like the game I'm just bad at it!). So while I can see why to some this is an issue, I believe they are forgetting that the focus is more on region play than 1 city. So I think it will balance out.All in all I think the game is fantastic, It is new player friendly, while still being difficult enough to keep you constantly balancing things out in the city for your sims. While I have never been in the negative on earnings in the game, things do get real expensive, real fast so you will always need more money!EDIT 1:My views on the gameplay have not changed, I still think the game itself is a 5/5, however EA in this case deserves a 0/5. While I am patient and can wait for servers and such, I also know how frustrating it is for many many others who just want to play the game. The part that bugs me is they have removed certain gameplay features, namely Cheetah Speed (Why?) not that it's a HUGE impact but I still have to ask why. The other part I don't understand, and I haven't figured out if it's Me doing something wrong or the servers not working well, but the cities in my regions... don't seem to be connecting. I buy power from a neighboring city but I don't receive it, nor water or Sewage removal. No one is commuting for work or shopping. And when i look at region view, the other city says it only has 1000 sims in it, despite it having a population of 75k. So EA, It pains me to say it, but you have failed miserably. I'm sure this will all be cleared up eventually but it is quite a bother at the moment, I sadly can't recommend anyone getting the game. yet. Keep in mind it's not the online only infrastructure i have an issue with, it's EAs failure to get their servers working... i feel sorry for Maxis =(.EDIT 2:My friend and I were able to play this game for 20+ hours this weekend, no server hiccups nor lag issues so I think they are starting to get the server issues taken care of. The biggest hinderence was the lack of Cheetah speed, but that too will be returned sometime soon (Still not an exscuse, it's a shame All this serer stuff happened). Those issues aside, the game is a blast. To those who think it's easier than the other SimCity games, it isn't. it may not have some of the problems of the earlier games but it has invented a whole new world of issues. Keeping all your sims employed and satisfied shoppers has become a challenge. On one side you create enough jobs for them and they are happy, but there isn't enough shopping, so you create more shops but that creates more jobs, and then the shops have no workers and close down... That is task one. Then once you start to have a bussling town, all your buildings upgrade to Skyscrapers and you get a massive amount of unfilled jobs compared to population. So you have to rebalance! Then the Traffic issues set in... it's madness! As for City Size... if they were any bigger I think at this time I would go crazy, at least until I figure out how to even get this size working. The cities are meant to be made together, one city can't do everything. I like to think of the region as my city, people will commute for work and shopping, while you can sell power and water between the cities. There are two issues i currently have1. The game doesn't explain much in the tutorial or anywhere, they say Busses are a great way to eliviate traffic... they don't. Maybe I am placing the bus stops wrong I don't know but traffic is ALWAYS my biggest problem because emergency vehicles, trash vehicles etc... can't get anywhere in time and things go wrong.2. Servers still have a bit of a delay. When playing with my friend I had the city that provided the power to the two of us, and it would take 4-5 minutes for power to update when i added a new Power plant or part to my power plant. It doesn't effect much, but it is noticable. I'm guessing that's either how it has to be or it that will be fixed eventually (Note, this is part of the Online portion wether the game had an offline more or not, since we were playing multiplayer).All in all I still love the game.I keep going back to Sim City to try new things, see if an idea works, see if it fails miserably. All part of the fun! Then i look up at the clock to see that 4 hours have gone by...Final Rating of game 4.5/5 (rounded to 5)Final rating of EA  -1/5 (EA has failed)Final Rating: 4/5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2013"}

The layout and map of the ship are super realistic.You play as a third person as Isaac Clark, and you wear an upgradeable suit that shows your health via illuminated LED lights on the spine of the suit. Very cool. You have a holographic HUD that you can bring up at any time to show your inventory, map & objectives. There are save stations throughout the game positioned almost everywhere you start hoping for one.Dead Space is just awesome! And to top it off I bought my firstDualshock 3 Wireless Controller, and what a cool thing I've been depriving myself of. The first affect was when I stomped on something. I never thought that a silly controller vibration could add much to the gaming experience....but don't knock it til ya try it certainly applies here.Gotta say, I'm not sure that watchingDead Space: Downfallfirst was such a great idea. It was actually kind of a spoiler; I kinda had to play like I was able to watch a log of the Ishimura's events before landing on it.Sick. Game. Did you like the movieAliens? Do you like to be scared? Add this to your cart, but prepare for an adventure that's perhaps more intense than any movie you've ever watched or any game that you've ever played.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2009"}
{"product_name":"B002I0KOSI","description":"","reviewerName":"Sloopydrew","summary":"BioShock Infinite -- In the End, Just Another Shooter(TM)","reviewText":"BioShock Infinite: Art, or Just Another Shooter(TM)Only a couple of hours into BioShock Infinite, I made a post stating that the art design was second to none, the story was compelling, etc. After finishing the game I'd still stand by all of that (only not as enthusiastically). I'd also stand by my statement that caused so much controversy -- the gameplay in BioShock Infinite is mediocre.Here's why (if you haven't completed the game yet, you may want to scroll down to the \"END SPOILERS\" section to read the rest of the spoiler-free review):SPOILERS(including end battle spoilers)The gameplay is limited like an FPS from the early 90s or a generic military shooter (Call of Duty) from this century. There's nothing to do, gameplay-wise, but shoot. And shoot. And shoot some more. Yes, you get to combine vigor/plasmids/whatever-the-kids-are-calling-it-these-days, and that's fun for a couple of hours but you find the most powerful combo and basically upgrade it to full and stick with it. Same with the weapons.Then, after an incredibly awesome Shantytown section and revolution section the game stops even trying to be something more and becomes Just Another Shooter. Wave after wave of bad guys. Pretty much non-stop from the section where you have to find the 3 tears to the end. And then there's that end.Oh, that end ...Until the end section the game is INSANELY easy (on Medium settings, which is how I always play through a game the first time, as story is at least as important to me as the challenge -- which is why I save the hardest difficulties for last). Then the end puts you in that airship which is at first simply monotonous and then devolves into something awful. You finally get to the top deck (I laughed when -- after an hour of non-stop shooting, Elizabeth says, \"Only 3 more decks\") and everyone and their mother is shooting at the power core thing to take it down. It's total overkill.There's nearly as many bad guys to fight in the airship and around the airship than there was the rest of the game. Again, total overkill and all art goes out the window and a generic FPS takes its place. Sure, you can call in Big Bird, but Big Deal? No wonder Infinite didn't have multiplayer -- it didn't need it -- the last third of the game is nothing but multiplayer you play offline. Waves of enemies and shooting and swearing -- just without the fifteen-year-old boys swearing at their mommies over a headset.ENDSPOILERSAnyway, I'd still this game a 5 out of 10 for the art design. But gameplay wise? It's no better than a 3 out of 10 (and that's being generous). The much hyped skylines were a useless gimmick to stop people from noticing this was Just Another Shooter(TM).I have literally never been this disappointed with a game. I loved the first BioShock. I thought the second was decent (with FAR better gameplay mechanics and variety than Infinite). The third was pretty and had some compelling ideas that reminded me of debates I was involved in back in college. Nothing that thought-provoking, but despite what Ken Levine and eager-to-please critics claimed, this is just a game, after-all (too bad that I, like so many, wanted it to be something more).BioShock Infinite isn't revolutionary. The first half makes you think it MAY be, but in the end, it ends up being no more than a mediocre shooter that drags on at least two hours too long and runs out of ideas 2/3rds of the way through (if that). A game with the potential of being a game-changer (pun intended) ends up being nothing more than a bore. A shame.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2013"}
{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"Reviewman","summary":"Epic RNG endgame fail","reviewText":"First of all - GW2 is the most innovative MMO's we've seen in years, you should buy it, it's amazing, you'll have fun and wish every other MMO works like it does.Where GW2 goes horribly wrong is it's implementation of the loot dropping Random Number Generator (RNG), a terrible Magic Find (MF) gear stat that may actually work against your loot drops, and a Development team that seems to want to cause chaos and depression by giving away legendary precursor weapons during one time events that you may not be able to attend. Seriously.Top end gear is extremely easy to get, maybe too easy. And that's a problem because it's really hard to enjoy instances when they offer nothing more than cosmetic items. There's very few reasons to enter an instance, usually its because someone needs a stack of tokens to craft a legendary weapon or finish the storyline quest in the very last instance of the game. The game has zero group finding utility and someone awesome actually set up a private website to provide this functionality. If you don't have some like minded friends with you, your best bet is to grab any PUG into any instance you can get into. This is the only way to instance in GW2.After hitting 80, GW2 becomes the most epic grinding game of all time. You'll grind out enough karma currency to obtain karma gear, grind gold to buy things from the trading post to complete your set, or begin the most massive grinding experience you'll find in video games and start collecting things for your legendary weapon (which happens to be cosmetic). This is where the RNG mentioned above comes in. Expect to spend hours grinding mobs to get a single item for your legendary. Items that you need 750 of. And there's two dozen of these types of items you'll need. Now you could grind enough gold to simply buy these things, but folks are playing the auction house like the stock market and items used in legendary crafting explode in price week after week. The market will outpace any amount of gold you can collect. It's controlled by the rich and they make lots of gold doing nothing while you grind to no end. So for the casual gamer (20 hours a week), legendary weapons are unobtainable everyway you look at it. Which really means you're done gear wise.So what's next? Create an alt to do it all again, explore, do achievements or engage in World vs. World (WvW). WvW seems to be where everyone has ended up. It's basically a huge zerg that moves across the map taking control of everything. I don't think this was intended, but if you're not part of the zerg expect to die when it finds you. Most times you won't see it coming, the game engine can't keep up and an entire army suddenly paints on top of you and you die. You can try to ninja around behind lines to capture stuff, but that feels really boring and the enemy just comes and flips it back again.So in my first paragraph I said you need to play this game, and you do. It'll change the way you look at MMO's forever. But don't expect an endgame. The framework was set for a great one, but there's so many problems with it right now the only endgame that exists is \"grind\". GW2 was promised to be a no-grind game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2013"}

You get a few weapons like a shotgun, SMG, assault rifle, grenades & grenade launcher, and the infamous dual handguns with the bottomless clip. Also, there are a bunch of \"rewards\" hidden throughout the levels and if a lot are collected you unlock new outfits and areas in Lara's Mansion. Oh, thats the other thing - you can run around Lara's Mansion.Whats good though is that this game places you back into ruins and tombs instead of trying to make Lara some special agent (Angel of Darkness anyone?). So you'll find yourself in areas such as Ghana, Bolivia, Nepal, Lara's homeland of England, and many other areas. Each level looks absolutley beautiful - especially the jungle looking stages. The water effects are magnificent, and the lighting is beautiful. The character models are alright, nothing spectacular with the exception of our main heroine herself.The music was superb. I can't really explain it.. it was just really good. Each stage has it's own song which fits beautifully with the level's culture and design..sso for instance in Nepal - a really empty & voide of life snow stage - it has gegorian chants which help intensify both the beauty AND the lonlieness of the level. You just have to hear it for yourself. The voice acting was GREAT and there are some really interesting and funny conversations between the characters at points.So whats Tomb Raider: Legends' downfall? Well for starters its extremley repetitive - you'll be doing pretty much the same thing in every stage. Secondly, its a pretty easy game. Thirdly, its very short; its only 7 missions long come on!, and lastly the gunfights are kind of lackluste r. The guns don't sound powerful, nor are they - I literally had to empty a clip with my assault rifle into a Jaguar before it keeled over - and they ae terribly inaccurate. Thankfully the targetting system is pretty right on.The ending to this game was interesting to say the least. You wind up at the stone dias after beating Amanda in her beast form. From there you place the ancient sword into the stone, the dias starts up, and you see your mother in a parallel universe doing the exact same thing you are. Amanda awakes and begins screaming to your mother for her to pull the sword out so the dias explodes while Lara tries to silence Amanda. Anyway, the mom pulls the sword out, the dias explodes, and Lara loses a chance to re-unite with her long lost mom.. so in a rage she threatens to kill Amanda at gunpoint. Amanda reveals that Lara's mom is in Avalon, Lara is so heated she begins shooting basically right next to Amanda to freak her out.. then she pistol whips her so hard she KOed Amanda. Then Lara says a great line, \"every breath you take from now on is a gift from me.\", and proceeds to make arrangements to see if she too can get to Avalon.To finish it up, Legend is a decent platforming game but really not worth the $50 price tag it carries. It's definitley worth playing, even with it's flaws. I suggest you rent it first.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2006"}

But after reading some reviews I decided to give it a chance and I am glad I did. Been playing for about 6 hours so far and it has yet to disappoint me. The combat system that I loved from Batman has made its way into a more hardcore style that has been improved upon greatly. From reversals to grabbing and throwing someone through any number of objects in the game there is always something a little different to do while in combat. The story itself is well told and I have been drawn into the game as well. Graphics are a bit dated but nothing to complain about at all. I like them more than I do Saints Row the Third. Even the movement around town while running is far more enjoyable than GTA4 was to me. You can jump over objects, climb up walls while keeping a fluid feel while exploring or chasing someone.Overall I have really enjoyed the game and it will definitely keep my attention until Borderlands 2 is released next month.Pros:Solid fighting system that feels like batman but much more diverse.Running around town is much more fun than other open world games.Story and acting are both top notch.Cons:Graphics are a bit dated but I still like it better than SR the ThirdNavigating the map can be a bit tricky","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00309XHD0","description":"","reviewerName":"Simmer \"itsme0209\"","summary":"Dud Space 2 ****REVISED","reviewText":"Let me start of by saying that I became a huge Dead Space fan shortly after only playing the 1st game in the series. I can honestly say it may very well be my favorite game of all time. And that's saying a lot being a fan of God of War, Final Fantasy 7, Zelda series, Resident Evil, etc. So...that being said, onto Dead Space 2.I haven't finished the game yet, but already I can tell the vibe is different. I started about 3 weeks ago, and I am only on chapter 6. Reason being is I am not as captivated to play this one in comparison to Dead Space 1 for quite a few reasons.Reason 1. This game is BEYOND REDICULOUSNESSISITY OF BEING DARK!!! I'm guessing this is what it would feel like to play a video game if I was Stevie Wonder, because I CANT SEE ANYTHING! Even after turning the game brightness up and my TV brightness up, I still am having problems seeing even well light rooms. I found a ton of threads with other people complaining about this same issue, so it is definitely not just me. I don't understand why they opted to make it so dark, but in comparison to the 1st game, seeing the aliens was much scarier than not seeing anything at all. Also, I LOVED EXPLORING in the first game. Because of the darkness and how difficult it is to see it is VERY frustrating to explore. I probably collected every power node possible in the first game, but I dont explore much in this game because its just too difficult to see anything. So the power nodes in my aresenal are definately not plentiful.2nd Reason, storyline. It seems like most games have this affinity to turn towards the clich&eacute; route of the ritualistic human cult story line. A very similar route Resident Evil took further in their story lines. It's quite old and boring. I wish they just left it alien oriented instead of turning towards religious type human outbreak scenario. Also, the brunt of this storyline seems to be James Bond conspiracy type.Reason 3, realism. I will say that I love how you have to stomp aliens in order to get your rewarded items for killing them, however....SOME OF THE MONSTERS DISAPPEAR AFTER KILLING THEM! I started by playing this game on the difficult setting but recently had to switch the to normal setting because after using my ammo on an onslaught of aliens that I cant even see because of the darkness factor, I would go around to collect my rewards, BUT MOST OF THE ALIENS WERE GONE!! It totally takes away from the realistic aspect of the game.Another specific scenario...I was out of ammo due to the reason above, and I opened a room that contained a bunch of dead bodies in it. I used my stasis to drag the bodies out of the room just incase there were any facehugging necropmorh spawning aliens in that room. Well, after dragging all the bodies out, I went back in the room, and POOF!!! All the bodies I dragged out were back in the room! And I didn't stray far. I was right outside the door the entire time. I've done this quite a few times in the first one and this has never happened.A few other points... When you die it starts you back pretty dang far from where you were. A bit annoying at times. The manual overriding wiring part is cool. It's very easy, but it was different. Nothing to make you say \"WOW\" over. There really isn't too much of anything new in the second game come to think of it.The ability to fly is new and pretty cool, but being on Chapter 6 already, there hasn't been too many parts that involved flying around.There also haven't been as many bosses so to say. It mainly just seems like a compilation of a ton of aliens being considered a 'boss', or ending of a chapter.Those issues alone has made the game less desirable to play and less enjoyable. This is a huge difference from the 1st game in which the PS3 controller was glued to my hand. I will still play it to the end since I bought it, but I may have to play the 1st one again to wash the remnants of the 2nd game from my mind.

Wait until the price comes down before you get it.*****REVISED JULY 2011OK....So now I played this game to the end and....IT ROCKS!!!I take back a lot of what I said.Dead Space is still one of the best games I have ever played!However....I do stand by a few things I said.The 1st game in the series in my opinion was still better.Because of that I up'ed this game 1 star from the previous 3 I had given it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2011"}

The only thing I did not like very much was the fact that you had to defeat Zemus/Zeromus at least twice to get into all of the bonus dungeons, and to go into any particular dungeon, you had to defeat Zeromus AGAIN with the particular character that dungeon belonged to. So if I wanted to sweep through the bonus dungeons more than once, I have to go all the way through the Moon to Zeromus again.

{"product_name":"B007VFHGZ4","description":"","reviewerName":"TheTruthHurts","summary":"Mediocre gameplay and story, but visually impressive...","reviewText":"As a tech demo: 4.5 starsAs a game: 3.5 starsTo begin, this is what I'd consider to be an overrated, mediocre game, outside of the connection that is built between the player and Lara (thanks primarily to her physical appearance, of course, which is indeed impressive and something that keeps our attention for more than fifteen minutes). From a gameplay perspective, it simply isn't anything special, the side characters and plot, at large, are largely forgettable, and the environments are mostly boring (forest, for example) (and let's not forget the glaring omission: \"tombs\" [which, of course, they'd pondered rectifying with this \"definitive\" release]).That said, on a competent PC, this is a gorgeous game. In spite of the recent \"definitive edition\" that has been released for the two \"new\" consoles, I remain confident that, given hardware requirements, this remains the best edition that money can buy (and at less than 1/6th the price, at present, it's a no-brainer for gaming-PC owners). I'd also add that anyone who claims that the \"new,\" \"definitive edition\" is somehow superior to \"PC maxed\" needs to read the below and apply common sense.Running two 670s in SLI (at 1200MHz [10% overclock, give or take]), this game's built-in benchmark pushes both cards to well over 80% utilization at 1080p/maxed (FXAA)/60fps (locked, without drops). That is more than four times the GPU power of XBOX ONE (thus, a smidgeon under three times the GPU power of PS4), ladies and gents. Thus, we can deduce that the PC edition, released long before the \"definitive edition\" (the game was designed to maximize newer PC GPU tech, then reduced by a factor of around 20x for the \"old\" consoles) requires approximately three times as much GPU power to be run at 1080p/60fps (again, at highest settings) as the PS4 edition, which, of course, fully taxes PS4's GPU (as XBOX ONE's weaker GPU can only run the game at an unsteady average of 40fps). In other words, if the PC edition were ported to PS4 as-is, PS4 would run 1080p/maxed/FXAA at around 20 frames per second. Logic therefore holds that since things were added to the \"definitive edition,\" much more was removed from \"PC maxed\" to facilitate 1080/60p on PS4 (consoles, in spite of what they try sell to console gamers, aren't magical; quite the opposite, in fact). Worse, the game is frequently CPU-limited, even when a 2500K @ 4.5 GHz is employed (that's around 3x the CPU power of both \"new\" consoles). In order to maintain 60fps, using the aforementioned CPU, I have to drop \"image detail\" (geometry, which is primarily CPU-dependent) to the middle setting (two steps below highest). As before, this directly implies that \"definitive\" has far less \"detail\" (geometry) displayed than \"PC maxed\" to maintain 1080/60p; it's simply common sense.In sum, then, mathematics work to show that the \"definitive\" edition would appear to be equivalent to running the game on PC on lower or even lowest settings, in many cases, in spite of the spiffy new facial geometry and \"skin texturing.\"Thus, when you see the game running on a PC with said GPU power, you'll understand that, as always, anything on PC is definitive; certain segments of this game represent the very best that is currently available, from a visual perspective (gimmicky though TressFX may be...), and no console with 1/3rd or less GPU and CPU power is going to be able to compete, period (and please spare me the obvious buzzword: \"optimization,\" try though you might to validate it with \"evidence\"). (\"The game was rebuilt from scratch\"...I sincerely doubt it, given the resources that that would have taken [this game is barely in the black]. The PC version was likely again used as the foundation, then again stripped down [with additional facial geometry and \"skin texturing\" added in] for yet another console release.)In short, if you have a competent gaming PC with something equivalent to at least a 670 (760, etc.), save $50 and buy the PC edition...it remains the \"definitive\" version of the game to own (especially when we can return to it at 4K/60fps in a year or two). Please feel free to ask any questions, but please also save any fanatical bitterness for Metacritic (where it belongs, these days). :)p.s. this game was a financial loss until just recently, hence, the \"definitive edition.\" What CD should have done was create a comparison between \"definitive\" and PC showing us not only what was added, *but the expense at which those additions came*, given what simple mathematics (as displayed above) work to very strongly imply. Would anyone buy the definitive edition on console? Sure they would...because console gamers cannot reconcile the higher initial investment of PC being recouped by *massive* savings in game costs over the \"life\" of the \"console.\" Try to deny it as they might, virtually all console gamers are really PC gamers; they simply want the most horsepower for their money (which is why XBOX ONE will come in a distant second to PS4, ultimately [hastening shortly after the Titanfall hype has passed])...and as such, they'll rationalize the purchase of the \"definitive edition\" as being \"near-PC\" or even \"better than PC,\" despite both of these statements being utterly fallacious.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2014"}

From graphics/environment to gameplay, to story, this game is about as well-rounded as you will find.There would not be enough room to go into detail about all of the positive points about this game, but here are some of the top performers:Graphics: By far the top feature in my mind. Clearly this game was designed to push the limits of the PS2. The result is a series of beautiful and immersive environments. You get the feeling you are standing in ancient Greece fighting frighteningly realistic enemies. Bosses in particular stand out as master achievements in gaming graphics.Gameplay: Nothing kills a game like a difficult control scheme and nothing makes a game like a truly intuitive one. This game offers a wide array of combos that are easy to use so you'll be owning monsters like Zeus himself imbued you with special powers. In fact, in the game he does! You obtain several special powers from different Gods throughout the story. Some games leave you wanting to use the same special power all the time, but not so with this one. Each power is useful in a particular type of situation so you find yourself using each of your powers regularly, depending on the situation you face. In addition, an innovative concept I loved was the \"mini-game\" method of defeating a foe. These bits of spice really add to the excitement and go a long way to avoid the monotony of typical hack & slash games.Summary:As action games go, this one tops a lot of lists. Within the first thirty seconds you will be drawn in and you likely won't want to put the controller down until you've finished the game. (As an aside there are plenty of save points for those pesky interruptions like work, school, etc.)Unless you bought a PS2 to play Tetris Worlds and nothing else, you should check out this game- you'll be quite happy you did!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00002STH5","description":"It's taken a while to get here, but Nintendo's 64-bit update to the old SNES classic, F-Zero, is here. F-Zero X is a stunning achievement in that it's truly the first racing game that runs at a brisk 60 frames per second, even in multiplayer. In fact, more than anything else, it is this feature that is F-Zero X's claim to fame. Does the rest of the game stack up? Well, it depends on what you're looking for.Instead of trying to compare it to its 16-bit counterpart, we'll dissect F-Zero X purely on its own merits. After all, the bar has been raised for racing games in general over the past few years. So what does the game have to offer? Well, first of all, forget any kind of simulation aspects. This is twitch gaming at its best. Although you can tinker with the basics, like acceleration and speed, that's about all you get to do. Everything else is just about driving. Playing like a Wipeout without weapons (which was like playing F-Zero with weapons), F-Zero X's only added enhancements are the inclusion of dash plates located at various points around the track. When you run over one of these plates, you get a severe speed boost that doesn't cost you any energy (after the second lap, you get boost power that you can use at any time, but it takes away some of your energy), enabling you to blast past some of your opponents. However, they too can use these plates.That's not to say that you can't dispose of your opponents though. By using the Z-button or the right shoulder button you can either crash into your opponent making his energy meter drop, causing him to explode if his meter is low enough. Or, you can try to shove him off the track if there is no barrier keeping you in. A number of play modes are available, including practice, death race, time attack, and vs. battle. However, the majority of the racing will be done in the grand prix mode, where the cup levels await. Each cup increases in difficulty, naturally, but with each additional level conquered, more and more racers are made available to you, adding replay incentive. If you make it to the final secret cup, you'll uncover a random track generator that offers you a fresh challenge every time.So what's the problem with F-Zero X? For starters, with up to 30 different racers onscreen at any given point, some sacrifices had to be made in order to keep the insane frame rate so high. Polygon counts on the vehicles are very low, giving them a particularly uninspiring look. The track detail is also very limited, giving the track a spartan feel to it. In its defense, the tracks are cleverly designed, especially the twisty corkscrew tracks that speed by at a blazing pace. One feature that's lacking is a first-person view. If speed was truly supposed to be on display here, a cockpit view would definitely have helped, but alas, there is none to be found. Control is pretty good, although the analog stick can be kind of touchy in places, leading to a few inadvertent fender benders. The sound effects are very good and actually add to the feeling of speed in the game. Unfortunately, the music can be pretty annoying in a cheesy synthesized-metal kind of way and doesn't really add much to the whole experience.As a game, F-Zero X is certainly thorough in its execution; unfortunately, there just seems to be very little in the game to keep you coming back. Sure, Nintendo incorporated all those funky characters to give it... um... character, but the game erases all that good stuff with its overwhelming blandness. Yes, the game can be fun in multiplayer, being supersonic and all that, but the game just lacks those certain intangibles that make a good game great. Practically flawless from a technical standpoint, the biggest thing missing from F-Zero X is that it lacks a soul. It's yet another stunning update to the legendary Nintendo catalog, but it's games like this that make you wonder: Where's Metroid 64 or Donkey Kong 64?

In some ways it did, in others it didn't.First off, I wasn't as initially interested in this game because, quite honestly, I only ever heard things here and there about Captain America and had little interest in his character, whereas I am a major Green Lantern fan.  The game looks great, but on my plasma it lacked the polish and flash Manhunters had.  Captain moves awkwardly and very clunky (he can't really run and he climbs ladders so slow it's almost laughable), and the camera angles have the similar annoyance factor that I found in Batman (which, while a huge Batman fan, is a game that didn't really appeal to me due to the camera angles and gave me headaches).Super Soldier kicks off right off the bat on the war front and takes off (literally) when you jump from a plane and land in a vast castle in Nazi Germany where the enemy has taken hold.  Like last year's amazing Prince of Persia: Forgotten Sands title, this game takes place in just one location, ie. this castle.  I love the slow motion takedowns (reminiscent of the aforementioned Batman), but found that Captain's punching abilities lacked fluidity and seemed clunky, at times even robotic.  Using his infamous shield is a lot of fun because it can take down so many at once, which actually turned into my main way to take down enemy.  Platforming also plays an important role in this game, and it can be quite fun to loop-dee-loop around beams a la Persia's Prince or Uncharted's Nathan Drake, but it too lacks the same level of satisfaction or grace; the screaming \"Leap!\" can get tiresome too as it appears, due to awkward camera angles, that it's there in order avoid missing a leap around a corner.Overall, Captain America: Super Soldier is one of those games that defies the stereotypical \"bad movie-game tie-in\", just like Green Lantern: Rise of the Manhunters (which, in my opinion, was better).  It's fun simply for fun's sake.  It's not going to be winning any awards, but it's definitely one of the best Marvel movie-game tie-ins to date.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2011"}

I was level 30 and I was beating bosses pretty easily because of how easy it is to exploit the class system in this game, but so I went and made a party of characters from the girl at the Inn in the beginning of the game.  I didn't choose the option 'call a friend' or whatever it was previously because I assumed that was a multiplayer option.Anyway, after adding 3 members to my party I ran around for a bit, leveled up some classes, and then removed them all from my party and went back to playing the whole game solo.I don't want a bunch of warm bodies following around the warm body I'm controlling, I want some of the interesting and fascinating characters I met throughout the story to join my quest and push the narrative along.  But no, there is none of that, the only voice on your side is this Bratz looking faerie that following you along and complains about everything but never expands on anything in the world because she's completely ignorant to all of it.The story is a bunch of stand alone quests that show how cultures and people are influenced by power, and that's good.  The leveling and combat system is classic and I was looking for that, that's good.But I'm so disappointed that the only voice on my side of things is that stupid faerie and that my character has almost no relation to what's going on, he's more or less stumbling onto the events and, without emotion or anyone having expectations on him, helping everyone.  I don't have a problem with a silent protagonist, but I do have an issue if everyone I control is a silent nobody.I know I'm nit-picking but most of my favorite characters from RPGs in the past are the side characters.  Yeah, you make a party based off abilities but you also pick one based off personality and liking characters and feeling emotions connected to them adds a lot to RPGs.It might also be an issue that I did get so far without an extra party member... Yeah, I leveled up a bit, got every class to around level 30, but once you do that you're nearly invincible with a few alchemy recipes for armor and weapons, and I never once looked at any type of guide to figure all that stuff out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002I0JIQW","description":"","reviewerName":"Mr. Ben \"ctsamurai\"","summary":"Excellent game for anyone","reviewText":"I first off want to say that only a basic familiarity with the first Portal is required to enjoy the sequel. This game is another homerun for Valve. Portal 2 is full of humor, great puzzles, an interesting -though simple- story line and great art direction/graphics. Its one of the few games I can recommend to just about anyone.Some of the accolades being tossed around are pretty extreme. \"best of the year\"(quite possibly) or even \"one of the best of all time\"(that might be overstating it) might build your hopes up too high.What's so great about Portal 2 is that the premise is relatively simple. Navigate various rooms using a portal shooting device, complete a simple objective (activate a button that unlocks a door). There are basically four buttons to remember: jump, pick up, and the two buttons for shooting portals. The puzzles get pretty interesting as other environmental elements like different gels/light bridges/and the hilarious turrets come in to play.I should also mention that this game is not particularly resource intensive or spec dependent. The game plays very well on an older ATI 4650 video card, with lower graphics quality. Many computers and even some laptops should be good platforms for the PC version. As always, it is worth checking out the developer commentary after you have beaten the game to appreciate all the work Valve put into this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0050SW8AC","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher Engel","summary":"Easily the best WipEout experience available; wonderful new modes and features abound","reviewText":"NOTE: This was initially written from the 1.01 patch that was released very early, which addressed many issues reviewers are talking about, particularly the long load times, which have been drastically reduced to not be that big an issue anymore. I expect the next patch will further reduce load times, so that really isn't a concern for me at this time.**UPDATE: 6/23/2012**Well, we knew we were getting DLC at some point, but they *really* handed it to us this time, potentially for free if you qualify. The most recent add-on for the game is the entire, complete version of WipEout HD Fury, which was initially solely a PSN title and then made cross-multiplayer possible on the Vita since launch. However, now you can do all of the single-player campaign and everything else, too. If you don't own Fury already, it's a $7.99 upgrade that also gives you the console version to play with. This is a great deal, especially considering that Fury was an expansion to WipEout HD and also  If you already own Fury, though, it's a free add-on that adds every bit of the game on the Vita, along with all the Vita tweaks that take advantage of the hardware.It took a long, long time, but the new DLC is potentially an entirely new experience for new players. Fury's campaign isn't a slouch, nor is the multiplayer or its own Fury-specific mechanics. It's different from the core game, sure, but it's still basically a totally different WipEout game.Anyone looking for more content can't go wrong with Fury add-on pack for the core game. There's no reason not to get it, because, if you already own Fury, it's a free update so you can now play on the go, should you choose it. If you don't yet have Fury, then you've got a whole new campaign to play through, along with every Fury track, ship, and campaign to go with it. It's pretty much an entirely new game with the add-on pack.**UPDATE: 5/28/2012**1.02 has been out for quite some time now, with some talk of future DLC, the content of which has not been officially announced to my knowledge, if it happens at all. For anyone who still was frustrated by the load times even after 1.01 made them at least tolerable, 1.02 nearly halves them. The game now feels like it loads just as fast as any other given racer, console or portable. An initial load of a race is about 20-30 seconds maximum, with retries taking only a few seconds (this is not to be taken for granted, as many racers have the truly awful fault of reloading *everything* from scratch, with the same load times as if you were starting an entirely new race. Considering the unforgiving difficulty that WipEout is known for, this is definitely critical, as you will be restarting very often due to its punishing, yet still fair, difficulty.). Its initial load of the game before you can even pick a mode is also almost nonexistent now. Basically, load times aren't an issue anymore, so everyone can sleep easy on that point.It should be noted, though, that if you have the digital version of the game instead of the cartridge, load times will have a few seconds added on, just like any other digital version of any game. It's a common myth that loading directly from a memory stick makes for better performance, but the opposite is actually true, due to mandatory data compression. While the idea of not using external media to load data and instead taking it directly from an internal memory would be faster in theory, the truth is that every digital game for consoles or handhelds is released with compressed data to conserve space--without the compression, the amount of space required would be astronomical, and unreasonable. Unlike cartridges, which have little to no compression, digital data has to be decompressed before it can even begin to load, which adds time, and takes away none.Don't fall for the myth that digital downloads perform better, because the opposite is true. It was true with the PSP as well. If you want the best performance, you want to go with the physical copy. This is pretty much universal for all downloadable games and content.Besides that, little else has changed besides a couple of minor bug fixes. As for the possible DLC, well, we'll see.(end of update)Really, this is *the* WipEout experience, absolutely loaded with content, and a multiplayer component including a \"multiplayer campaign\" which are all excellent. The multiplayer campaign, gorgeous graphics, thumping soundtrack, ship selection, weapon variety, balance, and general feel are all worth noting as exceeding my expectations.The use of the camera is also a fun little feature, in which it will take an optional photograph of you before every race, and the top three players are shown with their photographs. If you're camera-shy, you don't have to do this, but I find it very fun.Also worth noting is the multiplayer campaign aspect of this, which is essentially an extension of the single-player campaign that includes real people instead of AI ships. This is really a beautiful thing, as it is for the most part the single-player experience that you are playing with everyone at the same time. It isn't just a race or a battle--it's a campaign that everyone can participate in, and drop in or out of at any time. The experience system which has become so popular these days is there, so the more you play, the more you get. It's really just a lot of fun to do the campaign with other people instead of the AI.Also note that cross-platform play is possible with the PS3's WipEout HD Fury, meaning you will never have any shortage of people to enjoy the game with. Further, if someone you know has Fury, but not a Vita and this game, you can play with them without a hitch. Cross-platform multiplayer is always a welcome addition to anything, so this may be very important for people with friends who don't own a Vita, or you simply want to play Fury-specific style.I have little to complain about, but one thing I dislike is the controls have three schemes only, and aren't fully customizable. At the same time, none feels *quite* right, the closest I can get being the \"Racer\" scheme. It takes some getting used to. One other complaint I have is that you can't add your own soundtrack a la WipEout Pulse for the PSP, which is a real shame. Pulse, if you don't know already, let you add up to 30 tracks from your memory card to the game, and then let you create your own soundtrack for the game. At the moment, this is not a feature, and you have the in-game soundtrack, which, while still very good, could benefit from more selection that you, yourself, should be able to add like Pulse did.At the end of the day, though, this is WipEout at its finest, bar none. Its added Vita-specific features are just beautifully done, and a happy surprise for me, since they actually work. The multiplayer in particular stands out as excellent and far beyond my expectations, and the added multiplayer campaign is a joy. There's little to complain about now that the load times have become bearable with the patch, and we can expect them to lessen further in the next one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2012"}

But fans ofGTA IIIshould note that  whileState of Emergencycontains adult themes and extremely violent  gameplay, that's pretty much where the similarities end. WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number  of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode,  but it's strictly one player. In spite of these flaws, the game remains  addictive and fun. It bears repeating that gamers looking for anotherGTA  IIIwill not find it here: this game provides an arcadelike experience  that's excellent, but in a very different way.

{"product_name":"B0047TG2R0","description":"","reviewerName":"R. Reining \"Old School Zinger\"","summary":"Dragon Age: Origins + Fable + Mass Effect 2","reviewText":"I wish there were half-ratings, because I don't feel this is a baseline 3 star game. More like 3.5. Just not good enough to be a 4.While I only experienced two freezes in the entire game, numerous things about the game bothered me. What stands out the most is the lack of creativity throughout the entire game. It didn't bother me so much that the whole game takes place in a single city, because if done correctly you would forget you're in just one city (and even if you remembered, you'd be amazed it was all one city).I think the city of Denerim in Origins had just as many locations as this new city setting takes place in. And while a couple of the city locations are fairly large, you will travel every inch of them so many times the city loses its charm pretty quickly. And it's unfortunate, because one of the strengths or getting the player familiarized with an area is that certain locations will inevitably come to be associated with events in the game. There was such an instance while I was playing when I reached an area and I thought \"Oh wow, this is where ______ was murdered.\" I won't reveal who because it would be a spoiler.However, the failure of the game setting is that underground areas/caves/exterior beach levels all used the exact same design. Literally, they would just re-use the same cave for all caves (except one, I think, which was unique), and they would fill it with different enemies. Drop giant spiders, blood mages or whatever else in the cave and change the quest, problem solved. And then the design of the cave itself was ridiculous. Not only did I feel it was lazy, but it made cave exploration feel like a chore, when in Origins it was one of the most fun parts. What this means for the familiarization of locations is that the personal connection I would have otherwise felt was shattered because the same interior setting existed in multiple places.And to expound on that point, I also felt a bit cheated in the game. Where in Origins the game took place along a large landmass and quests occurred all over it, the same locations are used over a period of ten years. So I'd take my time and work through nearly all the available quests, and then the game would skip ahead 1-3 years and suddenly I have to clear the same caves, deal with more gang problems, the same old thing. I found it cheap for one main reason. My first character was a \"Good\" guy. I helped out everyone I could, the best way I could. But then when the game skips ahead I'm supposed to buy that for the past three years my character was just absent from all events and did nothing to prevent the further decay of the city. It ruins the immersion.And that's the main thing really killed the game for me. That even though \"rushed\" isn't really the word I would use to describe what was wrong with the game, it was sorely lacking in the creativity department.The game still earns a 3.5 rating though, because especially the second half of the game, the story really picks up and gets really damn good. In the interest of keeping this review as short as possible, this is where I'll end my review. Dragon Age 2 was a game that had so much potential to be great, the ingredients were all there. But as with Mass Effect 2, I felt this sequel kind of moved sideways. It did some things better and some things worse than the original, and ultimately I was left feeling unsatisfied.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2011"}

Demons Souls you pay a penalty if you die and that adds a lot.Killed by too many cheap shots by slicers.

A couple of acts take 3 or more hours. I have no idea what people were talking about when they say this game is short. Maybe they just ran thru it without collecting adam and taking care of little sisters, regardless game is not short. I still hate the cheap shots delivered by annoying slicers.

While the degree of \"interactivity\" may be questionable, there's no doubt that as a game this represents an entirely new genre - not quite open-ended, but still offering results for the player's actions.Heavy Rain tells the story of four characters: The single father, Ethan, the detective, Scott, the journalist, Madison, and the FBI agent, Norman. Their stories are told as short vignettes - the perspective will start at Ethan, switch to Scott, then to Norman, and so on as the story warrants. Their stories center around the Origami Killer, a serial killer so named because of the figures he leaves on his victims. Each character is trying to investigate the killer for different reasons, and while their investigations start out entirely separate they inexorably end up caught up in each others' stories.The game is carried out through what are basically quick-time events. In some segments, the player character will be allowed to walk around and interact with their environment by making the appropriate movement when near an object. In action sequences, the player simply has to hit the buttons (or do the appropriate motions) when the icon for it pops up. Both try to have actions be fairly intuitive based on the motion. The game's use of occasional motion controls, as well as making the button display shakier in times of stress or crisis, both add atmosphere and player connection to the events of the game.The game's \"choice\" varies between the two kinds of sequences. In free-moving sequences, the player is allowed to make an occasional decision that will affect the development or ending of the game. In action sequences, the player's goal is simply to survive - messing up too many quick-time events (or one important one) will actually kill the character off permanently. For that reason, there's always a really impressive sense of weight and drama during these scenes, instead of annoyance or irritation on having to retry if you fail. There's a chapter select, so it's possible to go back and retry failed scenes, but the real drama of the game comes from trying to get it all done on one playthrough without having any characters die or do the wrong thing. Personally, I became more concerned for my success than I had in any other game simply because of this fact.The main problem I could see with the game is that, while the game's a murder mystery, you're never really given the opportunity to try and solve it per se. While you, the player, might guess at it based on clues you find, there's no part of the game that's actually about going out and getting clues. The characters investigate, but in a linear, pre-determined manner. While on the one hand I found this kind of annoying, the fact that the game has to go on no matter who dies - even if all the playable characters die - kind of balanced it out. There's simply so many scenarios already that making it open-ended on top of that would've been much more difficult.On the whole I really enjoyed Heavy Rain, primarily because of the aforementioned life-or-death struggles. However, it was only really good for one playthrough - it's not the kind of game that one really replays to find out what happened. The game is about your one story, and going back and doing it again takes away a lot of the pressure, and therefore the drama, of the game's system. It's essentially an extended movie where the player's failure can change the ending. It's worth a playthrough, but might not be worth holding onto.8/10.We purchased this game with our own money from a game store.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2010"}

Now you along with the help of your friend Diddy Kong set out to get back his stash. This game follows the gameplay of it's predecessors such as having to swing between vines, exploding out of barrels and collecting the golden letters of KONG scattered throughout the levels. This was originally released on the Wii and was an instant classic but there is a few differences from the original version and the one on the 3ds.First is there are 3d visuals that could not be recreated on the Wii and the visuals really do stand out and add to the game. Next there is a new mode which makes the game a bit easier for those who are not seasoned gamers. You can trade in items for various items such as energy boosts, extra lives and even green balloons which can be useful if you fall into a pit! Also there is a new world that you can unlock (which would be the 9th world) and it gives you access to eight new levels. And finally there is local wireless play so you can team with a friend to double the action and fun!For fans of the original Donkey Kong games and wanting to get a new game for your 3ds this is definitely the game for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2013"}

While it does run smoother and after opening up my old Xbox hard drive case and putting it into this console I really have no complaints except one,  like many people have said the Kinect does require a medium to large size room to play and my bedroom does not fit that requirement though it does let me play a little on some games not all but some.  The only reason I got this model and not the 250gb one is that if you already had a previous Xbox 360 all you have to do is crack the case and wallah a hard drive for your console so if I'm paying $300.00 dollars I rather have the Kinect at least.  The newer model runs smoothly and amazingly silently when compared to the older 360 also a big plus for this model is that unlike the previous 360 this has its own wireless connection so no need to have to buy a  $100.00 ad on router for your Xbox 360 slim.  The Kinect what little I'm able to play is enjoyable but also fads fast unless you're competing with another player,  the games are pretty much the standard example of higher evolved wii games at least that's what it felt like to me not that I'm trying to put it down but again for single players the games loose your interest pretty fast so hopefully something more entertaining and enjoyable for the single player will be coming out soon for the kinect rather than later.  This box set comes like most do with the console,  power supply,  kinect,  one wireless controller,  and for some unknown reason AV cables which since I have a LCD t.v. I'm left wondering why they still give these out I mean at least give us a combo of AV/Component cables if you're not going to give us an HDMI cable.  Hopefully this one will at least last me three or more years I hope for more but amazingly and ironically as my previous 360 got the RROD after only three years I can only laugh as I have a Nintendo gamecube which still works after ten years,  a PS2 which I have and still works after eight years and my Ninteno Wii which I have and works great still after five years so hopefully Microsoft has learned from its mistakes and we can hope to see our new slim 360 last this long...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2011"}

{"product_name":"B005VKRGXI","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason","summary":"Best Spider-Man Game this Generation, but it Could have been AMAZING...","reviewText":"If you've played previous Spider-Man games you doubt have high expectations for this game.  From the great sprawling open city games of last generation to Beenox's well recieved Shattered Dimensions and Edge of Time.  While I never played any of the previous generations iteration of Spdier-man, and was not a fan of either of Beenox's linear time-shattering games, I was hoping this game would be amazing (since it is Spider-man after all).Graphics:This game looks good from a far and in Motion.  Even if you stop up high you'll enjoy the graphics, but if you get close to textures and overly-reused objects or other in game pedestrians you'll see that this game was not meant for you to be crawling around on the ground.  Which is sad cause many of the game's main missions take place in confined boring-looking sewers and bland labs.  But when you're free roaming throughout the city, this game really shines and actually makes you feel like Spider-man.Gameplay:Many of the gameplay elements have been borrowed (combat especially) from Rocksteady's Batman games, yes, but it's still a lot of fun.  However, if you weren't a fan of Arkham Asylum or Arkham City that might dampen how you feel about this game's control mechanics.  There's also this element called web-rush in which you slow down time to super slow and you can target an area or enemy in slow-motion release this button to shoot at there/him at top speed.  It's a neat element that in some ways overpowers Spider-man but at the same time can really give you a \"rush\" (see what I did there?).  It will probably get old until you can upgrade the abilities of what you do when you hit the enemy after rushing him, such as web-hurricane or slowed-down take out moves which look pretty cool.  All-in-all this element capitalizes on the fact that while Spider-man isn't the Hulk and can't just absorb bullets, he can move so fast that enemies quickly loose track of him.  Sadly, as I mentioned earlier, you will be forced to go into \"dungeon\" areas like bland sewers and labs, not only are they graphically boring but gameplay wise they force you to be stealthy (just like Batman) but aren't nearly as fun as the Dark Knight.  This is where the pace of this game really slows to a crawl (did you catch it that time?) and collectibles will be your only joy in these dark places.  But as long as Peter Parker is out in the sunshine chasing robots and make'n jokes and slinging around the city it'll feel like the best game in the world even if it's elements are used to a repetitive bore.Story-line:This game takes place in the universe of the recently rebooted Amazing Spider-Man movie.  The game takes place following the events of the movie, so I recommend watching the movie first.  However, I feel that this limited what Beebox could do with the Spider-man character, they've already shown us they have some creativity with their earlier time-traveling editions of the character and in the use of the jokes and quwips in this game, they clearly understand Spider-man's light hearted nature (no, Sony, Spidey doesn't need to be dark like Batman to sell well).Conclusion:While this game is good it is in no ways great. The gameplay elements that shine among some drabby design choices and limited-repetitive-over-used gameplay mechanics really make you wonder what they could have done with a more open book on the Spider-Man universe or some help from the folks at Rocksteady.  Who should pick up this game?  If you're a fan of sandbox games and spider-man then you should pick this up (I am a fan of both so that certainly colored my feelings on the game), others might want to give it a rent first.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2012"}

The game is remincent of the recent adventure called DISHONORED.  Beautiful graphics and action.  I do not want to spoil it for most people but if you are sensitive about racial stereotypes especially blacks of the early 1900s then steer clear of this one.  Many of you will undoubtably disagree because you young folk did not live through the years of the civil rights movement and cannot understand why the average intelligent person of color would find this game offensive.  There are many who will make comments against this game but I found it to be entertaining once you get over the initial shock. With that said, this game is truly amazing; if the story gets out about the racist nature it will be difficult for it to become a blockbuster.  Then again I could be wrong.  Very important to play all the way through before making a judgement on this game.  Bottom line..it is a lot of fun to play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2013"}

On the plus side the setting is unique and the graphics on the 360 are good - I only experienced minor pop in issues and the draw distances were somewhat constrained.  The gameplay is also pretty solid.  Where the game falls (only slightly) short is in the story department.  Much of the game is taken up with thinly disguised, yet elaborate, fetch quests -- and a lot of the plot, such as it is, became repetitive after while (seriously, how many times did our heroes have to end up in a crashing blimp?).  The \"big twist\" at the end was also a bit of a let down, mainly because I dismissed the idea early on as being way too obvious.  Regardless, I had fun playing it and definitely feel I got my money's worth.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2013"}

If you hit something with a piece of wood or anything like that it will eventually become damaged and either break or you have to repair it.  It took me quite a while to finally beat the game but it was worth it.  And like most great games if you want to try it again you can and you get to keep all your weapons and upgrades you have beaten the game with so that is nice.There are some draw backs though such as you have to be on-line to play it and anyone that is close to you can join, and in my case if you complete a quest and the person drops the weapon you were supposed to get a person that joined you can snatch it up before you get to it and take it from you.  Other than that though I would recomend it for a play if you like gorey zombie games.  Definatly deserves the mature rating between language and gore.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003TIVSM4","description":"","reviewerName":"Riyad Kalla","summary":"Simplified Gears + Great Characters + Solid Execution","reviewText":"Space Marine is an interesting animal... for all intents and purposes it SEEMS like it would be a silly rental game that you knock out in a few hours and never touch again, but because of the sheer talent of the development company behind it, it isn't. It is much more enjoyable.I know nothing about the lore behind Warhammer 40k and was worried this game would give me so little context that I would be lost, fortunately there is enough story telling that you pretty much understand what you are (a badass) and what you are doing (being badass) and why you are doing it (for the emperor!). Titus (you, the main character) is Marcus Fenix if you sent him to Oxford, made him in his 40s and classed him up to the point that he demands respect and admiration from everyone around him.The story itself is straight forward, one of the alliance manufacturing planets (I guess everyone in the universe just makes war implements and constantly fights) is being attacked by orcs and you are dropped in to secure the most valuable war machines.But then there is a twist and things go sideways... I loved the twist, the character design was brilliant.Had this exact same game been given to any other development studio that was more junior and maybe had sloppier controls or poorer looking graphics and design effects, it would have scored a 5 out of 10, it is honestly just from sheer solidness of execution that this game ends up being fun and feeling great. A testament to skilled work I think.Space Marine is a great \"play for 15 mins\" kind of game or sit down and play for hours. It is gory, controls are easy to use, sound effects are great and punchy and checkpoints reasonable.On Easy, you can almost always get into a group of orcs and slaughter them with no concern for your life. You WILL encounter some situations towards the end (even on Easy) where you need to slow down and use some strategy or die and retry once or twice... so if you just want an action packed arcade experience, play on Easy. If you demand that there be more of a challenge and you want to use the perfect move combos to survive even if that means dying and retrying sometimes, go ahead and try a harder setting.An example, if you are the type to play God of War on something harder (Norm, Hard) then try that here.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00D6PTMSW","description":"","reviewerName":"Colin Brown \"Colin Brown Microsoft MVP\"","summary":"Not perfect but a fun way to learn to play the guitar","reviewText":"Rocksmith 2014 is like the old guitar hero but on steroids.  Rather than playing a plastic guitar replica and just pushing buttons, you play a real guitar using the proper frets and chords.Rocksmith comes with a number of cables, the main one being a USB adapter that you plug into your xbox and the other plugs into your guitar.  You can play just using this arrangement however when you get to more advanced it is recommended that you also use the other cables. These plus into the back of your xbox and into your tv or amplifier directly using audio adapters, component cables etc. depending on how your TV or amplifier receives a signal.  This cuts down slightly the lag from strumming your guitar to it playing through the TV if you don't use these cables.  The difference is minor but when your playing on the more advanced levels this slight lag can make all the difference in you hitting or missing the notes.After a very short intro (and an initial 45Mb patch when I first put the game in my xbox) and a couple of questions (do you want to play lead, bass, rhythm?  Which type of guitar do you have? Left or right handed? etc) the first thing Rocksmith will do is tune your guitar.  This is simply a matter of picking each string and following the onscreen guide as to whether to tighten or loosen the string.There are a range of difficulties in Rocksmith from complete beginner (just picked up a guitar) to expert (you should be on stage somewhere) and Rocksmith seems to hit the ground running based on your difficulty level.  For example, when on beginner you start off by playing maybe only 20 notes during the whole song.  Once you get a certain percentage (Rocksmith likes the 75% mark for a lot of things) it will gradually introduce more notes for you. Hit the next percentage mark and you get more notes etc.  This is a very good way to learn a song.The main screen is just like guitar hero, each string is represented by a color, a small bar moves down the screen with a number on it.  Based on the color (which string) the number on the bar (which fret) you play the note.  Chords are the same way you just have multiple string to hold down.It does take a little while to get used to the play screen but not too long.  There are onscreen cues for when you are going to move up and down the fret board so you can get ready in advance.The actual menu screens are a different story and these I did find confusing.  There is no instruction manual included in the box and everything is presented to you in short videos and narration. I started off by picking lead guitar, played a few songs then wanted to see what rhythm would be like but I couldn't see any way to change my type of play.  I finally found it by pressing the back button on the controller (the B button is marked back on screen).  A little help with the menu screens would be of great benefit perhaps by including a little instruction manual in the box.Included with Rocksmith are about 40 songs (you can purchase more online) and the range of type of songs included in Rocksmith 2014 are great, ranging from Aerosmith and Def Leppard to The Who and Tom Petty.  If you grew up in the 80s, you'll love these.Rocksmith is a mix of a serious game (it will teach you to play guitar from scratch if you keep at it, or individual songs if you already know how to play) and a fun game trying to hit all the right notes at the right time (ala Guitar Hero).If you are already an accomplished guitarist Rocksmith will aid you in learning new songs however I think it is aimed more at the beginner/novice guitarist in helping you learn chords and songs in a fun manner.It's not perfect (especially the confusing menu system) but still something I would recommend to the budding guitarist.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2013"}

It took me about 3 hours to really understand how to play and what to do, but I also wound up putting 40 hours into competing the main missions and some side missions as well. I was overwhelmed at first, but then you just get to know what to do and where to go. You have the option of continuing your game after beating it, or starting up a new game with your current character. I still have a couple of DLC missions to play, and probably 10-15 side missions too, so I chose to just continue my current game. I focused on the main missions and completed all the dossier and loyalty missions for my squadmates. If I didn't have such a backlog of games, I would absolutely start up another game with another character.One negative of Mass Effect 2 would be the load screens. It seems to take about a minute each time. This didn't bother me at all, but I know it does for some people. Something else I noticed was that my characters really didn't get very many new weapons. I'm a looter and check every nook and cranny for everything, and yes I did get weapon upgrades and upgraded them, but nothing exciting and different. I did just finish up Borderlands not too long ago, so maybe I was expecting a bazillion guns like that game!?!One cool thing I liked about ME2 was that you can literally save anywhere and anytime. I like games like that so you don't have to play for an hour to be able to save.Without hesitation, I would recommend this game. Especially considering how cheap it is. It was so good, that I think I might just continue on with Mass Effect 3 even though I have other games I have been looking forward to playing (Red Dead Redemption, Arkham City GOTY). I don't think you can really go wrong with this game. Enjoy!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2013"}

The only area of incompatibility is that I think* the new console doesn't fit older hard drives. This is a non-issue, as the new console comes with the largest drive available, so if you have a current drive you'll be porting your information over using a transfer kit**. So really, it's just a question of where the new console is better than the old one.Pros:-Largest hard drive available means more storage space for games, movies, and more.-Quieter parts mean a better experience. The 360 is easily the loudest console this generation while it has all the fans and disc drive running. The 360S is much quieter, bringing it in line with or even quieter than some PS3 models. I never had a problem with the sound in the first place, but I won't deny the improvement.-Decreased power consumption means this new console will put some money back in your wallet.-Has the HDMI port in back, if you're still stuck with a first-run 360 that doesn't have that.-Cool black finish, which I feel is superior to the iPod-pearl color of the old console.-Lighter, smaller design makes it easier to place in your entertainment center.-Although it'll take some time in the field to get real data, the new hardware seems to have a better build and new cool-down features to all but eliminate the old \"red ring of death\" problem. This looks to be the most reliable 360 hardware yet.-And to top it all off, the price is very competitive.Cons:-The case looks sort of like a gaming computer, with the new grills on the side. I'm not a fan of \"Xtreme\" gaming computer design, so I'm not sold on this look.-These case features also favor a stand-up orientation for the console. Keeping a console vertical can lead to accidentally jarring or knocking over the unit, which can cause damage to the spinning disc inside or the console itself. Keep your console horizontal, even if the design looks a bit odd that way.-The glossy finish, while it looks awesome, attracts dust and fingerprints like crazy. You have to handle the console with surgical clean-room care, or else a few invisible fingerprints will show up dust-encrusted in no time.In other words, I feel that the internals of the console are wholly improved while the case design is a draw. If you're considering getting a new or a first 360, this is absolutely the way to go. There's a rumor floating around that there may be an Arcade version of this console released later this year for budget-minded consumers, so if budget is a concern, I'd suggest waiting too see how that option turns out.If you already own a 360, ahould you upgrade? Well, it depends. The functionality is basically the same across all consoles, so long as you have a hard drive. If you're on an older Arcade console without a hard drive, or if you're frustrated by your older console's small hard drive, this new hardware is a pretty awesome upgrade. If you own the Elite model with the 120GB hard drive, or any older console with a 250GB drive, all you're really getting is quieter fans and a few bucks off your electricity bill.*I'm not 100% how the new console does or doesn't support older hard drives, I'll re-post once I find confirmation.**Transfer kits are usually available for free if you call Microsoft tech support with your proof-of-purchase of a new console, or they can be purchased separately from most stores.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2010"}

{"product_name":"B001CWXAP2","description":"","reviewerName":"Alan R \"Alan R\"","summary":"SWTOR - For each step forward, it takes 5 steps in place or backwards.","reviewText":"Emotions and excitement are sky high right now with the release of SWTOR.  Many people are just starting their journey and are blown away by the voice acting, cut scenes and story telling.  Rightfully so!  But with that comes a lot of early reviews from people high on their first experience with that aspect of the game, who haven't had enough time to settle a bit into the ENTIRE game or look objectively at the WHOLE package.  Not to say that anyone who likes this game falls into that category, but there are a lot of people who do.  I'll do my best to give an objective review here, from someone who has played beta to 50 and has spent enough time with it in both beta and release to really see what the full game has to offer.First things first - SWTOR is the ultimate example of what a theme park mmorpg is, and what I would call the 2000's model mmo.  It takes everything that is typical of this model and gives it to you in the Star Wars universe, staying with every tried and true path to come before it.  Some things it does infinitely times better (story telling, voice acting, cut scenes), other things are about equal to other AAA mmo's released over the last 3-5 years, and quite a few things are down right poor compared to those same mmo's.  The more I've played SWTOR the more it does indeed seem that a huge majority of the money and development attention went towards the story, which resulted in feature after feature that seems to have received just enough attention to make it \"passable\" or \"just good enough\" as opposed to awesome or even just impressive.  So let's break things down, from best to worst.- Story, voice acting, cut scenes - 9.5/10This is the selling point for TOR and by FAR the game's strongest feature.  It's exactly what you would expect from Bioware and it definitely does not disappoint.  All 8 classes have their own unique story which increases replayability a ton.  Some may argue that the only difference is the class quests, which are a small portion of the game, so playing a new character isn't that much different - but isn't that still more than other mmo's have to offer?  The effect of this feature is that it also increases the enjoyment of questing and dungeons (flashpoints) far above what I've experienced in the competition.  Note that there are a lot of instanced quests in this game, but I didn't mind that.  Similar to LOTRO, instancing quests affords the ability to make more complex story telling experiences possible in those instances.  I would give this feature a 10/10, but one disappointment is that none of your decisions during conversations have real long term consequences or effects.  You may alter the course of a quest, or experience different things in flashpoints, but at the end of the day your choices don't have that much impact.  Still, that's a minor gripe, just having the small changes is better than nothing - which is better than all other mmo's offering in that regard, no choice at all.- Combat - 8/10The combat in TOR is good, it's nothing revolutionary but it isn't bad.  Personally I think the animations are fine, although I've heard some complaints.  The combat feels responsive and is smooth, and you do feel slightly more \"heroic\" as Bioware talked about by being able to demolish groups of mobs pretty quickly.  I don't have a lot to add on this, it's basically the typical combat style of this mmo type.- Crafting - 7.5/10Crafting in TOR has a few nice twists.  It is the typical theme park crafting model, but the ability to use companions, missions, mods and crits all help to make it a bit more unique.  It's definitely no Vanguard, EQ2, or SWG crafting system, but it's a step above the system you would see in WOW, RIFT, AION, etc.- Flashpoints - 7.5/10Flashpoints, which are TOR's dungeons CAN BE a ton of fun.  Focus on can be.  The problem is that it seems they put a lot of time and effort into some dungeons (which are the awesome dungeons), and others are just filler.  The great dungeons have a good amount of story, hidden things to trigger, crafting ability use to alter events in the dungeons, but the filler dungeons are pretty much just dungeons minus everything I just mentioned - what you would see in any other mmo.  It's a shame that Bioware seemed to go the quantity over quality route in this regard to a degree.  If there weren't the \"filler\" flashpoints I would give this category a 9/10, but there are, so 7.5/10.- Questing - 6/10Questing in TOR is a mixed bag.  On one hand it's more fun than most other mmo's simply because of the story.  The problem, however, is that most of the quests are still just kill, gather, or fetch quests.  This is taken to the extreme actually, because other quest types familiar to the genre seem to be either absent completely or just in short supply such as escort quests, quests dropped from mobs, quests to defend certain areas or NPCs, etc.  The voice acting is a nice addition, but it doesn't change the actual gameplay of the questing - which gets monotonous very fast, especially without a little more quest variety.- Graphics - 4/10The graphics in TOR are also an interesting mixed bag.  Character models in cut scenes look spectacular, but after that, it is pretty poor.  Textures in the world look about 5 years dated and so do character models (character models look different *better* in cut scenes).  This is one area TOR is definitely behind the pack, as most mmo's over the last 3-5 years have had better graphics than TOR, at least in my opinion.  Clearly they wanted to make the game easy on machines, for broader audiences, but it would have been nice if they designed it to look better for those who could handle it.- Space Combat - 3/10A huge disappointment.  I would have rather they not even had space combat for launch and focused on giving us a quality space system down the road than release this.  It's one of the few things TOR has to count as a feature not many other mmo's have, but they totally dropped the ball here.  It's simple, it's boring, it's monotonous, it's Starfox.- U/I - 2/10Having played the beta, I figured there was no way they would release the game with the UI as it is.... but they did.  I will say they are planning on improving it, so there is hope for the future with this.  Still, releasing a 2012 MMO with a UI like this is almost insulting - there are literally almost 0 customization options with it and you can't even move your windows around.  In general it's also quite cumbersome, as things like the Codex which you use frequently don't have they're own tab, so you must sift through other menus in order to get to it.- Character creation (race selection) - 1/10Another major disappointment in the game.  First of all, your only choices of race or species are humans and basically..... more humans.  For example, you can be a Zabrak (human with horns) or a Miralukan (human with blindfold on), or Cyborg (human with metal implants), etc etc.  What a disappointment!  For a game in the Star Wars universe and not being able to play as a Rodian, Bith, Ithorian, etc etc!- Character creation (appearance) - 3/10Your first choice is 1 of 4 body types, the 4th of which is a super fat guy which almost no one is going to want to be, so you have 3 options total for your height and size basically.  Then you can choose from a handful of preset faces, half of which are just terrible.  There are no sliders anywhere, everything is preset.  There are ton of \"complexion\" options but those make very little change.  Even the hair is disappointing - no long hair options for example.  In general, it's another feature that is \"just good enough\", and another feature I'm shocked they didn't improve for release based on the massive amounts of beta feedback on this issue.**************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************- World immersion / atmosphere - 2/10The story in TOR is very immersive, but this isn't about that.  When it comes to the actual game world itself, honestly speaking, I have never played a AAA mmo that I have felt LESS immersed in than TOR.  I do not say that for shock value, it is the truth.  This is actually the first time I've noticed such a thing as this to the point that I'm bringing it up in a review.  There are a LOT of contributing factors to this, each of which individually may not be that big of a deal, but add them all up and you've got a world that feels static, lifeless, and kind of like a card board cutout of a world.  Let's look at why this is.** 1A. - NPC's - NPC's in social hubs and cities are just \"odd\".  There are a lot of NPC statues in TOR, more than most AAA mmo's I would venture to say.  Some move, but in a very limited capacity usually, like move lightsaber up, then down, then up, then down, then up, then down, etc.  Many also are just locked in place doing what SHOULD be an action, but it's like time just stopped for them (such as a Jedi in the middle of casting a force power and he just sits there forever halfway done with his cast, or 2 people about to duel but they never do, they just sit forever like they are ABOUT to duel or fight).  It's extremely weird looking and out of place.** 1B. - NPC's - You cannot interact with npc's.  There is no clicking on random npc's for a short 1 or 2 sentence chat.  The only npc's you can interact with in the game are vendors and quest givers, so statue npc's seem even more statue like since you can't interact with them.** 1C. - NPC'S - Lack of npc chatter and ambient noise (NPC mimes).  There are a few npc background chatter conversations in the game, but not many.  You will however see a lot of groups of npc's that are in essence mimes.  They will be interacting with each other through animated gestures, but there is no sound to go along with it.  Also creates a very weird atmosphere as you may be in a city full of npc's, but it's quiet as a library if the music stops playing (which it does at certain intervals)** 2. - Mobs - There is very little pathing for mobs in this game.  What I mean is, almost all mobs and groups just sit in place like statues, waiting for the slaughter.  You will find a patrol here and there, but like the npc's, it is a rarity.  Most mmo's have static groups of mobs, but I haven't seen it done to the degree that TOR does.** 3. - Critters / world creatures - Where are they?  TOR is almost completely void of life besides for mobs and npc's.  You will occasionally find a world creature like the beasts in the beginning of Tython, but they are very rare, and like the mobs and npc's, just stuck in place usually.** 4. - Sound - Cities and social hubs need a lot more ambient noise and sound effects.  Almost every major city or quest hub feels like a library or morgue rather than a bustling hub of activity.** 5. - Zoning - The fact that TOR has zones within zones really hurts as well because even when a lot of players are on a server, it never truly feels busy, as the game just creates more instanced copies of the same zones.** 6. - Music - There are too many periods with no music playing.  It's especially noticeable when you're in a city, because it emphasizes the lack of other sounds even more.  It's not uncommon to be in a quest hub or area with lots of npc's but experience dead quiet if the music stops.** 7. - Weather - There are no dynamic weather cycles.  Dromund always has a storm, but it ALWAYS has that storm.  Key word dynamic.  It's not a huge deal, but it doesn't help the immersion.** 8. - Day / night cycle - There is no day / night cycle.  Some people care about that, others don't, but again, it doesn't HELP immersion by not having it.** 9. - No swimming - Same as day / night, debatable, but doesn't help.** 10. - Sitting in chairs - Can sit in chairs in your ship, but that's it folks.  Another small one, but it factors in for some people.All of these things combined result in world with an extremely static and lifeless feel.**************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************- PVP - ??????I never pvp in games, so I can't comment on this aspect and won't attempt to talk about it without experience.- Miscellanous:** Guild functionality / features - 3/10 (completely bare bones guild set-up - although this is supposed to be getting addressed)** Galactic trade network (auction house) - 3/10 (needs A LOT of work)** Companions - 8/10 (fun feature and addition)** Music - 8/10 (good when it plays, but doesn't play often enough - too many periods of silence)** Map - 9/10 (loved the map, good job on this)** Extras - 8/10 (Datacrons, lore object finds and the Codex are enjoyable little extras)Overall - (2.5/5) - Chose to give 2 stars on Amazon.Bottom line - SWTOR is Star Wars + Bioware + years of hype, so I think most of us assumed it would be one of the highest quality mmo's of all time.  SWTOR, for me, has been one of the biggest gaming disappointments I've ever experienced.  I love Star Wars and Bioware games, so I thought this would be a lock as my MMO home for years or even decades in the future.  I didn't think it would be possible for me to not like this game, but the longer I played the harder it became to ignore the shortcomings, to convince myself that I was having fun, that this was the high quality game it was hyped up to be.  For each feature that is a step forward in QUALITY for the genre such as the story telling, it takes 5 steps that are either in place or going backward.  Finally I just had to admit the reality of it, at least how it is to me:SWTOR is an amazing story telling experience, but not a very good game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001CWXAP2","description":"","reviewerName":"genocidal_maniac","summary":"Good cutscenes, lousy game","reviewText":"This game reportedly cost EA $200 million to develop.$200 million.What did they get for $200 million? Some really great cutscenes. The cutscenes are like a hyperactive encyclopedic fan-fiction extraordinaire. They take subtle elements from each movie and mash them all up into something that is truly great. These cutscenes are better than the three prequel movies easily, and give return of the jedi a run for the money.Now, what about the game itself?Well, the game is okay, but it isn't really inspired. It did cost $200 million to develop after all. EA is not going to allow creative risks.I'm a fan of the KOTOR games, and found them to be mindblowing by actually allowing me to set foot on star wars worlds that I had only read about in books. Just stepping on the Mandalore moon was cool, or Kashyyk. I might be jaded, but I don't get a similar sense here. Granted, I\"ve already played through KOTOR so the novelty is gone, but I'm not really feeling the awe of running around star wars in this game. it's just more of bioware's very mediocre level and art design. The characters again have stilted dialogue and spend alot of time saying nothing. There are a lot of annoying MMO fights that have no purpose because this is an MMO with respawning enemies.Beyond that though, it takes KOTOR and it unravels the story very SLOWWWLY, which is probably why I'm find it so hard to stay interested. MMO's are designed to elongate play, which I get, but if you elongate a story, you end up with tedium. There's a lot of tedium here in the story. It doesn't move along fast enough for you to really be awestruck. INstead, you spend way too much time running from poitn to point and killing pointless enemy after pointless enemy.In the time it would take me to beat KOTOR, I have maybe a level 15 agent. So I'd have to spend like 3-4 KOTOR playtimes to get to the end of the agent's storyline.Bah.And another thing is that since this is an MMO, you don't see your effect on the world like you did in KOTOR. This is a weird disconnect. ANd the story segments seem to take forever. And they say a lot of nothing, at a sloowwwww pace.I hear that the game recently went F2P which probably was inevitable but ultimately shows a stupid business model. The best part of the game is for KOTOR fans wanting more of the story. That part is now free.The worst part of the game is the combat models and MMO elements. Those parts are now paid.They would have been smarter to make the game on the guild wars model with people paying to play the SP story and having an online component for later. They would probably have raised more revenue and sales of $50/copy games rather than $0/copy that they'll get from alot of people.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003PHLTDC","description":"","reviewerName":"UziHorowitz","summary":"Vanquishing Every Other Third-Person Shooter","reviewText":"The name fits this game well, as Vanquish completely destroys every other third-person shooter. Yes, it's pretty short, and will likely last you only 4-5 hours to beat the single player campaign; however, this is one time where the short length doesn't hurt the overall product. Vanquish is developed by Platinum Games, most notably Shinji Mikami, known for his work on games like Resident Evil 4, P.N.03, and the most recent Shadows of the Damned. Vanquish, without a doubt, is his most fun and playable title to date. This game is fast and frantic from beginning to end.The gameplay is a high-adrenaline affair that has you sliding across the battlefield, kicking robots in the face, etc. Sure, you can take cover and shoot from there, but you won't last long if that's your strategy, as the battles happen to offer a lot more challenge and require you to move from place to place if you want to stay alive. The boss battles will especially keep you on your toes, as they're known to attack you from just about every angle, with explosive attacks, so you'll want to slide around in slow-motion a lot while taking down these humongous foes. In addition, a small gameplay feature is the ability to light up a smoke during battle, which recharges your stamina and allows you to do more melee moves, go into slow-motion, etc. Overall, the gameplay is buttery smooth and very satisfying; combat never gets old and always keeps you on your toes.The graphics are pretty good. The overall look has an epic feel, but it doesn't offer the cutting edge visuals and resolution that you may be used to; however, it is a darn good looking game nonetheless. Heck, the explosions are downright mindblowing and some of the best I've ever seen. The particle effects after an explosion will make you say \"wow\" every single time. Environments are large and detailed. Characters look pretty good and animate well overall. It's a pretty nice looking game, just not something that pushes the hardware in every area.The story is super goofy and cheesy. It'll keep you interested, but it's nothing that pushes the boundaries of narrative in gaming. It's cornball stuff, which is fine since that's what it's going for.Vanquish is fun, beautiful, and just a good time. It's short and cheesy, but that doesn't matter when you're having this much fun. Sit back, turn the brain off, and eat this one up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0086V5V9A","description":"","reviewerName":"Koala1356","summary":"Yay, for the return of true stealth!","reviewText":"After \"Conviction,\" I was unsure where Ubisoft was taking the Splinter Cell series.  I've been a fan since the first game, back in the day when you, as Sam Fisher, would sit in the dark for 20 minutes analyzing guard patrol patterns prior to making your move.  I still recall flattening Sam against a wall and having a guard walk by, unawares, literally inches from his head.I was very pleased that with \"Blacklist,\" Ubisoft brought back a lot of the old elements of the original Splinter Cell games.  It's now not just the 'run and gun' of \"Conviction,\" although if that's your thing then you can certainly play it like that, but fans of the original three games can rejoice at the return of true stealth mechanics, even in broad daylight.  The 'mark and execute' feature is still there, but it's no longer the crutch it became in \"Conviction.\"Missions are rated upon completion, graded into three categories--Ghost (non-lethal stealth), Panther (lethal stealth), and Assault (full-out assault).  Trying to get 100% Ghost is difficult, since firefights do break out unexpectedly, but you get rewarded handsomely the higher your score.  Points are converted directly into dollars, which you then use to purchase new gear and upgrades.  I found that playing co-op stealth awarded many more points/dollars than the solo campaign.  There are lots of gadgets to unlock, my personal favorite being the crossbow with all its stealth modes.  Sticky shockers remain one of my favorites, and now that you can toss or fire them into a puddle of water means you can do a non-lethal takedown of more than one enemy at a time.  Sleeping gas grenades come in a close second.The ability to hide bodies is back, so no more guards tripping over the guy you left unconscious in the hall (as per \"Conviction\") and raising the alarm.  If you perform a non-lethal takedown, your foe will fall to the ground and snore, which is sort of comical.  If you don't hide his body, then it's likely a buddy will stumble over him and wake him up.  Still missing (and it has been for several games now) is Sam's 'split jump' ability, which perhaps would have been the one thing that truly made this like a Splinter Cell game of old.  Sam can still climb like he is part monkey (as per \"Conviction\"), but I guess since he is an elite super agent I will overlook his extraordinary rock-climbing/parkour skills.The story itself is nothing new--a terrorist group called 'The Engineers' threatens the US with a countdown of deadly events that will happen unless the US recalls its troops worldwide.  Sam, now head of Fourth Echelon, is sanctioned to stop these attacks on the various US assets, aka the Blacklist.Fourth Echelon operates out of a mobile headquarters, a refitted 'jumbo jet' known as the Paladin.  The plane also serves as a nice change from a traditional game menu system, keeping the player immersed in Sam's world at all times.  The Paladin's main feature is the SMI (Strategic Mission interface) the table-like computer system from which you launch the solo campaign, multi player and co-op missions, and a host of other things like buying and upgrading your gear.  You can also walk around the plane (as Sam) and visit various the other characters aboard and, in a nice touch, call Sarah (Sam's daughter) via phone after each mission.  I even visited the cockpit, and although the pilots aren't talkative, the forward view was nice.New characters Isaac Briggs and Charlie Cole (the latter who first made his appearance in the 2013 graphic novel) join Anna \"Grim\" Grimsdottir in the cast for the thirteen main story solo missions.  There are also a few other returning characters that I won't mention for spoiler sake.  Walking around the Paladin, the player can visit any one of these characters for conversation about recent or upcoming missions, as well as upgrading gear and the plane itself, and as an alternative way to launch the fourteen co-op missions.  Briggs' missions are all 2-man co-op only and are story related, Grim's solo or co-op missions are all about taking out x-number of enemies without raising the alarm, and Charlie's solo or co-op mission have you surviving increasingly difficult waves of enemies until extraction.Of course, no review would be complete without mentioning the omission of Michael Ironside voicing Sam Fisher this time around.  This was the one point I thought would really bother me, but I have to say that although I do miss the gravelly, dry wit of Mr. Ironside's Sam, Eric Johnson did a more than adequate job.  I found that in a very short time, I was drawn into the story and missions, and didn't really notice Sam's 'different' voice.  I hope Ubisoft keeps Mr. Johnson for future installments in the series.The game comes on two discs.  Disk 2 contains a HD texture pack, which you are asked if you want to install when you first start the game.  It's worth doing, even though it takes about half an hour to install.  This is on top of the half hour you spend installing both game disks (optional).  I installed them because I thought it would mean that I would not have to swap disks, but I was wrong.  I am still prompted to swap disks when appropriate.In conclusion, I think the gameplay in \"Blacklist\" is the best since \"Chaos Theory.\"  Although, at the time of this review, I've been through the solo and co-op campaigns, I haven't even begun to get immersed in 'Spy vs Mercs' online multiplayer yet.  My goal right now is to go back and play the single player campaign, trying for a better Ghost score.  I'm so delighted to be back in Sam Fisher's world that I might stay here for months!  I wholeheartedly recommend \"Splinter Cell: Blacklist\" to those who enjoy a challenging 3rd person stealth/action game like the Splinter Cell games of old.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2013"}

This version will have new weapons, veteran and rookie drivers, weather effects, and night driving.","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"One of the greatest games of all time","reviewText":"I just bought my PS2 the other day and Twisted Metal: Black was the first game I bought for it.  Where as Twisted Metal 3 and 4 were extremely disappointing, the developers at Incog Inc. have taken the series back to it's roots of the first two Twisted Metal games (a few of th developers at Incog were the original designers of the first two games), while injecting a mother load of shockingly violent and disturbing images that combine with the series' trademark dark (in this case very dark)humor.  The graphics are absolutely unbelieveable, the combat arenas are huge, the frame rate never drops or drags (even in multiplayer mode), the lighting effects are excellent, and the landscapes look shockingly real.  The sound is excellent as well, combining an orchestral score with industrial Nine Inch Nails-esque music, not to mention the Rolling Stones &quot;Paint It Black&quot; used as the music during the game's end credits (whoever came up with that idea is a genius), and the song fits the tone of the game like a glove.  The control is super tight, its layed out exactly like the control scheme in TM 1&amp;2, although it can be kind of tricky at first until you get the hang of all the weapons.  The characters are very well done as are their cinematics and the overall storyline (its like a graphic novel come to life), but be warned: there are many disturbing images and graphicly violent scenes throughout the game, but those over the age of 14 shouldn't have much trouble swallowing it.  All in all, I am very glad I purchased Twisted Metal: Black, I love it and can't get enough of it, and if you own a PS2 it is a sin not to own this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2002"}

You are encouraged by the game to perform head-shots, run people over with your car, as well as to burn or electrocute them. The enemies vary from mutated dogs to midgets to uniformed soldiers. Violence is made to look more trivial since every enemy you kill is wearing a mask to make them look less human. It is nothing too violent for experienced gamers, but if your child is under 18, there is some questionable content. There are no options to kill innocent civillians or female players thoughAs far as fun, this is one of the best games of the year.

My favorite in the series is Tricky, but this new game is a close second. Low points in the series were the awful GBA game and the incredibly terrible Wii title. This current SSX is going to polarize a lot of gamers though. It's incredibly difficult at times, but also really really fun most of the time. The addition of the \"survive it\" runs really bother me. This series is basically one big gimmick to begin with (tricks = boost), and I don't think it needed extra gimmicks like Oxygen tanks, pulse goggles, wingsuits etc.  They're annoying at times, but they ruin entire mountains at other times. The highest peak in the game is only playable using an oxygen tank, which forces you to watch your O2 the entire race. Not fun. Not fun at all. Fortunately there's about 60 unique tracks in the game across 153 runs and I'd guesstimate that about 40 of those are really really fun.

When it came out, most people were accusing Rare of copying the Mario Kart 64 formula. That may be true, but at least they made modification. For example, there is a major decrease in emphasis on items in Diddy Kong Racing. In Mario Kart 64, you need a good hold on the items to win. In Diddy Kong Racing, items are merely an afterthought. What are really important are the boosters strewn all around the levels. This creates a different racing feel that some people may like more than others. I personally feel that the karts are not as agile as they are in Mario Kart 64, and that decreases my enjoyment of the game. Ah well. The inclusion of two extra vehicle types adds a different feel to the gameplay. I didn't really like the plane, but hovercrafts rule! In a racing game, level design is just as important as the controls. The courses are nice, but a bit lacking in variety. Oh well. It was obviously a way to fit in with the five different sections in the single player mode. Gawd...the single player mode...the Silver Coin Challenges are no fair, I tell you!As the game is less focused on the items, the battle modes are a bit drawn-out and boring. However, Fire Mountain and Smokey Castle are brilliant. In Fire Mountain, your goal is to take eggs to your nest and make sure they hatch. The game becomes frantic with the addition of the ability to steal your opponents' eggs. In Smokey Castle, you must take 10 bananas (2 at a time) to your respectable treasure chest. It's not as awesome as Fire Mountain, but it's fun just the same. Graphics are actually decent for 1997. It may not be as visually stunning as what Rare would achieve in half a year with Banjo-Kazooie, but the game looks nice nonetheless. Most early Rare games have lousy backgrounds, but DKR's backgrounds are impressive. The music is terribly catchy, and the voice samples are cute. The Silver Coin Challenge is still unfair.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2004"}

The game is packed full of beautiful graphics/CGI cutscenes, sound, gameplay, and great story line.  I played the game for about 80 hours, and thats about how long it took me to get everything.  Now when I say everything, thats talking about a whole lot.  The game it self is (to complete)about 40 hours long.  The story line is so important in RPG's and this one does it perfectly.  All the character are unique in their own way, they walk, talk, and act different.  The world in which it takes place is extremely believable and immense.  The graphics are truly amazing both in game and in the CGI sequences.  The enviroments are highly detalied, colorful, and vibrant.  The character models are sharp, crisp, clear, and overall great looking.  The women, of course, look more appealing (not to say that I have crushes on video game characters)with the high polygon count.  The monsters you fight in this game are all very unique and clever.  The summons (some new some old) are exhilhirating to watch when they make their grand entrance.  After the long sequence of their entrance is shown you can reduce it so its not so long.  Now in battles you can switch out characters, using each one's abilities effectivley.  Voice acting is very good, and somtimes not so great at times and the scripts are well written.  The music is very deep, affecting and soothing to listen too.  Unlike the other games (where you can play cards as the maine mini game) you get to play blitzball.  An underwater sport in a giant water sphere where some very excting scenes in the game take place.  All in all this game is the best RPG expirience you will ever have.

Which kinda makes sense, I mean it does take place in one major location, but each cave is exactly the same, down to the last detail. Only difference is that they use walls to block off areas and items make or may not be there.I do like the dual wielding rogue and two-handed warrior. One is ninja like, the other is faster and much more devastating. Mages are also able to fight back on their own now, and the spells are more streamlined. Weapon and shield is a pure tank class, and bows (only bows this time around) are strong and useful, but Varric easily handles that spot.All in all, not a bad game. Easier for casual gamers.

I always wanted the experience of seeing the world from behind the wheel of a car.  I always wanted to drive in a virtual environment where I could not hurt anyone while enjoying what it was like to drive.I love this game because; it lets me drive and the experience is just life like enough to make me want to visit different parts of LA.  I know it sounds sort of stupid but, driving in this game gave me a chance to feel a little closer to normal if only for just the all too fleeting time where I let myself live my driving fantasy in this virtual world.  Yes the game wants you to race and the game voices are built around racing.  However this game is programmed loosely enough that it lets you drive around the streets of L.A. looking at the sparkling buildings, bridges and such.  The game is programmed loosely enough to just let you drive by nice houses and seedy parts of LA town too.So many video games are so driven by their stories that they do not allow the person to just drive around.  Of course I have the option to drive like a maniac or drive like Miss Daisy is in the back seat barking out orders.  Sometimes I drive like a mad man and other times I drive like a gentleman of both quality and breeding.  The best thing is the cars are in effect indestructable.  The cars DO break down after lots of abuse but you always have the option to \"Fix\" them.  The overall quality of the \"friends you have in the game are of a thuggish gangsta playah sort\".  The cars are all extremely nice, sporty and powerful too.  You drive during the day or night.  As a dude with fairly moderate Cerebral Palsy playing video games is generally a disaster but with great effort I can generally keep the car on the road.  Oh I do make some really BAD mistakes which is why I don't drive in reality.  Oh I CAN AND DO drive on the sidewalk.  The people in this game rarely get killed by a car because; lets face it people in LA are too kewl to be hit by any car even one driven by a reckless half blind autistic werewolf with cerebral palsy.As a dude with cerebral palsy the main thing to remember is the primary purpose of playing any video game is to have fun.  I figure if a video game can deliver on its promise of fun to all people able bodied and disabled alike then it is a true gem.  This video game is a true gem because; I was not SOOOO locked or forced into completing the races that I could not just drive around and have a good time doing so.  What made this game fun is that I could choose to just ride around the city and enjoy the trouble I got into.  What a joy to have cerebral palsy and still DRIVE around like Joe solid citizen to see the sights OF THE great LALA aka LOS ANGELES.  The graphics in the game are great. The realism of the game is first rate.  I did not see any glitches or flaws at least not big ones that took away from my driving experience.  For the price this game was \"The Bomb Biggity!\"  Too bad this game does not let you just commit mindless acts of mayham from behind the wheel because it would have been so much more added fun.  Yes I would have loved the opportunity to be a psycho mad driver with road rage being chased by police car and feared by pedestrians EVERYWHERE!  I WOULD HAVE LOVED HEARING THE GAME'S POLICE OFFICIERS BROADCASTING THE FOLLOWING ALL POINTS BULLITIN...ATTENTION ALL UNITS...PSYCHOTIC INDISTRUCTIBLE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF WITH CEREBRAL PALSY RECKLESSLY DRIVING INDISTRUCTIBLE CAR.  APPROACH WITH CAUTION.  SUBJECT IS STONE COLD CRAZY.  HE CAN NEVER DIE SO KEEP LA'S CITIZENS ON FOOT AND IN CARS SAFE... THAT IS ALL!I am happy I brought this game.  It is just plain fun even if you are so disabled you will never spend time behind the wheel of a real car.  Hey this is the next best thing to real life driving.  CRASH ON!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2011"}

This is a phrase I've never used before, but...I don't think children should be playing this game.Please don't interpret this as any right-wing nonsense or ESRB loving BS. When games like Grand Theft Auto and Doom (Doom?  Freaking Doom caused school shootings?  Are you high?) are lambasted for violence and blamed for everything the past two generations have done wrong, I laugh and boot up Gears of War for a while to practice my chainsaw gun skills.  But that's the thing with most of those other games; they exist snuggly in some absurd video game fantasy world.  A chainsaw?  On a machine gun?  Come on now.  We aren't learning a disrespect for life or... anything really.  In fact, I don't think we're learning anything at all, save for hand-eye coordination and basic story telling devices.  The idea that violating pixelated monsters and even human analogs is what's warping my fragile little mind is absurd.  And yet...Here I am, playing Black Ops (Or Modern Warfare, same basic deal), looking down my sites and firing in controlled burst at muzzle flash in the distance that I can only assume is the bad guy and I've got this strange feeling in my gut.  I don't know how to describe it, but it's a little nauseous (just a little) and a little uneasy (just a touch) and it's exactly how I felt while watching Saving Private Ryan (for the first and only time).  I'm engaged, I'm fascinated, I can't look away, but I'm not having 'fun'.  No, what I'm feeling now, I can describe it a lot of ways, a lot of positive ways even, but certainly not as 'fun'.I've never been to war, I've never even played paint-ball.  But there's a part of me that just knows for a fact they've nailed some real-world physics when making this game.  The battle cry of the gaming pacifists has always been that they desensitize us to violence when really all they (usually) do is desensitize us to FANTASY violence or the IDEA of violence, and those are very very very different things from ACTUAL violence.  If anything, I'd say we as Americans are among the biggest sissies on the planet when it comes to ACTUAL violence (think about what goes into a bull-fight or political riot or a freaking public beheading next time you hear someone complain about a damn football game).  But these modern war games are a step (admitted a very small one but the first I've seen since COPS first aired) of injecting real-world, honest-to-goodness, palatable murder into mainstream culture.  Am I saying they're responsible for school shootings and gang wars (do those still happen, or was that a '90's thing?)?  No, of course not.  What I'm saying is...I've no idea what I'm saying.  Maybe parents (especially those with young boys with anger issues) should take the extra step before buying their kids this game and play it themselves?  Maybe... maybe we should just acknowledge the steps we're taking in our entertainment, the level or realism we're demanding and how we've begun to strip away fantasy whilst still labeling as entertainment.  Maybe acknowledging that will be enough?  Maybe none of it will matter in fifteen years when the next bloody spectacle comes  out?  Maybe my guts are just too delicate?But, of course, the reviews are correct and this game is damn near flawless.  Tight visuals and sounds, compelling level design, serviceable story, voice acting that ranges from great (GARY OLDMAN!!!) to ugh-that-guy-from-Terminator-Salvation-again.  It's a good, flowing, extremely playable, top tier game.  And yet...Am I the only one beginning to miss the guilt free days of Nazi sniping?  C'est la guerre fantastique, I suppose.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2011"}
{"product_name":"B004FUL9YW","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Miller","summary":"way too easy","reviewText":"I read the lower rated reviews on this game and I dont agree with them. If you are a pc gamer then you wouldnt like this game or even the first one for that matter, Im not a pc gamer I play the 360 and ps3 exclusively so I cant compaire this game or any other with pc game playing which I have to imagin is better than the console games but enough of that and onto what I think of pt2 first off I like the new moves that heller gets but dont like what you have to go through to change the powers list to useing them. the first prototype was great the only problems I had with it was the fighting was limited exspecialy when dealing with hunters and supersoilders. in this game you can block when fighting but the challenge is all gone the enemies are so week and you get so many upgrade to fight them like health regenerate which takes away the consume ability unless you want dna or its part of the mission other than that no need to consume anyone even during the fights the bosses are so week no need to worry about health. the only challenge in the whole game as far as fighting goes was at the end in fighting alex but after fighting him a couple of times and learning his moves and how to dodge them he was easy as well. I personaly like the story line and yes it was a little like the story line in the first one but this one has him trying to get his daughter which was a change. so to end this post I have to say I liked the new powers, storyline and new enimies in this game I just which they would have made it easier to switch powers and made the game way more of a challenge the first one was a challenge to me but all it needed was a block button and it would have been just fine. this has to many powers for a week assortment of enemies even the dreaded strike teams are week in this one and I hated them in the first one. so thats why I gave it three stars. would I pay full price for it no but then again I havent seen a game since batman arkam city that I would pay full price for. look forward to darksiders 2 will pay full price for that one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2012"}
