What if they are speedy but have low catch rating??I'm just supposed to pay up and get a \"speedy receiver\"Also if I'm the coach why can't I change player positions???The Connected Career Mode is a step back in my opinion.I loved playing Franchise Mode by myself.Might just go back to Madden 12....

{"product_name":"B006WQR3GA","description":"","reviewerName":"Phoj","summary":"Another Generation of Exploding Alien Faces","reviewText":"Like some of the other reviews claim, I was a fan of the original Xcom.  That one, like this one is a turn based strategy (thanks goodness! some of the old trailers made it looked like an action game instead).  The fun parts to me anyway is that you do battle with various types of malicious aliens who want to invade earth.  During the battles you take turns with the aliens with time units that you consume per character per turn to choose your actions.  Run twice as far, or run and shoot, or maybe use more attacks.After the battles you obtain your loot and can invest in developing better weapons for your elite squad of E.T. haters as well as choosing how to develop your underground base of operations between rounds.This game is an improvement over the original, however i doubt many of the readers will care as you are probably to young to have played it or were not involved in the genre at that point.  It was a computer game in the mid 90's.Like the original the biggest down I can give this game is that it does get a bit repetitious.  Battles have come a long way, and look generations better. You can do cool stuff like blow up objects like gas tanks near aliens as well as shooting them directly; their is some creative killing going on.  At the end of the day however a battle is a battle and it all starts to blend in together.Overall if you enjoy some light rpg elements, developing an arsenal of weapons starting with assault riffles and going up to alien death rays, combined with a turn based strategy flow you would probably like Xcom: Enemy Unknown.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2012"}
{"product_name":"B006WQR3GA","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Every Decision You Make Affects the War!","reviewText":"XCOM Enemy Unknown does an outstanding job of reviving a classic gaming franchise which was heralded as one of the most addictive games of all time.  If you've never heard of XCOM, it's a turn based strategy game where you manage a group of space marines and defend the Earth against an Alien Invasion.  But you don't just fight.  You hire scientists, engineers, choose what technology to develop, manage the finances, equip your guys, and control their moves on an interactive battlefield.  The tension is high and every battle is meaningful.  You'll also feel the pain of being a commander because you won't make all of your superiors happy and not all of your soldiers will return from battle.  You're going to make some really tough decisions in this game.If you've played the original:This is a reboot, not a whole new adventure.  The story is the same.  The weapon progression is the same.  The features are the same.  The campaign is a bit shorter and the gameplay has been streamlined.  In the original, you micromanaged time units.  Every step you took cost time units, holstering a weapon cost time units, shooting cost time units, crouching...  Well, you get the idea.  You could spend 5 minutes just trying to figure out the best way to get your sniper on the roof and shoot.In the new version, the gameplay works like this:On your turn, you move all of your troops.  Then it's the alien's turn and they move all of their troops.  You want to do as much damage as possible when you get the chance.During your turn, there are two different colored outlines displayed around your character.The Blue area is within 10 steps (near).  The Yellow area is within 20 steps (far).You can:a)  Shoot - and your turn ends.b)  Run Far - Move within the Blue Area, look at the map, then move within the yellow area. - and your turn ends.c)  Run and Do Something - Move within the Blue Area, perform an action:  Shoot, Heal, Use Smoke Grenade, Reload - and your turn ends.d)  Defend - Stay put or move within the Blue Area, and put your character on \"Overwatch\"(Overwatch allows your character to shoot at any enemy that comes in range when it is the other team's turn.  This is ideal for covering your other troops or setting up ambushes.)e)  Perform a special class specific action:  Assault Troops have an ability called Run and Gun, which allows them to run through the blue area, the yellow area, and then shoot.  Heavy Gunners can fire a rocket launcher at the beginning of their Turn.  Snipers can perform a special head shot at the beginning of their turn.  Support Troops can throw a smoke grenade which makes your allies harder to hit.At the beginning of your turn, it's important to figure out the best way to execute your strategy.Whenever you shoot, you pick your enemy target and you can see the % TO HIT and % TO CRITICAL HIT for extra damage.It's important to cycle through your troops and your options so you can do as much damage to the enemy as possible!Concept:  10/10Reboot XCOM with improved graphics, production values, the same tactical gameplay, and streamline the interface.  Then add Multi-Player!!!Story:  9/10The Earth is being invaded by hostile alien forces and you must run a military organization as large as GI JOE.  There are a few cutscenes, but most of the drama takes place on the battlefield.  Watching one of your best troops get surrounded and gunned down is pretty heart breaking.  Watching a rookie take down 5 aliens on their first mission is inspiring.  Watching your squad work as a well oiled machine as they use their strengths to cover each other as they raid an alien base is truly a great feeling.XCOM also allows you to name your marines after your friends and family members, which adds even more to the tension.Gameplay:  10/10There are many levels of gameplay in XCOM.International Relations:XCOM functions like the United Nations.  There are 16 Nations that give you funding.  In order to get funding, you must build a satellite and put it in orbit over their country.  These nations will pay you every month for protection.  However, if you fail to respond to an alien threat or lose a battle, they become unhappy with you.  If things get too bad, they withdraw from the project completely.  If half of the nations withdraw, you lose the entire game!!!  (Yes, you can LOSE an entire War Campaign!)  Some nations give better bonuses than others, so prioritize your allies.Finances:You have a monthly income and monthly expenses.  Your credit is NOT OK, so you really need to plan things out.  How many troops do you hire?  Do you buy a flying craft to shoot down UFO's, or do you invest in better armor for your soldiers?  Do you research laser weapons or do you perform alien autopsies to see what makes the enemy tick?  All of the decisions you make affect the war!Air Combat:Once you have a satellite over a nation, you'll see UFO's flying around.  The alien crafts vary in strength from small scouts to flying battleships.  As the commander of XCOM, it is your duty to intercept and try to shoot down the UFO's (via a mini-game) and then send the marines out to kill or capture aliens that survived the crash.  Your interceptors can get shot down, so it's important to equip them with the latest technology and weaponry.Research and Development:With limited resources, you will constantly make tough decisions on what to develop.  China is upset that you don't have a satellite over them, but you almost lost your entire squad in the last battle?  Do you build a satellite or do you invest in armor upgrades for your troops?  Every decision you make affects the war!Battles:There are a few different types of battles in the game:UFO Crash - send your squad to kill or capture the survivorsUFO Landing - similar to the crash, but there are more aliens.Alien Abduction - a city map with destructible environments and hidden enemies.Alien Terror Attack - a city map with destructible environments and civilians you must try to protect.Alien Base Raid - you must advance through hostile territory to complete the mission!Risks and Rewards:In XCOM, you are often presented with situations like this:There are 3 alien attacks going on at the same time.The USA, where they are happy with you, an easy mission, win the battle and get 200 credits.China, who is about to quit the project, a very difficult mission, win the battle and get a Heavy Gunner Captain to join your squad.  Ignoring the battle or losing it will cause China to quit.Mexico, where they are not very happy with you, a difficult mission, win the battle and get 4 Scientists who will help you research better technology faster.As the commander of the XCOM project, you're going to make hard decisions.Battle Tactics:  10/10Which 6 members do you bring?There are 4 character classes:  Assault, Support (medic), Heavy Gunner, and Sniper.Some missions are better if you use snipers, others, heavy gunners.  It's up to you to figure out the best make-up of your squad and what to equip them.  You won't have enough money to give them all the best weapons and armor.Game Modes:  10/10There are 4 difficulty Levels and a special Iron Man mode where the game auto-saves and you only get 1 save file.  If you mess up, there is no going back!  Losing a battle and having to live with the consequences is a painful experience.Character Upgrades:  9/10When your characters kill enemies, they gain XP.  When they gain XP, they go up in level and unlock new abilities based on their class.  There are basically 2 columns and you chose option A or B when you advance.It's really important to think about how each squad member will fit into the squad.  You can upgrade your sniper to be defensive and auto-shoot at enemies, or you can make their shots more deadly.  It's up to you.Multi-Player:  10/10In Multi-Player, you join a match with a point limit.  The limit is for your squad.  Each type of character, weapon, or upgrade costs points.  So, you can just have a basic guy with a machine gun for 3000 or you can have a jet pack sniper with a plasma rifle for 6000 points.  You can even use aliens.  A floater enemy may cost 1300 points, while a hulking berserker costs 6000.  How you build your squad is up to you.In the multi-player battle, you get 120 seconds to move your guys, then it's the other player's turn.  What makes things interesting is that you don't know what you are up against until you see them.Replay Value:  10/10The campaign is very addictive and will take about 30-40 hours to complete.  When you beat the game, you're going to want to try a harder difficulty on Iron Man mode, too.  When you factor in Multi-Player, there's 100 hours of fun here.Maturity:  TeenThe graphics are kind of cartoony and there's sci-fi violence.  No swearing or nudity, just good ol' aliens and space marines blowing each other up.  This is a complex strategy game, so kids may not be able to play it.Overall:  10/10This is truly a great game and I actually played it until 5am a few times.  I was completely consumed and I nearly grew a beard.  If a game is this addicting, it deserves a 10.  I also named the characters after my friends and enjoyed telling them how they did.  Some were heroes, others died horrific deaths.The strategy feels right and there's enough going on to keep you engaged.  I wish the developer would reboot Baldur's Gate 2!!!Buy this game if you love turn based strategy and fairly complex tactics.Buy this game if you have lots of FREE TIME and or an understanding family/spouse/or girlfriend.Buy this game if you want a real challenge.Avoid this game if you play easy games to relax.Avoid this game if you lack discipline and have a busy schedule.Avoid this game if you think this will be like Mass Effect.  It's not.  It's a turn based strategy game where you must think on different levels toward an end goal.  When you win, you feel like a champ.  When you lose... it hurts.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2012"}

As I worked up to my full sprinting speed, I felt my heart pounding faster and faster. I leapt down the staircase and landed with a forward roll, never breaking momentum. I threw my shoulder into the door at the end of the hall, and the lock popped open from the force of my impact. As I escaped, I wondered how people could be afraid of heights. Some see fear, I see challenge. Others see apprehension, I see exhilaration. I'm still alive...\"Anyone who saw the movieCasino Royaleremembers the construction site chase sequence - Daniel Craig had to chase down a terrorist who was a master of Parkour: a method of moving from one place to another in the quickest and most efficient ways possible.In Mirror's Edge, you take the role of Faith - a young roof runner proficient in Parkour. Her sister has been accused of a crime she didn't commit, and you have to clear her name while keeping one step ahead of the Blues (police) on your tail. The game is presented in a first-person perspective, designed to fully immerse the player in Faith's world. Whether it's stretching to reach a ledge, going into a landing roll or leaping across a 50-foot gap between buildings, the player does it all. Unlike other games in a first person perspective, Mirror's Edge offers a view of the player's hands, feet, and even the torso to accurately judge distance, depth and height.Though the tutorial lessons, we learn the available maneuvers in the game: running, wall climbing, sprinting, sliding under objects, vaulting, soft landings, and most importantly, how to disarm hostiles. Holding a weapon makes Faith move slower, and since time is of the essence, more often than not we find ourselves discarding weapons instead of using them.The trophy system is well-built for Mirror's Edge. With each level of gameplay and each time trial, trophies are earned. The designers clearly wanted to focus on the running aspects and less on the combat; evidenced by a trophy awarded when the player completes the game without shooting any enemies. Online leader boards record the fastest run-throughs of each level, and the competition is FIERCE.Even with all this going for it, Mirror's Edge does have its flaws. If a player isn't right on target with physical attacks or misses the opportunity to disarm a hostile, they are left open to a crushing counterattack. Some pathways are crystal clear, others are not always visible to the naked eye and will require some trial & error to navigate through. After a time, the levels start feeling repetitious, and with only 9 levels to explore, Faith's frenetic pace makes the game feel quite short.Williams Belle, one of the founders of Parkour, had this to say:\"...It should not be lost. It has to stay alive! I do not want to have this experience, and just write it in a book, it would become a dead experience! I want it to be alive! I want people to use it, to live it and to experience it.\"Well, Mr. Belle, after playing this game, I can say that Parkour is still alive...and ready to thrive.If you look at a construction zone and see an obstacle course, don't be surprised if you find yourself pulled to the Mirror's Edge.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2009"}

Squires \"theDrizzle\"","summary":"Not perfect, but what is","reviewText":"I don't understand why I keep reading that it doesn't have good graphics; are you people using an HDTV? Do you have an HDMI connection? I wouldn't say it's the best graphics I\"ve ever seen but you have to take into consideration that it doesn't load that often and it doesn't take that long when it does. The console systems are working with finite resources and you can't create that big of an environment without 10 minute loading times unless you allow the visuals to suffer a little. People have become so critical of games these days; everyone's an expert all of a sudden. Considering the size of the environments you're playing in, I'd call the graphics top notch.The story is really good and there's a lot of options to change it...I think. I've made choices that have led one direction or another in the story, but I'm not sure if the game would have let me to that path anyways. I know they spent a long time developing this game and the depth is amazing, but after you make a choice in the game, there's no way to know if you actually had a choice or if all the dialogue is just to entertain you and ends in the same result. I'm going to have to compare with other people who used the same race if they had similar results from choices made.I only have a few complaints about this game. I was hoping for an Oblivion style of fighting, but it's closer to turn based. You just hit the A button whenever you feel like it and it attacks an enemy...it's kind of lazy. I prefer the first person hack N slash, but that's just a personal preference. It just feels like there's not too much room for skill to play a role in the combat. Also, why can't I exit out of a conversation? I keep talking to people and realize they have way to much to say...why can't I just hit B if that person's not interesting to me? A lot of the people you interact with don't seem to have much purpose but they sure have a lot to say. I was building up my persuasion skill because I thought that it would help me get cheaper weopons and goods like in Oblivion, but I haven't found it that useful yet...I guess I was able to lie and get a sword from an elf, but usually it just allows you to interact with more people who don't have anything useful to tell you...and you can't hit the B button to stop talking to them, so you just have to get bored and annoyed! They probably should have included an exit strategy for the human interactions. So far the game feels kind of linear too; again, I made choices but I don't know if they were really choices or just resulted in different dialogue but didn't actually change the story line.Anyways, even with all of these little issues, I still have to give it 5 stars because of the depth. You're bound to have little glitches and issues when you create a masterpiece like this. I think that it's unfair to be overly critical of a game with this much content that costs the same as the Shrek game. Think about it.Graphics: 9.0Sound/voice acting: 10Story: 10Combat: 7Replay: 10Controls: 8Overall, I think this is the best RPG released since fallout 3. It's not perfect, but it will certainly keep me busy until COD comes out...and maybe till the next Bethesda gameUpdate:If you hit the X button you can skip conversations; thought I had tried every button, but apparently not. So, this is much better than having to listen to some of the more pointless dialogue.Also, I've been able to use the persuade function to do more relivant things in the last few hours of play, so perhaps it's not as pointless as it seemed initially.And, I definitely had a real choice to make when I was playing last night. It was without a doubt two different outcomes I was choosing from. However, would it have changed the story if I went the other way with my choice? I still don't know how much influence I have on the story when I make these decisions. How linear is the game? I know it's forcing me to recruit all of the different factions that have treaties. So, there's nothing I can do to change this, and I don't know if the little choices I make are going to have any significan impact on the game play. Just have to keep playing I guess.Update 08Nov~Ok, so I made it to the end and I have to say, \"WTF!\" How can a game be so easy through the whole thing and then impossible at the end? I've tried 4 times and there's no way for me to beat the ArchDemon. I would call the difficult of the game inconsistent at best. So, now that I'm invested in the story, I'll never get to see it finished. I'm not spending another 4 hours trying to level up further just to beat the end.I guess just be really ready when you go to fight the final battle. The reinforcements you worked for 20 hours to round up turn out to be essentially worthless. So, you better have your A game ready to beat this thing.Update 10Nov~Disregard comments about the ending. This is where the glitches finally work in your favor. Just put your party on \"hold position\" and walk each one to a balista canon on the 4 surounding towers. Then switch between characters and use who's closest to the dragon to shoot it. Sometimes it will just sit there frozen and let you pummel it for five minutes. I didn't even have the Dark Spawn army show up this time. It was actually a little anti climatic to win this way, but at least you can beat it.Traded it in for COD4 MW2 now; having much more fun","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2009"}

The 64 player servers are intense as well! Much better than 24 on current gen.My main issue with this game is that the campaign save data tends to just delete itself. I've had to play through the campaign 3 times so far because it just deletes. DICE and EA know of this issue, and have known since launch, but still no fix for this. I do recommend this game, because the multiplayer is fun and the graphics are breathtaking, but I wouldn't pay over $45 for this game new due to the issues with it so far.TIP: if you are content with the games you have, wait a few months to buy. With BF3, after about 5 months, they released a version of the game that included Battlefield Premium (all the map packs, etc), for the same price as the game was new upon launch. so they may do the same this time as well.

Lucrative contracts on the rich and powerful in high profile locations make killing for money good business.  But when a rival agency enters the scene it's war, and only the best man will be left standing.","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"Find this Hitman and bring him home","reviewText":"The Hitman series fits in its own place on the third-person action game spectrum. On one side you have stealth games like Splinter Cell and Metal Gear Solid, while the other is filled with stuff like Resident Evil 4 and typical third-person shooters. Hitman is everywhere and nowhere in particular, because the flexibility of its gameplay caters to fans of either side of the spectrum. Hitman: Blood Money has this flexibility and a few other elements that make it a viable purchase for Xbox 360 owners and Hitman fans on other consoles.In Hitman: Blood Money, Agent 47's story is played totally through flashbacks and recollections of a mysterious, scarred-faced man who claims to have hunted down and killed the elusive agent. I didn't think that the overall story was as particularly gripping as the individual scenarios found in each level. Hitman: Blood Money invites some of the emotion and some of the tension that perhaps a real assassin might feel: is killing another person easy to do for the sake of money? It's possible that some might feel remorse for 47's victims.Each of the twelve levels is a cleverly conceived romp that Io Interactive should be extremely proud of. From the initial training mission, where you'll kill an amusement park tycoon, to one where you'll cleverly kill an actor as he practices an opera on-stage, each level is exciting. When the player completes the level the way it was intended--with stealth--the clever side comes out, and the feeling of accomplishment is immense.Fortunately, setting up the \"accidents\" in each mission is simple enough thanks to an intuitive control system that is mapped entirely to the Xbox 360's face buttons and shoulder triggers. Pressing the A button (or, for PS2 owners, X) will allow you to interact with just about anything in the environment. You can climb up ladders, through open windows, rig explosives, and more. The B button (PS2's circle) allows you to pick up things scattered around the environment, like weapons and disguises. Last, the Y button (PS2's triangle) lets you drop things. Shooting, using weapons, and setting traps can all be done by pulling the Right Trigger, while the Left Trigger allows you to sneak around silently. And though the default perspective is in third-person, there is a first-person perspective available as well, which can be adjusted on-the-fly. I found myself using this first-person perspective in situations where I didn't have to worry about sneaking or following someone, as it gave me a better perspective on different things scattered around the environment. It also felt a lot more natural when the time came to defend myself with a firearm.Since Hitman: Blood Money isn't a game that focuses on combat it isn't the most polished in that area. It feels stiff and sluggish to engage in a firefight, which is unfortunate when Eidos's other recent published release, Tomb Raider: Legends, feels so fluid. At least firefights aren't necessary, or encouraged, because the true fun in Hitman lies where guns aren't used and cunning is the key to success. Using sedative syringes to silently incapacitate your victims is pleasing, but it's all the better when you inject poison into a drink and watch your target drink his life away. It's endlessly entertaining to watch the rich wife in the suburbs explode into flames when she turns on a rigged barbeque grill, then falling into the clear blue water of a swimming pool just after being burned to a toast. And setting traps is great: one of the targets in the opera level can be killed by a falling chandelier if you set a mine in the proper location and time the detonation correctly.Performing these violent killings has a negative effect on 47. This time around, a system called \"Notoriety\" will be affected by how violently or with what level of terror that you execute your hits. If you enter a level in the game and unload on every living thing, you'll earn a lot of notoriety and later missions will be made even more difficult from the beginning, based on your predetermined notoriety. However, performing missions the way they're meant to be-stealthily-you'll gain far less notoriety and have to spend less of your hard-earned money lowering the wanted level. So while it's safe to say that Hitman: Blood Money is accessible to those with an itchy trigger finger, those patient gamers will be rewarded with more available funds to upgrade the in-game weapons and add items to the assassin's inventory.Visually, Hitman: Blood Money is a mixed bag. While the indoor environments are fantastic (the first level, for example, is beautiful), outdoor areas (the rehab facility, for example) aren't always as impressive. Shrubbery and trees are particularly ugly.  I will say, though, that the game has beautiful water effects and decent cloth effects. For example, running between hanging sheets in a suburban home definitely reminds me of Splinter Cell. Last of all, it's definitely got the most humorous ragdoll physics I've seen in ages. When the going gets rough and you're armed with a shotgun, pumping NPCs full of lead, you'll definitely be laughing as bodies slump across the floor and fly over tables.In terms of music, Hitman: Blood Money delivers at just the right time, but it's more about ambience than anything. The opera level was the most captivating, mostly because of the opera music in the background. For once I found myself trapped in ambient noise and speech bytes rather than my Xbox 360 custom soundtrack, and I'd say that Hitman: Blood Money gets the job done in the audio department.The flawed parts of Hitman: Blood Money lie in the A.I, which is sub-par to say the least. NPC's will follow their computerized routes, rarely straying away from them to interact with you or the environment. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, because the combat A.I. is quite simply the dumbest thing you'll ever see. I witnessed attackers stand blankly in doorways, unsure of what to do. Other times, I'd randomly alert a guard or stumble into something and frighten a civilian. It's annoying, but it's something that is tolerable to the point that the game itself isn't tainted.Others might say that Hitman: Blood Money's scenarios are dangerously similar to those of other Hitman games, but they're fun and entertaining nonetheless. I particularly liked the rehab facility, suburb, and opera missions, which is why I keep bringing them up: they're tense, they require perfection, and they're obviously entertaining. They're early levels, and the later ones are much more complex, but they're definitely worthy mentions.Overall, this is a fantastic game. Playing through each assignment and figuring out the perfect formula is the key, as well as keeping a low notoriety level. Doing these things will make the experience so much better. Hitman: Blood Money's intuitive controls, satisfying gameplay, and addictive qualities make all of that something that I wanted to do. Even when I'd alert a guard and restart an entire level or miss a chance to kill my target, I was having fun trying to cleverly clear this game. Unskilled players that play on easier difficulties will find that the game is a lot shorter; the later levels are only unlocked on the two harder difficulty settings. Going through different difficulty settings and trying to unlock more missions is the extent of this game's longevity, since there's not a single multiplayer mode in sight, but it's safe to say that you'll want to perform missions at least twice to see just how many different ways each one of them can be finished. Though there are a few flaws, this is a great entry to the series and a nice addition to any gamer's library.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2006"}

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Chris A.

The best way I could describe this game is that it is a feel-good game. The graphics are really creative with the whole yarn/quilt effect, and really colorful too. The music is light and instrumental in most of the levels (predominantly piano music). Its pretty easy to play considering you don't die in a level, but when you are hurt you will lose your beads (the equivalent of money in this game) which you need to unlock several things. What is really cool is that the game gives you an apartment, in which you can earn (or purchase) decor and furniture so you can decorate your apartment to your own tastes, and you have yarn neighbors that you help decorate their apartments also and then each different one offers different mini games to play with you. The two player mode is awesome and lots of fun (my little sister loves playing two player with me :)) , and at some more difficult parts a partner comes in real handy. I thought possibly at first that this would be a childish game, but its really not, its more of a comfort game with cheery effects made for young and old alike. And a note to parents; This game would be great for younger children since it is devoid of almost any violence and there is positively no bad language.

Working in the proximity of the palace, Leonard stumbles on a plot to kidnap the enigmatic Princess Cisna. As he helps her escape he also becomes aware of his connection to a transformative power which allows him to take on the ancient shape, and harness the devastating power of the White Knight. Yet there are other elements at work here as well, including the forces of an evil wizard with powers that stretch back to the same ancient times which produced the White Knight. With the help of his friends and the power of the White Knight, these are the forces that Leonard will have to face in his quests.GameplayWhite Knight Chroniclesis a Japanese RPG (JRPG) centered around a turn-based battle system in a local single player story-driven campaign that is supported by online multiplayer functionality. Gameplay questing occurs from a third-person perspective and follows Leonard and up to three other AI companions, which can include the customizable character that players assume in multiplayer mode. Once quest members are assembled, players utilize the strengths of the overall group as a whole, and are able to switch between characters at will. Combat being turn-based, players must be able to cue up and control the actions of each character in quick sequence for each combat scenario faced. The game facilitates this via the Function Palette, located in its Battle Preparation menu, allowing players to prepare in advance a series of commands for each character to carry out. These can involve magic or weapons use and can be merged into combos. Multiple palettes can be saved, making it possible to optimize actions for specific types of enemies, and making for quick changing of commands. As with any RPG, throughout quests players accumulate experience which allows their character to level up, purchase items and abilities and generally grow stronger with an eye towards besting the increasingly challenging creatures, bosses and situations faced.Online MultiplayerAlong with a compelling single player campaign,White Knight Chroniclesalso contains an exciting online multiplayer component. Within this, up to four players can engage in more than 50 multiplayer quests, with each player creating their own unique customizable character which can be leveled up in a combined group effort, and take advantage of created items and new skills. Although unique to the online game mode, which is designed for multiplayer action, these quests can also be played alone if players wish. In addition to this functionality available in the online multiplayer mode also includes a variety of ways to interact with the widerWhite Knight Chroniclescommunity on the PlayStation 3 platform. Included in this is town building through the Georama functionality, which allows players to construct a town to their own specifications that can be populated offline with characters from throughout the single player campaign and then taken online where it serves as a base for quests hosted by players, as well as a persistent online location that other players can visit and buy items your town's population has for sale. The game also offers an online interface known as GeoNet that allows players to communicate with others via blogs, forums, quest logs and voice chat functionality, as well as post snapshots from their journeys using the Crystal Camera in-game tool.Key Game FeaturesWhite Knight Transformation- During single player combat players can transform into the giant White Knight, gaining the ability to challenge large enemies as well as troops of soldiers throughout the adventure.The Customizable Avatar Character- Using a wide array of sliders and customization options, players are able to create a unique character that can join the adventure in single player mode as well as online.Combo Battle System- Engage in an accessible, active turn-based battle system that caters to players of all levels allowing both default attack settings and a system for for maximum damage.JRPG (Japanese RPG) Action for PS3- Experience true JRPG action on PS3 that incorporates a variety of online gameplay elements.Beautiful Environments- Players traverse through 13 stages, as well as visit up to six towns/villages to visit and purchase items at shops or interact with NPCs.

This is easily the most beautiful game world ever created. This is true for indoor scenarios, but the engine is especially good with tropical outdoor scenarios.Unfortunately, the save-game system is the worst I have encountered in a long time. Not only is your only option to auto-save at check points (which are few and far between and also inconsistant), but the game sometimes even ends up saving just before you get hit by a bullet. And you guessed it: Once you load the game, the bullet is right there again, hitting you in the face. Argh! (I read that there is a bug that fixes this problem, but I have not seen that available anywhere... V1.1 seems to have the same problem...)Can it be so hard to create a FPS game that is fun to play, simply by allowing me to progress through the game smoothly? This is now the second game within a very short period of time that I bought an UbiSoft game that was truely fantastic, but was made completely frustrating and useless by its save-game feature (XIII being the other).But perhaps I am asking too much if I expect some fun to come in the same box as great graphics...PS: I have now modified the game myself, adding a quick-save key (which can be done using configuration files and some minor scripting). This makes the game a little better. However, once I did this, I realized that there are many other things wrong with this game. I can not count the number of times where I entered a room and was immediately killed without even knowing what hit me. I often had to enter the same room 4 or 5 times before I could even figure out what was going on!At other times, I would have to approach the same enemy multiple times and even though I knew what was coming and already aimed at the right spot before things happened, I was still killed again and again. How one would get through these scenes without a save game feature is completely beyond me. Sure, I did not play on the easiest setting, but still! I have played through all of Doom 3 without having been killed once where I thought it wasn't my own fault. In Far Cry, this happend all the time!And then there were times where the level design was just so sloppy that I could not move on. A few times I tried to swim through a pond, just to realize that I could not get out of it because the banks were to steep. At other times, I set off a huge explosion that threw crates around so they would block the next door, and I could not move them out of the way. Now just imagine you die because of that kind of nosense and there is no save feature!At other times, I tried to shoot mosters with a clear line of sight, but the collision detection is so sloppy that I kept firing into an invisible wall. As soon as I moved a few pixels though, the monster would kill me before I was able to fire off another shot (and it takes several shots to kill those monsters). I am not sure why this is such a problem?!? It seems that the FarCry developers can do perfect per-pixel lighting, but on the other hand, they can not even do rough per-vertex collision detection and instead use a bounding box? Hard to believe, but for a good number of on-screen objects, this seems to be the case.This game is a good example for a game that sells because of its graphics. The graphics are awesome, but the rest of the game is a disaster! Put a different/average graphics front end on this, and people would hate this game! Game design wise, this is completely unacceptable. Still, the graphics are worth seeing, especially outdoor scenarios. You can see that in the free demos though.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2004"}

Both HALF LIFE 2 and FAR CRY were released. Whereas DOOM III and QUAKE IV came and went - (not exactly unnoticed but does anyone play them today?), these two were here to stay. Nevertheless, whereas HL2 eventually got to my nerves with the whole STEAMed-permission-to-play-for-30-minutes blunder, FAR CRY was the game I loved the most and replayed again and again.The graphics are just amazing! HL2 may have crisp and clear textures too, however, FAR CRY's are also realistic and detailed even at maximum resolution. The controls are intuitive and remapable - and take the character (Jack Carver) precisely where you want him. Running is fast and crawling is effectively silent. When greater distances are to be covered, vehicles are available to commandeer.The weapons are beautiful: a mix of real and futuristic improvements. Ammo is never really a problem (well, with the exception of the Sniper rifle bullets and the RPG loads when they would really tip the balance in your favor) and, most importantly, the damage they inflict is TRULY BALANCED: both enemies and player go down with about the same amount of damage (you would be surprised on how many games this is not true - STALKLER for one...).The story is interesting, the locales truly breathtaking and the horizon the further you have ever seen in any game! True free roaming is not actually available (try to round an island with a speedboat to circumvent same stubborn enemies and a black helicopter will chop you to pieces), however the taste is at the tip of your tongue the whole time.The sounds and music have been worked on with care and they maximize the gaming experience.My only (minor) objection focuses on the battles with the mutants: FAR CRY features one of the best enemy AI ever encountered. I truly savored battling human AI - but was apprehensive when another mutant segment was coming up. Then again, the game never lets you get bored.I am not an easy costumer (feel free to browse through the rest of my reviews, you will see what I mean...); nevertheless,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00113JSCG","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Greatness yanked down by poor decisions","reviewText":"Most people attribute the start of the Survival Horror genre to Resident Evil.  While you can trace the birth of Survival Horror back far, far before that game (to Sweet Home or, if you want to stretch it, to Haunted House in 1981), modern Survival Horror games were firmly established by the first Alone in the Dark.  Since that first game, though, the series has been an up and down roller coaster that never seemed to be able to outmatch some of the better known and more famous franchises like Resident Evil or Silent Hill.So, when Eden Games started to work on reinventing the franchise, I was cautiously optimistic.  A lot of the ideas and concepts they spoke of seemed like great ideas, and they seemed to be trying to Do Something Different.  Unfortunately, the sum is not greater than its parts and Alone in the Dark, while reaching for the stars, can't stay afloat.Things begin appropriately apocalyptic.  Edward Carnby awakens in some hotel with some bad men arguing about cryptic shenanigans.  Carnby, no longer useful, is led up to the roof to be executed but before that can happen, bad juju hits the fan as a \"scar\" tears through the building.  From here, this first episode really picks up as you're trying to escape the building alive.Here is where the goodness lies.  Alone in the Dark has a great opening that's appropriately cinematic but in such a way that only games can do.  The building starts to fall apart, you have to run and jump your way to safety, climb along the outside of the building while debris tumbles and while watching cars below you explode.  You learn how Eden Games created some appropriately realistic fire for the game as you watch it spread and have to put it out or use it as a weapon.  You'll see things happen to the various rooms you're in that will make you want to believe you're watching a cinematic, not playing through a game.  It's very cool.And then you try to move.Movement is the worst part of the game.  It's all controlled with one stick which makes actually moving feel as if you're controlling a drunk, disobedient person.  Once you get a melee weapon in your hand, you'll see another problem: using the right analog stick to attack.  You'll have to swing it one direction, then another just to attack.  Unfortunately it's sluggish, as is the animation, resulting in you taking more damage than you should need to.  Fighting monsters becomes a chore, one you'll grow to hate because as the game progresses, you'll learn that basically all monsters can only die via fire.  So, grab that chair, light it on fire and swing away...hoping you hurt it more than it hurts you.  Similarily, gun fights are also not terrific as you have to pop into first person whenever you want to shoot someone.  No lock and pop here.Likewise, if walking around makes you feel like a drunk, driving is a good approximation of drunk driving, I believe.  The controls are incredibly loose and in the first driving portion of the game, loose controls isn't a good idea.  What should be an exciting escape sequence that involves the ground behind you exploding, tears appearing across the streets, buildings collapsing, fire, death explosions, cats and dogs sleeping together turns into frustration as you'll probably find yourself repeating the episode.  Over. And Over.  From the beginning.  It loses its fun and becomes a chore.Towards the end of the game, the game pulls a Zelda: Wind Waker moment and has you hunting down certain things and destroying them in an effort, one has to assume, to artificially lengthen the game.  If there's one thing that Alone in the Dark does exceptionally well, it's the pacing.  When you hit this moment it's like running smack dab into a brick wall.  It's sad.There's a lot going for Alone in the Dark, don't get me wrong.  The inventory system is a cool innovation.  The whole episodic \"TV show/DVD\" feel is perfect, with DVD-style menus complemented by the ability to switch to any episode you like.  The graphics are pretty decent, as is the engine it's running on.  Some cool, small features, like the ability to blink your eyes is very effective during some sequences.  And the pacing--for the most part--is perfect; it can really get your adrenaline going...until you're forced to repeat the same thing over and over again.I really wanted to like Alone in the Dark.  I didn't honestly think that Eden Games would elevate the game to the front of the pack, but there was enough little things and innovations that I thought maybe it'd be a good game.  When I played it, I was amazed.  Eden Games wanted no less than to shoot for the moon and make the most ambitious Survival Horror game yet.  Unfortunately, reality is sometimes like gravity and unfortunately Alone in the Dark isn't the masterpiece I, and Atari, I'm sure, was hoping for.  Definitely give it a rent, but I'd hold off on purchasing it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2008"}

I have played, and still own, the previous 9 COD games. I do like COD as I'm a fan. I like change like new game modes but talking away the old ones is disappointing. Not a fan of any of the weapons or multiplayer maps. Poorly made. There are campers in every shooter but there's more of it here. This is because there are a lot of high points and maps are bigger than usual. SMGs has been very good in the last 4 COD games. However, due to the larger maps the Assault rifles seem to be the better choice because of long distance firefights almost no recoil. Liked MW2. Loved BLOPS 1 and 2. MW3 wasn't that great. IW just can't do it anymore. Big COD fan but going back to BF4. Maybe the PS4 version will be a better experience. Rent or play it at a friend's house before purchase.PROS:- New game modes are always welcome but still aren't as fun as the normal ones.- Squad modes are interesting as there's lots of do.- Extinction mode is pretty fun. IW's answer Zombies except you fight aliens.CONS:- Some multiplayer maps are bigger than usual leading to more advantage points and camping. Most maps are poorly made and not fun.- New weapons are meh- Ability to unlock ALL available weapons, perks, etc. Rather have the option to earn them ONLY by leveling up.- Seems you die more easier leading to be noob friendly over skill.- SMGs taking a back seat to the Assault rifles due to more open and large maps.- Many long fan favorite game modes (dating back to COD4 MW1) have been removed. No Search & Destroy, CTF, or Headquarters.- No more Ground War. I play this mostly due to having lots of friends. Time to time I enjoy playing 9 vs 9 that rotates TDM, Domination, and Kill & Confirmed.- Only 6 vs 6.- Takes a long time to level up and unlock things.- Engine and/graphics still look the same as previous COD games.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2013"}

But when i bought the PS2 2 years ago i bought also thps4, then thug and finally thug2, each of them a piece of art on its own. But i had that splinter in my mind from this THPS3, the game that in most of the gamesites and in most reviews of various magazines had 10 of 10 of score, but the game costed like 80 bucks because it was a collectors item, thanks God, finally the people of activision re-launched the game again in greatest hits (again, so this has to be like greatest hits of greatest hits of greatest hits) and i couldn't miss it, i bought it inmediately. Well, what can i say, the game is just PERFECT, as the score of so many magazines 10 of 10, the graphics shine and are state of the art, the music is perfect, the play control is awesome and the best of all THERE WAS NO BUGS!!, at least not during my watch, i can say that i don't know what is happening with the pc versions, but sometimes it has to do with the video card, other times with the sound cards, other times with some hardware i don't know. Well, to conclude, i can say that i am a Tony Hawk die hard fan, and this game is just perfect, it filled every spectation that i had.

I was bored and itching for a new game a few weeks back so I stumbled onto Amazon to see what could wet my appetite.  I spotted Dragon rising and decided to give it a shot.  After a few frustrating hours with the strange control scheme and underwhelming graphics, I finally saw the true potential of this game.  I opened my map to see just where I was and slowly zoomed out, out, out, out, out, out, to see all of the glorious 223 squared Kilometers!  WOW!  Suddenly the underwhelming graphics were stunning for a game of that size!  An open world shooter!  Who would have thought it could be sooo fun!My brother is a bit of a brainiac. Whenever I play xbox with him he is always like \"why is every bullet a tracer?\"  or sometimes he will mention \"you know real combat takes place over hundreds of yards.  Not a dozen feet.\"This game finally confronts those flawed shooter pillars so many games are built around.  I LOVE the fact that combat is long range.  When you fire shots downrange 300-400 meters and pull off a head shot you feel AWESOME.  Especially when using a red dot :)The soundtrack is another part of this game that I wanted to mention.  Some people won't care for it, but I personally love it.  It just embodies what this game is, and I don't know... its hard to put in words.  You'll just have to listen to it.  Sometimes I will boot up the game just to listen to the music in the main menu!Pro's-Huge open world (very unique in the genre)-Realistic combat, for example firing downrange, and only a few shots actually being tracers.-Great graphics for a game of this caliber-Full co-op campaign adds a great deal of replayability-Unique missions and lighting during each missionCons--Sometimes glitch ridden, but not very much so than other great shooters are! (besides 90% of all bugs seem to have been fixed by now)-Lackluster story (Its all sorta, Blah Blah, take out PLA.

Your morality will be tested as one can be pure or corrupt this time around, and not just the one dimensional good or evil.The game takes place so far after the events of Fable the world has shifted to a new degree. Familiar locations now built up in empires or murky ruins, Fable 2 really upped the size. Although still somewhat linear, the free roaming areas are much more expansive.Stylistically Crayola colored and cartoony not as much can be said though graphically.  The graphics are decent enough, but lack visually popping aw inspiring details. So if the graphics aren't top notch, why must we have such a poor frame rate (even in pause menus)!? Honestly I couldn't answer you that.Controls are a bit gimpy too, but one will hopefully write that off for the trip instore. Fable 2 offers a wide range of options. One can raise a family, maintain homes and do jobs to earn gold. The game also features a  faithful companion, your dog! The dog can aid you on your way to becoming a hero from finding treasure to keeping you from being the lonely hero deep down inside you think is cool.With new evil taking root, you must ensemble the three heroes. These heroes are all of distinctly different backgrounds, each holing a key trait to the demise of said evil. A golden trail will show you the way to your main goal, but the bread and butter of the game is doing what you want. going at your own pace to complete the game is more rewarding. If following only said bread and crumb trail the game may be another wasted purchase, that was short lived and possibly mediocre at best. No reason to hurry feel free to explore, as maybe one day you'll own much of all you see. The story is great, but not able to emotionally connect one all too well. I found the game really started to pick up the further I went, at first I honestly felt I had been scammed. Now owning the game and having it opened I had no choice, but to play and not waste $$$. The game is definitely worth 60$, that is if they can fix a few of the glitches. Till then maybe a used copy would be a better choice.While still playable with some of the glitches, many become frustrating. I had a pop up remain on my screen the entire time I played still I restarted it. Some glitches are reportedly said to lock the games progress, or halt much of the fun. Why ship a game in this state? I can tell you it's fun, but with so many issues one should be cautious.Multiplayer functionality is a mixed bag, as one may find out he or she is not a hero or anything worthwhile!Some might be contempt with this, others will pray for a better option possibly from a future update. The items weapon wise are large, and collecting them is fun. Clothing and hairstyles on the other hand are lackluster. Multiple endings give way to replays of the entire game, and enough settling features to keep you coming back for more.So with the failed ideals of the limited edition I bring you this the standard edition and all it's worth.  A game with a handful of options, decent graphics, and where morals are consequential.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2008"}

David Swan","summary":"Repetitious Pirating","reviewText":"I'll state it right up front; Sid Meier is a game making genius. Civ II is perhaps the greatest game of all time. So what happened? Civ III was fatally flawed and now Pirates looks like a huge misfire. I love the whole pirate concept, I love sailing around the Caribbean and visiting cities like Nassau, San Juan and Havana. The problem is that the game seems pointless and repetitive. I danced with every Governors daughter, found all my family members, collected all unique items but so what?So how is it repetitive? Regardless of the city they all look the same; Tavern, Shipbuilder, Market. Same same same. The fights are the same. The opposing captain may have a slightly different uniform, the swordfight might be on a different part of the ship but they're all essentially the same. It goes even beyond that. The villain who captures your family needs to be caught in order to extract information on each ones whereabouts. Except that when you catch him he only offers one small piece of information. So you capture him again and again and again.The game sets you on apprentice level to start with and I quickly, VERY QUICKLY, managed to upgrade my ship to the limit, purchase every single unique item and kill eight of the nine top pirates. At that point money was completely useless. I had nothing to spend it on except the occasional diamond necklace or ruby ring. I suppose I could work for a large estate but it seemed like an awful small reward.Some of the fights were an exercise in frustration. If the ship doesn't have the wind behind its sails it moves like a badly wounded hippo. If the opposing ship is positioned into the wind you may find yourself flailing about unable to move as the other ship pounds on you. The positioning of the ships seem to be set at random so it's not even like you can use this information to your advantage.There are lots of things to do in the game but it's hard to figure out why I might want to do them. I can assault a city, I can lead a new governor to a city, I can urge pirates to attack a city, I just can't figure out WHY I want to do these things. Even simulators like SIM City have a point. Build a cool city. In Pirates you can build up a fleet, collect a treasure pile and gather a pirate gang but before you know it you have to divide the loot and you lose everything you've collected except for a tiny percentage of the loot.I think the fatal flaw in this game is when you ask yourself `Why am I still playing this'. I know that a game isn't working when I keep wondering when it's going to get better. Sid Meier will always be a legend in my book but a game really should have a desirable goal.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2005"}

It just didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the series. This is the factor that kept me from giving the game five stars instead of four.  As a first person game, it plays great. But as a Metroid game, there are a few things that are missing. Being a FPP game some things just couldn't be done. There's no Screw Attack (the most hurtful absentee).  The Space Jump has been reduced to a double jump (appropriately shown by the High Jump icon).  However, in spite of these small `problems,' Prime plays very well.  Controls are easy to learn.  Response is smooth.  With a training level at the beginning, players should have no trouble picking up on it.Sound: The sound effects are also great.  It seems as much attention to detail was given to sound as it was graphics.  However, music is another matter.  It's rather muted, buried so far into the background you'll hardly notice it's there.  My personal tastes, that's where it belongs, but I know other gamers would disagree.Extra's:  The hookup between the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance adds a lot to the game.  With the Fusion Suit from the Game Boy game and the original 8-bit game both waiting to be accessed, there's plenty to keep this pack interesting for a good long time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2003"}

You still tilt and angle the board to maneuver your ball-encased monkey through courses that range from easy to wildly complex and fraught with peril.Super Monkey Ball 2provides background info on its characters with a new story mode that includes 10 monkey worlds. You will see what these persevering primates are made of when they are forced to face up to a big ape who steals their bananas. Information about the characters appears throughout the game, so you'll learn more about them as you play.Super Monkey Ball 2includes six brand-new party games, including Monkey Boat Race, Monkey Shot, Monkey Dog Fight, Monkey Tennis, Monkey Baseball, and Monkey Soccer. One to four players can team up or compete.","reviewerName":"flaviolius","summary":"Now the Monkeys are SINGING!","reviewText":"The first time you pop Super Monkey Ball 2 into your Gamecube and start up Story Mode, you may get disturbed.  Very disturbed.  See, Sega has implemented a plot this time, in which AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, and GonGon have to stop Dr. BAD-BOON and retrieve all their precious, delicious bananas.  Ummmm....OK.  Whatever you say, Sega!  The monkey-voices are cute and kinda creepy at the same time, and when they sing their Ei-Ei-Poo! song....you get the sense that there's something..well, just WRONG.But does this mean the game's a disaster?  Oh no.  Quite the opposite.  Not only is it one of the Gamecube's best games, it's one of the most well-designed, well-playing games of the last couple of years.The basic premise of the game (insane plot aside) is to roll your ball-enclosed simian through a series of often insanely difficult obstacle courses, collecting Dole bananas along the way.  The aforementioned Story Mode is split up into four themed worlds, and you're treated (in a manner of speaking) to a cut-scene that advances the bizarre plot.  You can continue as many times as you like, and tackle the ten puzzles of each world in any order - a godsend during the brutally tricky later worlds.  And yet, as you witness your monkey plunge to his death for the thousandth time, you always feel that success is there for the taking. In fact, the puzzles are so deviously designed, the solution is often much more apparent, and much simpler, than it would appear.  Frankly speaking, the level design of Super Monkey Ball 2 is the best ever seen in the puzzle genre (and some of the best in ANY genre).  The feeling when solving a difficult course is one that's becoming rarer in gaming.Luckily (so to speak), you can avoid the Story Mode altogether and take on the puzzles by themselves in Challenge Mode.  Choose from Beginner, Advanced, and Expert stages, much like the first game.  However, you'll have limited lives and continues initially, and you can select any monkey, whereas you can only use AiAi in Story Mode.As you progress in Story and Challenge Modes, you're awarded Play Points, which you can then use to unlock one of six mini-games.  There are twelve altogether, and the six original games from the first game are available right away (Race, Fight, Target, Bowling, Billiards, and Golf), but in evolved forms.  For example, you can make the lane curved in Bowling, or race against up to eight opponents in Race.  The six unlockable games are Boat, Shot, Dogfight, Baseball, Tennis, and Soccer.  These twelve games are all huge fun with friends, and make Monkey Ball 2 an attractive package when teamed up with the single-player mode (in which you can also use Play Points to buy extra lives or continues...and you'll need em).Control is the same as before, using the analog stick to tilt the floor, and the audio is practically identical, but the graphics have undergone a major upgrade.  The backgrounds of the levels are staggeringly gorgeous, ranging from waterfalls to the insides of volcanoes and a whale (really).  They're so beautifully animated that you can't help but be in awe.  It's a far cry from the relatively static levels of Monkey Ball 1, and rank among some of the best visuals on the Gamecube.  Of course, there's no slowdown or draw-in to be seen.  The animation of the monkeys is absolutely endearing and flawless.  Sega knows how to program, and this is one of their best-looking titles to date.Super Monkey Ball 2 is a fantastic game for one or for many. Credit Sega and Amusement Vision for not just releasing a rehash - the puzzles are more kinetic and involved.  Some might argue that the original game is a purer experience, but the creativity evident in the sequel's puzzle design cannot be denied.  If you liked the first, you'll love the second.  If you didn't like the first, there's enough differences here to warrant a look.  But it's still monkeys in balls, and it'll still tie your thumb(s) and brain in knots - a good thing!  Plus, if you're looking for a great party game, your search is over.  Super Monkey Ball 2 is a true throwback with its brilliant and clever game design, no-frills gameplay and high difficulty (although overall it's not quite as hard as the original game), but a true modern game with its marvelous visuals and unlockable goodies.  To date, Super Monkey Ball 2 is one of the top five console games of 2002.But beware - you may catch yourself singing EI-EI-POO!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2002"}

I recently played Silent Hill 1 for the PsOne and thought it controlled better than this game. With that aside, this game is a very fun ACTION game.. Don't expect this to be your typical Resident Evil Survival Horror, because it is not. It is much more action based with light survival horror (collecting supplies to survive) and light RPG elements (inventory management and buying/selling equipment at the vendor). I had a blast playing this game and if it wasn't for the controls would be a perfect 5/5 in my eyes. The story is alright but has really no ties to other resident evil besides the main character and the typewriter I guess. They mention raccoon city but just in passing. I paid 19.99 for this in the PSN store for PS3 and don't regret it at all, I just wouldn't go into the game expecting such a great experience like Resident Evil 1,2, and 3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2012"}

The starter bundle comes with one, but be prepared to keep buying more.You *must* have a PS3 Move camera in order to use this wand. So make sure you get that camera first, either alone or with the starter bundle. Once you get that camera, though, you'll want to stock up on your controllers. If you have a two person sword fight, each person needs a sword! Many games want you to have TWO controllers for a single person, one for each hand. So for a two person battle that would be four separate controllers, two for each person.The controller fits nicely in your hand and the globe on top lights up with different colors, which is a neat touch. The buttons on the wand are easy to get to and help you activate different functions in your game. There's a wrist strap to keep the controller from flying of your hand and smashing into important things like your TV set.I am thrilled that the controllers recharge. Just plug them into your PS3's USB port via the normal cable you use to recharge your other controllers. I'd highly recommend getting a recharging station, though, so you can recharge multiple of them at once easily. When you recharge the unit a red light blinks so that you know it's doing something.As you might imagine, you need to get games that are designed for the Move system in order to use the Move controllers. You can't just pop in a game from 2008 that involves swords and expect the game to understand your Move controller's swinging around. Make sure the game you are interested in says on it that it is built to handle input from the Move controller system.Well recommended! It's great fun to get into a sword fight where you actively swing your arm around to do your hits, striking high, swinging low, and watching your on screen character mimic your moves.

Contoured perfectly to fit a player's hand,The Wii Nunchuk (left) connects directly to the Wii remote.View larger.the Nunchuk controller builds on the simplicity of the Wii Remote controller. The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance. Just be careful not to knock out your significant other, or bruise the dog, severely, while using one, or two Nunchuk controllers.","reviewerName":"D.

{"product_name":"B001NX6GBK","reviewerName":"SnS \"&#34;Those are my principles and if you ...","summary":"A Visually Stunning Scratch for the God of War Itch","reviewText":"There is one thing that you'll notice from the very first scene: this game is a visual masterpiece.  Sure it's a mythological hack-n-slash, but surprisingly for me, the gameplay took a backseat to the artwork.If you have read or are familiar with the bookThe Divine Comedy: Inferno; Purgatorio; Paradiso, You'll know Inferno is about the author's decent through Hell.  When I read it, the book sent a tremendous array of mental imagery that scared and amazed me at the same time.  At the time I was thinking, \"This would make an excellent setting for a video game.\"  Well, EA and company delivered on that plane.  While the game is by no means a faithful recreation of the book, it delivers an experience that can only really be summarized as a kindred spirit to the book.  Each world has such depth and creativity with amazingly unique creatures from circle to circle.  Scantily clad demons populate Lust, while ever hungry worms populate Gluttony.  The realms are beautifully repulsive.  Yes, I used that and I will again........beautifully repulsive.  But enough about the visuals.......they're great.  Moving on.The gameplay itself is in typical hack-n-slash formula.  Wielding Death's scythe, you can unleash some very fluid combos and tacking on some magic makes the battles erupt.  However, don't expect alot of it more than hitting square and triangle alot.  To break this up, puzzles are thrown in from time to time to flex your mind as well as choosing to absolve or punish the denizens of Hell's circles.  That's right, mid-combat, if you are feeling lucky and generous, you can choose to absolve the creatures you are fighting; as well as choosing the fates of some historical and mythological characters from history.  Case in point, early in the game you approach Pontius Pilate.  Do you forgive him?  Do you punish him?  Your call.  And making that call factors in to which side you receive \"exp. points\" for.  Which brings me to the skill tree.  You have the Holy and Unholy sides.  Holy focuses mostly on magic, Unholy on melee.  The souls you collect are redeemed to beef Dante up.  Pretty standard if you have playedX-Men Origins: Wolverine Uncaged EditionorStar Wars: The Force Unleashedor any other button mashing games in the last few years.The sound of the game is amazingly brutal.  You hear the screams of the tormented, the wails and pleas of the damned.  Hell(no pun intended), it makes you FEEL the despair and anguish.  It could quite possibly, in much the same way the book did, scare the Hell out of you(okay....that one WAS intended).However, the real \"God of War Moments\" are the bosses.  There is so much wow factor to them that it makes Wolverine's boss fights seem like reruns of Andy Griffith.  Expect alot of button prompts and figuring out plans of attack.  These are the fights where simply pressing square or triangle will not yield the best results.  I would love to go in to a lot more detail, but frankly take my word that they are amazing fights and don't make me ruin it for you.Ultimately there isn't really alot to this game that has not been seen before.  Yet somehow, it SEEMS fresh.  More importantly, it is still fun.  I doubt there will be a changing of the guard on the realm of Hack-n-Slash champions, but this game is certainly up there and should be taken very seriously.  With God of War III supposedly being the end of the franchise, Dante's Inferno may shape up to be the next in line.  With graphics, gameplay, and sound that dares you to turn away........a Dante's Inferno franchise could be golden.  Seriously, pick this up.  If you can't afford it.....rent it.  This is a game that NEEDS to be played.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2010"}

{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"stevie","summary":"A fun experience, but one that leaves you feeling hollow.","reviewText":"Spoiler FreeIf I am going to be honest with myself, I can't help but feel disappointed with this game. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but something is off here. Its probably the story and and the feeling of that you have been there before. At one point in the game, you find yourself alone battling pirates in a shipyard and you have to escape (I tried to keep this as spoiler free as possible, dont worry, you dont know how you get there until you play). The game is at its best here and I really felt that excitement. That little spark of magic you felt playing uncharted for the first time. Its just you and drake against all the odds. You have your full disposal of weapons and moves. Dodging bullets and baddies while jumping in between broken down boats and docks, sometimes diving under water to avoid fire (a new feature). It's these sections that really made the combat fun in the last game; those levels where you could climb up something to get the high ground or go around. A linear path but open ended in how you want to fight. I don't know how many there are of these compared to the last game, but it didn't feel as much, although the game definitely has more towards the end.The game itself has other epic moments as well, but the story seems to hold back their awesomeness or they are extended repeats from the last game. Unfortunately, there is not a whole lot new in this game except for the chataeu level and the shipyard. The other \"set pieces\" are extended retreads from Uncharted 2. The series has become too formulaic. The plane level was particularly jarring in that it served as the perfect synopsis for all that is wrong with this game. During the trailer, you may recall the section where drake is fighting the 'brute' type guy. I remember how cool that was. It was a bad guy we had not seen yet in Uncharted. The problem is that by the time you get to this part in the real game, you have already fought 5 or 6 of these. The novelty has worn off. Its not cool anymore. And what is worse is that many of the brutes are exact copies of each other. Exact copies. Same clothes and same face. Later on, in the caravan level, you see the same exact big brute you knocked off the plane earlier. Of course, you know its not the same guy unless the sand broke his fall......but it is distracting when they don't even try to change the look. This same thing happens with the spiders. You encounter them in France and then again in Yemen. Again, once you get to yemen, your ready for something else, but the game recycles the same moment. All of this adds up to an unpleasant feeling of been there and done that. The gameplay is almost similar to U2. I am one of the few that liked the new melee, but the shooting has taken a step back. It is more rigid in aiming and not forgiving at all. Even the story is similar despite being different. You gotta find a secret city before they find it. Just insert new faces in the last one and its basically the same plot, except less interesting and no twists. And like the plane level, the game is over fast while recycling previous moments. In fact, the plane sequence was so short it didn't even feel like a set piece.Until now, my only complaint with the Uncharted series has been its lack of a background story for almost all the characters. They said we would get more of this in the last game, but we really didn't. All we got were a couple characters from Drakes past. Ok, but who is drake really? Where did he come from and why does he choose this life?? Despite the past two games lacking in this area, I considered those games to be top tier and they were easily contained many of my favorites gaming memories. Nonetheless, U3 finally gives us some information about drake and sully and how they met. Unfortunately, it leads to nothing and raises more questions than it answers. What are elena and drake up to? Are they together? Well, I won't say anything, but at the end I still felt like I didn't know. What about Chloe? Forget about it. She disappears half way through the game and is never mentioned again along with another new character. Don't worry, she probably lives. We all love these characters and its a shame we don't get to learn more about them. For some reason, I want to know more about their lives even though they are fake. This is what a good series does and why people get attached to tv shows. I dont' want a soap opera, but some character development would be nice. I'm beginning to think the writers themselves are unsure where to take these characters, since they do not grow at all during the game. There is no direction other than some personal life lessons were learned. The ending especially blows. I feel like I know even less than before I started the game. As a result, the game does not make you feel satisfied like the ending to the last one did. Sure I wanted to know more after U2, but at least we knew everyone's roles. Chloe and Drake moved on. Elena and Drake officially become a love interest. And Sully was Sully. The third game does almost nothing with the status of the characters and new allies are not explained.Unfortunately, most of these mysteries go unanswered or are explained expediently near the end. Earlier oddities I guess are assumed to fit under a one size fits all explanation. Once you get there you will know what I am talking about. As a result, you can only guess about the rest of the plot holes. Once the credits start rolling, I couldn't help but feel duped. The game leads you on to believe there will be some major twists, but there are really none to speak of. In fact, I found myself wanting Sully to die or someone just so it could feel different in any way as messed up as that sounds. But the story plays out differently than the one in your head after seeing the trailers. But ultimately it boils down to the \"we gotta stop them from ruining the day\" model. In the last game, the story was full of action movie cliches. It got away with it because it was the first time they were done well in a video game so no one cared. It starts to feel old in this one. Too many last second escapes, villains showing up whenever you find something and taking it, and rushed explanations.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2011"}

SC2 has delivered on all fronts and is a successful instalment to its predecessor.SC2 brings in some new games which have utilised the Move controller functionality greatly such as boxing, bowling and golf and then there is skiing and tennis that lag a little (out of sync) and may require some additional work which I suspect the producer would update via a game patch. There is also the return of the archery game from the first SC with some additional contents and modes of play that are sure to keep the avid gamer hooked.The SC package has shown that it can deliver on utilising the full potential of the Move controller even though there is more to be done to fully utilise the technology in other areas.

This is a perfect port of the original Super Mario Bros. Every last mushroom and goomba is accounted for, and you'll feel yourself slipping into a blissful recollection of your early days as a gamer. Just don't expect anything revolutionary here. The closest thing to newness is the ability to link up with another GBA to play with a friend, but don't worry.

{"product_name":"B0050SYZS0","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Fulkerson","summary":"A brilliant yet flawed experience","reviewText":"I have played through Mass Effect 3 twice already, and I still don't know exactly how I feel about it.  The fact I've powered through it twice, enjoyed the story, appreciated the characters, and experienced the ending tells me that I must love it on some level.  However, each time the end credits have rolled I have felt somewhat disappointed.  As powerful an experience as Mass Effect 3 is, something is missing.  Bioware set the bar so amazingly high with the first two installments of this franchise that I suppose I may be unfairly judging amidst the shadow of those other games.  However, the third game in any series should effectively wow the player, and take the story and gameplay to heights that outdo most aspects of the preceding installments.  That just doesn't happen here.  With Mass Effect 3 we are treated to the same old same old, and while that is certainly acceptable with such a brilliant game series, it doesn't really suffice within the framework of playing one of the best RPG's of all time.  Also, Bioware and EA have, once again,  gouged the customer in ways that I will illustrate later.What I enjoyed most about Mass Effect 3 was the writing between all the characters.  The writing with all three games has been top notch across the board, but the humor really makes most dialog options a treat to peruse.  The flow of conversation takes place effortlessly, and no matter what dialog choices you make it will always be the next natural step to whatever you may be talking about with your character.  This type of natural writing really pulls the player in and ensconces the individual into the world of the game.  It's hard to not be enthralled with the story once you start discussions and get actively involved, even more so than with Mass Effect 1 and 2.Another improvement with this third installment is the graphics.  Facial expressions are more animated and ambient back drops are stunning and painstakingly detailed.  In the beginning of the game when Shepard is dropped off at a space station amidst a huge sand storm, the graphical quality for a console is second to none.  Again, these sorts of qualities really pull the player in.Mass Effect 3 introduces the option of choosing what type of narrative you'd like to have.  You can choose to have a more story focused setting with less fighting, the traditional mix of story and fighting, or the option to have tougher battles and less choices to make during conversation.  I chose the classic mix of fighting and storyline as I wanted to maintain whatever balance I had throughout the first two games, but it's cool to have the option nonetheless.Despite these slightly new improvements to the game, there are some glaring missteps that are both new and carried over from the second game.  The first huge annoyance that gets carried over from the second game is planet scanning.  Why would Bioware bring this back when the players were so vocal about not liking it in the second game?  It's only slightly less tedious than it was before, but it annoys in new ways.  Instead of scanning each planet for minerals or anomalies you scan for possible war alliances in your fight against the reapers.  While you do this the reapers will detect your presence and then chase you until you either get caught or have to leave the system.  Either way, you end up having to go back to the system and scan again, get caught, leave, evade, and repeat the process all over again.  Why this boring and yawn-inducing part of the game would get re-introduced is beyond me, and it really detracted from the gameplay.The other head scratching addition that gets carried over from the second game is the cover/run/roll system.  The same button is used to do all of these actions, and during a battle it can get really annoying.  There were more than a few times where I'd be sprinting away from an enemy and my general proximity to a block or ledge would make the game think I was ducking for cover.  Instead of running away, I would commando roll into a cover position when the enemy was bearing down on me in the open.  I know this is a tricky thing to pull off since all of the controllers buttons are in constant use with this game, but that means Bioware should have just done away with either running or ducking.  At any rate, the ducking and running can seem more like a hindrance to battle than a genuine plus.Something that may seem trivial to many but was a serious disappointment to me was the fact I couldn't transfer my character customizations from the previous two games.  Why would it be no problem to transfer from the first to the second, but not the second to the third?  When I was personalizing the look of my Shepard it didn't even have the same hairdo I had from the first two games!  Is it really that difficult to have all the same presets?  It was flabbergasting that I couldn't get my character to look the same as it did before.  The customizations were never that great to begin with, but to not even have the same hair cuts confounds reason.What really disappoints me most about Mass Effect 3 is the inconsistency with its writing.  At one point the writing will be incredibly deep and meaningful, the next, ponderous and trite.  As the game progresses you will feel a tendency from the writers to wrap everything up as quickly as possible and not give the characters their just evolution.  There is a gradual build in personality with all the characters, but most of this progression just topples off a ledge as the writers frantically attempt to tie up loose ends and make sense of everything that has happened thus far.The romances are just glossed over as well.  Where they were passionate and thoughtful in the first two games, they feel like they are crowbarred into the story only because the player now expects it.  Love is looked at in a trivial light in ME3 and this surface level interaction doesn't coincide well with the rest of the story.Quite simply, it all feels rushed.  The first two games did such a masterful job of letting the characters blossom into what they are, and Mass Effect 3 seems intent to just squash that evolution with brief exits.  I'm sure this can be seen as an emotional overreaction on my part, but I really don't feel like it is.  There is a tangible flow and narrative to this series, and it all stops throughout this game.Which brings me to the end.  I know there has been a lot of discussion over the ending, and to be honest, I didn't have a huge issue with it other than it was somewhat predictable.  I won't spoil anything for anyone, but this series ultimately ended the only way it could have.  What stands as such an injustice is the horrible and sloppy writing in the last 15 minutes.  I can accept what is going on in the last 15 minutes of the game.  If you pay close attention to the game from beginning to end and make note of ALL characters and their involvement with the narrative I think the ending wouldn't be such a disappointment.  This game has always been open with its ideas on the universe and free choice, and the ending reflects that with its actions.  What makes the ending so bad is its choice of character and its preachy nature.  This entire series was based upon the player using their brain to make huge decisions, and having free will to use it over not only themselves, but to inspire all of those around them.  There is no freedom of choice at the end, and I feel like this is Bioware flexing their muscles and trying to show us humans that no matter what we do during our short lives, it matters not in the end.  This is a bold choice, and I actually respect them for taking such a stance, but when it comes at the expense of narrative and flow, it just plain doesn't work.  This ending is a bad decision, not because I can't handle it, but because it is poor writing.  It isn't often that endings such as this could be seen as a cop out, but it most certainly is.  It's creative cop out.  It's Bioware saying, \"we hold the cards here, and we say you're done for no other reason than to just make it official.  Does it matter how this story ends?  Because your choices mean nothing, and here is an annoying little character with seemingly no life experience to tell you so\".  Doesn't work, guys.  Bioware attempted to come at the audience with a 2001: A Space Odyssey-type ending where we're supposed to get wrangled in by crazy visuals and profound statements, but what really happens is we get a fourth grade type lecture from some writers trying to wrap everything up in a nice little package.  It really is kind of insulting.  Mind you, 2001: A Space Odyssey is my all time favorite movie, and I still ponder the ending.  I'm all about ponderous endings.  Just don't pander to me and talk to me like I'm stupid.  That's exactly what ME3 does at the end.  Gamers don't need explanations.  Gamers don't require endings that make sense.  We simply want to be transported while making up our own minds.  ME3 forgoes that idea by trying to preach to us instead.  Mass Effect 3's ending shouldn't have said a word.  We would have been totally fine with letting Shepard disappear into the ether without a single utterance.  Less is more;  a cliche, but a cliche Bioware clearly has never heard.As a side note, I'd like to address the Collector's Edition.  Don't bother buying it, especially at the current inflated prices.  This whole \"From Ashes\" fiasco really soured me toward Bioware, and I will forever look at this developer askance.  The only reason I dropped the extra 20 bucks for this Collector's Edition is because I felt like I was getting exclusive in-game content.  I really couldn't care less for all the physical ephemera you get here, like the comic and the patch and all the other junk.  When they announced right out of the gate that the DLC would be available to everyone, I was irritated.  Not because it was available day one, but because I had pre-ordered it months before to make sure I got the DLC, only to watch Bioware make it available to everyone.  Bioware screwed up on so many levels with the DLC, and this will forever be etched in the minds of gamers.  I already avoid many products from EA because of their outright customer gouging, and now I have to do the same thing with Bioware.  The longer gamers get treated as guinea pigs, the more they will resist.As you see, playing Mass Effect 3 is much more complicated than just playing the game.  When you involve ethics, endings, and writing you come up with quite an issue.  The Mass Effect series is one of the most enjoyable gaming franchise I've ever had the pleasure of playing.  Apart form the Elder Scrolls series, I can't think of a franchise I'd rather replay and enjoy.  I feel that many of the one star reviews are people not looking at this situation realistically.  You can't put 40 hours into a game, love every minute of it up to the final 15 minutes, then give it a one star review.  There are many aspects of this game that all players love, and that should be reflected.  Sadly, Bioware put the entire franchise into a hole with the way they chose to write and market their product.  They rushed the results, and tried to monetize content that should have been included with the original game.  Sometimes the way you play a game is more important than the actual gameplay itself, and Mass Effect 3 will forever be remembered as the experiment that went wrong.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2012"}

I thought I'd miss having towns to visit, bu I don't. I thought I'd miss a lot of tings this game got rid of from early games, but I don't. They took out all the crap that slowed earlier games down and added better tings to make the game run smoother. The game starts out easy and is basically a button-masher util the 3 or 4 hour point, butthen the Paradign Shifts come into play along with other abilities and techniques and i gets a lot tougher and use must use strategy o win even simple battles. I love the characters and the English voice acting is great. The storyline is sappy in spots, but in all actuality it's a lot \"darker\" than most FF games. The only thing I have a complaint about is the lack of Gil (money). You never win it in battle and must find it. I like the linearity of it, th developers mentioned the linearity of the game before it was released and they said they did that on purpose so people wouldn't wander around so long they forget the storyline. That said, I heard once you reach Cocoon it gets a lot more non-linear. I'm like 12 hours in and not a seconf of it has been boring.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2010"}

Somewhere I read a review of this game called Fatal Frame 2 and it looked interesting and everybody was saying it was one of the scariest games they've played. So on a whim I rented it and didn't even finish the game and found it quite disappointing.Story: Mio and Mayu are 2 japanese twins who are playing in the woods one day. One of them hurt her leg previously so they other one feels sorry about it. One of the twins starts to follow these red butterflies into the woods so the other starts following her. Only they end up in an abandoned village that holds more than what it shows.Graphics: Pretty dark but sets the atmosphere perfectly. With Resident Evil 4 it was pretty dim and dark with casual lighting or full blown lighting from lamps and fire but here there's not a lot with the only light coming from your flashlight. The ghosts look downright eerie and very disturbing looking, especially some of the later ones.Sound/Music: Since it's a survival horror game, much emphasis is on an organic and atmosphere based soundtrack rather than full on orchestral music. It's certainly creepy too as you pass by a room and start to hear moaning(not the sexual kind, that 3am grandfather woke up kind) or even voices. The english voice actors are ok but it's in english so it's always gonna sound slightly hammy.Gameplay: This is where I feel the game falls flat. Your only defense against these spectres of the night? A camera. Not just a camera, the Camera Obscura. Which reveals hidden things and secrets and damages ghosts. Look through the viewfinder and take a picture of the ghost. Hold it long enough and the damage will be more greater than if you fire off shots.  It gets tedious since the whole game essentially boils down to look, search, aah ghost, click click click, ghost dead repeat.If this was a movie I would've loved to see this story unfold but to actually play the game to get to that point just gets old.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time.

Yet by hunting together with friends, or braving it solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support.Multiple Controller SupportMonster Hunter Trifeatures a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes.

I tried a little bit of everything and thus far my opinion of Monster Hunter Tri is extremely positive with only a few minor issues.GRAPHICS: Wow.  The first thought that shot through my mind was \"this is beautiful!\"  Graphically the game feels a bit low-res on my 42\" TV, but the art style and quality pretty much make up for that in spades.  The environments are lush with details and beautiful colors.  The details on weapons, armor, monster and dinosaur models are excellent and have definitely whetted my appetite for more.  Human NPCs are kind of weird and awkward looking, but you'll quickly forget how bad they look when you see the monsters in action.  The monsters are beautiful, varied, and a joy a to look at and watch.  The animations on the many of the enemies are stunning, fluid, and you can't help but appreciate the effort put forth to bring these creatures to life.GAMEPLAY: Both online and offline the game consists of hack-n-slash missions to go hunt gigantic monsters.  There are some fetch quest missions as well, but most of the time the missions are very similar to what you would find in a game like World of Warcraft or other similar online offerings.  The game has an exceptionally heavy emphasis on combat with minimal story getting in the way of the action.  Combat can be either fast-paced or slow and deliberate depending on your personal style and choice of weapon.  The combo system is limited but effective and each of the 7 weapon types has its own distinct style, advantages, and disadvantages.  It may sound repetitive, but the driving force of the game is seeing what the next hunt will behold.  Some of the boss battles, even early on, are simply breathtakingly awesome.  When you kill a boss, even at the lower levels of the game, you will feel a sense of accomplishment.Throughout the game you will level up your equipment, which is very important because your character actually doesn't level up.  While your skill in combat is very important in this game, you won't get anywhere if you don't make sure you get the best armor and weapons available.  Loot is king, and you will spend a lot of time hunting for the right components to craft the next big awesome weapon or armor upgrade.  As you upgrade your weapons and armor you will see an amazing amount of customization in your character appearance, but more importantly you'll also see an amazing difference in your combat performance.  When it comes down to it, this game is hard.  Casual gamers will likely be turned off by the difficulty and depth of this game, but those looking for a deep and engaging action RPG experience need look no further.DESIGN: Level designs are varied and gorgeous.  I have only seen a handful of the sections of the game and can confidently say that the levls and maps are awesome.  Environments are varied and in many cases the environments play a key role in your hunting strategy, influencing the weapons and equipment you choose to bring with you as well as your basic battlefield strategies.  My only real complaint is that you will see a lot of load screens as you pass between zones.  Luckily, these load screens are blessedly short (2 to 5 seconds usually) and don't ruin the gameplay experience, but the issue really does interfere with the immersion factor.CONTROLS (when using Classic Controller): Controls are solid, as long as you use the classic controller.  While more complicated than many games, the controls are responsive and the button layout is pretty good for the most part.  Once you get past the slightly steep learning curve, the controls will become second nature.  The swimming controls were actually better than I expected.  My only major complaint about the controls I find it is too easy to accidentally use a potion or healing item because the same exact button is used to sheath your weapon.  I drink a lot of potions on accident because of this issue, but on the plus side my characters are usually pretty healthy!CONTROLS (when using a Wii Remote and Nunchuck): Oh. My. God.  Who thought these controls were a good idea?  Seriously, I don't think I have played a Wii game with more complicated and unusable controls than this.  Different actions depend on whether or not the controller is twisted left or right, but you are still swinging the remote around, and button mappings are inconvenient and change depending on the context of your situation.  It's a mess.  My advice to anyone wanting to play this game, buy a Classic Controller.SINGLE-PLAYER MODE: Single player mode is very solid, but very challenging.  A storyline is present, but most people will probably find it forgettable.  Really, it comes down to finding loot, hunting awesome monsters, and making cool weapons out the body parts of those monsters.SPLIT-SCREEN ARENA MODE: This is pretty decent and my roommate and I dove into this for a little while.  We found it enjoyable but the experience is fairly limited, consisting only of boss battles within a single arena with a pre-set selection of equipment.  You can gain some pretty nice rewards within arena mode and it's a decent way of introducing a friend to the game.  Compared to online multi-player or the single-player modes, split-screen doesn't hold a candle.ONLINE EXPERIENCE: Getting into the online experience takes some getting used to, but this is truly the best part of the game.  I would favorably compare this to Phantasy Star Online, except this is so much better on nearly every level.  I do question the wisdom of the \"Server -> City Gate -> City -> Quest\" structure, which takes a bit of getting used to, but it does work.  Without coordination and communication between other players, it is a little too easy for a newbie player to accidentally start questing alone when the real intent was to joining together for a quest.  Once you learn how to navigate the online world, finding a group of people to play with is fairly easy.  The game supports Wii Speak for online chat, but most players don't seem to have that peripheral at the time of this writing.  I didn't experience any lag at all while playing, and once I intentionally joined a server that had the highest number of users just to see how well it performed.  I was pleasantly surprised.The player community seemed nice enough and of the small handful of people I've played with most were either helpful, polite, or silent.  Chatting with your group will be important, but virtual keyboard in the game is a bit clumsy, as is the case with every virtual keyboard I have ever used.  I plugged a spare Apple USB keyboard into my Wii and found that it worked perfectly and made communication much better.  If you don't have Wii Speak, at the very least find a spare USB keyboard and plug it in, preferably one that uses a wireless dongle.  So far I've only met one rude person with a higher level character that talked trash on me for being new to the game, but muting those people is simple.  That elitist, high-and-mighty, God's gift to gaming has been permanently added to my banned players list and I'll never hear from him ever again.  Problem solved.  The internet can definitely do without people like that.  Overall I would say that my online experience, while slow to get rolling, has been largely positive.  I expect to probably spend well over 100 hours playing online with this game, possibly more.PROS:+++ Gorgeous graphics+++ A hard-core loot-based action-RPG experience that quickly offers difficult challenges.  Not for the faint of heart.  This game will challenge you.+++ Online 4-player cooperative monster hunting gives you the chance to share some truly awesome battles with others.+++ Voice chat.  Online play allows the use of the Wii Speak peripheral to allow players to communicate between eachother.+++ Keyboard support.  Plugging a standard USB keyboard into the Wii will allow you to chat easier with other players.+++ Lagless online play.  I was completely shocked by the lack of lag when I played online.  I may just be lucky though.+++ Online play does not require Friend Codes in order to communicate with other players.+++ Initial character creation and customization is fairly deep, allowing a wide range of physical characteristics.+++ Amazing enemy models and animation, full of detail and amazingly fluid.+++ Arena Mode, a limited but decent split-screen multi-player boss challenge experience is included.CONS:--- Steep learning curve that may scare away more casual gamers.--- Repetive mission designs, much in the same vein as World of Warcraft, Phantasy Star Online, etc.  Go here, kill that, collect this, complete mission, get next mission.--- The controls when using the Wii Remote and Nunchuck are so awkward and complicated that they are almost worthless.  In my opinion, this game is really only playable if you use a Classic Controller or Classic Controller Pro.--- Frequent screen load times, but thankfully the load times I experience are usually less than 4 seconds.--- Although voice chat is supported it is hard to find players with voice chat enabled.--- NPC animations and character models are fairly stiff and awkward--- NPC dialogue is pretty bad.  At its best it is humorously awkward and annoying at its worst.--- Online play is a little confusing at first because of the \"Server -> City Gate-> City-> Quest\" structure.Releasing a deep, engaging, and time consuming game like this right at the beginning of summer is just cruel.  I know I'll be torn between playing this game and hitting the great outdoors.  I have a few (mostly minor) complaints about the game, but most of them truly are nothing more than minor annoyances and blemishes on an otherwise amazing game.  Graphically and artistically this game is amazing and the gameplay is hard and challenging but amazingly rewarding at the same time.  Taking down boss monsters, either alone or in a group, always gives a sense of achievement and leaves me craving the next hunt.  When it comes down to it, this is a good solo experience packaged in with a great online experience.  Fans of Phantasy Star Online, Diablo, or Borderlands should definitely check this game out since this game shares much of the same emphasis on finding loot to customize your character with.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2010"}

I have about 30+ hours logged into the game and really I'm just scratching the surface still on this monster.Monster Hunter Tri offers a lot of qualities in mmo likeness. You play as a randomly created character that you can fully customize right down to the voice. The basic plot of the game is that your a hunter and you want to be the best hunter there is. You test your strength by starting out with weak monsters and then working your way up the ladder to the strong ones. You do this by completing quest which allow you to earn points to progress in your rank.As you slay monsters you will also be rewarded with materials from these monsters that you can take to an armorer to craft new and stronger armor and weapons for you. There's lots of armor sets in the game(I'm not that high so there's only but maybe 10 or so available to me right now)and as you become stronger more will be made available to you.So that's pretty much it. Take quest...kill monsters... make weapons. That is pretty much the synopsis of the game. So what makes it so popular? It's what you have to do to kill those monsters. That is where the challenging part comes in. Each monster is unique and has it's own behaviors and characteristics that you need to learn in order to defeat them. You also need to figure out what equipment you will need to bring to take down this monster(once you start won't be able to restock items once durring quest).All of these things I really like about monster hunter. It's fun, it's challenging, and it looks great. Matter of fact you will hear lots of people speaking about how great the game looks. Honestly what they mean is that it looks great for a \"Wii\" title. If you ask me the game looks about average by today's standards. Yes the environments are nicely detailed and everything is pretty to look at... but that's how 99.9% of games should look like with today's modern technology. When the PS3 was first released I brought a game called HeavenlySword and that games graphics blew me away. Having downgraded to a Wii and knowing just what else is out there... Wii graphics are about a few steps above PS2 and that's just me being honest. So does the game look great? Yes! Is it mind blowing? No!.Now getting back to the game itself...there are a lot of things I enjoy about the game but why I rate the game at only 3 stars is because one of the biggest flaws of the game and to me it's something that a true 5 star game should have...GREAT CONTROLS!Monster Hunter Tri has some of the absolute worse controls I have ever played...and yes that includes Sewer Shark and about 80% of the Sega CD games I owned back in the 90's. Monster Hunter Tri's controls are so bad they had to market a new controller with the game just to try and attempt to make it more playable. So let me explain exactly why I took 2 stars off for the controls.To me there's 2 aspects of Monster Hunter Tri's controls. You have the equipment interface...and then you have your battle interface. The equipment interface's main problem is that it offers too many menu's and functions. Checking your bags and your equipment almost feels like your working on a excel spreadsheet. There's so much going on. It's just too complex because there is too much going on. The Final Fantasy 8 junction system was much more simpler than this and people complained about that as being over complicated. There are just too many options to select and too much that you have to go through just to empty your bags (provided you pick the right one),combine a few items, and equip them properly. I mean it's hit Y for this Z for that A for this B for that L1 for this and R1 to do this and so on. It's a lot more complex than an equipment and info window should ever be. I've seen it done better in other games that don't get as much press has MH3.Another annoying thing that adds insult to injury is that sometimes you well need to grab your classic controller and pick up your wiimote while hitting all these buttons in sequence and then fling your wii more around to try and register a monster then hit some other buttons to clear your screen all while in the middle of combat! When at that point your probably being attacked by monsters because you had to jump through all those hoops just to add it to your register book. This isn't a required part of the game but still it is a part of the game and you think the developers at capcom would have figured out a simpler way to execute their idea especially in a game when your attacking or being attacked by something of some sort 95% of the time.But!... all that aside those menu's and features aren't even my true complaint. There's one thing that makes the game fall so short on being all that it could have been. It's the fighting controls and the sheer programming of the game that makes it lose those stars. The only way that I can explain it is that when your in combat with your character it feels like your experiencing a heavy level of lag. All your reactions and movements are very slow considering how aggressive the pace of battle is. Your character pauses after every move and does an animation after every action that can put you in very dangerous spots. Some times you can be halfway across the screen healing or loading your gun and the animation for you healing or loading takes so long and with the added pause it will give a \"monster\" more than enough time to rush in and attack you. I should say that the monsters/bosses in this game move fluently however your character almost moves like it's turn-based. You can press the B button to evade an attack but your character will not instantly evade. They will pause like a dear in headlights and then roll out the way. You better hope that you leave enough distance for this animation delay to ensure that you do not get hit instead.For attacks it's even worse. There are several attack moves that you can use. This is a nice part about the game because each weapon has its own characteristics and fighting style BUT... hit or I should say launch an attack you cannot stop your swing until the animation is done. That means that if you strike at an monster and miss (will happens A LOT since they are faster than you)...you are open to attacks until your attack animation stops. Like I said the game feels like Semi turn-based almost like how Final Fantasy 12 was but except you don't have to select a move from a list you just hit a button to launch it.For me the controls really hold back the game from the \"real-time\" fighting experience that it could have offered. The game has potential but its very clear to see that the developers needed to spend more time working on the combat/control scheme for the game.  The way your character behaves almost makes it feel as though they were designed to be in a completely different game but were adapted to MH3 \"hit attack > pause > animation for attack > pause again\" and you do this until the monster dies or you die.5 Stars for the idea of the game -2 stars for the painfully enduring controlsOverall 3/5  rent it to try it if you like it buy it otherwise you might end up with something that is not your cup of tea.Oh, and there's online too. Not much to talk about it's the same idea as the main game just with 3 other people and group related quest and events. That experience is either great or depressing depending on if you get a friendly group of people or if you get a group of jerks and morons. Level doesn't really matter you can be rank 1 or 100 online play is all about people your grouped with.In response to many people who feel compelled to jump to the comments after reading my touching review of your beloved game...It's interesting see how many people have so much time on their hands to defend a game that came out almost a year ago from a \"3star\" review. Nothing new has been added to this game since its release. It's old, it's bland, and it's boring. So they add some \"special\" events for monsters you already killed 100 times before who cares! Move on with your life other games have come out go explore those. This game got old after the first month. It's a boring, tedious, redundant game that doesn't offer much. It only has a limited 5 maps or so. The Jungle,The Ice Terrain, The rain Forrest, The Volcano, The Plains. How much of a life can you not have to run around the same place killing the same monsters over and over again. The same armor gets recycled over and over again, and the weapons aren't so interesting either. This isn't an MMO that changes and gets updates it's just another game with an online play feature, and since it's a wii game it's stagnant meaning that there are no content downloads for it.My final bottom line.The Controls Suck, The Games Repetitive, It's Too limited, and Online is PITA because you have to play with the same morons you see commenting in this review. ENOUGH SAID!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2010"}

Rhodes","summary":"Among the Most Delightfully Creative Kirby Adventures","reviewText":"The Good:+Great graphics, art design and delightful animations+Some really creative levels+A lot of variety in powers+A lot of content, including two mini-games at the start and a lengthy campaign+Good use of the 3DS technology without making it all feel tacked onThe Bad:-It's incredibly easy-You're not likely to spend a lot of time with the mini-games---Kirby has always been one of Nintendo's more popular characters.  He's never grown to the popularity of Mario or Zelda, but he has always had a few delightful adventures.  It feels like a long time since we last got a really good handheld Kirby Adventure.  And Triple Deluxe may, in fact, be among the best the series has ever seen.  Each level is creative, artistic and fun.  There is plenty to do and a lot to explore in what may be one of Kirby's finest handheld adventures.Triple Deluxe focuses on a beanstalk (referred to as a Dreamstalk) that grows and carries Kirby's house high off the ground.  It also carries other parts of Dreamworld, including King Dedede's castle.  A mysterious menace known as Taranza comes into the frey and easily dispatches Dedede's henchmen before kidnapping Dedede himself.  It's up to Kirby to save Dedede and stop Taranza.  As with Mario, Kirby hasn't exactly been about story.  It's often been about the gameplay, level design and exploration.  Kirby Triple Deluxe does that well.  It's a pretty simple game in its own right but it's how so much of it blends together rather well that makes everything about it really stick out.  There are various floating islands to go to.  You'll start in world 1-1 which is more or less just a basic level.  Unlike a lot of games (even side scrollers) Kirby doesn't waste a lot of time with a tutorial.  You'll see signs that show you the basic controls, but they don't interrupt the flow of the game through the level.Everything in Kirby is going to feel familiar to anyone who has played some of his previous outings.  Kirby has the ability to suck in air and spit it out, as well as hover over his enemies.  As before, Kirby can also suck up certain enemies and utilize their powers.  There are tons of different enemies in the game, which make for a lot of different powers for Kirby to use.  It's fun to mix and match and experiment.  The game never abandons you, however.  Always making sure the right enemy with the right power is close by for an upcoming mini-boss or for a difficult task at hand.  Likewise, quite a few of your enemies respawn quickly should you lose your power up or lose a life.  There are tons of abilities to copy throughout your adventure.  Some of the best, however, come when you take in the mini-bosses.  You'll be able to use whips, shoot arrows or slash with a sword in no time.The best new addition to Triple Deluxe, however, is the Hypernova.  Sometimes you'll find a special berry that lets Kirby use this fantastic technique.  Utilizing it, you'll be able to suck up just about anything in your path from a long distance.  The detail is fun to see, as well.  Using the hypernova you might see Kirby uproot trees, suck in larger enemies he normally wouldn't be able to or even send enormous objects hurling back at enemies.  There are also times when it's used to solve quick puzzles.  Enormous blocks can be dragged to create paths.  You'll also use this ability to defeat mini-bosses along the way.It's the level designs in Kirby that'll delight more than anything.  A lot of the levels are quite creative.  And, at least for the first leg or so of your journey, every level introduces something new.  But more than that, no level feels like any other level.  As each one introduces something else, they also make sure to keep the utilization of those things coming in other ways.  You might see a platform hanging from a rope that needs to be shot one moment with a simple arrow.  The next, it's underwater and you have to find another means to cut the rope.That's not all, there are few games that make quite as good use of the actual hardware as Kirby Triple Deluxe.  The gyro controls even have some use without necessarily being annoying or feeling too tacked on.  You might jump into a bowl of water and have to tilt the 3DS one way or the other to water plants or put out a fire.  Even the 3D itself isn't actually bad.  In many levels there are enemies in the foreground and the background.  It's interesting to see enemies directly in your path trying to pummel you with attacks, but you also come across plenty in the background, throwing bombs into the foregrounds.  Or even threats.  In one level there's a cannon firing at you from the background.  In other levels you'll see boulders rolling from the background into the foreground.  This is all pretty cool stuff.  And every now and then you'll find a star that allows you to go into the background and take out the enemies there.  Putting on the 3D certainly helps to make some of these moments much easier to get through.  Particularly in some of the games boss battles where the baddies jump to and from the background and foreground.  In fact, the boss fights are some of the best things you'll see in Kirby Triple Deluxe.  They are often unique battles.  It might take a moment to recognize an area boss's pattern or to really gauge their attacks, but they'll certainly keep you on your toes.  Some of the most exciting moments in Kirby Triple Deluxe come from the uniqueness of the boss fights.  There simply aren't many moments like it on the 3DS.The levels in Kriby Triple Deluxe are not short, either.  They're actually quite lengthy, often ending with a mini-boss of some sort.  But you'll want to go back into each level just the same an explore a little more.  Every level has several keychains for you to find.  Rare ones and common ones alike.  But the real deal about each level is collecting the various sunstones.  The boss of each area can't be accessed without the right amount of sunstones in your possession.  If you find every sunstone in an area you'll be able to access an extra level as well.  Kirby Triple Deluxe is a surprisingly lengthy game as a result if you decide you need to find everything there is to uncover.If there was any complaints about Kirby Triple Deluxe it would be that the game itself is far too easy and simple.  The game is no challenge whatsoever.  Many enemies are easily dispatched and there are plenty of health restoring items everywhere.  There are even some of King Dedede's minions that'll give you some food to put in your reserves so that you can restore your health at the press of a button or the tap of your bottom screen.  This along makes even some of the more challenging boss fights a cakewalk.  The game gets a little difficult going into the home stretch, but it's not difficult enough to be a problem.  At the very least there's no Super Guide if you do happen to die too much, and Nintendo isn't throwing extra lives at you at every turn.  Kirby Triple Deluxe is a really easy game, but at least Nintendo didn't opt to hold your hand with this one.There are other things to Kirby as well.  There's more than just the main campaign.  There is also Kirby Fighters where many different Copy Ability Kirby's can battle.  It's quite similar to Super Smash Brothers in this regard.  There are even items and environmental hazards to beware.  It's not quite as robust as Super Smash Brothers, however.  There are only ten copy abilities to choose from and in Single Player it isn't really anything special.  In multiplayer, however, it is surprisingly fun.  There's also Dedede's Drum Dash.  Which is like a rhythm game.  You'll bounce on drums, collecting coins to get to the end of a level.  It's timed and you get rewarded for finishing quickly, collecting all the coins and taking no damage.  It's a surprisingly difficult game mini-game to get the hang of at first.  Even though you're just bouncing from one drum to another.  You'll have moments where you need to press the A button at the right time to bounce higher.  The timing is a little hard to get, but once you do get it down it's a surprisingly fun little mini-game.  It's short lived, however.Graphically, Kirby has hardly looked this good on a handheld.  The levels themselves (presented in 2.5D) are colorful and detailed.  It's got a nice look and feel to it.  The music is also just as playful sounding and fun.  All told, artistically, Kirby is a great looking game.  Everything also happens to animate really well.  As mentioned earlier, the 3D is also quite good.  It's a graphically good looking game with a great art design to accompany it.  It's colorful and vibrant, easily making for one of the best looking side scrollers on the 3DS to date.Kirby Triple Deluxe is a great game.  It mashes its elements together really well and creates a nice meaty package for those interested.  You probably won't spend as many time on the mini-games as you will the main campaign, but the fact that there is so much content included here makes the game worth the purchase for any Kirby fan.  It may not be a difficult game, by any means, but clever and creative level design as well as lots of collecting to do is enough to keep the fun going for a long while.  If you've enjoyed Kirby's previous outings then you ought to try Triple Deluxe because it's without a doubt one of his best.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2014"}

Having played these I think Halo is much better as I will explain below.The game places you in the future as a special Cyborg with a mission to save mankind from some aliens known as the Covenant.Unlike other shoot everything that moves games, in Halo there are a number of unique differences which make it the best game of its type in my opinion.First of all theres some epic fights which you get to participate in. You can find yourself dropped off with other marines fighting for your lifes against a myriad of aliens. The AI of the marines and aliens is impressive. You could if you wanted to hide somewhere in the game and watch the chaos around you shoot itself out. It's amazing. It's like being in a real battle. You never know how things will pan out as your actions can change the whole way a battle evolves. To hide or not to hide is the question. Helping your fellow marines out is necessary to help insure they don't die. At one point in the game I felt quite alone until reaching a later checkpoint where I met up with a survivor who gratefully jumped into my warthog(armoured Jeep if you ask me)and manned the guns. When I accidently squashed him against a wall on flipping over I felt quite sad for the poor guy. I was on my own again. After that experience I protected the marines as much as I could. I actually started to care about the little guys and seek there company.The aliens themselves run away from you when they know they're beaten but as soon as they get the opportunity will come right back and shoot you the moment you're not looking. Some of the bigger aliens when dying charge you in the hope of taking you out with them. It's quite impressive.You get a fair number of weapons to use including alien ones. The good old sniper gun was my favourite and the telescopic zoom will have you itching to have a go.A big difference for me was the fact that a good part of the game plays on the surface of a planet. It's awesome to watch and you're given more freedom to roam around and explore than in other games of this type. The game doesn't have such a linear feel to it. There's plenty of strategy for those who want to be clever and various ways to defeat the enemy.The levels are quite long and numerous and only a few are a bit repetitive.One of the best aspects of the game is the ability to let you drive any of the vehicles in the game such as armoured jeeps, tanks and alien ships. You can even knock out an enemy guard and assume his position on a laser cannon. There's stacks of fun in this. It's even better in a two player game. As one player can drive whilst the other shoots in the case of the armoured jeep. It really is fantastic.Best of all the single player campaign can be played on four difficulty levels and repeated as a multiplayer game. So if you struggle with certian levels you can get a friend or 3 to join you and help out. I struggled with my friend to get a go driving the jeep! All this and no slow down.We were riveted for hours. He of course has a PS2 and at the start said it wasn't much better than PS2 games until he saw the planet and the sniper rifle and the way you can use vehicles.No doubt the gameplay is the clincher. I'm not a fan of violent games as such but this game has a far more innocent feel to it. Half life for example was extremely scary. In this game I didn't get scared. Later on in the game there are some levels which unnerved me a little bit but I always felt in control. There are no horrible impossible puzzles to solve here. Just straightforward planning and common sense will see you through. There are also regular automatic saves throughout the levels so at least you know you will be able to reach the end eventually. The very final stage stumped me for a while only because I thought it was harder than it actually was! The levels are also broken up with cinematic scenes. The graphics are stunning in places and the planet knocked me senseless.There are stacks of multiplayer options such as capture the flag, slayer, and race. There's hours of play to be had here.You might like me find the controls odd at first but you'll get used to them. Any negatives have to be constructive or very minor niggles. I would have liked the aliens to have a bigger variety of random responses than what was offered, which too my knowlegde is better than what has gone before anyway! The game slowed down when reaching some of the checkpoints in the multiplayer mode but only for a second or two. One very minor niggle is the ending wasn't as long as I hoped although it's worth seeing. Another strange this was the disappearance of the alien bodies on certian levels.Halo brought something different and exciting to discover and it pushes even newer boundaries to my experience. The story line has some interesting twists and turns along the way and the suspense lasts right to the end.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2003"}

I am not a fan of first person shooters, and here is why... Control. This game needs to be on a PC. It has a very mouse and keyboard feel to its control set up, a set up that does not work well with a control paddle. Still, despite these quips Halo manages to be a very good story with a lot of possibilities. I have not finished the game, but despite my complaints I will probably have to at some point buy it. Maybe when the price goes down. For future installments it is my hope that Microsoft will remember that the XBox is a console, not a PC, and will develop more console user-friendly controls in the vein of Goldeneye in the future. They may also want to consider not having than baddies laughing maniacally as you're blasting them into tiny pieces. I will probably buy the PC version so I can use the mouse and keyboard. It will feel less awkward to me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2002"}

I think it actually had more dinosaurs than Turok 2, though! The multiplayer is fun, especially co-op missions, but 2 players aren't enough for good multiplayer. The storyline is derivative and that makes me tune out and care less. There are many dull moments in mazes of corridors, where the areas are repetitive and that contributes to getting lost and/or bored. Level design is bland technocrap, though sometimes perfectly epic-looking. You essentially open locked doors and search in between enemies, and that's just not good gameplay. It's best when there are many vehicles and enemies around, with friends playing with you, open areas are numerous and dry. Single player is ... somewhat tedious, co-op multi can be great but the graphics are smaller and enemies harder to hit (I won't praise the game just for multi). Multiplayer Vs. isn't worth it unless you have 3 or 4 people and controllers on. I think controlling the Warthog should be easier, and more weapons should have a scope. I liked how the Marines would speak to you during the game, but they just say goofy stuff. You can't use your own music ingame, either. I wish there was one weapon w/ infinite bullets. Overall, this is a pretty good shooter, but rent to see if it's for you or not first, I wish it had more battles in larger outdoor levels and better gameplay surrounding them. What really bothers me, is that people say this is the Xbox's answer to RARE's Masterpiece, 'GOLDENEYE 007\", when it isn't. Ultimately, it's just so overrated.

{"product_name":"B002TDIEDG","description":"","reviewerName":"Q","summary":"Unique stylized puzzle game with great story","reviewText":"It's not often I rave about a game: I'm pretty picky (see my other reviews), however, this game was so addictive, in many ways. The art is unique, stylized, and well done. It reminds me of Street Fighter Alpha, a little over the top, however, I'm pretty sure the characters are 3D models, or I'm even more impressed with the quality and smoothness of the animations! The game play is simple and new, yet can get very complicated. Going from object to object, preforming single \"tricks\", at specific times to see how it affects the world, and other objects.The details of animation and background, as well as interactive objects is great. Perhaps so much there to make up for the simple interface. At times you end up with a sort of Golberg-esc device, manipulating objects in a particular order to affect the change necessary to progress the story. And the story is very intriguing! It's a murder mystery, with a twist, that's deep, with many levels and minor stories that add to the whole picture. I regret rushing so fast through the story, to find out who dunit, and not taking the time to investigate each character better (such as reading their bios).There really isn't much to Ghost Trick; it's as simple as it's name. You are a ghost, you can perform minor poltergeist-like tricks, however, with so many different objects you can perform tricks with, the puzzles become challenging. I hope for a sequel (if that is even possible with this type of game), where, perhaps, they give you more choices in solving puzzles. Most of the time, there really is only one way to complete a puzzle, having more choices would be great. Does this game deserve 5 stars? Again, I don't give that rating often, with this game I justify it because of the obvious quality in design and implementation, and, as a personal feel, it pushed me to look for more games with the same qualities it has.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2013"}

But this game deserves praise.Sampling from previous classics such as Max Payne, Super Metroid, Halo, Bioshock, even the Mario franchise, BMAA forces you to tread over previous areas in a kind of open-ended free-roaming super hero romp. But not free-roaming in the GTA sense; more like the aforementioned Metroid where, as you gain more powers or gadgets you can finally reach that ledge, that ventilation shaft or the top of the building. Soon strange buildings and gardens become familiar romping grounds and... well, they become yours. The game blends so many elements - collecting, solving, combo fighting, upgrading, exploring, learning and finally winning that it is in a class to itself. It really is. Even the achievements are so well placed they deserve a mention.So rather than go on about Luke Skywalker's incredible v/o (it carries the game) or the amazing graphics and atmospheric locations... I'll simply shut up. It's by far in a way the best game of the year regardless of your DC comic fanboyishness or not.Personally I don't care about Batman - I do however know a ruddy great game when I play it and that's this game.

[see Cons: 3.) below]3.)A few new weapons and a couple of new transport systems.The Cons:1.)Repetitious play. About half way through you've met all the various aliens that are going to try to obstruct your path.All levels involve killing all the aliens to open up a portal to the next level. This is basically the entire game.2.)There are a few levels involving some flying of a lightly armed shuttle-craft; however the encounters with the enemy aircraft usually occur in an area where there is not much space and the enemy is much faster and more maneuverable than you. You're better off to quickly land your craft at a docking pod and engage the enemy fighters from the ground.3.)BUT, the most annoying feature of actual game play is the fact that it doesn't matter if you live of die in a fight...Why? Well, let me elaborate a little; because you play a native Cherokee Indian you have connections to the spirit world. If you die you simply go to the spirit world, restock up on hit points and return to the game at the point where you died. There is no reason to fight for your life if you're taking a beating; just stand there, get killed, get automatically transported to the spririt world, reload on hit points and start again where you left off. Initially  this seemed like a great feature, but it quickly became obvious that all the fun and uncertainty of major battles disappeared because you now can win all battles by simply wearing down your opponent's hit points, as he/she cannot renew theirs, at crucial times, like you can.4.) The game is only available on the \"easy\" level until you beat it the first time; the problem being, I can't think of a single level I'd want to play again on any level. (easy or difficult)5.)Also, if you wanted to play the game again on the difficult level, you must go through the entire bar sequence at the beginning of the game and also watch a prolonged movie segment at the start of the first level in the alien ship; there is no way to skip these sections and they are tediously long.All in all a game that had great potential but instead was a disappointment in many ways; too easy and repetitious are just 2 of the a series of problems with this FPS.2 Stars","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2006"}

I enjoy third person shooters and stealth games alike, so I picked it up for its affordable price.Absolution stars Agent 47; a legendary hitman who feels betrayed by the government group he works for known as &#34;The Agency&#34;. After assassinating a former member of The Agency, 47 feels guilt for the first time and vows to protect Victoria, whose importance is unknown to 47 at the time. What follows is a dark, mature story told through beautifully done cinematics in between the sneaking and murdering of the bad guys in your way. It is gripping, and while the antagonists are cardboard and not memorable, 47 and his interactions with Victoria are heartfelt and engaging. The story is the star of the package here.Gameplay boils down to either sneaking around and disposing of enemies, shooting everything in sight, or slipping through the shadows in an attempt to find the primary target of the level. Stages in Absolution are linear, but open for you to explore and to find the most creative way to dispose of your targets (the signature kills of this game are brutal and are totally worth the extra work). Players that need it can take advantage of the &#34;instinct mode&#34;, which allows 47 to do things such as easily slip past guards or dispose of everything in the room with the blink of an eye, but true Hitman veterans don't need to use this at all. I found myself using the system in only the most dire of situations, and resorting to stealth and carefully picking off targets instead. There are plenty of disguises scattered throughout the world (not to mention being able to steal the clothes off your fallen victims), though these are almost useless since people of the same disguise will instantly know you're an imposter. A huge complaint I have with the gameplay is that restarting at checkpoints causes all of the guards you have killed (including bodies you properly dispose of) to respawn, meaning all of your hard work went to waste.Also included on top of the main story is a player made mission system known as Contracts, which allows you to compete with friends and the world alike for the fastest time and the cleanest kills. This is a fun bonus on top of the lengthy single player campaign.Hitman Absolution is a great game with a few forgivable hiccups. This is a great buy for third person shooter and stealth fans alike.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2014"}

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, is a much better game than Time Splitters 2, but in some spots, is actually harder than that game.

Don't get me wrong, the game is well made, it follows the first two movies very well, and is really cool looking.  It is actually fun to play, the controls are in the spirit of Devil May Cry, and when I first started playing the game I loved it.  But, there is a big difference between a challenge, which I love, and downright impossible, which is what this game neared.

The game tends to have a lot more math problems, but none of them require you to use a calculator to figure out the solution (I have not used one at all).  The puzzles range from very simple to common sense and some mind numbing puzzles in addition to actual puzzles (slide puzzles to be exact).  Some of them are very easy to solve and you won't need to use the 'hint coins' (which are coins used to get hints for the puzzle without giving away the answer) while some are difficult and require some hints (you can get up to 3 hints per puzzle).  If you had to categorize the game, it is a point and click game (where you point at the person/object and touch it on the screen).  This game requires you to think, not only for the puzzles but for clues to solving the mystery (although it is a very straightforward game some parts require you to locate certain people at a specific location).  In the event you can't solve a puzzle you can always go back to it later and try to solve it then.  Also, if you are missing a puzzle, later on you will get access to the puzzle you missed for that chapter (although if you missed something early on you won't be able to get it back later on).  Overall, the game has over 100 puzzles for you to crack and that is more than enough to satisfy any puzzle lovers, but it gets better as there are puzzles that are downloaded every week for you to solve a brand new puzzle.  Simply one of the most unique DS titles to be released on the system and does not disappoint.Recommended for everyone and highly recommended for puzzle lovers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2008"}

Mechanic turned race car driver turned saboteur Gerald Butler oops I mean Sean Devlin is an Irishman whose best friend was murdered by a Nazi official whom he swears his revenge on. This not so gripping tale is a mere setup to what otherwise is yet another open world action game. 1940s occupied France is your play ground this time and Nazis are your prime target. As a member of the resistance, Sean uses his parkour, driving, shooting, stealth, and Irish charm expertise sabotage targets all over the place and to find the man whose responsible for the death of his friend. With hundreds of free targets dotted around this virtual France, taking them down is The Saboteur's strongest aspect. The actual story missions can be completed within 8-10 hours but tackling all the optional targets for you to blow up can take up to double if not, triple of the time. Of course your sabotages are useless if you have no arsenal of toys to use, and The Saboteur has plenty. From the usual sort of period firearms to blowtorches to tanks, you'll blow up tons of Nazi property here. Don't forget your perks which enhances Sean's accuracy by successfully meeting conditions such as racking up sniper headshots or blowing a number Nazi scum with one grenade. Overall, The Saboteur is not the most original game out there and has been done better by other games. But still, a good game is a good game and The Saboteur is just that.

Super Mario Kart was great, Mario Kart 64 was even better, Super Circuit brought back all the elements of SMK, and now, we approach Mario Kart: Double Dash. Does this game stack up to all the other games in the series? Well, OF COURSE!Mario Kart: Double Dash features a huge variety in courses and characters, like the other games in the series, but unlike them, Double Dash's main highlight, where you use 2 characters at once, takes the series to brand new heights! Not only was it fun to select which 2 characters race together (Baby Mario and Wario? Heh.), and to hold more than one item, but you can also play with a friend together in Co-op mode! And to top it all off, the racing is MUCH, MUCH FASTER than in all of the other games!As for the items, they were just as insane as the 2-driver concept. Sure, you still have the average Koopa shells, Banana Peels, etc, but you also get a flying Spiny shell that creates a quick explosion in the 1st Place player's spot (Previous games had it wingless), and Special Items exclusive to each character (Mario: Fireball - Toad: Golden Mushroom)!!The courses were more creative than ever. Here, we drive on a freaking cruiser ship, through prehistoric times, a couple stadiums, and even highways with multiple paths! And let's not forget the new feature in which we play through all 4 cups in one sitting!Lastly, it's hardly ever known, but with some hard work, you can actually connect with 16 other people and play online! With some effort, it can be done....and you'll have an extreme experience unlike any other.So overall, it's one of craziest, most fast-paced kart racers I've ever played!

I even went as far as getting a copy for myself and another for the kids that I picked up at my local Gamestop so that I wouldn't have to share. What a disappointment it was when I put it in and started playing the campaign. There's really no maps to guide you along your way, it's basically hit and miss. All 3 campaigns could have been a bit longer and more detailed. Game seemed kinda rushed and not totally put together. In my opinion not worth the $60 being asked.The only thing that makes up for it is the multi-player mode which even gets bland after a while. I love the fact that you get to be either Marine, Predator or Alien while in multiplayer mode and it's random so you never know who you're going to be in the next game but still could have been better all around.Edit: Found out the only way you can change your character in multi-player is if there's an open slot, if there isn't the only thing you can change is the skin of your character.

I mean the story is a bit of a stretch because a rather obscure character is the main villain (Hint: R&C;: Going Commando Side-Quest). Yes, there is freedom to go out from your base, which you must defend from enemies, but there is just not any real platforming in the way R&C; is known for. The game looks great, don't get me wrong, but it isnt R&C;: Future caliber. This installment is REALLY SHORT like the downloadable entry Quest for Booty, but QfB was a lot more fun in my opinion because THAT was a typical R&C; adventure, however short. While that is a bit negative, this game is still good. Just think: &#34;At least its not the PS2 version of Secret Agent Clank or Size Matters.&#34;Pros:+ Still a good looking game+ Weapons are still fun to useCons:- You could finish this game (with dedication) in 6 hours.

{"product_name":"B009S4JTTC","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Ramos","summary":"Happy Anniversary?","reviewText":"Didn't think the Ratchet & Clank series could sink any lower after R&C;: All 4 One... I was wrong. At least All 4 One had a traditional campaign with an actual story, R&C;:FFA is pretty much one big mini game. Plus they changed the art style so Ratchet now looks like something designed to appeal to a 10-year-old. Really the only thing going for this game is classic R&C; combat, but even that gets stale without any of the traditional platforming, puzzle solving or exploration to mix things up. Adding insult to injury, the framerate is extremely unstable. In the first 5 minutes of gameplay you'll see very noticeable drops in performance before the actual game even starts! You're literally just walking around the ship/lobby with no enemies or dynamic events in sight and you experience slowdowns. To make matters worse, the game completely froze during my first time playing it. I had to restart my console to get it working again and all my progress was gone. But on the PS Vita that's not even the half of it...The Vita version is just awful. The framerate lies somewhere around 25fps on average and it makes gameplay feel incredibly sluggish. When things get chaotic it can slow down to the point where you're practically playing a slideshow. It's honestly borderline unplayable and if you think it's because of PS3 quality graphics on a handheld, think again. The graphics took a massive hit with the porting process. It looks bad compared to almost any other Vita game out there. Textures are bad, pop-ins galore, the list goes on and on.The only thing that saves this mess of a game from being a total letdown is the inclusion of a free copy of Ratchet: Deadlocked HD. That game is incredible! Beautiful graphics running at 60fps with possibly the best combat of the entire series! If you can find this game for less then $9.99 you should buy it just for Deadlocked! It's without a doubt the silver lining of the package.On a more somber note; it's sad that this mediocre title was released to celebrate the 10th anniversary of such an amazing series. It's severely lacking in the qualities that R&C; fans around the world have enjoyed for over a decade now. Even with more polish it couldn't have noticeably improved on what turned out to be an entirely forgettable experience. I would only recommend this game to someone who was a huge fan of the series and just had to have every new title released. Otherwise it's really not worth it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2014"}

If you began liking Mario Kart with the Nintendo 64 version, then the GBA version will not live up to your expectations.  However, I have friends who prefer the SNES version; so if you are one of those, consider the GBA version an upgrade from the SNES version.In the GBA version, the graphics are rather decent as compared to the SNES version.  The GBA system is 32-bit; and compared to the SNES (16-bit), there are more capabilities.Your perspective is behind the racer, and the graphics flow smoothly all around your driver with a great 3D-like perspective.  The levels are quite nice, and the drivers and graphics are well-detailed.The gameplay is a lot like the SNES version where hopping doesn't help you very much (it helps a LOT in MK64!), but it surely upgrades the item usage.  That is, you can line your shells up much better, and negotiating turns is much easier.The action involved in the game is complimented with the Gran Prix mode where you can win tournaments.  Linking up with others, in my opinion, is the best feature of the game, hands down.So if you like portability and you appreciate the SNES version of Mario Kart, this game will suit you nicely.  Also, if you like to play Mario Kart by yourself, this game can burn some time for you.  But if you started your Mario Kart career off with the N64 version like I did, then you will be slightly disappointed with some of the general gameplay capabilities.  (The GBA game plays nothing like the 64 version.)","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-23-2006"}

I was looking for good, solid titles, and had picked up GTA IV, Metal Gear Solid 4, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, and Dead Space.  I at first wasn't going to pick up inFamous, but the guy at the GameStop was like, \"Hey man, if you're looking for good games for your PS3, you gotta check this game out.  Trust me, it will be worth your while.\"  Boy, he wasn't kidding.inFamous is a third-person-action, open-world, sandbox-style Superhero game with a great story and a protagonist that you, the player, can truly get behind and identify with.  Cole McGrath, the main character, is presented with good and bad choices during his journey to achieve his full potential - either as a super hero or a super villain.  Supporting characters will react accordingly - they will praise his good deeds or condemn his bad ones.  Also, Cole himself will start to look different as you become more good or more evil.  Cole's actions define his story.There are three areas of the city (after the catastrophic event occurs at the beginning) that Cole must liberate from gangs, and along the way you have to battle game bosses.  I won't spoil it for those that haven't played it, but they are well-done and fun to play.The controls are pretty solid, but occasionally Cole will grab surfaces during jumping that will keep him from landing where you want - and the camera can be a little ackward - but rarely.  The special moves he learns are easy to do with the controls, and as you proceed through the story, you are able to unlock more and more abilities.The cut-scenes are in comic form - but are well done, and add depth to the game's underlying story.The sound and music is good, as is the replay value.  There are many side tasks to help the character clear the streets of criminals and, although they are not essential to beating the game, they do add a profound sense of accomplishment.Lastly, is the character animations and graphics.  Compared to graphics in 2013, they are great but not the best - and when characters talk to each other they show little facial movement other than their jaws flapping, but take this in stride, as the rest of the game is great.This game is a must-own for gamers of all types, and is cheap now, so it should be easy to pick up and won't set you back much cost-wise.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000ZKDOV2","reviewerName":"PS2 Bruce","summary":"It's ......FUN!","reviewText":"A lot of people have waited a long time for this game, and the question, as with many others, was, will it live up to expectations/match the hype? For me, it does. There has been a lot written about \"Saint's Row is a GTA ripoff,\" and things to that effect, but I have always seen it differently--I will try to explain what I mean in the course of this review. I was not really intending to write a review of GTA IV here, or a comparsion, but when you consider Saints Row 2, or the first game, for that matter, it's really difficult not to compare the two. I feel that they are all good games in their own right; I happen to prefer Saints Row 2, and will do my best to expain why.Now, to the review: The original Saint's Row was the reason I purchased my 360-I had read all the previews and was so interested to play the game, I purchased a new console to do so (like I bought my PS2 so I could play Vice City). At the time most people disparaged the first Saints Row as a \"GTA clone\" or GTA ripoff,\" but, I didn't see it that way, in fact, to me Saints Row instroduced some things that I think GTA IV incorporated, so from my view, GTA IV is a Saints Row ripoff--for example some things Saints Row had first-1. GPS2. Cell phone interface, including easy access cheats3. When you die you lose some money but NOT your weapons (thank god, finally)4. NPC's look more liike people, than cartoon charactersBut, that's just my view. I always have felt that, Saints Row is more \"FUN\" than the GTA games. The new Saints Row, even more so. The game begins with your character in the prison hospital; at this point you get to choose the gender and ethnicity of your character, and pick his/her voice. I'm just wondering how many guys made their character a female, and ran around in their underwear for awhile (I know I did, lol). The cut scenes can be very amusing, that way.Anyway you make your character, then an NPC who is a 3rd St Saint, gets himself stabbed so he can get into the infirmary, and help you bust out of prison. The first \"mission\" involves you two fighting your way off the prison island, and getting back to town, which has changed a lot since you have been away. From here, gameplay is similar the to the first Saints Row-you do side missions of various types to build up your \"respect\" gauge, once your respect indicates at least \"1x\" you can then play missions and try to beat strongholds.  You gain \"respect\" by completing the various levels of activities, killing cops, klling enemy gang members, and now, new features-you can gain respect by skillfull driving-coming close to other vehicles without crashing into them (\"near miss\") getting air, going on 2 wheels, driving on the wrong side of the street without being hit, etc. The cleaner the near miss, or longer you are on the wrong side, higher you fly etc, come more \"stars\"--sort of like \"kudos\" in the PGR games. This is cool!Now, here's my main point. this is why in my opinon Saint's Row 2 is a better game than GTA IV. It's simply more fun. Now, GTA IV is a great game. But after awhile things about it get OLD-your \"friends\" nagging you all the time to hang out, and my LEAST favorite thing--all the damn \"chase\" missions--where you drive somewhere (usually way across town or, later, on another island), find a location, kill a bunch of people there, then, the final target escapes the area and you have to finish the mission by chasing him/her all the way BACK across town. After 5 or 6 of these you get SICK of it. In fact, just today I decided to play today, put the game in, and came across just a mission. I put quite a bit of time into GTA IV so that I could unlock all the islands, now, I just don't care about playing it that much anymore because I know I will be facing a couple more dozen \"chase\" missions. There are a couple in Saints Row 2, also, but not as many, and not as frustrating, to me, anyway.Anyway, here is why I prefer Saints Row 2 to GTA IV: (and what's improved since Saints Row 1)1. You can select your characters gender/appearance/voice, etc.2. ALL AREAS OF THE CITY ARE UNLOCKED TO BEGIN. I have always HATED that in the GTA games, you are locked out of other areas of the city, sometimes till pretty deep in the game.3. You generate money-once you have completed several story missions, and control a few areas of town, you are generating a couple of thousand dollars a day; then when you buy a couple of stores, another thousand or two; you can then buy clothes, weapons/ammo, etc4.HITMAN and CHOP SHOP activities improved-now once you start a hitman or chop shop list, as you roam about the game will show you where the hitman target is (you dont have to have a specific weapon for them anymore, yay), and if you happen to jack a car that's wanted, the game will show a message \"wanted by the chop shop\" and draw you a GPS route to the chop shop. Cool! (and both are good ways to make easy money and a lot of respect).5. New activites: You can now drive a taxi for fares, drive an ambulance as a medic (instead of just picking up groups of people you actually go on scene and do CPR, etc- and many other things, including driving a flaming ATV into things and people, driving a septic truck and spraying poop on things and people, and many, many others. Also old favorites, like SNATCH, ESCORT, DEMO DERBY, etc. are still there, in more locations.6. The aiming system: Saints Row has no \"auto aim\" or \"lock on,\" and I think this is BETTER. It does take some getting used to, after all the years of GTA, but the problem with GTA'a aiming, is it almost always \"locks on\" the wrong target. So while an enemy is pumping you full of shots, you are \"locked on\" to somebody else. Sucks. In Saints' Row, you \"free aim,\" you have a gunsight on screen that changes size and shape, depending on the weapon equipped; when your shot will do damage the gunsight turns red; when you are aiming at a friendly, it turns to a green cross, telling you not to shoot. Easy. Once you get used to it, it really is better.7. Retrying missions: If you fail a mission  you can usually choose to restart from a checkpoint, if it's a mulitpart one. This eliminates a lot of driving.8. Easy use of cheats: Like GTA IV, once you enter a cheat code into the phone, you can bring it up again and select it. This is nice; you don't have to remember it/key it in every time etc. To those that will say, \"but that disables ome achievments\" I don't care. Achievements are OK, but I'm not that invested in them; I don't care about getting 100% compeletion either; in games like this, I just want to play through the story missions enough to finish and get the ending.9. The health system: One of my favorite things-if you are taking damage, take cover somehow, and gradually your health will regenerate. This can be helped by carrying food items. The game does not have \"take cover\" as such, but you can still crouch behind objects, go around corners etc. I still prefer this to the GTA health bar to 0- \"wasted\"To give balance though, there are a few things I don't like that much:1. Damage modeling on the cars-I agree this isn't so good...GTA IV does this better, no doubt. But I think the \"spirits\" of the game being different, vis. this game is for \"fun\" I can forgive that.2. \"Pushbacks\" I didnt like these in the first game, and still dont. A \"pushback\" happens when, you get a cell phone call that an area your gang contols, is under attack from the gang you put out of there. You must then respond to that area, and repel the attackers--you win the \"pushback\" by killing from 5 to 12 \"lieutenants' of the gang that are marked on the map. \"Pushbacks\" aren't especially difficult, just annoying because you are very outnumbered, and need to have max ammo for whatever weapons you are carrying. The good side of them is, once you've finished one, you have killed enough enemies to move your \"resepct\" up enough to do a new mission. The bad thing is due to the \"numbers game\" you will get killed a lot and have to retry. Two tips for this: always have plenty of ammo, and stay in the car as much as possible.3. Flight controls. You can fly helicopters and various general aviaton planes. But the contols are awful. It is fun though.Saints Row 2 is a great \"sandbox\" game. It's not GTA IV but it's really not rying to be. They are both good games for different reasons, but I can tell you, I will be playing this game a lot more, because it is FUN!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2008"}

I loved the mad max feel, with green mohawks etc. The way the enemies screamed while running at you added to the intensity and fun. I wish there were more titles like this. The humor is juvenile and I love it! Lot's of cursing so put the kids to bed. The controls are smooth as butter and whipping your enemies, pulling them towards you then kicking them into the air (in slow motion) and shooting the s*** out of them is so incredibly satisfying. I try and turn as many of my friends on to this game as I can as it is a sleeper hit for sure. Unfortunately, the plans for a sequel had been scratched due to mediocre sales. There is multiplayer but to be honest I dont have much experience with it.If you grew up playing DOOM and similiar fps just get the game now. You cannot go wrong with this game, especially with how cheap it is now. I pre-ordered the game at full price and am still satisfied with my purchase. I can't waitr to get this game back from my friend so I can do another play through. P.S. this game is easy, so if you're looking for a real challenge I would recommend crysis 2. Loved this game!More please!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2014"}

Both schemes work well and I find myself using a combination of the two.GAMEPLAY: Like every other Final Fantasy adventure (especially the older ones), you'll be spending the vast majority of your time leveling up, searching for items, and talking.

{"product_name":"B0017HIIWW","description":"Transformed and unleashed, Sonic races to save the world...and himself. Sonic the Hedgehog is on an adventure unlike any other. Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience. Merging blistering 2D action with meticulously rendered 3D environments, players race through intriguing locations across the globe as Sonic to save a chaotic world.The other side of SonicSonic and his alter ego Werehog.View larger.Collect rings for Ring Energy.View larger.Swing into action with Werehog.View larger.A NewSonica New StoryOn a quest for world domination Sonic nemesis Dr. Eggman has managed to steal the chaos emeralds once again and this time drained them of their power. As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new modified game engine,Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.","reviewerName":"jayman721","summary":"the start of  sonic's comback","reviewText":"SEGA finally got it right with sonic unleashed for the wii. before i talk about the game, lets make one thing clear, the wii version is a completely different version than the 360 version. in other words... it's better. any way, the werehog was SEGA's sorry excuse for inovating gameplay, sonic's new speeds aren't enough apparently. so what is the innovating gameplay? no it's not teleconesis, a jet board or even guns, it's 3D platforming. not innovating at all. the werehog sucks in both versions of this game, but then again, if you had common sense, you'll probally buy the game for sonic's levels and guess what, they're good. they're the best to date, even better than SA2's.the daytime controls are great. it's easy to play for any age. the levels themselves have great design too. instead of just boosting through the easy stages that make you qustion who's acually playing the game, you have more to do, like more drifting points and timed homing attacks to get to a shortcut. to motion controls aren't the best, but at least they allow a classic or gamecube cotroller. those options are always welcomed.the werehog levels have better design and a little bit more veriaty than the 360 version, but are still pointless to play. you could like it if you're a hardcore 3D platformer player, but even you'll get bored of the 10 to 30 minute levels that are filled to the brim with dumb puzzles and pointless fighting that's only good for show-offs. they're best left alone.if you own a wii, i highly recomend this game. the day time levels are good enough for you to buy the game, but the night time are boring. but again, the day time levels are AWSOME. no matter which version of the game you buy, you'll have lots of fun in the sun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2008"}

That game changed my life... in the gaming sense.  It was everything I ever thought a computer game should be: turn-based strategy with multiple avenues to test my ego and self-promoted genius.  Above all features of Civ3, however, my most favorite was the customization of the game through the map editor and the wonderful online resources of the Civ community.  (I've downloaded more Civ3 files than MP3s.)  This allowed me to express my self-proclaimed genius with new rules, technologies, and units (and all the accompanying chronologies and requisites) at my discretion.  Nothing could get any better, I had thought.When Civ4 was being talked about, however, I couldn't imagine on what grounds they could improve - except perhaps making the game even more customizable and thorough.  Well, you've already read about the differing features of the game: less micro-management, more diplomatic and trade features, new technology trees, enhancing popular mechanics found in previous Civ titles, and of course, going 3D with it all.When playing Civilization IV, you sense an overwhelming POTENTIAL to be a really great game.  In my mind, that potential has not been fulfilled, and I hereby advise you to purchase Civ3 Complete instead and forego Civ4 if you haven't chosen so already.  If you have already purchased Civ4, let's send a message to Firaxis Games that they need to do better - let's stop purchasing Civ products until they are actually without so many bugs, that aren't rushed to be released for the holidays, and that don't insult our intelligence by requiring expensive \"expansion packs\" which merely add content that should already have been included in the original release.Here is a list of comparative reasons to only own Civ3 and not Civ4 and boycott future Civ titles until something changes for the better:1.  There is no map editor in Civ4.  Instead, they included a \"World Builder\" which is so awkward and strange.  It is not like Civ3's map editor where you can set starting positions, resources, civilizations, and terrain BEFORE you play the map.  The \"World Builder\" of Civ4 only allows you to alter scenarios from the installation or randomly generated maps.  You cannot create maps from scratch - you can only change what has already been created within predefined parameters.2.  Who needs 3D graphics for a turn-based strategy game?  Civ4 is not fully 3D; it merely allows a tilting view from ground level to overhead.  That can be cool, but consider the offset: it is unnecessary for this genre, it diverts computer resources from other cool and more thorough features, and it makes the game extremely difficult to modify.  For Civ3, there are well over 1,000 things you can either download or make yourself and put right into the game.  You don't have to know XTML or Python programming languages as you would in Civ4.  Civ4 requires advanced education (like a graphics design or computer science degree) to simply alter things like governments, units, buildings, and game rules.  Waiting for others to design them (like the amateur online community or the professional expansion packs) isn't so fun anymore.3.  Expanding content for more money?  This was a problem with Civ3, as well - its first expansion pack was a total waste of money because everything was later put on the second expansion pack.  People bought the first expansion pack because they loved Civ3 so much and didn't know it was a waste.  (Many video game makers are taking advantage of gamers in this way, not just the Civilization makers.)  My point here is to fight back.  We already know what they are going to pull: Civ4 has an expansion pack out there titled Warlords.  It basically includes elements intentionally left out so as to somehow formulate a \"new\" product.  In the base version of Civ4, you have the Great People: artists, scientists, merchants, and prophets.  Hmmm... now we get the warlords, eh?  Oh, and a few other civilizations and buildings left out from before.  Nice try...  Boycott this type of marketing out of sheer principle.  Play Civ3 Complete until Civ5 comes out if you have to.  Maybe Civ will be less of a cheap shot then.4.  The last reason why you should be content with Civilization III and completely forget that Civilization IV was ever made is the most simple.  Purchasing Civ3 Complete right now (1) will cost you less than half of Civ4; (2) is fully expanded while Civ4 is still looking to make more money off of us; and (3) Civ3 has the very same level of addictive game play as any other Civilization title.  If you have already dropped the cash for Civ4, simply do not support Civ4 any longer.  In fact, uninstall it and put it in your drawer as a sad chapter of shameless marketing.  Yes, Civ4 is fun, but it is does not live up to its potential in most ways.  Playing Civ3 will take up your time quite nicely until they release a REAL title that doesn't take advantage of us so blatantly.To conclude, my overall point to stick with Civ3 and forego Civ4 is this: without an easy, efficient, and overwhelmingly powerful customizing interface (like an awesome map editor that allows FULL customization), we are simply asking for \"re-tread\" products.  The fact that Firaxis did not include a kick-butt map editor proves in my mind that they expect us to wait for their \"expansions\" to come out and spend at least $150 each before they move onto Civ5.  Hold out with Civ3 Complete and wait until Civ4 goes away.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2006"}

There is a good basic story involving the classic confrontation between good (Grey wardens) vs evil (undead and arch-demon).In addition, there is lots of dialogue with main characters as well as npcs, side quests, loot, advanced weapons, armor and magic that become available to you as your skills develop and bank account increase. There is even an underlying hint of  the erotic from time to time.Graphics were well done and the actions of battles was smooth and flowing. If I had any complaint it would be the camera angles (which are all 3rd person, but can be adjusted from level behind to looking down from above). Sometimes, during the chaos of battle, the camera angles made it difficult to focus on a particular player or area.Battle are set up so you can give orders to each character in your party of four. They will follow these order explicitly with regards to who to attack, who to defend, etc. depending on how the battle is progressing. However, over and above the scripted automatic battle instructions described above, you can interrupt a battle if it's going poorly to adjust characters health, weapons selection, who to attack or defend etc. Personally, I liked the control I had over my players on the battlefield.The game is set up to take 60 to 80 hours of game play, depending on the number of side quests you take on. Game difficulty ranges from easy to very hard and is changeable at any time during a game, through the options menu. Some DLC has been made available, either purchased at the time you bought the game or later on. The DLC, in addition to adding some new maps to explore, gives you a new party member (a stone golem, named Shale), some new armor, a storage chest with unlimited capacity and some new attributes.Suggestions:1.)You will need a rogue to open locked chest, doors etc.2))buy extra backpacks whenever you can...the amount of loot you'll collect mounts up very fast, and you'll want to carry it back to a shop to sell most of it.Conclusion:A great RPG with an interesting and progressive story.

Ramos \"Voltaire Tempentry\"","summary":"Simple, mindless old school fun","reviewText":"Sin and Punishment: Star Successor is the sequel to the cult classic \"Sin and Punishment\" released only on the Nintendo 64, and only in Japan, in 2000. The original game earned much praise and a hardcore cult following, but despite it launching with an English voice track, the game never saw the light of day outside of the land of the rising sun. In 2008 Nintendo, in an effort to return to \"classic\" franchises and play styles, resurrected the series, and two years later Star Successor was born.Star Successor is very much like other treasure games, including its prequel; hair-trigger shooting with arcade replay and insane bosses. Star Successor doesn't stray from the formula. A truly horrible story (both in plot and presentation) weaves together incredible stage after stage. Boss battles aren't limited to the end of a level, as you'll often find yourself fighting 2-3 within each stage. Bullets crowd the screen, and the game in general has a noticeable aura of insanity.At first the dozens upon dozens of enemies and bullets on screen make the game feel as though too much is going on at any one time. \"Bullet Hell\" doesn't begin to describe the chaos one finds in the latter stages. To remedy this, Treasure created a very well done difficulty curve and system. Newer players will want to start on the Easy mode, and the games difficulty ramps up with each stage in a very linear fashion.The game is as creative as they come; music, creature, pacing, and level design are genius and truly deserving of the name \"Nintendo\". Boss battles especially are some of the most memorable you ll ever see, simply because nothing like them has graced a console in so many years. Star Successor is the definition of \"old-school shooter\", and although its hard as nails, it will never make you want to tear your hair out. The game runs at a solid 60fps despite the plethora of action on screen. Online leader boards contribute to the arcade replay value, and local co-op screams \"Wii fun\".Graphics, on the other hand, don't fair as well. There are rumors that Star Successor started its life as a GameCube game, and if its true it shows. Character models and environments have low level detail, and although there are some nice effects, it ultimately fails to pass or even reach the graphical fidelity of games like Metroid Prime 3 or Red Steel 2, both of which also had a locked 60fps. Keep in mind, however, that Star Successor almost always has upward of 30 enemies on screen at any time.As far as replayability goes, S&PSS; benefits from the same simple and mindless fun that most Wii rail shooters have, and its that fun that brings most players back, replaying a single level over and over again. What differentiates S&P; from many other Wii rail shooters is the inclusion of online leaderboards (a few games, like Darkside Chronicles and Ghost Squad, already have leaderboards), and wholly different style of gameplay (your finger may not release the trigger for minutes on end), and not a single branching path. Just about every rail shooter on Wii features branching paths in some form or another, but S&P; does not. In a way, it fits the gameplay better, as S&P; is more about speed and frantic shooting than precision or building suspense. To further exemplify this, several enemies go down in a single shot, and come in hoards instead of waves.Probably the most noticeable difference that separates S&P; from the rest of the its kind is that the game is a 3rd person rail shooter. Instead of \"viewing\" the game from 1st person, your character is always visible on screen, and must be maneuvered out of harms way. Its this feature that allows the intensity of S&P; to build and work. having to constantly evade bullets (oh so many bullets), enemies, and obstacles all the while trying to deal damage yourself is where S&P; really shines. In fact, the game is only a rail shooters for lack of a better term. A much better comparison than House of the Dead to S&P; would be Star Fox to S&P.;For $50, buyers get one of the best Wii games this year, and definitely one of the most unique games this generation. Its a different game style that unfortunately is getting harder and harder to find. Online leaderboards and local co-op play add to the games inherent replay value, as do various difficulty modes and multiple characters with different abilities (charge shot vs. lock on). Those thatve made up there mind about rail shooters may be surprised, as S&P; is far from what you've come to expect from the genre, but all the while fans of the genre will enjoy the same simple, mindless fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2010"}

I'm a moderate gamer; the new controls are generally more complicated than I'm willing to commit to. He is a hard core gamer. Some games are easier to watch than others, and some are easier to play. This review is not for the hard core gamer. This review is for the girlfriend (or boyfriend, who am I to judge?) that sits on the couch and watches.Sometimes I feel as though there is a massive evil conspiracy meant to relegate me to the watching only role. There are a few games that allow me to take the assistant player role, which is right where I want to be.I loved the firstSuper Mario Galaxy, and it felt like I had to wait forever before this incarnation of the game came out. This game is well worth the wait, as it does not disappoint.The story is the same, but that's what we were all expecting. I love the additional involvement given to the second player. Not only can you hold things and grab star bits, but you can also grab coins (including the dreaded purple ones), mushrooms, enemies and air bubbles. This makes for a much more active 2nd player role, which was great for me, the second player.Maybe it was because of the new abilities of player two, but the game seemed easier this time around. (We still have not beaten the dreaded Luigi disappearing square purple comet board in the first game.) The board is back in the new version, but giving player two the ability to pick up the coins floating in mid air that you may have missed make the board infinitely easier.*****SPOILER ALERT**********SPOILER ALERT**********SPOILER ALERT*****I'm glad the Luigi disappearing board was easier this time around. Once you get ALL of the 120 stars, you get new GREEN comets. You kind of know they are coming when you get close to the end, but they are still a bit of a surprise. Each board has \"hidden\" green stars now, one for each star that you previously beat on the game. So, when you think you are done, you find out that you are actually only half way though. With a huge stack of un-played games, we (mostly he) have given up the green star comet quest quite early on. But, for those of you who have the fortitude to keep on playing, best of luck.

They sprang from the ashes of the company that created FALLOUT, and they've been living in the shadows ever since. If you look at their track record, every single one of their games have been sequels to some of the most highly-acclaimed RPGs of all time. They always have huge shoes to fill, and the results have always been a mixed bag.My favorite game isStar Wars Knights of the Old Republicfor many reasons. It was my first experience with a game where my actions actually mattered, where I could interact with the characters of that world, and where I could actually roleplay. As soon as I finished it, I went out and bought the sequel:Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords. I really didn't know what I had played. It was a game that was so tedious to play at times, but actually managed to improve on the formula I had thought was perfect. Obsidian hasn't broken that habit; they always progress the state of RPGs in their own way, but that accomplishment is always hidden beneath layers of glitches and faulty gameplay.ALPHA PROTOCOL really is no different. Though it represents the company's first attempt at making an original I.P. that's entirely their own, they made the mistake of allowing it to be compared to the MASS EFFECT series, games that are known for their quality, gameplay, and story. If you're looking for an experience similar to that of MASS EFFECT, you really won't find it here. But what you will find, oddly enough, is a game that manages to pull off a few tricks that guys at BioWare should really take note of in the future.The story of ALPHA PROTOCOL is sort of clever when you get right down to it, but it is almost one of the most convoluted I've ever played. You take on the role of Agent Michael Thorton, a man who has just been drafted into a top secret branch of U.S. intelligence called Alpha Protocol. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, requires you to investigate the circumstances of a terrorist act against a passenger airliner. This story will take you to Saudi Arabia, Rome, Taipei, and Moscow, all the while making decisions that will affect how the story unfolds.Now, this is the really amazing part of the game. Unlike MASS EFFECT, where all your decisions really end up doing is change the ending, the decisions you make in ALPHA PROTOCOL decide how the entire story unfolds. Depending on who you save or kill, how you behave in a mission, who you choose to form alliances with: it all impacts how the story plays out. Sidequests will open and close. Some romance options won't even appear. The way people talk to you will change depending on how you've treated them. Maybe the overall story arc doesn't change very much, but how it unfolds certainly does, and by wide margins.Though you will have to play as Michael Thorton (there's hardly any customization available, nor is there an option to play as a female agent), the story managed to become very involving the more my choices began to come into play. The times when you interact with the other characters (all of them are very well written and voiced) are the highlights in the game. Heck, it almost blows MASS EFFECT out of the water in that regard, but that still doesn't change the fact that there is still a game that you have to play to get to those parts, and that's, unfortunately, where ALPHA PROTOCOL founders.To put it bluntly, the gameplay is terrible. It's nothing special in the least bit. It's as if Obsidian was trying to blend GEARS OF WAR, SPLINTER CELL, and MASS EFFECT mechanics into the same game, but they didn't succeed in making any of it work to the point where it's fun. The gunplay is based upon your level, so if you try shooting people with a pistol and you don't have any ranks in it, you can be at point blank range and STILL miss your enemy. I had all of my points into that skill, and by the end of the game most of the enemies were still dodging bullets and brushing off those that actually hit them. You never really feel like you've gotten any more talented than when you started.Not to mention this is only exacerbated by terrible enemy AI. Guards will take cover and never pop out again, some will always charge you no matter how much damage they're taking, and some will just blow themselves up. Also, every single enemy in this game has grenades on their person (not an exaggeration), so expect to be hit with some of those if you take cover for too long.Despite being labeled \"The Espionage RPG,\" this game does not really allow you to live out your spy fantasies. Ninety percent of all the missions in this game revolve around shooting guards in different ways. It doesn't matter what your overall objective is; there is no option to smooth talk your way through any of them like James Bond would do, nor can you effectively stealth through them like Sam Fisher would do. You will always be running and gunning, no matter what class you choose. It's like playing the same level over and over again for over ten hours.The funny thing is, though I can fault this game in so many ways, I would buy a sequel on the first day. The game needs improvement, that's a given, but Obsidian have made an attempt to progress modern RPGs. They've made a game that changes based on your decisions, instead of giving you the illusion of change (ala MASS EFFECT). The characters are great, witty, very likable, and the thought of a proper spy-based RPG is something I never knew I wanted so badly until I had played ALPHA PROTOCOL.The potential in this series Obsidian have created is astounding. Of course the game didn't sell well - and for good reason; I wouldn't recommend paying full price for this game - but I would hope that Obsidian decides to give the property another shot somewhere down the line. I would only suggest that they watch CASINO ROYALE, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, and THE BOURNE IDENTITY over and over again, get back to the drawing board, and give their fans the Espionage RPG that they'd promised, but only partially delivered.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2010"}

Is it beautiful? Yes. Is it fun? Amazingly so! Is it different? Both yes, and no.Visuals and Sound:Are you tired of cartoony graphics that stress your video cards but don't really look all that good? I know I was! World of Warcraft knock offs abound these days, and I have gotten sick and tired of the same graphics every time I try a new game. I remember buying Age of Conan and being wowed by the graphics, why has it taken so long for another game to follow suit?Well the wait for amazing graphics is over! Rift's graphics are on par or better than any other MMO out there. Everything is very \"realistic\" (in quotes because it is a fantasy world). Water looks like water, spell effects are top notch, and this is all done without stressing my 2 year old computer too much.The sound quality is very rich. Yes, it can be a bit repetitive. A sword hitting a shield can only sound so many different ways. I do wish there was a bit of differention in the combat music but oh well. That is a minor gripe. Speaking of music: it is a mix of World of Warcraft and Guild Wars, depending on the area. I loved GW's music and am glad to see that someone else picked up on this style.Gameplay:If you've played an MMO recently, then you know how battles go. You hit your predefined buttons until either you or the enemy dies. What makes this game different is the range of skills you have available even very early in the game.Speaking of skills: You do not just pull from one specific class (or soul as they call it). You can use up to 3 souls at a time. Yes, the three you are using are fairly similar in purpose, but the function is completely different! By mixing the souls and purchasing their abilities how YOU choose, your characters can be very different even from someone else using the same 3 souls.You can also change \"Roles\" on the fly. These are like Talent Builds in WoW. You can use any souls that you have available on different roles. I currently have a Tank role and a DPS role on my Warrior. This makes it much easier to make sure you are playing the right character for the job.But is it \"Just another MMO\"?Game play can be divided into a few areas: Open world grinding, Open world rifts, Dungeons, PVP.PvP: This is done similar to other titles. There are battlegrounds with specific objectives. These are instanced and can either be really fast, or take a long time depending on the teams. PVP can also happen in Open World. Both reward you with points that can be spent on gear.Grinding: Unfortunately, the quest grind is pretty much here to stay. At least it is very story driven in Rift. I do think they have you running around a bit too much, but this keeps the areas fresh and interesting, so I was pretty much ok with it once I got my mount (about level 15).Rifts: This is a blast! You get another type of currency for closing Rifts and defeating \"Footholds\" in the open world. Every so often there is a major incursion which takes a large group to defeat. These are so much fun, everyone turns out to defeat the invasions from the rifts, and I always stop and close any Minor Rifts I find (it takes a small group to close a Major Rift). Footholds can easily be defeated in a couple of minutes by one person, depending on their level.Dungeons: Pretty much your standard group of 5: 1 tank, 3 dps, a healer. So far the dungeons are a little shorter than some other games, but are still challenging and offer nice rewards. Definitely worth the time and effort!Overall: I will definitely be playing this game a lot for the foreseeable future! The mix of Guild Wars, World of Warcraft, and Age of Conan is the perfect mix in my opinion. Finally, a gaming company learned from the mistakes of others and made very few of their own!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00027CXEM","reviewerName":"Vappour","summary":"A Half Great Game","reviewText":"Oh, man, here we go with the name calling already. Re reviews below:  Ray is not an \"idiot\" L.L., he just expected his game to run since Kotor I ran okay on his system, and the engine is basically the same.  I've had the opportunity to play Kotor II on the Xbox (friend's copy and console), and now I've just finished the PC version (hoping Obsidian/Lucas had learned something in the last two months).  No such luck.  The game is inexcusably buggy (even after all the feedback from the Xbox version players).  This is a serious and distracting problem throughout the game (and Lucas/Obsidian tech support is not good) -- beware!To be fair, I should note that Kotor II is a darker, more complex, more philosophical story than Kotor I.  The GAMEPLAY is somewhat better with a whole new system to build a great Jedi character (Dark or Light) and to handle combat more effectively (new Dark/Light Force powers are available along with new moves, feats and Jedi or Sith \"prestige classes\").  But the STORY, as realized, is often tedious, confusing and even puzzling (read boring) -- it often simply doesn't make sense (Like why am I doing this?).  Quests end for no apparent reason without resolution or explanation.  The ending sequences are especially bad.  Storylines begin involving NPC's in your party who you  care about, but you have no idea how they're resolved. The ending just creeps up, and then it's suddently game over (credits roll). It's almost as if they didn't get a chance to finish the last 25% of the game completely (time constraints?). This looks like a rush job for the Christmas 2004 (Xbox) shopping season which is really a shame.  With a little more development time, testing and polish, this game could have really been great.  I guess it's all about money.The new characters/party members are okay, but not quite as interesting as Kotor 1.  You do have a \"bond\" with one of the NPC's, but she's not a pretty young Jedi -- just the opposite in fact.  For those of you who enjoyed the \"romance\" and other sidequests involving party members in Kotor 1, there will be major disappointment. If you liked the random dialog (sometimes very funny) between certain NPC's in the first Kotor, forget it.  Most of the dialog in Kotor 2 seems to be pretty much scripted.  The new \"influence\" system is a nice touch if you like to talk a lot (and know how to say the right things).  If you handle things exactly right, you can even make apprentices (Jedi or Sith) out of certain party members.In a couple places the game forces you to split up your party and use party members you don't like, don't want and didn't equip (this really bothered me).  If you like combat, you can build a real \"tank\" type Jedi and mow down scores of \"enemies\" (this can get a little old after a while).  I often felt my character was actually too powerful -- even with the game setting on \"difficult\".  Remember, this time your character starts the game as a Jedi exile with some Force powers (but no light saber -- you must acquire the components and construct it).  The weapons balance (melee vs. ranged) is MUCH improved as is the ability to switch weapon types during combat.So, as I said in my Xbox review, this is a half great game.  The gameplay is great, but the story/quests/characters are not so great.  There's no way this game deserves 5 stars (except to real Star Wars fans who admit the game has problems but still give it 5 stars. Hmmm).  For more objective people, I'd give it 3-1/2 stars if I could.  It's a pretty good game.  Perhaps upcoming patches will fix the bugs; perhaps not.  I loved  Kotor I but felt kind of let down by this one.  Consider carefully before you buy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2005"}

Unfortunately, it died and I needed a new headset. My goal was to purchase the official PS3 headset[...]. Unfortunately, it was sold out everywhere UNLESS I went with the bundled Socom:Confrontation package. I'd read very mixed, mostly negative reviews, but I figured the bugs had been fixed by way of patch and it was really popular Sony exclusive, so there would be a community that would be able to help me figure it out. [...]The headset works great - in fact, it's awesome. First party peripherals rarely dissappoint and I reccomend it if you are using brand x.Socom:Confrontation is garbage. It has a lengthy patch after the lengthy download. It promptly froze the first time I booted up. And the second. Once in the main menu, you will find absolutely NOTHING in way of tutorial or explination. There are no training missions and no option to play against bots. The ONLY option is to go straight online. Not only does this suck for people new to the game, but for those who are already online, it's no fun having people jump in that are totally clueless.Once online, using my nifty new headset I said \"what's up guys, I'm new to the game, any pointers?\" I was promtly booted. Next game I wondered about, picked up five kills (lead the room in kills) and was promptly booted as soon as the next match started. These were 8 (of a possible 32) people matches. The quality of players was sketchy and I checked [...] and there were only 9500 people globally playing. Compare this to 350,000 people playing Killzone 2 at any given time or 900,000 playing 2 year old COD:MW in any week. I gave it a few hours and found the game boring and maps nearly empty. Furthermore, even an experienced gamer will get wrecked by experienced players in any given game (I pwn on Killzone, but get pwned in COD). There aren't a lot of players and on a weekend over the course of several hours, no skilled players that made me think I was outclassed.The actual nuts and bolts play isn't bad. Playing 3rd person is differnt after 1000's of hours playing in the first person, but it's okay. The graphics are last generation. I understand that this is a PSP game ported to PS3, but this is really terrible. The load out is simple enough, but in most of the matches I joined, I had equipment that was restricted and I almost always played with whatever the host wanted me to play with. The pacing is MUCh slower than COD and Killzone 2, in my opinion, too slow. After having played games that require thought AND move very fast, whipping up on the SOCOM players felt almost unfair. Again, the quality players seemed to be playing something else.When you play Killzone or see videos of COD:MW2 running, it really makes you wonder who Sony and Slant 6 thought would play this game. Graphics aren't everything, but Socom is not user friendly, it is not something you can pick up and play and offers nothing to entice new players to comeback and get better (hence the few number of people playing).

This modern approach brings with it new weapons, action and options.

Every weapon is a blast to use. Nice multiplayer levels and the addition of spec-ops is great. But.....Cons.The devs didn't include a co-op campaign which is inexcusable, especially considering their excuse. \"It didn't fit with the story.\" Give me a break, look around you on every campaign mission-youre surrounded by allied soldiers, so don't use that excuse. The fact is that they were lazy and didn't want to put in the effort. For goodness sakes, change the story to fit a co-op campaign! Don't you think it would provide much more enjoyment to play with a buddy? YES! Don't use the story as an excuse to make a game less than it should be.Spec-ops mode, while very fun, is not nearly what it should have been. What they DO have is fun, but they left out too much. None of it is original, as they had us believe before the game came out. These are just small pieces of levels already in the game that they made into spec-ops levels. They made it sound like the spec-ops levels weren't in the game and were original material--they aren't and shame on them for leading us to believe so.Also, there is no \"terorist hunt\" or similar mode. Why not take all those nice multiplayer levels and let us fight a bunch of computer controlled \"bots\" like Vegas 2? Let us play with four buddies. They have ONE level like that, which was from the campaign, but that's it! They blew a huge opportunity and I'd hoped they would have learned why Gears 2 and Vegas 2 were so successful in that regard. Apparently they don't think their game needs it. Sadly, it will probably sell plenty of copies without those extra features, and that is unfortunate that they probably won't get the message. If they'd added co-op play against bots on the multiplayer levels, this game would be worth another star, and if they'd added a co-op campaign this game would be a perfect 10. But they didn't.... as usual the devs cater to the kids that like to play multiplayer and they ignore the rest of us.UPDATE***I decided to fire up a private multiplayer game with just my buddies this weekend. Imagine my surprise when I found out that even in a private match, all the guns and other goodies are locked. So you have essentially three guns to chose from--and that's it. If you don't want to get on and level up with a bunch of people you don't know, then you may as well ignore this game. IW does not like you or want your business if you're not a multiplayer junkie, and they are working VERY hard to make that clear. I, for one, will listen and take my game back. I can't believe that a bunch of intelligent individuals could possibly do so many stupid things on accident or out of ignorance, so it must be on purpose....","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00008QOL6","description":"When it comes to first-person shooters, there are two schools of thought. One harkens back to the originalDoom--frantic action, scary monsters, big weapons, and story is given short shrift. The second school is best exemplified byHalf-Life: strong narrative, consistent real-world weapons, consistent monsters, and settings.Doom'sheirs up until now have beenQuakeandSerious Sam, but nowPainkillercomes onto the scene leaving bloody footprints, and &#x85; let the carnage begin!You play a man who dies in a pathetic car crash (he's distracted because he's holding his girl's hand) and has spent a long time in purgatory. He thinks this is unfair because, despite being well-schooled in the art of killing, he maintains that he's done nothing wrong. Heaven makes a deal with him. Take care of a little invasion problem concerning Hell, and our hero can enter those pearly gates.Weak storyline aside,Painkillerbasically amounts to a brilliant series of arcade-style levels and challenges. The settings include darkened monasteries, graveyards, a horrifying asylum, a medieval town under siege, and even H-E-Double Hockey Sticks itself. The level design is brilliant, varied, and jam-packed with enemies. There seems to be no end to the amount and variety of cool monsters to fight, and they each explode into chunks of blood and gore in a most disturbingly satisfying manner. At the end of each level is a challenge, such as collecting a certain amount of gold or killing a Boss within a time limit. Winning the challenge gives you tarot cards you can use to make the game easier. The different cards bring haste, double-damage, invulnerability, and so on. This simple mechanic makes the game far more replayable than your average shooter.The graphics are first rate, which means you need a powerful PC to run the game with all the detail settings maxed out. The only other problem is a CD-copy protection bug that makes the game unplayable for some (a patch is available).Painkillermay seem a bit silly at first glance. But the gameplay mechanics, replayability (full multiplayer is also available), variety, and brilliant level design make it one of the finest and most satisfying shooters ever made. -Andrew S.

Over a dozen hours of gameplay (on medium difficulty) , and some excellent AI. The levels are sprawling and the 'baddies' are very eclectic. A huge assortment of very intense battles with one very powerful weapon named 'The Painkiller'. This thing could slice through solid steel. And, it leaves quite a mess behind. Especially when you pull out the blade. The weapon selection is limited to , i think, 6 weapons. But, they all have a secondary fire, and that comes in quite handy. So, there's really a dozen weapons. Yes, it's a lot like what we are to expect Doom 3 to be. Much more shallow than we expect Half-life 2 to be. And, a definite stepup from Serious Sam. A blast all the way through ,if you're someone who believes that a shooter should be just that. Only a shooter. No side-missions that have you running around doing RPG stuff.

I mean, the original Secret of Mana for the SNES is one of my favorite all-time games. It was an action RPG, good story and plot. So, when a sequel was slated for the GameBoy, I had to get it.Well, I had to get it a couple of years after it was released. Shh. Details.Anywho, I must say, I have never had so much aggravation and pain from playing a game. The AI is horrible, repeat, HORRIBLE! The story is convoluted, and the gameplay just downright frustrating. I almost regret the $20 I spent on the cartridge.GameplayI am going to get the worst part of this out of the way. The gameplay flat-out stinks. You start the game by choosing either to play as the Hero or the Heroine. The basic difference in these two is one is better at physical attacks, and the heroine is better with Mana (magic). Depending upon who you choose, the game will play differently. I chose the heroine.You start out (as the heroine) in a village, talking to your mother as you prepare to leave on a quest with some strange swordsman as a bodyguard. The village is attacked by soldiers that work for the Dark Lord. You escape, your village is slaughtered. You are taken to a manor by the mysterious soldier, where you meet the Hero. The manor is attacked, you escape again, and the Hero promises to protect you. He falls down, you run away, he is captured and beaten by soldiers.Fast forward, you wake up in bed after a nightmare recalling all this. The soldier is by your side, and you learn that you have been living with him in hiding since your escape. The story takes off from there. The Dark Lord now controls the land, he is evil, you must avenge your people, yadda, yadda.Oh yea, there is a mysterious sword called, get this, the Sword of Mana. And a goddess that turned herself into a tree to protect the people of the world. You worship this Mana goddess, because you are of the Mana tribe. It seems that you are the last of them.You now know as much as I do, and I have played the game. The plot is that horrible. You meet townspeople that tell you pointless stories or offer side quests that make no sense. While the story itself is a bit linear (run to next obstacle, defeat boss, possibly get an item for someone, etc.), you will often find yourself wandering a map trying to figure out where to go.Since save spots are few and far between, and healing in this game is a pain (either through the start menu, or using the appropriate Mana spirit, controlled through the right shoulder button on the GBA), you will find \"Your strength is depleted\" (i.e.; you die) happens at the worst possible time, with little warning. You then have to reset to your last save. Early in the game, this is horrible. The first cave you must travel, as the Heroine, has an enemy layout that killed me 5 times before I developed a strategy to get past the monsters.Bosses vary in the game from easy to insanely difficult. One boss in particular was on a spinning platform, and you could only hit him when he landed. However, given your level, your weapons only do like 1-2 points of damage per hit, and he has over 400 hit points. It took me 45 minutes to kill this guy. Needless to say, he hits a LOT harder than 1-2 points of damage. AND he inflicts status effects like blindness, so you may not even hit him at all.The next boss died within 2 minutes. Literally. I just ran and whacked.AI has to be the worst I have ever seen. During the course of the game, you will be partnered with various people. The battles in the game are real-time, and as long as your character is in a battle \"mode\", you can switch between who you are actively controlling by using the \"Select\" button. However, if your main character dies, you will have to start over from your last save. If you are controlling the main character and your partner dies, you can resurrect them. It is a bit unfair.The AI, though, even after I figured it out, stinks. There is a grid, with zones. You can either set your character to be aggressive or timid, use more magic or physical attacks. You position their icon within the grid to choose which attack style you would prefer. You have to manually do this for each new partner, otherwise, they will just stand there while you get yourself killed.Then, even if you do get the AI set to where they will attack, they will attack using a method that may do no damage. If they are better with Mana, they will drain their mana casting at a monster, even if it is doing 0 damage, then move in to attack with melee. Also, they get \"stuck\" on a map, and can't or won't follow you up a jump, across an area, etc. Once you kill all the monsters on a map, they will \"teleport\" to you, but that does little to help you if the monsters are ganking you.In terms of attacking and the like, it is standard RPG fare. As aformentioned, battles are realtime. You have to select the appropriate weapon/spirit to attack each type of monster. One monster may take a lot of damage from the Bow, however, another may take zero from the Bow but lots from a specific type of magic. It is up to you to cycle through each and attack appropriately.Towns are small, with standards like Inns, save points, general stores, and blacksmiths. Weapons can only be upgraded if you have special vegetables or fruits. Which you can grow with seeds that you collect in your \"Hot House\". Weapons can be reinforced with different materials that you find. So in short, you need to find materials to reinforce your weapon and vegetables to assign attributes.Lastly, levelling and the like is a bit confusing. You can choose a level in a class, and depending upon which you choose, you will gain in different attributes. You can choose to level any class at any time. However, your main class is fixed. So while you may decide to take a few points in say \"Warrior\", if you have the bulk of your points in \"Sage\", your main class will be like that of a Cleric. None of this is satisfactorily explained by the game.ControlsThe game controls, to their credit, are good. They respond well, and I have never had a situation where I was pressing the \"A\" button and felt the system didn't register the attack.Controls, for the Heroine, are as follows:Left Shoulder Button: JumpLeft Shoulder Button + A: MeditateRight Shoulder Button tap: Stat/heal boostRight Shoulder Button hold: Attack w/ spirit assignedA Button: Attack/ Select a menu optionB Button: Hold down to run/ Exit a menuSelect: Switch active character in battleStart: MenuFor fighting, you simply have to mash the A button or use magic. There really isn't much strategy in that regard. Menus are complex, though, and there is no way to quickly assign a hotkey. So, for instance, if you want to change which kind of magic, you have to scroll through menus, find the new spirit, set it, back out of the menus, then use the right shoulder button. It is just as complicated to change weapon types.Movement is like a standard GameBoy title. Not much to say there.Graphics and SoundGraphics are reminiscent of another GameBoy title, Golden Sun. The graphics are sprites, and the backgrounds are detailed and colorful. Particle effects are not really pretty. Your character is nice to look at, and menu pictures are clear, if not really detailed.Sound is standard GameBoy fare. 8-bit sounding and nothing overly special. I play with the sound off. There are different sounds for different game areas, but for the most part, you will be disgusted.There is no voiceacting. All conversations are based on text, and some story choices are text-based.Final SayThis title is cutesy, but the story doesn't make much sense. The gameplay is frustratingly unbalanced, the menus are too time consuming, and when it is all said and done, it seems like Square tried to throw so many silly side quests that serve no purpose into the title that the game borders on ridiculous. In the end, while it is a way to kill time, I wouldn't recommend this title to anyone, even the diehard fans. Save your money, and buy one of the many better GameBoy RPG titles out there, even something as text-heavy as Golden Sun. At least that one makes more sense.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2013"}

Just Not on the Overlooked GameCube...","reviewText":"The quick summary of Symphonia is that you'll play the role of Lloyd Irving, a teenaged boy with a cloudy past, who stumbles (along with several friends, naturally) into the adventure of a lifetime, culminating in the rescue of not one, but two endangered worlds. It seems that Lloyd's lifelong friend, Colette, is at the center of a once-every-generation pilgrimage that leads to the mysterious salvation of the world, and that everyone but Lloyd realizes that this journey will not end well for Colette. Basically, it's the plot of Final Fantasy X with more of a homogenized, Saturday morning cartoon flair, and less hideous flying monsters named \"Sin.\" I had a really hard time enjoying the progression of the story, as not only was the writing a bit suspect and the characters largely unlikable, but the pacing was jerky and off-putting. After a handful of hours of treading water and building toward an ongoing climax, just as things would begin to get interesting, the story would slam on the brakes and go right back to treading water again. If the writing was feeling particularly exotic, maybe you'd gain or lose a party member in the process.Perhaps most accountable for the slow death of the story was the inclusion of far, far too much unnecessary dialog, without any sort of payoff to validate its existence. This is a game that would have benefitted tremendously had it been basically halved in length. The plot isn't without its intricacies and shining moments, but they're so few and far between that they lose a lot of their impact amid the tedious, back and forth discussions and repeatedly dull, fetch-and-return styled missions. Conversations almost always go on well beyond the point of good reason, even in key situations. It's understandable to have a silly, one-sided conversation with an unimportant character on the outskirts of a city somewhere... such dialog is the bread and butter of RPGs as a whole. Where such meanderings are less acceptable and more damaging, however, are in the key scenes after crucial battles or big plot twists.About two thirds of the conversations in Symphonia are delivered via written text, while the more important chats are spoken by a cast of voice actors... it's a fairly good way to indicate to the player that they need to pay special attention to what's going on, because what's being discussed is going to affect the way the game plays out from that point forward. Yet even these spoken scenes are usually marred by poor writing and unnecessary asides that only serve to elongate the experience. I spent fifty two hours shoveling through about twenty hours' worth of really interesting material.Assuming you can look past the majority of the story, however, the actual practice of playing the game is an extremely enjoyable ride, with plenty of innovation to go alongside the more universally applied elements. All fights occur in real-time, and more resemble a limited Final Fight-style beat-em-up than a standard, turn-based RPG. You're limited to four party members in the field at one time, and will be routinely facing off with as many as six enemies at once. At first glance, the system looks to be nothing more than button mashing and a little luck, but as you become more familiar with your special attacks, working in conjunction with your teammates and shifting your strategy to fit each battle, the actual depth and flexibility of the system becomes much more evident. To tell the truth, I was far from a fan of this battle system until roughly the ten hour mark, when that tiny switch flicked in the back of my brain and I finally understood the intricacies of a fight in the world of Symphonia. The in-game instructions aren't exactly helpful in explaining the full potential of its own mechanics, which leaves you to sort things out on your own... and actually, I preferred it that way. It's much more rewarding when you develop a particularly successful strategy and apply it than it would have been, had you merely followed instructions and begun to paint by number.The controller setup works well with the way the battle system functions, and never gets in the way, even when things are at their most frenzied. Successfully using the GameCube's controller is usually just a matter of how effectively the \"A\" button is mapped, since it's basically the sole point of focus on the hardware, with every other button and even the analog stick playing a secondary role. Fortunately, Symphonia handles the button in question admirably. In a battle, it's your driving force, working in conjunction with the direction you happen to be pressing on the analog stick to begin one of your basic attacks. While enduring one of the game's lengthy speaking segments, it both increases the speed at which the text appears and acknowledges that you've finished reading that passage and are now physically and emotionally prepared to enjoy the next sentence fragment. It's the only button you absolutely, positively have to have. The rest of the buttons are laid out, basically, declining in button size as they also decline in order of importance. The \"B\" button activates both your special attacks and your magic, depending on the type of character you're controlling. The \"Y\" button brings up whichever menu is appropriate at the moment, the trigger buttons momentarily pause the action while you choose a primary target, and the tiny \"Z\" button initiates incidental conversations at seemingly random points around the map. Because if there's one thing this game needed, it was more incidental conversation.One area in which the controls run into a snag is in the world map, where roaming around the land can quickly become a headache-inducing experience. The camera angles chosen for this view are typically an overhead perspective, following the player from behind and perhaps zoomed in just a little bit too close for comfort. Should the camera nudge anything above ground level, such as a cliff or small building, however, it'll shift to a godawful view, directly over your party. It'll also kindly zoom in beyond the point of any comprehension, so that you're basically seeing your lead character's scalp and a few feet in either direction around him. Naturally, this makes navigating the map extremely difficult, and usually requires some maneuvering to get back into something resembling a workable view. Inside dungeons and during battle, no such issues are evident.The visuals are one area in which this title really excels. Although most characters are rendered via cel shading, which is a technique I'm starting to see overused more and more, they never look forced or unnatural. Set against the beautiful, painterly appearance of the entirety of the game's backdrops and surrounding textures, the shading gives the impression of a big budget, animated motion picture. It's a truly lovely combination, and gives the title a style and look all its own. The character designs are provided by Kosuke Fukishima, well known for his work with the \"Oh My Goddess!\" and \"You're Under Arrest\" animated series, and is truly a shining point for the title. The world is filled with a unique visual flair, which is both represented and enhanced by the characters' appearances and their choice in clothing (aside from Lloyd, who wears a jacket that he may as well have lifted from Vash the Stampede himself). The enemies are universally outstanding, and rarely fall to the RPG trend of merely recoloring a design and unleashing it as an entirely different villain. My only real complaint lies with the notable lack of cutscenes during dramatic moments, and that's more a personal preference than anything else. From start to finish, there are three animated cutscenes in this title, and none run for longer than a minute and a half. That makes the giant shot of just such a scene right on the back of the case a bit misleading, and there were surely some moments that would have benefitted tremendously from a little additional visual flair. Instead, 99% of the game is live-rendered, and while this is an example of one of the GameCube's better looking titles, I really would've preferred to see a little bit more than cel shaded polygons after a big fight from time to time.The audio has its ups and its downs, honestly. Some of the voice acting is really top notch, such as the brooding, secretive speech of Kratos and the unintentionally snooty tone of Raine, but for every character with a quality voice, there exist two or three that are absolutely wretched. Most of the summon monsters have irritating voices, and the leading duo of Lloyd and Colette are so super-nice and cheery, I want to take after them with a rusty butcher knife and a bag of salt. The music, as well, goes beyond the point of no return with the inspiration gathered from colorful nature of the graphics, and is almost entirely forgettable. If I weren't such a stickler for listening to every last moment of spoken dialog in a game, I'd have more than likely played this from start to finish with the television muted and my iPod providing the audio input.Simply, if you're a GameCube owner and you're jonesin' for an RPG, this will fill your need adequately. The battle system is outstanding, if you've got the patience to figure it out via trial and error, and the visuals are worth a look or two, because they use the Cube's hardware fairly well. If you're also the owner of a PS2 and / or an Xbox, I've got to say there are far better titles out there in the genre. The story stinks, the characters need some serious work, and there is a LOT. OF. NEEDLESS. CONVERSATION. I'd call the entire package above average, but it's not really anything I'm going to recommend my friends go out of their way to try out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2006"}

I've never gone for these personally because the value is just not there, but Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection has totally bucked the trend by delivering 40 Genesis games, many of them classic and highly regarded titles, and a host of other features for just $20. This is something that you need to own if you consider yourself a retro gamer of any description.I never owned a Genesis back in the day (I was a Nintendo boy all the way back then), so this is my first time playing the majority of the games in the collection. All of the Sonic the Hedgehog games are included, even the classic Sonic & Knuckles and the less-than-classic Sonic Spinball. Mixed in with the landmark franchise titles are several of the best games the Genesis ever saw, including Streets of Rage, Altered Beast, Golden Axe, Shining Force and the excellent Phantasy Star series. Mixed in with these titles are some lesser-known games like Fatal Labyrinth, Beyond Oasis, Ristar and the stylish Comix Zone. The only real disappointment is the first two Shinobi games are not included (only Shinobi III) and the classic titles that were cross-platform with the SNES are also not here. But you are getting an excellent collection of Genesis exclusives that will keep you busy for hours, so it's easy to forgive the omissions.Also included in the game is a lot of unlockables, including video interviews with the game designers and other goodies, as well as arcade games like Zaxxon that completely floored me. Zaxxon was my favorite arcade game as well as the reason I had a Colecovison back in the 80's, so my nostalgia meter was definitely kicked into overdrive. The last thing I'll touch upon is the benefits of this game for achievement hunters. Several of the games support achievements and the majority of them are easy to obtain, such as 45 points for reaching level 11 in Vectorman 2, something you can do by entering a cheat code to get there instantly. Other games have simple objectives, such as survive a level without dying or reaching a certain number of points within a limited period of time. If achievements are your thing, this game is definitely worth picking up (not that the games aren't incentive enough).Many of you reading this will belong to two different camps: those who experienced the Genesis back in the day and those who are too young but are curious about retro gaming. To both, this collection is an easy recommendation. These games come from a time when story, challenge and sheer fun were the main draw of a game, so don't let the primitive graphics and lack of modern tweaks discourage you. This collection is, simply put, a must-have.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

Well its pretty difficult. I have had to think long and hard about how to go about doing this review, because while there's a lot about this game that I like, there's also a lot that could have been better. First of all, I would like to comment on the games rating. I saw nothing in this game that would make it worthy of an M-rating. While there is some suggestive content, the \"nudity\" in the game doesn't show anything worth getting in a huff about, as its all shaded to the point where you can't see anything, although some of the outfits are suggestive I do think that the game is not in appropriate enough to warrant its M-Rating. With that in mind one could think that they could have and should have done more with the game since it ended up rated M anyway. They could have gone the full mile, but stopped half way, so to speak. This game should have been rated T.The game has a lot going for it, but unfortunately falls short on many levels. While the shopping elements of the game are surprisingly addictive, and my desire to see what each girl looks like in every bikini I can get her into keeps me playing I am very disappointed with the main element of the game, fast and furious volleyball. While it is possible to adjust the button sensitivity I have a problem with the analogue buttons. Initially I found myself having to hit the button so hard my thumb was getting sore, when I adjusted it I found that I still have the same problem, only now its actually harder to hit the ball softly, which in turn causes me to loose the games... just less often, since the computer opponents tend to crowd the next and take turns spiking the ball... it makes it easier for me to counter spike clear past them. But if they are far away from the net now its harder to just lightly tap the ball so it drops over the net just barely out of reach. Had I been developing the Xbox controller I don't think I would have gone with analogue buttons to begin with, because there are people like me who are soft tapers, who just don't have much grip power, and that puts us at a disadvantage in games like this where pressure sensitivity is so critical. With that said I would have liked to have seen the button set up done differently... perhaps, B-pass the ball, A-hit the ball hard, and X- hit the ball softly sort of thing, but that's not something everyone will agree with. Most critics liked the button set up for the game, and there is a pool hopping game designed to help you get used to the analogue sensitivity... which I'm surprisingly good at, but only because I can see a head of time how hard I have to hit the button.Then there's shopping, for your girl, and buying gifts for the other girls as well. Part of the enjoyment in this is the ability to dress your girl(s) up in a variety of bikinis and accessories, and then view them posing briefly... this mode could have been better. Camera controls in this mode are very limited, and even work against you in many cases. It would have also been nice to have the games story mode fleshed out a little more. While we do get to know a little about the girls, like Kasumi is very shy, and very few people like her, and Ayanai (the purple haired one) is a moody brat... and nobody likes her, we don't get to know anything deep and personal... like why nobody seems to like Kasumi, especially when she's so shy its cute. Then again the lack of a substantive back-story has been a deep flaw of the Dead or Alive series for a long time. Motives, and history for the girls seem vague, at best. If I could change one thing about this series it would be adding more story, because the potential to have a long lasting comic book caliber saga is there, but Tecmo's Team Ninja has yet to do anything to develop these characters beyond some basic likes and dislikes. Although this is the first game to give us a little glimpse into the girl's personalities... just not a very deep one. Anything we learn about the girls is very basic. I'd like more. In fact that's my sentiments about this game, I just want more of it. Its fun, but the flaws should be worked out should they do this again, and since the game got an M-Rating anyway they may as well not hold back next time, although I did buy this game because they did show an amazing amount of restraint for an M-Rated title... there isn't even any swearing!The game also includes the ability to choose from a selection of soundtracks on the game, or you can also pick songs from your hard drive, which comes in handy... except that no matter what you do you'll soon find your selections looping way too soon, and it has the potential to play your favorite songs to death... I'm already sick of Mandy Moore's \"Only Hope\" thanks to this feature... needles to say I have greatly expanded my song library on the Xbox hard drive hoping that it will slow the looping cycle down. I've also found that some songs work better than others for this game. Movie scores don't work. However I recommend Darren Hayes \"Insatiable\", Jennifer Love Hewitt&#65533;s \"Bare naked\", and Paula Abdul's \"Crazy cool\" and \"Sexy Thoughts\". Surprisingly these songs work very well with the over all game, but are not a natural part of the sound track and will need to be brought in via the Xbox hard drive.Over all this game is pretty cool, but it could have been much better. I am hoping for a sequel, however. With a little polish this could be one heck of a sports title.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2003"}

If it's anything like the Brotherhood multiplayer I'm in trouble cause I was addicted to it like crack! :) Especially the Wanted mode.First off I'm a huge fan of the series starting with Ezio's journey in AC II. Ezio D'Auditore is probably the best developed character in games right now and in AC Brotherhood you saw him come into his own as an Assassin. In Revelations he has aged into a wise Master Assassin who's barely lost a step.The game was a little slow to start but once you got into the groove it was fascinating and fun. The addition of the hook blade brought enough change to getting around and fighting without messing with the overall fight mechanics, which are outstanding. Traversing Constaninople was a breeze while rooftop free running and using zip lines to speed things up. It doesn't get any better than doing an air assassination off a zip line!Pros:Graphics: The graphics are top notch as always and you will enjoy climbing towers just to see the sights below.Combat:  The addition of the hook blade was very well done and adds a different dimension to combat and getting around. You can now craft different types of bombs to use in different situations or just to have fun with. Nice addition! I especially liked the poison bomb that had everyone within the blast area flailing away like crazy before they dropped.Story:  Seeing Ezio as an older Master Assassin still doing his thing, getting more insight into Altaire's life, while also  continuing Desmond's journey is enough to keep you wanting to see what happens next, just like a good book.If you're a history buff the story while fictional includes historic figures which you can learn more about in the database. Ubisoft goes through great pains to make sure the locales and landmarks are portrayed accurately. I actually enjoy going through the database and learning about the real people, places and things in the time period. Who new you could learn some history from a video game?Cons:  Just some minor ones which can be avoided if you like.Side Quests:  Some are fun some are filler. Most are optional. You can go back and do them after the story mode.Den Defense mini game: You may like them. I didn't care for them. I played the first one which is unavoidable and didn't feel it fit well. You can avoid them by not letting your notoriety meter fill by bribing heralds and the like.Bottom Line:A great addition to the epic franchise that won't let you down. Dinged it one star because it was a tad shorter campaign than I expected and I didn't care for some of the filler.As a bonus you get the first AC for free which I haven't played yet. At 40 bucks plus a free game it's a steal. Looking forward to AC III!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00009WAUH","description":"As renowned as theFinal Fantasyseries has become over the years, the release ofCrystal Chroniclesbrings with it an air of unfamiliarity. Although many of its elements tie into the greaterFinal Fantasyuniverse, this is but a faint echo of what you have come to know and love.While it can be argued that this is a new direction for the series, and therefore shouldn't be put on the same level as the other games, fans have come to expect the best fromFinal Fantasy, and with each passing release, Square has delivered.Crystal Chroniclesmay break new ground, but it lacks the creativity and passion of its role-playing brethren.As stylish as the character designs may be, they are completely void of personality. The story is just as ambiguous. Never once did I feel attached to my character, nor did I care what twists or turns the plot would make. TheFinal Fantasygames are renowned for storytelling, but it seems like an afterthought inCrystal Chronicles. Cinematic flair is also noticeably&nbsp;absent.The gameplay is just as careless and jagged. While the quest can be played single-player, it's meant to be tackled by a group of people (preferably four). Since each player utilizes menu screens often, Square and Game Designer's Studio decided that you could only play multiplayer with a Game Boy Advance attached to the GameCube. Hence, all menu management is done on the GBA screen, and the action on the TV is unaffected. In theory, this is a just solution. As it turns out, though, I found it to be more detrimental to the quest than anything.When a player accesses the GBA, their character on the TV cannot be controlled. Not only does this leave them open to attack, it more or less halts any progress that the group can make. So basically, you still find yourself sitting around waiting for your buddy to make preparations, but instead, you're doing it with a controller that has fewer buttons and dying batteries.To make matters worse, players must also keep an eye on a bucket. To prevent characters from scattering and trying to run in different directions, the bucket emits a field of energy that covers roughly 80 percent of the screen. If you go outside of this barrier, you'll take damage. So you basically must stay huddled together as one person carries the bucket throughout a stage. Without question, this is one of the stupidest ideas in the history of video games.When it comes to the basics of gameplay, the combat is respectable, but by no means great. I really like the timing-based combo system that accompanies both magic and general hack n' slash, yet I absolutely despise losing all of my magic with each new area that I enter. Hence, classes are not defined, and you never really get the impression that your character is growing in power.There's little here that truly excites.Crystal Chroniclesplays like an experiment gone awry, and is unfit to bear the sacrosanctFinal Fantasyname.Concept:A hack n' slash with inventive, yet highly aggravating GBA-based multiplayer connectivity, and a worthless bucketGraphics:Stylish character designs, gorgeous particle effects, and awesome boss designsSound:Not the familiarFinal Fantasymelodies, but memorable nonethelessPlayability:Steers away from button mashing with timing-based chains, manual spell aiming, and multi-person combosEntertainment:A cookie cutter adventure with a lackluster story, poor character growth, and frustrating playReplay:Moderately HighRated:7 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Crystal Chroniclesis here to remind us that every so often, Square Enix actually puts out an average game. It seems like for every thingFF: CCdoes right, it does two things wrong. Combining spells with your teammates is awesome, but half the time it's less effective than two individual castings, and you lose all of your magic between areas. The effects and character models are cool, but downtimes really drag and many cutscenes look awfully similar. The worst part, though, is that character advancement is the slowest I've ever seen. Beat a boss and get your choice of +1 to one of your stats! Thrilling. There is certainly some enjoyment to be had here, but it's sprinkled somewhat thinly among all of the lame and boring parts. On a console with a lot of great four-player titles,Crystal Chroniclesdoes very little to distinguish itself.Rated:7 out of 10Editor:Adam BiessenerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"elton dan","summary":"a long way","reviewText":"final fantasy has gone a long way with there extremely detailed games, but unfortunatley there running out of ideas.  these new games are NOT true to the final fantasy series that we once knew.  final fantasy 3(my favorite game) was by far the best one but these new FF games are just repititive but still fun, dont get me wrong. if you never played FF you will love this game. there great.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2004"}

For all people with Xbox live that have the demo they really make it fun with killing druids, riding the druid plow, and doing an earthquake thing to make the building fall. This game is more like go to where you need to doing 1st missions and 2nd missions. The first go with the storyline and take you to the next level. Second missions appear on your map with at least 10 or less on there. You go there on \"The Druid Plow\" and just do some easy and small missions. Some parts in this game are strategy which really suprised me. If you saw the video at the end of the demo you'll see Eddie(the main character)with wings. On certain levels you get wings to fly over a battleground. You create Headbangers and all sorts of metal things to help you out. You send them over the battlefield and try to take out the enemys metal character creators which are called merchandise stores which you play a guitar solo than choose your Headbangers or Motorcycles Guys or Whatever, but the point is that it reminds me of Halo Wars except you can drop down and help your guys but Eddie dies quickly so you have to hit a little than fly back up. You do this numerous times. Sometimes it pisses me off because I hate strategy and having to send men places and all that. This game is fun but people that played the deoms reading this review the demo is not even close to the game you don't even fight the druids after that level so yeah. So people buy it if you want but you might want to think it over and watch gameplay videos on google videos or youtube.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2009"}

I have bought all (COD1+UO on PC onwards) day one, most of my gameplay was on PC then I moved to 360 about the time COD4 came out.2. I played this via Steam on the free weekend, so I did NOT buy this product.I played for just under 3 hours, multiplayer only. Boy, I hate to say it, but this might be the worst COD since COD3. I enjoyed MW2 much more than this. Treyarch has really put a standard on this series since Black Ops 1 and 2. I find that IW is just reaching to far off the podium to obtain something they can't reach. The customizing menus are great in Ghosts, the level design is hit or miss, some maps are too big, some are too small, the gameplay is just off compared to Black Ops 2. The biggest reason why this is 2/5 is because how bad the PC port is. Terrible graphics, glitchy gameplay, and horrible use of PC performance.It's sad that Activision has hired another lead developer to take on the COD series (Sledgehammer). So not only will we still be getting COD's every year, Treyarch isn't releasing one until 2015.After playing all of the COD's all these years, and having a combined ~800 hours with BC2/BF3/BF4 multiplayer, I honestly cannot wait for Titanfall.

Know you his name?&#x201D; Scrawling his name onto the next blank page, Luso unwittingly begins the first chapter of an adventure all his own.","reviewerName":"JoeAZ92","summary":"A great, huge game that's just a little annoying","reviewText":"Positive:+ you'll never run out of things to do+ story is nice+ very addictive+ lots of new jobs and abilities+ both screens are used for maximum convenience+ new law system is great, but...Negative:- actual laws range from ridiculous to mind-numbingly stupid- other little annoyances here and there that hurt the experience a bit- the graphics aren't completely upgraded from the GBA- no multiplayerFinal Fantasy Tactics Advance (FFTA) was the defining game for the GBA. Whether you liked it or not, it showed us just how much could fit onto one of those little game cartridges. We've waited four and a half years to get our hands on a sequel, and we FFTA lovers had every right to have sky high expectations for this game. It's not all it could have been considering how great its predecessor was, but it's still a great, addicting game nonetheless.Grimoire of the Rift's story is fine but not as great as in FFTA. The new main character, Luso Clemens, is really likable and his personality and dialogue make him a memorable and worthy main character. The supporting cast isn't half bad either, with other fun characters like Cid, Adelle, and Vaan that make the story better. The story is similar to FFTA: Luso gets transported into the world of Ivalice by accident through a magic book and he sets out on an adventure to figure out how to get back home. Thankfully he meets some good friends to help him on the way and he gets used to the new world pretty well right off the bat. As he goes along his adventure, he discovers that his journal, magically filling in its own pages telling of what he's done, is his ticket home. When it's filled, he'll return. But near the end of the game, a deeper plot to destroy Ivalice is discovered and this ends up being linked with Luso's way home. It turns out to be pretty good in the long run, but you don't even know what the 'Grimoire of the Rift' (you know, the thing the game is named after) is until about 5 missions before the story's ending.FFTA's premise is simple: you pay a fee to take on a mission, you move around on the big map to get to where you need to go, you fight, you clear the mission. Repeat 400 times (for you completion obessessors). The battles are where a lot of your time will be spent (for obvious reasons) and is where the gameplay occurs (for other obvious reasons). The grid is viewed from a kind of slanted bird's eye angle, which is neat until you can't see behind a couple units blocking the space behind them, then it's kind of annoying sometimes. You move your guys around in turn-based strategy fashion, beat up the other guys until you defeat your mark or all enemies on screen, and that's it. The battles are hugely enhanced by the vastness of the jobs your characters can take on and the abilities they can learn to be more efficient in battle.The main thing about FFTA2 is also what makes it live up to its $40 pricetag: it's absolutely huge. With 400 missions to clear and tons of jobs and abilities for your characters to master along with a load of stuff on the side, the game is bigger than what most developers bother to put into one DS game card. If you play until you beat everything, you will have spent well over 100 hours of your life, congrats.However, not all of your time will be spent in battle. In fact, a large amount of your time with the game will be spent on outside strategies such as figuring out what job to have your character work with, which abilities they'll be learning, and going to the shop. The shop is greatly enhanced by adding a 'bazaar' in which you can exchange three pieces of loot for new weapons, suits of armor, shields, and all that good stuff. You'll definitely be going to the bazaar freqnently to see if your new loot can make you a new item, and it's a nice addition to the game.The main reason FFTA2 is annoying is because of the laws. In every battle, your nifty little judge will protect your characters from actually dying so long as you obey one single law. This law can restrict you from using a certain type of weapon or magick (it's spelled with a 'k' at the end in the game, kind of strange...), but it can also restrict you from getting stolen from, dealing more than a set amount of damage, performing actions with a certain type of unit, moving more or less than an exact number of spaces... the list of stupid laws like these just goes on and on, and you'll find that about 50% or more of your battles will be riddled with frustration because of these kinds of laws that either make you feel like you shouldn't be playing to your best abilities or that you should just throw the DS into the wall across the room. I can guarantee you will turn your DS off on impulse and come back to it later several times before you're through with this game, it gets that annoying sometimes.Thankfully, breaking a law doesn't get you a stat reduction or a ticket to the local jail. Instead, you can't revive KO'd units, you lose your law bonuses at the end of the battle (items and loot given you for keeping the law), and you also lose your clan priveledge. At the beginning of each battle, you select a Clan Priveledge that allows you to move farther, attack with increased power, regenerate HP every turn, or other nifty little things like that. It's a really cool feature, but it's really damaged by the fact that you'll be breaking the law in about half of your battles because you either don't care or can't do anything about it. This is the main thing that will make people not want to continue playing the game, but if you can look past this you'll have a great time.FFTA2's graphics are both updated and not updated at the same time. The maps look no different than they did back in the GBA days, and neither do the character sprites. However, the attack animations have recieved a true DS upgrade, and there are a few that look pretty stunning but otherwise they look just fine. Overall, the visuals aren't up to par with the DS's standards but they don't look bad.The sound here is nothing too great. The music is pretty good and fits the game pretty well, and tunes from the GBA game make a return occasionally which makes it cool for people who played that game. The sound effects are ok, not annoying but not particularly cool. But whenever a mission is finished, you hear some random kids screaming \"Yay!\" or \"Aww!\". This is annoying sometimes and definitely could have been done without.Working with the DS's unique layout has done much good for the game. Both screens are used for your maximum convenience, and things that bugged you in the GBA game can't bug you any more, because rather than going back to your characters' abilities to see if they've mastered something, it'll tell you if you've mastered it on the top screen as you're scrolling through weapons, making equipping much more convenient. In battle, the bottom screen shows the grid and the action while you can look to the top screen any time to check the law, clan priveledge, and who will get the next moves. Both these uses of the top screen are great and make you feel like the whole thing is much better. There are also touch controls to use at any time, on the map, menus, or in battle. However, you'll likely stick to the regular controls because the touch control isn't worth the hassle.The big hit against FFTA2 is the lack of multiplayer. I was thoroughly disappointed at this. Come on, this game is BUILT for multiplayer and online! Trading items and characters and helping your friends do better in the game and battling and all that stuff would have been awesome! They had it in the GBA game when you needed a stupid link cable, and now that it's on the DS with wireless and online they cut it!?! Why? It's perfect for the game and the system and takes away a lot from us, and it would have pushed it above and beyond into being a much better game, but nope. And I don't count getting a raffle ticket after connecting to another DS and exchanging it for an item I already have multiplayer, by the way.Overall, FFTA2 is a sequel that isn't as good as its predecessor, but it's still a great game. You'll be addicted from start to whenever you feel like getting on with your life, and you'll most likely never finish it. Being such a huge game, it's well worth your $40, but you do need patience. If you can take time to look past the annoyances it brings and stop lamenting the lack of multiplayer, Grimoire of the Rift will be a rewarding game that you'll undoubtedly enjoy and play for a very, very long time.Gameplay: 8.0Graphics: 7.0Sound: 7.0Value: 10FINAL SCORE: 8.2/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2008"}

Why? Well for one if you have ever had the dream of wanting to actually play a Pixar movie this is as close as you're going to get. The graphics are nothing short of amazing and truly shows off the real potential of what the PS3 is capable of producing. If you have an HDTV set that can handle 720p or higher you are in for a real treat as your TV is going to be bursting with smooth frame rates, tons of characters on screen and loads of beautiful colors.

The game has a pace to keep even the most hardcore gamer on their toes moving faster then a Lombax with his tail on fire it just keeps the adrenaline junky satisfied. You will not get bored playing this game.Humor wise this is one of those rare games will you be laughing out loud to. This is like I stated above playing a Pixar movie. Not only for the graphics but the actual content of voice acting and story line. It's just fun all the way around.One thing I wanted to point out that had me smiling from ear to ear was the sound. WOW! If you have a 7.1 system  you will be blown away by the uncompressed 7.1 PCM that this game delivers. This is what your home theater system was bought for and it really shines in this game. Totally immersing and very impressive down to the last bolt pinging across the room in glorious 7.1!In closing this is without a doubt a must have game. This is the type of game that can and will sell systems.

It looks like greatness may have to wait a little longer though because &#8220;Killzone Shadow Fall&#8221; definitely isn&#8217;t it.Now don&#8217;t get me wrong.  If drop dead gorgeous, but painfully generic first person shooters with aggravating and pointless free fall/flying sections are your thing, and you love games that are hollow, shallow and soul-less to their very core-plus you are completely opposed to anything that even resembles action in your first person shooter then you are in for a monster treat here.For fans of the Killzone Series however, outside of a few cut scenes there&#8217;s really not much here that immerses you into the rich universe that is Killzone.  There&#8217;s no longer a sense of being a star player or a hero in an epic war raging between races.  There&#8217;s no sense of urgency or feeling that you are immersed in an epic battle to save mankind.  Honestly there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much of any kind of threat here at all when it comes down to it.  There&#8217;s lots of walking around though.  Lots of walking around.  See that waterfall over there?  Yep.  You get to walk over to it.  See that scientist?  Yep.  Instead of shooting and blowing things up (who wants to do that?), you get to walk with her for a while.  You also get to experience the joys of meandering aimlessly through large and completely barren terrains not having a clue where you are going because your direction indicator doesn&#8217;t work half the time, just hoping you finally stumble onto your next objective before you throw your controller and say &#8220;screw it, this game sucks&#8221;.  There&#8217;s also a bit of walking in the dark.  I especially enjoyed these areas of the game where it was so dark on the screen I could barely see anything at all.  The walking experiences I had there were particularly memorable.  I can honestly say that I have never experienced a game quite like Killzone Shadowfall where so much loving devotion was given to recreating (to the last detail) the entire experience of being a pedestrian.So if you like trekking through large empty spaces completely alone and desperately searching for an enemy (or even TWO!) that you can finally kill, and you can&#8217;t stand too much action in your first person shooters-Killzone Shadow fall is your launch game of choice this holiday season.For the rest of you odd ball types who actually want some action and intrigue in your first person shooters, do yourself a HUGE favor and skip this piece of Hellghast spawned dog s*** and pick up the Killzone collection for PS3 instead.  Even KZ1-dated as is it is still an enormously more fun game to play than Shadowfall.If Guerilla games wants to take the Killzone series in this new direction for PS4 this generation-that&#8217;s fine.  Count me out though.  Call me crazy, but I still like to have &#8220;fun&#8221; when I play videogames, not just look at pretty eye candy as I&#8217;m traipsing along the countryside with no one around and nothing at all to do.  Oh, I forgot-the inclusion of the new OWL is pretty cool though.  So there&#8217;s that I guess.  Shadowfall was easily my number one choice of launch games.  Of the three PS4 launch games I&#8217;ve played now, Shadow fall ranks dead last with a bullet.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2013"}

Grenade throwing skeletons and other stuff that really just kills you in a heartbeat.2. - It's a good game in some spots especially with puzzles but really there is no time for this type of game for me anymore. If it was the ONLY game I owned I guess it would be great but its ridiculously time consuming and really for no reason...because no matter how good you are and how much you know what your doing...all it takes is a slip of a ledge or some bad camera angle to kill you off and then start over again. And again...and again....3. - It's not too much fun wandering around the \"world\"..all the maps are somewhat linear but connect to one another or lead to a central map. It can get confusing sometimes but after dying over and over again your brain just memorizes the whole place. There are some items that help with travel and warp to other points and some strategically placed \"elevators\" but it doesn't help the drabness of the game world. The atmosphere was way better and more creepy in Demons Souls in my opinion.4. - The ending most people will get is sadly a disappointment in my opinion. All that work really doesn't feel rewarding in any shape or form in any of the endings. Never in a game have I felt \"least\" rewarded than in this game. Quite the opposite towards most reviews on this game. Again this is my opinion...5. The bosses on the other hand are some of the best in any game I've ever played. Some of the most bizarre and otherworldly you will ever see. Some of course are frustratingly hard to beat and others are somewhat easier. All of them though are quite memorable.I do NOT hate this game nor do I think it's a great game. I merely think for the entire experience it's not worth the time and effort. Some people do and this is where the game hits a home-run and can be considered one of the best RPG's ever made. Sadly, I'm not part of that crowd...I would be if I had the time and I felt a sense of reward after the credits rolled. I did not. I felt cheated and taken advantage of...much like the entire game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000G7PMX2","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Pretty Annoying","reviewText":"This was the first Wii game I got, and its mostly because I couldn't get a hold of Zelda.  Red Steel looks promising.  Certainly its controls are good, but it feels more like a game that's supposed to get you used to using the remote and nunchuck attachment.  A tutorial of sorts.  The problem is that it isn't much fun to deal with.You play as Scott, a man in Japan with his girlfriend.  You suddenly find out that her father is a Yakuza Mob boss and that he's got tons of enemies.  Your girlfriend gets kidnapped and so its up to you to save her, ultimately getting yourself involved in this family struggle.  It's pretty simple stuff.  Most of the game is told through voice acted cutscenes or graphic novel like storyboards.  The graphic novel storyboards look interesting, but its really painful that you can't skip any of these cinematics or storyboard cutscenes.  This is especially annoying when you die and you have to listen to the same objective over and over again.Red Steel's appeal is its gameplay, which seems to be the focus of the game.  The controls are solid, for the most part, but again, the whole game seems like a tutorial to get used to the Wii remote.  You use the remote to aim at enemies and the B button to shoot.  The nunchuck allows you to pick up weapons, reload said weapon and tip over tables (you'll know what can be accessed because it has a golden outline around it).  The nunchuck is also how you'll move around.  You can strife from side to side and you can move forward.  The nunchuck also allows you to jump and duck.  You'll be doing a lot of ducking.The remote is responsible for most of the gameplay.  It allows you to turn from one side of the screen to another.  The game itself will help you get adjusted with a tutorial provided at the beginning of the game (with your grifriend directing you what fish to look at).  You'll be able to use the remote for several things.  You can lock onto enemies with the A button and if you hold the A button you can zoom into enemies by moving the wii remote closer to the screen, or you can zoom out.  It's all pretty cool, but the remote is extremely sensitive.  Just the slightest flick to the left and you'll look to the left.  It's great to actually point and shoot at an enemy, your accuracy is really important, but now it's all up to you whether or not you hit an enemy.  Granted, the controls take time to get used to, but they flow particularly well.Swordfights are another story, though.  These are annoying sequences actually.  Mostly because the controls are clumbsy.  You'll have to swing your sword using the wii remote and you'll parry and dodge attacks using the nunchuck.  At first this is fun, but its so limited.  When fighting with swords you can't pull out a weapon.  This is bad when you're in the middle of a firefight and some guy has a sword.  You'll be forced into the sword fight even when all the enemies using guns are still up.  And they'll STILL fire at you and you'll lose health.  There's no way to back out of sword fights either, and that's also really annoying.  The controls just feel clumbsy as well, especially with its extreme sensitivty.To the gameplay's credit, there are some interesting things you can do.  For starters, when you're not shooting someone and you're ducking behind something, your health refills.  At first this makes the game seem easy, but you have to understand that if you're taking damage, or shooting at all, your health doesn't refill.  So this doesn't make the game incredibly easy.  Also, after a sword fight, you'll have the choice of finishing your attacker off or sparing his life.  Sparing his life earns you respect, which you can use to learn more techniques.The game doesn't look fantastic, but it's not bad looking either.  It's visual presentation is alright, but the part of the graphics that lacks are the games numerous bugs and glitches.  There are moments where you'll be staring an enemy right in the face and he won't move.  Won't flinch or even attack you.  He just stands there waiting to be killed.  Sometimes enemies will run right past you or claim they can't see you when you're in plain sight.  There are also moments where I shot an enemy in the back and neither him nor his comrades even acknowledged my existence.  There are probably more bugs than this found within the game, but it was hard to take after a while.There are a couple of other annoying aspects of the gameplay as well.  You can only hold two weapons at a time.  This isn't as annoying as it sounds, but I wish I could've held on to more.  Luckily, ammo is not hard to come by at all.  There are also glitches such as your bullets passing right through an enemy while he takes you out.  Enemies shooting through walls.  This game is just full of them.I wish I could say it sounds good, but it doesn't.  The voice acting is very mediocre and the soundtrack isn't great either.  Some levels sound good, but there's nothing memorable here.Red Steel has a good control scheme going for it but that's really all it has going for it.  It's not a fantastic game by any means.  The bugs and glitches strewn throughout are also just really annoying.  It's hard to recommend this game, even to die hard first person shooter fans.The Good+The control scheme works+Well, there is lots of actionThe Bad-Tons of bugs and glitches found throughout the whole game: enemies who don't attack, or walk right past you.  Enemies who can't see you in plain sight.  Bullets going through walls or through your enemies... this game is full of them and they detract from the gameplay-Sword fighting is clumbsy-You can only wield two weapons at once.-When you're forced into a sword fight, there's no way you can get out of it until the fight is over-Horrible voice acting-There's really no story to it-The controls, while good, just seem like another ploy to get one used to the Wii Remote","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2006"}

On one hand, I loved the concept of the original game, but on the other hand the original game was just too hard and unforgiving in many ways.  The new remake is sets out to honor the spirit of the original and fix many of its shortcomings, and for the most part I believe that the remake succeeds.GAMEPLAY: You play the role of a young boy who discovers an alien blob.  The boy and blob work together as a team to navigate the levels.  On the surface the game looks like a standard 2D-platformer, but this is hardly the case.  While there is some basic platforming involved, the true meat of the game is based upon overcoming environmental obstactles and puzzles with the blob's shape-changing capabilities.  Different levels give you access to different jellybeans, which will allow the blob to transform when eaten.  The farther you progress into the game, the greater the variety of jelly beans.  Example transformations: hole, trampoline, ladder, balloon, parachute and rocket.  The majority of the levels are fairly short.  Some levels have a theme and others are more platformer in nature, but the good news is that there are a lot of them.  You will die a lot, since this game is old-school.  Touched a spike?  You die.  Touched an enemy? You die.  Fall too far?  You'll die.  Fell in the water?  You drown.  Luckily the game has checkpoints everywhere, so frequent dying isn't an issue.GRAPHICS: Gorgeous cartoon style artwork graces this game, giving it a sense of style and place.  While the game doesn't do anything particularly impressive from a graphics standpoint, it is obvious the development emphasis was on clean, colorful, and whimsical artistic expression.  The artwork can get repetitive though since many of the levels within the same zones use much of the same artwork, but at least it looks good.PRESENTATION: The presentation is a mixed bag.  One one hand, the game is trying to create a cohesive experience from the moment you boot the game up.  The feel of the original game is definitely kept alive, which is a huge bonus.  The first time you play, an intro movie is played that ends by abruptly dumping you into the game's hub level.  The hideout/hub level is charming and gives you a sense of child-like whimsy.  On the other hand, you are limited to exactly one save file and the game doesn't bother giving you much of a sense of purpose near the beginning, leaving you wondering what to do inside this tree house.  No tutorial, no instructions, and no helpful mission hints.  To top it off in the mixed-bag department, once you do figure out how to get to the first levels, the first several levels turn out to be absurdly easy with the game holding your hand through the solution to every puzzle near the beginning.CONTROLS: Mostly pretty good.  The button layout for remote/nunchuck controls is slightly awkward, but the classic controller setup is rather nice.  Running and jumping work great, but commanding the blob can be a bit annoying since it seems like the little alien has a mind of its own.  Throwing and aiming the jelly beans is a snap and once I figured it out it makes perfect sense.  A lack of a tutorial will leave a lot of folks randomly pushing buttons until something they want to happen happens.  I perhaps I was just really special.  Near the beginning, a lot of the buttons don't do anything, so it kind of confused me at first.  My biggest complaint is the Jellybean wheel, which is used to select your jellybeans.  The layout of the jellybeans changes from level to level, so the bean you got used to being in the right slot for four levels in a row might suddenly get moved to the bottom slot.  It's kind of annoying and never really lets you intuitively learn where your menu items will be at any given time.VALUE: The game has a lot of levels, although most of them can be beaten fairly quickly.  Every level  has 3 secret treasure chests which can be collected to unlock additional levels, artwork, and basically gives something for the completionists out there to shoot for.  Considering this game released for about $10 less than the average Wii game, I'd say you get a good value for your gaming dollar.PROS:+++ Beautiful cartoon graphics+++ The spirit of the original game was preserved+++ Lots of little unlockablesCONS:--- Minor control quibbles--- The game is way too easy near the beginning.Overall, I have to recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzle solving game, 2D games, or who wants to get a nice family friendly game.  Fans of the original game will probably like this remake, but just be warned that the difficulty is much lower than the original, partially due to the frequency of checkpoints.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2009"}

Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"Are We in the Containment Unit?","reviewText":"I remember playing the original Ghostbusters Activision game for the Atari 800 back in 1984.  Repetitive, clunky, and featuring an out-of-place driving mini-game, my brother and I actually enjoyed playing it.  After that game, it was all downhill for the Ghostbusters gaming franchise. Until now.This new Ghostbusters game is an instructive way of immersing a player in the movie experience.  The majority of the voice actors are back.  The plot is directly tied to the first two movies.  You get to play a rookie Ghostbuster and the proton packs are accurately replicated down to the slightest detail - the music is straight from the film, the sound effects are exactly the same, and the special effects of the twisty, winding proton streams are perfectly captured.  Ghostbusters even features a nod to modern gaming tropes, like \"venting\" weapons so that they cool down before firing. That's the good news.Setting aside the Ghostbusters content, the game comes up a short. Playing Ghostbusters is like playing on a movie soundstage: you can only go where the set is built.  Although there's the illusion of freedom from the first- or third-person perspective, there's really not much to actually do.  The characters have a shiny, plastic look and the lip-syncing is awful. There are half-hearted attempts to round out the content: collectible artifacts that echo creepy noises, equipment upgrades, and the bizarre ability to drink from water fountains.  But none of this really affects game play - the artifacts are set dressing, you will be able to afford every equipment upgrade by the end of the game, and drinking from water fountains nets you an achievement.Least forgivable is the lack of a co-op mode for the campaign. I was fooled by the advertising indicating that Ghostbusters has a \"campaign mode.\"  To be clear, campaign mode is NOT the same as co-op mode.  One would think that a game that features all four Ghostbusters in play would be a natural fit for a co-op mode allowing four players.  One would be wrong.Looking back on the concept art, a lot seems to have been cut from Ghostbusters, and that's a shame.  The game is short, with a very linear plot and not much in the way of side missions.  Walking around with a PKE meter in first-person mode washes everything in a green lens, which is great for finding artifacts but not so great for enjoying the game's beautiful backdrops and foes.  In fact, sometimes there's so much going on that the game's rendering can't really be appreciated.  Ghostbusters feels cramped and busy.The experience of running around the Ghostbusters' firehouse encapsulates much of what's wrong and right with the game: you can talk to the portrait of Vigo the Carpathian, stand in front of a game of Q-bert (but not actually, ya know, play it in-game), slide down the fire pole, listen to Janine Melnitz answer the phone, and be stalked by disembodied disco jeans you picked up earlier in the game...but once you've walked around a few times there's not much else to do.But my two-year-old now chants \"ghost-BUSTAHS!\" whenever someone asks him who he's gonna call...so Terminal Reality must be doing something right.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2009"}

Blending unique gameplay, humorous characters and interactions, and the aforementioned graphics,Munch's Oddyseesimply feels unlike any other game in the 2001 console gaming lineup. Players control two characters in the game: Munch, a wheelchair-bound hero, and Abe, a character some gamers will recognize from previous Oddworld games. Their goal is to find and free the Mudokon queen, keeper of the remaining eggs of an endangered species.Both characters feature unique talents that, via a tag-team style of play, propel the player through the game. For instance, Abe can climb and jump to reach new areas, as well as temporarily possess an enemy's soul via a chant. The web-footed Munch can swim to new areas and, when on the roll in his wheelchair, use his sonar plug to control machinery remotely. Saving an entire race also requires a coordinated effort on everyone's part. To get the job done quickly, players can deliver verbal commands to kinsmen. They'll gladly greet you (in a witty manner), then gang up on a mean-spirited enemy or accomplish difficult tasks for you. As with the rest of the game world, the finely detailed characters and environments, as well as a refreshing charm, draw you into an experience with the quality of a Pixar film.

There are several complaints about the length of the campaign but in my opinion it's perfect.

It does glitch every once in a while but it is bearable.\"The glitch that my son was referring to was interesting, in that during the bad guy's turn during the one alien base invasion (one of the storyline missions), enemy's turn wouldn't end, and the game would not progress.  My son was able to quit the game and reload the game at the last move, and the error repeated itself.  This was tried a few times, and my son gave up and instead loaded an even earlier save, one back at the base, and this error did not repeat when he took that mission again.With regard to what my son said about first person versus top down turn based, what happens is that you start with a top down, 3/4 isometric view of the field.  During certain moves and actions, and especially kill shots, the game would often turn to a first-person perspective, giving you the opportunity to relish in the details of that kill.  Not necessary, but fun to see.I personally like the way the complexity of the game increased as you go further down the missions.  You start having to worry about the attitude the world's countries have toward your response, defending satellites, and your squad can go from 4 to 6 members.  There's also individual character progression and equipment upgrades.This game has enough to entertain you for many hours.Overall, recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2012"}

Mills","summary":"Feels like a classic western movie... plays like a game!  Win!","reviewText":"I don't typically review anything which already has copious reviews, but this game is so unique (and I am bored at work) that I felt the need to review RRDThis game has a nice little intro-scene which reveals the setting (1911 - how cool?) and sets the tone nicely for a game which feels like a classic western movie starring Clint Eastwood.In terms of game play the two games I was immediately reminded of were: Oblivion, and GTA.  But let me make this clear right now... this is NOT those two games, its a really unique experience.I never played Red Dead Revolver, but I played GUN for the ps2 and this game is kind of like that, but a million times better.It's like GTA, in ways, some more overt then others (like the wanted level thing) but it's not really a sandbox game, at all.  It's an \"open\" world I suppose, in that there's a big map and you can ride around on your horse, but after a few missions, many of which streamlessly lead into each other you realize, this is just a great single player story that has been arranged so that you have a little bit of choice between which and when you do the missions or deal with something more pertinent, like shooting a cougar in the face on your way to town.I know that GTA is similar to what I described, but that's because its hard to quantify the experience in RDR, but suffice it to say where in GTA you can get completely distracted with, \"hey what's that thing?\" or \"I want that car!\"  or doing countless racing challenges or play \"cop\" after stealing a cop car and as a result neglect the main \"story\" which feels somewhat disjointed as you haphazardly beat one mission or another... well RDR is not like that.Yeah you can steal horses if you want to, and you can play bounty hunter and there are side missions, but overall it feels like it's part of the narrative not a distraction, and the main missions play together really well and actually succeed in feeling like the events in the order for which you choose to play them could work as the exact plot to a classic (but really long) cowboy movie like they used to make, none of this Jonah Hex crap, wait two weeks to know what I am talking about.In terms of the Oblivion likeness, maybe it's the horse which you can ride through the country side looking for happenings, or maybe it's the whole, man on a mission-but do this thing for me first and maybe I will help you - but I just got the vibe.2 hours in and I had forgotten all about Oblivion.  First, and this might be obvious, this is a not an RPG, well maybe by JRPG standards, har har har, but seriously, no dialogue options, \"talking to\" strangers consists of tipping your hat and making some generic greeting, but that's because this game has a story and the main character has an actual identity and it's a pleasure to watch it unfold.As I mentioned in the GTA-comparison section, the story flows really well and keeps you hooked, however the result of this is unlike games like Oblivion, or more obviously the wonderful InFamous, where your every actions seems to change the world around you, not the case in RDR.The ability to choose your mission selection means that you might be at a ranch where everyone was slaughtered and then an hour later you'll be at the same ranch, everyone is alive and well.  There's not a whole lot of permanence in your actions other then the story's narrative being advanced,In short, the setting is not a fluid organic thing, similar to most other games which are driven by a tight story from beginning cinematic to end cinematic, the difference is that this game creates an illusion of openness, and the illusion is great, the ability to ride your horse anywhere you want when you want to makes you feel like you own this character even though he has been 100% created for you by Rockstar (it helps that his, and everyone else character is fantastic)None of this is a criticism (not exactly anyway, well get to that) either, I have enjoyed GTA's but never finished one, I'm the poster child for ADD and its just too much work for me to get through the whole thing, I do side stuff until I forget what the hell is even going on in the story, then I play a new game, I'll end up getting plenty of hours out of it but never finish.Oblivion, never finished, I got too obsessed with trying to play a \"perfect game\"... join every group, do every quest.  Once again lots of hours (149 to be exact) but still not finished.I will finish RDR! and keep playing, for those that say its short compared to GTA, well its long compared to GOW3 and no one complained there because it was a great experience, same thing here, I am really excited to \"beat\" this game because the story is so good, where the \"story\" in most GTA games is moderately amusing, as a satire, but gets old.However, it's a 4-4 review (4: fun, 4: overall)  Why?  Well the game-play is defiantly fun, but there are some missed opportunities, the Wanted system works, but it could have been so much better.  It's very similar to GTA, but where as in GTA wanted level equated to high-speed chases racing your stolen car through oncoming traffic narrowly avoid car wrecks (or not and having a fantastic explosion) in RDR it's just riding your horse through the desert, makes sense but not exciting,Then you have a \"bounty\" which you precede to pay off.  No biggie.  It's a bare-bones game mechanic that gets the job done, but something a little more complex, where pictures of you went up around town, and if they didn't catch you they couldn't confirm it was you but some guy that looks like you and the sheriffs try harder to catch you red handed, etc.  But alas not the case.  Overall this system makes an otherwise more realistic game have a bit of an arcade feel at times.This \"complaint\" (we'll call it that for lack of a better word) is indicative over the one thing plaguing the single-player, that opportunities for actions to really effect anything (other than your \"fame\" or \"honor\" bars) maybe if when you saved a guys life that guy had a name etc and he would buy you a drink every time you went to the saloon and he was there, just a thought. But instead everyone who is not a main character is pretty faceless.The multiplayer is pretty weak.  I have a hard time penalizing games because of a sub-par multiplayer when the single-player is spot on but in this case it really feels like a shame.  A less ambitious multiplayer, maybe a smaller world that kept the players closer together with more to do then shoot each other or hordes of random Mexicans, would have been really cool.  It's a lark for a bit, you start with a Mule and look like a homeless person and level up, but there's not much to it and it gets boring fast.So overall, 4 out of 5 on fun, lots and lots of fun to play, I don't want to put it down, but it's not a perfect experience.Now where I traditionally bump up the overall to a 5 is when the polish really wows, alas this game can be glitchy.  It hasn't gone to the point of cumbersome for me yet, but if they didn't have \"checkpoints\" in the middle of missions I would have lost it by now, I can NOT tell you how often I \"fail\" a mission due to glitch.  Everything will go fine and WHAM! \"FAILED, you abandoned so-and-so\"  when I was right next to him, or you fail because you didn't do something right, I can get more specific because I don't want to spoil anything, but then do it the exact same way and it goes off without a hitch.Then the game gets hung-up sometimes, thank God for auto-save or this game might be unplayable due to glitches.  Overall, thanks to the aforementioned safety nets it doesn't amount to more than a minor annoyance, but it is frustrating when you stats aren't accurate due to it and it can interrupt the over-all experience.Also riding horses is tough at first, do yourself a favor, open up the options and change horse controls from \"relative to horse\" to \"relative to camera\" what were they thinking with that one?  Also they don't do a great job explaining the whole horses stamina thing, or Dead Eye and how it works,  the manual is almost worthless, it looks nice but its 5 pages long and not that full of info, but high its full color right?Here's a couple quick tips, the blue bar in the left is your horse stamina, yeah, watch that!  much easier now huh?  Oh that read bar, that's your Dead-Eye meter not, repeat NOT, your life, got it?  To activate Dead-Eye, aim then click R3, this is essential.On this topic, some of the controls can be cumbersome, it seems to hard to me to switch weapons (which includes your lasso) and ride a horse AND keep on target, how many fingers do they think I have?  But I couldn't really tell you how to make it better, there's a lot of stuff to do sometimes.  But little things would be nice like a map button, so I didn't have to go thought the menu, and some people don't like being forced to use L2 and R2 to fire, I like it, but that's personal I can see the irritation of no customization.I mean in reality it would be pretty hard to switch guns and ride a horse while chasing someone, and I have always been an advocate \"if the task is hard don't fault the game for making it feel hard\"And this game is not easy, I often found the missions in GTA to be boring unless they involved a car in some fashion.  The shooting mechanics have always been weak, GTA3: lock-on target and just shoot the guy a bunch of times, GTA4 had some rudimentary cover-system, but the whole thing was pretty awful,RDR is fun, and hard.  The single player isn't terribly difficult to get through, but it remains challenging enough to be enjoyable all the way through, but a lot of the random side stuff is actually hard, you'll kill the bad guy in the end, but were you fast enough to save the person?  Most of the time not.  Don't worry you'll get like a 1000 more chances to do better, and it will be fun each and every time BECASUE its hard, otherwise it would be like Assassin's Creed: \"really, this again?\"And where the cars in GTA4 drove like dump trucks on a hockey rink, the horses ride beautifully in this game, just watch HOW they run for one thing and you'll be amazed, they get snagged on things sometimes, and they INSIST on jumping over anything if your moving AT ALL even if your just trying to slow them down and get off, but after a bit you'll get the hang of it.So, this Review turned out to be a lot longer than anticipated, but I had a lot of fun writing it and I wanted to share these thoughts with people who were like me asking themselves \"everyone likes this game, some nut-cases hate it, but will I get hooked or will I get bored and lose interest?\"I got hooked, and hopefully if you're on the fence, my review helped, if just a bit.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2010"}

With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents.

It was a beautiful, open world with fairly good gun play, but the story wasn't very focused and it was often very, very repetitive.  Thankfully, Far Cry 3 remedies all those issues and delivers one of the best open world, shooter/RPG games of this year or any other.If you've played Assassin's Creed II, Red Dead Redemption or Skyrim, you'll have a fairly good idea of what to expect.  Rook Island is the setting and human trafficking is the name of the game.  You, Jason Brody, and your friends have been captured by the evil pirate, Voss (one of the best villains in recent memory).  What follows is an escape from captivity and a quest to free the rest of your friends.  While the story is more focused than FC2, it's serviceable and not necessarily noteworthy.  It's main purpose is to provide the catalyst for your island adventures.  And it's there that FC3 really shines.Rook Island is a beautiful place full of flora and fauna which can be used to craft syringes and upgrade your wallet and ammo packs. You can do special hunting challenges, rid certain areas of undesirables via \"wanted dead\" missions, make timed supply drops, take part in the island racing league, customize your guns, play poker, torch marijuana fields with a flamethrower, throw knives, clear out pirate outposts, find the 120 relics hiding throughout the island, help the native Rakyat people, hang glide over the island, go on timed killing sprees via the \"Trials of the Rakyat,\" find 20 letters written by Japanese soldiers during WWII, and more.  In short, there is a TON to do in this game. If you wanna C4 a passing pirate convoy, go ahead. You will spend hours roaming about the island without even touching the main story line.Character progression is also pretty standard.  With each skill you unlock, the tattoo on your arm expands and a more lethal and deadly person you will become (which alarms your friends).  There are some pretty nifty skills to be had. The guns in this game are GREAT.  They're beefy, handle wonderfully, and are a joy to shoot.  It's no fun playing a shooter when the guns stink.  My only complaint here is that I wish there more guns.The multiplayer and co-op levels are a nice addition.  The multiplayer is serviceable (I don't see it lasting very long, though).  The co-op I've had a ton of fun with, however.  You can join three other people in public lobbies are set up a private with your friends.The one misstep in the game is the score/soundtrack, or lack there of.  This game demands a great theme, but the music in Far Cry 3 is essentially non-existent.  I've dropped about 25 hours into the game and I can't hum a single note. I don't think I would have enjoyed Skyim as much as I did without its incredible score. Unfortunately, Ubisoft missed a golden opportunity here.  But that's only one quibble with a game that satisfies on so many levels.If you're on the fence, rest assured this is a great, open-world game that will clock in at about 50-60 hours (about $1 an hour).  In this day and age, that's money well spent.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2012"}

Pull up your map, cycle through what's available in the area you select, set a waypoint and off you go.  It does require two button presses to exit the map, but this is nothing to complain about.  You will access the map frequently.  The ability to place multiple waypoints would have reduced having to frequently access the map.Controls are responsive and rarely are camera angles an issue.  Heller's feet seem to adhere to verticle surfaces well, especially narrow surfaces.  This solves a frustrating issue from the first game.  In Prototype 1 trying to run up a narrow surface often resulted in falling off and causing you to utter some explicit words at your TV.RADNET:  Introducing RADNET was a great idea.  It was a way to add fun to play content in the game while keeping them separate from the main story.If you played the first Prototype you know there were things in the game that just didn't fit.  Things like collecting glowing orbs for various reasons and other mini-games.  It seemed like filler in an otherwise good game.With RADNET these things are outside of the story and yet rewards gained from completing them are carried into the main game.  It's a win-win.  RADNET does require an internet connection.Mission design flows well.  The story unfolds gradually as you progress.  It makes you want to continue to the next mission to discover more about the story.As odd as it may sound, Prototype 2 feels more real than its predecessor.  Not only are the graphics substantially improved, but I was able to slip into this world and lose track of time and reality.  To me this is indicative that a game is doing something right.  After all, games are not just entertainment, they are an escape, a way to experience things on an interactive level we likely will never see or do in real life.  To that end Prototype 2 delivers.There is repetition in that the searches for black boxes and field teams are the same in all areas.  In fairness, the hunt for black boxes is alright because it makes you explore to locate them and rewards you when you find them all.  I think the field team missions could have offered a bit more variety, but they fit with the story.Prototype 2 improves on the first game with graphics, story and gameplay.  It has music fitting the sequences of the missions.  It's easy to get absorbed into the game and just have fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2012"}

This largely unplayed (and possibly unheard of) game is extremely good.The characters are really likable, each one has depth, and it's easy to feel like you know them all.The story is extremely compelling and deep. Full of twists and turns, always keeps you on your toes and not knowing what to expect.The gameplay itself, while short on hours, is nonetheless great. The Judgement Ring system seems kind of rough at first, but easily becomes second nature within an hour or so in. There's everything you'd expect in a good RPG, towns with shops and vendors, hidden items everywhere, weapon/armor upgrades, random battles, turn based combat, etc. There is however no summoning, instead the main character Yuri can actually fuse with demons he's killed and become them. It works well, and it's pretty cool.The graphics are where the game falls short, having been made for the PS1 originally, looks very much like FF7, at least to me. The cut-scenes and CGI however are still fairly good, and the spell animations are bright, and colorful.The music is nothing short of awesome, and really helps to set the mood of the dark story.I highly recommend this game to any lover of old-school type RPG's, namely the FF7/Dragon Quest series - but remember, Shadow Hearts is unique at the same time, and it doesn't try to be a FF clone.With that said - Enjoy!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2008"}

{"product_name":"B007XVTR3K","description":"","reviewerName":"Lucas A. Knisely","summary":"A thoughtful negative review","reviewText":"Most negative reviews can either turn into too much of a rant or become so general that they are unhelpful (ie: this game sucks!).  I am going to attempt to write an intelligent and helpful review that will be almost entirely negative because of the flaws and problems I see in this game that are central to the experience of the player.  My review will focus entirely on multiplayer since that is all I have played and, if we are honest, it is why almost the entire community purchases the game at this point.Now, to earn a little clout with those reading this review, I have been playing Call of Duty since the very first title released for PC back in 2003.  I have played every single release since.  I made the change from PC to XBOX when World at War came out.  My experience with World at War was challenging because I no longer had my mouse and keyboard.  After a few months of playing World at War I got my groove and have had a good experience with every release so far.  Up until the release of Black Ops 2, I enjoyed World at War the most with MW2 and MW3 coming in second place.  The first Black Ops suffered from poor spawns and irritating lag compensation, but it was still somewhat enjoyable to play.  Also, keep in mind that for MW2, MW3, and even the first Black Ops I had a steady k/d of about 1.20 and a good win ratio, ranging from 5.00 to as high as 9.25 on MW3.  So, needless to say, I became an above average player that won quite a bit more than I lost.  My k/d was never very high because I preferred objective game modes over camping in team death match.  This is why my win ratio is high and my k/d is average.Fast forward to today.  Black Ops 2.  Where to begin?First, lets start with the look of the game.  The movement, frames per second, and textures are, in my opinion, a step up from the previous Black Ops.  It seems smoother and brighter, and the HUD as well as guns look better.  This is just my opinion, but I do think most people would agree there is a smoothness to the game that feels nice in comparison to the first Black Ops.  Now, this is about as much as I can say that will be positive about the game.  I also really like the new class building system of 10 slots for whatever you want and think it's a huge step forward for multiplayer, and I hope future COD titles include it.  You want 4 perks instead of 3?  Go for it!Second, lets talk about the overall feel of the game.  At first, the smooth frames per second and better aesthetic made me think the game was going to run better than the first Black Ops.  I quickly discovered I wasn't just wrong, but that it was actually worse than its predecessor.  I play with some very skilled players, some that make me look amateurish with their immensely high k/d, and even they have barely been able to maintain even k/d in this game.  Why?  What's the problem?  What's so different about this game versus all the other Call of Duty releases up to this point?  Two words: LAG COMPENSATION.  Because they have kept an ultimately unhelpful auto kick for team killing in Hardcore you are forced to play Core unless you want to get kicked from games for simple accidents or teammates running into your score streaks.  Why am I talking about Core vs Hardcore when I just said the problem was Lag Compensation?  Because Core requires a high amount of bullets as well as accuracy to kill efficiently.  And when Lag Compensation takes over, you are basically at the mercy of everyone else's connection and will find it very difficult to land a kill.Essentially, this is how Lag Compensation works: John has a fast connection but Billy doesn't.  John's experience is therefore altered to make up for his \"advantage\", which in turn gives Billy a fair shake.  So when John starts to shoot Billy, there is a delay, and Billy has a few extra milliseconds to react.  How this plays out when you are in the game is this:  You round a corner, have the jump on a guy, start shooting him, and then you drop dead.  You watch the killcam, and it turns out you only shot maybe one bullet before dying, not the 3-5 you thought you did.  What happened to you was Lag Compensation.  The player that killed you probably had a slower connection than you, so he is given a slight advantage.  This is why some games you can feel like an unbeatable god, and others you feel like you're playing against wall hacking aim bots because all you do is come around corners and die.  For those of us with faster connections, our experience is almost entirely the latter.Now, there are people who defend Lag Compensation, saying it isn't fair to give an advantage to those with faster connections.  While this may be a valid point, it is not a convincing one.  Why is it not convincing?  Because you are just changing you gets the advantage.  And not only that, you are hurting the experience of any player with a good connection.  When I played Quake 3 on my crappy old 786 PC with slow internet, I just figured out how to play with my disadvantage, and actually I got quite good.  I didn't suddenly expect everyone else to be nerfed or slowed down in order that I could get as many kills as them.  Changing who has the advantage in this situation is also unfair because you are going against what every gamer in existence is used to.  Players with slow connections know and expect to have a tougher time.  And Black Ops 2 should be a safe haven for them right?  A great experience?  Wrong.  All it's doing is making those of us with fast connections stop playing, so the goal posts are just going to get moved.  So now the guy with a mediocre connection is suddenly the guy with the best connection, and he is going to start to have a worse experience.  In other words, there is always going to be someone with a slower connection and someone with a faster connection.  So the experience of all players will be ever changing.  There is no consistency, no standard, no constant.  This is what makes the game so frustrating to play.  You go from having a good experience and feeling like your first 3-4 bullets actually hit, to feeling like a worthless player, shooting blanks, falling to your death around every corner.The reason I mentioned being \"forced\" to play Core, is because Hardcore would help with some of this.  Because you have to shoot a player so much in Core, Lag Compensation can make it seem impossible to get a kill.  If you are on the bad end of Lag Compensation, you will be helpless to change anything.  In previous titles, if I was having a bad game, I could make alterations.  If I'm not getting the jump on players, I'd switch to an SMG.  If I am getting the jump on players but not killing them fast enough I might switch to a high damage AR or maybe the same SMG with rapid fire.  I tried all my usual audibles when having a rough time in Black Ops 2, but it doesn't matter.  Everyone I play with was saying the same thing, \"There is nothing I can do.\"Now, before moving on from the topic of Lag Compensation, there is one final thing I'd like to say about it.  There is something inherently wrong with altering the experience of a player purely because their internet connection is better.  The nature of online gaming has always been one where those with slower connections have to deal with their lot in life.  But nobody is actively giving them a disadvantage, it is just the result of varying connection speeds.  Actively giving someone an advantage over another player is, in one sense, cheating.  And in a even greater sense, it is more unfair than just letting the chips of connection speed fall where they may.  Many have said that Lag Compensation is present in all of the COD titles.  While I have the \"I swore I shot first\" experience from time to time in previous titles, it is basically every gun fight in Black Ops 2.  So something is dramatically different.Third, lets talk about spawns.  When players start complaining about spawns and getting shot in the back they are usually met with a response like this:  \"It is very difficult to have consistent spawns with how much people move and change location.\"  Okay, that seems like a fair response, except it's a cop out that hopes to excuse a bad spawn system.  If you want proof for how broken the spawn system is, play Nuketown, against Bots, and camp on one side of the map.  My buddy and I tested this.  It was just me and him versus 6 bots, and we never crossed over to the other side, in fact, we never went past the school bus.  And still, without fail, the game would consistently, at random times, spawn a couple enemies behind us.  This is why you can get caught in a spawn cycle where, even though you are spawning in different locations on the map, you take a few steps and get shot in the back.  This little Nuketown experiment should make it crystal clear to any skeptic that the spawns are poor.  Not to mention that almost every map the spawns are incredibly easy to control, and many games turn into \"who can spawn trap the other team first\".  No creative ingenuity has come to the realm of spawning in any of the Call of Duty titles, so this isn't necessarily just a Black Ops 2 problem.  However, it is quite frustrating to have the same problems persist in every release.Now, to conclude this little review.  The question has to be asked:  How could it be this bad?  How could they make a game with so many problems, so many flaws, and so many complaints after having 2 years to make it?  The answer is:  I honestly don't know.  People blame the deadlines, claiming that having to make a game every two years is too short a time to iron out all the bugs.  But we aren't talking about bugs and glitches (I haven't even had time to notice them)  We are talking about a game that is essentially broken.  When a 10 year veteran like myself cannot go positive or equal with k/d in almost every game I've played, then something is wrong.  I did not suddenly become a terrible player.  All of my 50+ friends that play this game did not suddenly become horrendously bad at this game.  They have changed the very core of the gameplay and just like the first Black Ops, have turned many people away.  Not because we don't like the maps, the guns, or the gadgets, but because we are defeated before we even start.  Our fate is determined not by our strategy, skill, or in-game decisions.  It is determined by an arbitrary \"compensation\" that ultimately decides who will win and who will lose.And if you read this and think I'm crazy or think all of us who are complaining are off base, think about this...  Why do they push so hard to motivate people to pre-order?  Why do they push so hard to get you to purchase a season pass for the DLC?  Why are they seemingly more concerned with getting your commitment and money prior to any reviews or consumer feedback?  Could it be because they know the game is sub par and most people are going to spurn the DLC?  Could it be because, just like the new Medal of Honor, negative reviews actually keep people from purchasing?","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2012"}

When it comes to collecting the most coins or eliminating each other, the Battle mode is another reason why this game is golden.Not ONLY do you get to battle and race with 11 computer players, but you can PLAY ONLINE via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, in those two modes! This means you get to play with bunches of strangers from across the world! Sure, there's signs of hackery, but not ALWAYS. There are only few times where things like that occur. Otherwise, the online play is great and rarely lags (if not at all)!And to top it all of, you can play as a Mii (You must unlock that first, but whatever). C'mon! You know you want to race around with Mario characters as Captain Falcon, Chuck Norris, Steve Urkel, Sonic, Pikachu, Mickey Mouse, etc (Depending on what Miis you can find on the Check Mii Out Channel or whether you're an excellent Mii artist)! Besides, even without the Mii feature, Mario Kart Wii is still some of the best fun you can have for your Wii console.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B00006HBTW","description":"It&#x92;s a pretty bold claim but for many,Mario Partyis the best multiplayer game series ever. No need for guns or complicated role-playing elements here--Mario Partyis fun because it&#x92;s simple. The original N64 game created an entirely new subgenre--an unlikely combination of traditional board games and lots of ultrasimple arcade titles. The idea is that you travel around the board trying to collect stars, which must be paid for with coins, and you get coins by competing in minigames, which occur at the end of every round. These minigames generally don&#x92;t last longer than a minute or two, and many are based on oldGame & Watchtitles. There are over 50 minigames inMario Party 4, and each involves either a free-for-all, two players against two, or one against three (depending where you land on the board at the end of your turn). These can involve anything from skydiving to basketball dunking, or car racing to hide-and-seek, to name a few.Admittedly, this basic description of the gameplay might not sound too exciting, and indeed if you&#x92;re playing with less than three human opponents it can be pretty tedious. But play it with the full complement of non-virtual rivals and the game&#x92;s infinite capacity for cheating, backstabbing, and ganging up allows it to completely transcend the humdrum sum of its parts. There&#x92;s nothing terribly new in this third sequel except that the graphics are much improved and the minigames are all new, but that really misses the point: get this game out at Christmas instead ofTrivial Pursuitand you&#x92;ll wonder how you ever got through the holiday without it.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"obryanstars","summary":"A pretty good game, but what's new?","reviewText":"Well, I don't own a GC, but I love and play it daily and at various friend's houses.  Well, one of my friend's picked this up and played it with me.  I was amazed by several things, but it did have a few problems:1. Graphics: Fantastic!  I can't beleive how good this game looks.  The N64, my friends, was a good system, but its graphics were anything from good.  It showed in the first 3 Mario's (on the N64).  But finally, Mario is given some justice.  This game looks awsome, and exploits what the N64 could only dream of!  The characters, backgrounds, coins, levels, everything is so sharp.  There is no framerate slow-down here (for those who don't know, where the game gets REALLY slow for a few seconds) and the worlds seem to feel and look HUGE compared to pasts.  Firy volcanic explosions, water in the swim pool, the ball swishing through the nets, the characters breathing in and out.  This game ROCKED in terms of graphics, and is my favorite among the Mario Parties just for that reason.2. Gameplay: Good, as usual.  All the games are extremely addictive, and there are many options to try.  The classic square off between you and 3 other characters or 4 player gaming frenzy is where this game shines, keeping all the same rules, characters, and fun games from the past, and adding something new!  Most games are extremely addictive, and are fun to play over and over and over...  But mostly, this game is a multiplayer game.  The single player gets a little old playing computer generated foes.  I mean, sure, its fun for a few days.  But the computer foes just never do anything new, or do really stupid things no human would ever do.  You'll find yourself beating the computers every game, or getting your butt kicked the other way around.  There's no real even competition against the computer.  Do NOT get this game for single-player (which ROCKS!)3. Replay Value/Depth/Controls: Well, this game is as good in terms of gameplay as the last 3, and sure, its all fun.  But its beggining to get a little old.  The replay value is there in multiplayer, but once beating the computer a few times, where is the fun?  They haven't added a sort of record keeping system so you know what you've done (would've been cool), there are NO new characters to play as, no ADDED rules to the game.  I mean, sure, a few new games here and there, but how many Mario Parties can they make?  This is easily the best, but it's not much better than Mario Party 3 except for graphics.  What else can be done to the Mario Party series?  The graphics are awsome, there all already over 400 games, and well, its just getting a bit overwhelming.  A good buy, but don't expect anything real NEW here.Overall, if you are new to Nintendo systems, Mario Party 4 is great for Multiplayer fun, or even single player.  Its easily better than Mario Party 3, but its not a HUGE improvement as some might put it.  This game is fun, and if you have 2 or 3 friends over to play it every day, this game will rock!  But by yourself, you'll beat all the games, and find you never take it out of its case.  It has several new awsome games, the graphics are a HUGE improvement, and the classic formula of fun from the original Mario Party still sticks to the fourth sequel.I would buy this game when the price drops, and buy it for multiplayer.  Its a good game, impoves a little on everything. and is a blast in multiplayer.  Your choice this X-mas, but don't expect greatness over the first 3, or to spend dozens of hours playing it buy yourself.  Good game, but in my opinion, not great.Hope this helped!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2002"}

It's been around for ever - I've been playing Starcraft since 1998 - but even though the graphics are sad by today's standards, the game is awfully good.There are hundreds of good reviews on the Internet, and so rather than reiterating their collective points of view, I will say this to complement them:If you have never played this game, you need to play it, if only to understand what kept millions of gamers (and probably half the population of South Korea) sleep-deprived for years.I would go as far as to argue that Starcraft is primarily responsible for global warming - think of all the coal we burned to generate the energy required to power all those computers and CRT monitors and light bulbs (and the heat produced by them!) as a generation of gamers stayed up all night fighting invasions and plotting fiendish countermoves instead of reducing their electricity consumption by turning off their PCs and going to sleep.For those of you who haven't played for a while, the Battle Chest is a good way to relive the memories of those happy days of bygone years. It works on Win 7, but note that the mac version of the game is not compatible with OS X Lion (Lion dropped Rosetta which allowed programs from the PowerPC days to run on Intel-based macs).But then I don't remember many mac users in the 90s playing Starcraft. When me and my buddies were happily gaming on our PCs, they were usually doing productive, artsy things on their macs, which is probably why they now zip past me in their SL55 AMGs.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2012"}

This Game Is Like Drugs.","reviewText":"Yep, as the title goes, the game is like drugs to kids and teenagers. Just like to warn parents and potential buyers.I've played it the second year after it came out, stopped, and went back. Clan leader of 4 clans and second rated general to the leader of 12 clans, so I'm pretty sure I know this game quite a bit. Oh yeah, I would say the rating is 4.5 not 5 as there are flaws even though insignificant.Even though the graphics aren't super, it is still great and I wouldn't want to change it, maybe just add a little more detail to each craft and individual.The game play is very nice. I suggest practice in single player for a short period, say a week an hour a day. Than you MUST, I emphasise on must, start playing it online with other player, this is what makes the game worth while. Playing by yourself with cheats can be fun but also very boring later on. This is what makes the game great. I suggest getting $29.95 or so broadband DSL, why? If you have 56K internet, you will usually lag, shown by the red bars next to your SN(screen name). If you lag in a game, the creator will very likely boot/ban you. This is where you'll get stuck playing by yourself again. Please take note, having 56K doesn't necessarily mean you'll lag so chear up. It just means you'll lag more of the time than those with fast DSL/Cable internet. Having super fast internet also doesn't mean you'll never lag, but you'll lag rarely, depends on server. Multiplayer player is great because you can fight other players, fight with a friend or by yourself against computers, or have a third whole new option, which makes this game excellent, called, uh oh I forgot, haven't played in 2 years. UMS, used map setting? This is where you can play maps made by ordinary people just like you to play. They can be totally different from the Melee counterpart. RPG and such. So when you're bored of melee go to UMS and vice versa. There are many options but you find out for yourself, I'm not your mom!The type of class you can get is nice as well. Terran, protoss, and zerg.Terran=Great defense, medium build time, requires more strategy than usual to play. As you'll usually see, terrans are used regularly in melee 1v1s. Tanks, flying buildings, vultures with mines, and Battlecruisers are some of the strategies you'll see used against you.Zerg=Fast build, between mixes of defense and offense. You must use the swarm to your advantage.Protoss=Best in offense. Slowest building time, more powerful men however.There are many other details into it but I won't spoil it for the new peoples to it.Please remember, limit yourself to this game. Its very, very time consuming. Its the kind of game where you start playing at 1:00 and the next minute you look at the clock, 3:00?? An hour or two on a free day.

I went ahead and bought em anyways, since my top 3DS XL screen already got scratched permanently without them (within the first week of buying the system. It was my fault though).Anywho, I did as some people suggested and went to the bathroom, turned the shower on with the heat all the way up, and went to work. Here are a few things that I think would be useful for anyone who is trying to put em on:1) Turning on the shower and making the room hot and humid really makes the dust particles all fall down (you can even see it in the right light), but it also makes your 3DS very humid and wet, so you wanna turn it off at some point and dry your 3DS a bit and make sure the screen isn't all wet. Just make sure not to let too much time pass after you turn off the shower, or the dust may flow up again (I read that somewhere).2) The little cleaning cloth that comes with the thing only leaves more dust in your screen as you wipe. Don't use it. If you have a better cleaning cloth lying around, use that one. I used the one that came with my mac. However, as you wipe, look very closely to make sure you're still not leaving any dust on the screen. It can be hard to tell sometimes. Once you feel that your screen is lint free, follow the instructions that come with the screen protectors.3) The instructions may seem a bit complicated at first, so you want to make sure you understand them before even attempting to put em on your 3DS. There are videos on YOUTUBE that can help you put em on, so if you're having trouble understanding how to do it, look it up.4) Once they're on, just use the little cardboard thing to push airbubbles out of the screen. This part wasn't as hard as other people make it sound (for me, at least).5) That is all.I'm very happy I bought these screen protectors. I feel safe whenever I use my stylus now, as I know I am not damaging my little baby. The 3DS is hella-expensive, so I suggest you take precautions. Also, they don't affect the touch screen as far as I know. If I ever do have hardware problems, I will update my review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2013"}

Many enemies with weapons will block attack after attack. Many animals will jump, either to the side or back, just as you are swinging. Many enemies will make the character pay if the player mashes the R2 attack button. The key is patience. Setting up attacks takes some doing.

Good RPG skills are important. Choosing a side is also important, and only by performing quests can a side be chosen. Stick with one side. Use online game guides if you need to, as the game's quests can be confusing. There are many non-combat skills, and they are fun to use.Always carry a bow. Distant switches and winches in the ruins can be used with either a telekinesis spell scroll or a bow. Don't sell any levitation, nautilus or telekinesis scrolls. I played an axe fighter (the best weapons are from the axe tree). I would suggest a magic user in the second play through.Risen was a fun game. I put 60+ hours into it. I did not have any bugs, although the 'puzzles' in some of the ruins were not easy. I was not able to beat the final boss. That battle was, like many games, not exactly based on the game skills.Overall, I could have rated Risen higher. However, the sometimes frustrating combat system and the final battle keep this a 4. Overall, Risen was a fun game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2013"}

Jet Grind Radio is one of the best Dreamcast games ever. The first things you will notice about the game is its graphics. Sega made Jet Grind Radio the first cell-shaded game ever created. Another nice touch is the funky music they play while you're playing the game.The story behind this game is great. The city Tokyo-to is under control by four spray-painting gangs. The GG's (you're gang), Poison Jam, The Noise Tanks, and The Lover Shockers. Your goal is to wipe out Poison Jam, The Noise Tanks, and The Love Shockers. However, the police force in Tokyo-to has had it with all the graffiti all over the walls of the city, on buildings as well as on cars and buses. The police force is willing to do anything to capture you and your gang.The object of the game is simple, yet extremely fun. In each level you skate around, collect spray paint cans, find the red arrows and spray paint your tag. But you must be careful and pretty skilled to avoid the cops, tear gas, dogs, missle-launching helicopters, and even tanks. This makes the game much more challenging and will often leave you dead before being able to complete the mission. After you beat some of the levels you will often be challenged by rivals to show off your skills. Other times later in the game a few punks will want to join your gang, but for them to join you have to be them and copy what your gang's members do.This is definitely an awesome game with tons of replay value. If you never had a chance to pick this one up for your Dreamcast, you don't know what you're missing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2003"}

This feels more like a well made tool (its made of real wood), but just don't try to plug it in an amp or anything for that matter, as it's wireless.  The wireless works very well, as its an officially licensed accessory that doesn't require some odd dongle.  Just plug the batteries (included) in and fire up your favorite guitar game.  At first its a little tight, but it quickly establishes itself as a smooth and precise controller.  Before long the weighty axe starts to be a bit of a pain on the ole back, but  since its wireless you can grab a chair even if its across the room.Style wise it's more of a modern Guitar Hero controller than Rock Band, but it works great in both.  It also works great in DJ Hero.  The frets and all of the other controls are positioned in the same locations and with similar spacing, but the larger guitar makes it feel more natural and is easier to play for extended periods (as long as the weight isn't an issue).  It looks awesome (bonus points if you love orange), and it doesn't look so bad in your living room, which is more than I can say for other controllers.  Plus it makes a great home defense tool, as it'll likely create a far bigger knot in the head than any baseball bat.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2009"}

Lots of Potential.","reviewText":"I am a multi-console owner who also has a Xbox One (see my profile for PS4 review). I was a huge supporter of the PS3/360/Wii and have the Wii U. I have to say that the Xbox One is impressive in user interface in what you can do with it but its a bit complex in using create things such as Snap where you can have two windows open at the same time. It does have some cool improvements such as sleeker achievement designs when they pop up (you can change their colors) and them each having pictures when you check them out. It even have a nicer design to compare your achievements with others. There is now even achievements to watch movies and tv shows or even downloading an app. They are separate from your gaming achievements are achievements such as watch 20 episodes of a tv show, watch so many tv shows after 9pm, and such.The controller is much improved. I haven't been able to try the rumble feature in the triggers which is a big cool improvement in the design of the controller but overall I am not as impressed with it as I am with the PS4 controller. The analog sticks feel more loose in comparison and the d-pad is a bit too low. Overall it works but it would have been nice if the controller was a bit bigger. The Xbox logo lights up white which looks very cool.The design of the hardware itself as in the look if it is pretty bulky. It would have been nice if it was something other than square. It is bigger than the 360. The kinect looks a lot better and works extremely well and can tell its a huge improvement. Now inside the system itself, it has the windows 8 design. I am not a fan of it. It looks nice but I don't like navigating it and this design is terrible to look for games. I think they could improve by at least have categories to look up genres but goes from popular to new and that is all. Snap is the coolest thing. You can literally watch a tv show on netflix or hulu plus and jump back in the game in an instant. You can do the same thing by having your cable provider connected through Xbox Live and look through its in-system guide to find what to watch and do the same thing. Now they also have video recorder so you can record your gameplay and even do a picture-in-picture of yourself and edit it of your gameplay footage.I think the weakness of Microsoft consoles is they take few risks and don't provide an extensive library of new IPs on a yearly basis but this time around they have Titanfall on the way which is the most anticipated next gen game to come out on all systems only. It will only be available on the Xbox One. You have Halo which is one of the biggest franchises that will make a return and you have Forza which launched that is arguably the best current racing franchise.

{"product_name":"B0000503MO","description":"The third title of the Gran Turismo series takes full advantage of the new PlayStation2 game engine, which is capable of rendering about 20 million polygons per second--roughly 10 times the number of total polygons of the series' previous installment,Gran Turismo 2. Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course. They don't drive perfectly, either; some will spin out and make other mistakes over the course of a race.","reviewerName":"\"arxane\"","summary":"A great racing game too realistic for its own good?","reviewText":"\"Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec\" is one of the first games (along with \"Twisted Metal: Black\") that became a Playstation 2 must-have. After the great reception of \"Gran Turismo 2\" on the Playstation, it was inevitable that a sequel would be made for Sony's next-generation console. Numerous delays only caused the hype to grow even further, and when it was released the PS2 started to gain some respect, thanks to the spectacular, realistic experience the game presented. However, was the game too realistic for its own good?The Gran Turismo series is the most popular racing series in the world. And with good reason. The series has prided itself on the fact that it goes to great lengths to simulate realistic driving conditions. \"Gran Turismo 2\" accomplished this feat effortlessly, and the third installment carries over that feat flawlessly. Different cars have different driving abilities, and these abilities can be modified by tweaking the car. Changing tires, replacing flywheels, and even lowering the body of the car all affect the way a car is driven. For racing fans who enjoy customizing their own cars, this is pure bliss. Add in the fact that weather conditions and driving surfaces also affect driving, and realism has reached a whole new level.Graphically, the game is amazing. One car in \"GT3\" has more detail than a single scene in \"GT2\". The courses in the game are very well designed, and small details like kicking up dust add to the experience. Probably the only thing graphically-impaired is the audience watching the races, which is basically a collection of paper cutouts. Of course, the main focus of the game is the cars, not the people, so it's only a minor nitpick.Soundwise, it's above average. Another thing the Gran Turismo series prides itself in is individually recording a real car's engine for the corresponding car in the game; the engine even sounds different when driving from a third-person perspective and from the driver's seat! And sounds like tires screeching and dust flying are top notch. The mixed bag lies in the soundtrack. The songs are mainly old 80s tunes, including a remixed version of a Lenny Kravitz song for the game's main theme and a rendition of \"99 Red Balloons\". Some people will be put off by this collection of songs, but most people will ignore them when listening to the actual sounds of the game.Are there flaws in the game? Unfortunately, yes. The AI doesn't \"put up a challenge\"; all the rival racers do is follow a specific path along the race track, making some races feel \"contrived\". Still, the AI is threatening enough so as not to be ignored. Also, while there are a lot of race tournaments, the number of actual tracks is limited; the same tracks reappear in different tournaments. Of course, racing the same track with a different kind of car can be a different experience, but people wanting variety will be disappointed. Finally, initially, the cars available are very slow-moving, and it takes a while to build enough prize money to buy better and faster cars (and to tweak them for better performance). This can cause casual gamers to lose heart.All in all, \"Gran Turimso 3: A-Spec\" lives up to all of its hype, but at a cost. Its deep realism, which is its major selling point, is also its greatest flaw. Casual gamers looking for speed in their racing will be sorely disappointed, and gamers hoping for a game like \"Beetle Adventure Racing 64\" will also be disappointed. But for any gamer who wishes to engage in a deeply satisfying game where you create and race a personal collection of customized cars, \"Gran Turismo 3\" is exactly what they've been looking for.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2002"}

Why?  I think it's because everything about Halo is just right:  you have a clean story (cadging from multiple science-fiction staples), engaging--if simple--characters, and a gameplay that is both balanced and somewhat open.  As time goes by, the only problem I've encountered is, ironically, with Microsoft Windows Vista:  at random points in the game, my framerates drop to single digits with no apparent cause or cure.[update:  the framerate woes don't get any better in Windows 7--I've tried it on Pro and Ultimate and the random slowdowns still happen]The gamplay for Halo is just plain fun:  whether it's the steady drama of the single-player campaign or the insane mayhem of online play (warning:  obnoxious people exist in large numbers on the servers), Halo is an enjoyable way to kill some time.  When I say that Halo is \"balanced\", I mean that instead of a growing arsenal of more powerful weapons, you are always limited to only being able to carry two at a time.  This limitation forces you to think on your feet, and it rewards you as you make discoveries:  each type of enemy has different ways that work best to bring them down.  There is also just enough AI to make repeat gameplay not as predictable as Halo's predecessors.  This is what makes it more \"open\" than older shooters:  I've had fun trying crazy things, like destroying a tank armed with only a pistol and a couple of grenades.  I've also sometimes been surprised when an enemy does something differently:  if you stick a plasma grenade on a bad guy, they might turn and run back to their friends...or they might just charge straight at you and try to take you with them!At the current price, I highly recommend picking up a copy of Halo for the PC.

The player takes the role of 1 of 14 mercenaries (which mercenary is chosen only affects your body, which is only partially visible, and the mercenaries you don't pick become potential allies during the game) on a quest to kill The Jackal, the arms merchant who's been supplying the whole thing. However, you contract malaria before you can do so, and find yourself indebted to one of the factions' lieutenants (which one depends on where you collapse in the initial playable sequence). From there, you set about enriching yourself and making a name for yourself in the war-torn country.The world is an open sandbox, meaning that you can go anywhere within the map's limits. Travel consists of walking, driving, river travel, and buses (which serve as fast-travel to selected map locations). There are guard posts set on roads and rivers, so it's nearly impossible to get anywhere without a fight. There are also safehouses that, once captured, serve as save points and, once you've upgraded them, places to restock your ammo and weapons. Theoretically, you're part of a war, but the truth is that everyone is hostile to you no matter who you do missions for. Therefore, you are always at risk, as your employers are quick to remind you. Your missions will send you to different points on the map, though luckily you usually only have to go to the place and don't have to worry about returning to collect your pay. Payment is in diamonds, which can also be found scattered around in suitcases on the map; these diamonds are used to buy weapons and gear at the weapons shop.Missions from the factions are the most free-ranging and generally involve a wider variety of tasks and opposition. Missions from the weapons shop unlock more weapons for purchase and involve attacking rival convoys. Hacking into a cell phone tower will provide you with mysterious assassination missions. Missions from the Civilian Underground consist of deliveries in exchange for malaria medicine - these missions are required, as you'll get malaria attacks after a given number of storyline missions. Therefore, you cannot advance in the story without doing Underground missions.The game is a first-person shooter that prides itself on gritty realism. Apart from ammo counters and health meters (which disappear when not in use, IE when you're not hurt or reloading), there are no heads-up displays of any kind - not even crosshairs, at least not on higher difficulties. Health is handled in a Riddick-like fashion, where you have five small healthbars and if you're injured, you only recover to the closest healthbar. To recover more you have to use medicine syrettes (which are luckily found in every first-aid box). If you're particularly injured, there is a short scene of you undoing your injury - pushing out a bullet, bending a bone back into place, cauterizing a wound, and so on.Another part of the game's realism is mechanical failures. Guns that are used frequently will jam or break and vehicles that sustain damage will need to have their engine fixed. Guns used by mercenaries will be visibly rusty and will jam very easily, while guns bought from the gun merchant will be much cleaner and more reliable. It conceivably can get annoying, but it does add a really cool, gritty feel to the game, which adds a lot to the immersion value. Guns tend to be old, reflecting the nature of the war, and vehicles are only cars and jeeps - no tanks, no helicopters, no planes. Just a lot of low-tech, low-intensity warfare, which is pretty neat in its own right.As mentioned, for the most part you're alone in the country. However, you've got a few mercenary buddies that you meet in some early missions. These buddies are taken from the roster of mercenaries who you did not choose to be your main character. Your best buddy (the first one you meet) will help you on missions by suggesting alternative solutions that make your main task easier. Your second-best buddy (the second you meet) will serve as a Rescue unit - if you run out of health, he'll come out of nowhere, drag you to safety, and help you fight. If a buddy is injured, it's up to you to save them by applying a syrette, and if they die in combat, they're gone forever. Luckily or unluckily, you can't bring buddies along normally - they're just special-use characters who provide only the two roles described above, in addition to giving you some side missions.The enemy AI is really top-notch, not just in intelligence but in presentation. Enemy chatter is really fantastic; if you're hiding after a firefight, they'll panic, arguing whether or not to chase after you. They'll comment \"Oh, he got the new guy, what was his name\", and similar points - and it actually feels like real conversations instead of just random snippets. Enemies will hunt relentlessly for you, flushing you out with grenades and gunfire (though you can trick them). Observing mercenaries from afar or sneaking up on them, you can observe a variety of behaviors - smoking, leaning against buildings, checking weapons, talking to each other - that makes them seem very real. There is a reputation system that you build up by doing missions - the higher your reputation, the more people will fear you. With a low reputation, if you push a person in town, then they'll shove you away and yell at you. With a higher reputation, they'll step out of your way, move back and apologize, and whisper to each other about you from afar (\"Don't look now, look who it is\" \"Oh, damn, what does he want?\"). The fact that there are no factions is perhaps a commentary on the nature of civil wars in Africa, but for the most part the game does a really excellent job when it comes to your enemies.The graphics are really great; the detail on guns and objects is fantastic, the mercenaries you face have a wide variety of gear and faces, and everything feels really realistic. Sound is top-notch, with great voice acting and immersive music / background noises. Technically, this game is really great. The world is very detailed, with wildlife (zebras, goats, antelope, gazelle) and a variety of terrain types from jungles to savanna to deserts. Explosions and fire are handled fairly realistically; if a fire starts on a grassy area, it will spread until the whole plain is ablaze.Overall, the main shortcomings of the game involve the missions. Most of them are far too scattered around the map, and each is preceded by 10 minutes of driving through hostile areas to reach the destination, then in some unlucky cases 10 minutes to drive back and get your reward. There's not enough variety in what you can do, either; besides the fact that you lack the option to go prone or lean (both of which are in Crysis, an earlier Crytek game), there's not a whole lot you can do besides hunt for diamonds or do missions. It feels like there should be more to the game - more varied missions, a deeper infrastructure, actual factions instead of fake ones, civilians, or something. These problems detract from what is ultimately a fairly solid game, and are what may drive a lot of potential buyers away. The multiplayer, too, is basically worthless - standard team deathmatch that doesn't take advantage of the setting, plus there's no co-op in what would be the best co-op setting of all time.Overall, Far Cry 2 is worth a 7/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2009"}

{"product_name":"B001TOMR0C","reviewerName":"Nightmare","summary":"Nothing like the original","reviewText":"The differences between Red Steel 2 and the original Red Steel are so striking that it's not really worth comparing them apart from the fact that both feature guns and sword fighting.  The graphics, music, gameplay, controls, etc. have all been improved in Red Steel 2, and the setting/story is completely different.  I figure the only reason they kept the name Red Steel is because they wanted to make up for the first game and give Red Steel a good name.  Although I am one of the few that enjoyed Red Steel, Red Steel 2 is an infintely better game.Most importantly the controls for sword fighting have been vastly improved.  Whatever angle you swing is the angle your sword slashes on screen.  To do the most damage you have to swing in wide strokes instead of short flicks of the wrist (so no waggling here).  There are a number of different combo attacks you can learn for your sword, and even a few for your gun.  You automatically lock on to enemies which keeps the camera from causing any problems.  You can cancel the lock on or switch between enemies as needed as well.There are four guns in the game to my knowledge and I have three of them so far--the revolver you start with, a double-barreled shot gun, and a tommygun.  You can spend money (earned from completing missions, killing enemies, and destroying random objects) to upgrade the attack power of your sword and different parameters of your guns, as well as upgrades to your health, defense, etc.  The sword is actually useful enough that you never need to use your guns (although I like to mix things up especially when enemies are far away).  Even if your enemies are shooting at you, you can simply guard and block their bullets.Red Steel 2 features some great music that mixes Western and Oriental styles.  It never gets old and really compliments the game well.  I'm not sure they could have done a better job on the music.  The voice acting is excellent as well.  I'm really impressed with the quality of the accents and overall effort put into the voices of the characters.The graphics are simply beautiful.  The cel-shaded look effectively brings the environment to life while maintaining a serious tone.  UbiSoft was wise to use this graphical style because it makes the best use of the Wii's graphical capabilities.  We have been given a product that rights the wrongs of the past in the best ways possible.  If you have even been considering this game, but have been worried that it won't live up to the hype, then you need to pick it up ASAP.  Just don't forget that you need the Wii Motion Plus for this game.Gameplay--9/10Controls--9/10Graphics--10/10Music--9/10Replay Value--8/10 (There are three difficulty levels and there are challenges you can unlock [which I have yet to] which should add some extra replay value)Overall--9/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002BRZ9AG","description":"No More Heroes 2 Wii","reviewerName":"Skitz","summary":"Bigger, Badder, Better","reviewText":"No More Heroes 2 is a significant improvement over the first game in every sense of the word. The additional option to use the classic controller pro was what hooked me. You're not gonna want to use motion controls ever again in No More Heroes after you've tasted how sweet the CCP handles. Graphically speaking, NMH2 blows it's predecessor clear out of the water. There's no comparison. The graphics are clearer, crisper, way more detailed, a lot of motion detail to clothes & \"other good things\", and even Travis himself looks cooler. They added a nice little mini sim including Travis' cat, Jean, which I really dig. You have to take care of her & help her lose weight, while staying happy. The characters and bosses this time around are even more over-the-top than last time, and you'll even be fighting in a zord like in the Power Rangers lol. Everything was done well. The slow downs that occurred in the first NMH has been significantly cut down to almost zero.In terms of story, it's just as good as the last, but you're gonna wanna make sure to complete the first game first, despite what they tell you in the beginning of this game lol, since the story actually DOES make a connection. The katana's are better, the combos are better, you get to carry ALL your katanas on you (which you actually see, & they move shake etc when you move, pretty life-like) & you can switch between any one you want in the middle of battle instead of having to go back to the Motel like in part 1. This literally adds depth and strategy to the game as you'll be able to get through bosses easier depending on which katana you fight them with. It can either help you, or be the reason you die lol.The mini games are WAAAAAAY more fun this time around, even though they're in 8-bit graphics. They are perfect just the way they are and hit us older gamers with a sense of nostalgia. Training is kinda tougher this time around but worth it so bring your A game. The only thing missing from this game is the ability to drive around Santa Destroy freely, which I don't actually miss. You are able to access all your jobs etc faster without the meaningless drives. If the previous world map were done better & with less slow downs & glitches, I might have missed it, but because it was done so poorly I like the new layout a lot more. Another big thing to mention is that you're going to be playing with more than just Travis this time around. I won't give any spoilers but let me just say that you'll get to take some really cool assassins out on missions, with their own boss fights etc, which is VERY, VERY cool. All in all this is a wonderful, fun adult themed game. Anyone who likes mature content, extreme violence & good comedy should pick this up","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2013"}

The fluidity of the controls and the movements are second to none. Just dancing around the place superhero style is a sight to behold and cherish.Devil May Cry gets the thumbs up for this reviewer.

The gameplay trailers looked superb and the details surrounding the games complete redesign sounded more than promising. When I popped this game into my ps3 and connected to my preferred game mode, team death match, I was ready for bfbc2 taken to the next level. Man was I disappointed, long story short this shooter plays, moves, and feels, just like Medal of Honor, also by DICE, a game largely regarded as a failure.  The first thing I noticed was that the graphics were nothing like the screen shots found in magazines, and the videos posted on you tube. I feel deceived in that regard. Granted the graphics are more polished than bfbc2, and more \"life like\", though no where near the level of polish in the previews. And even though the game looks great, the level design does not promote direct, or indirect engagements, it promotes lots of camping.Next, and more importantly, how does the game play? Well first of all it feels NOTHING like bfbc2 in terms of gameplay, gone are the smooth controls and methodical engagements of bfbc2. Moving, aiming, and shooting does not feel anywhere as refined as bfbc2, again, it feels almost exactly like DICE's Medal of Honor. The team death match level designs are, as others have said, \"a campers dream\", and now that you can lay down, it becomes impossible to spot snipers. In bfbc2 you could get sniped but you could usually spot your shooter, not here. Also out the gates using the iron sights it is almost impossible to rack any kills as you engage from so far away, and you will find yourself \"blinded\" by new attachments like \"red lasers and flashlights\" that will literally obscure 1/3 of your screen with light \"in your eyes\", and COMPLETELY obscure the person shooting you, which to me is a really \"cheap\" new feature that will turn off more seasoned players.I strongly doubt that the same developers behind bfbc2 produced this game, but I can absolutely guarantee that the same developers behind Medal of Honor made this game, and like Medal of Honor it plays miserably.

A decade has passed since the events of the first game, and the face of E.D.N. III has changed dramatically. Terraforming efforts have been successful and the ice has begun to melt, giving way to lush tropical jungles and harsh unforgiving deserts. Players will enter this new environment and follow the exploits of their own customized snow pirate on their quest to seize control of the changing planet.GameplayLost Planet 2, like the original game in the series, is a third-person shooter featuring huge boss battles, challenging terrain and the ability to pop in and out of battle mechs, known in-game as Vital Suits. The primary difference in gameplay this time around hinges on the inclusion of RPG gameplay elements. Players can now customize many of the aspects of their playable snow pirate, including his physical attributes, clothing and to a certain extent, weaponry and gestures. Players will control these customized heroes across 6 interconnected episodes, creating a truly unique and interactive experience that changes depending upon the actions of the players involved. With this concept, players will have the opportunity to engage in the story in a much more dynamic way as plot threads evolve from different players' perspectives.MultiplayerBeyond the deep single player mode,Lost Planet 2is loaded with extensive multiplayer modes and play options. This includes 16-player online versus action, as well as a 4-player online co-op support and two-player split-screen functionality in local co-op play. In addition, the intense and action packed campaign mode allows for 4-player online co-op play to clear mission objectives with friends, unlockable weapons and the ability to resurrect fallen comrades.Weaponry and GadgetsNo action game would be complete without an arsenal of weaponry, and to that endLost Planet 2comes loaded with a huge variety of hardware for players to unleash on unsuspecting enemies. Machine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers, lasers, sniper rifles, grenades and a host of other weapons are scattered across the game. However,Lost Planet 2's biggest weapons come on two legs: the heavily armed and armored robotic Vital Suits return in greater numbers and variety than the first game. There are Vital Suits that transform into other vehicles, and even some that hold up to three players and take multiple players to operate. Also, the grappling hooks that made the gameplay inLost Planeta true 3D experience are back, allowing gamers to gain tactical advantage by quickly scaling buildings.Key Features4-player Co-op Action- Team up to battle the giant Akrid in explosive 4-player cooperative play. Teamwork is the player's key to victory as team members are dependent on each other to succeed and survive.Split-screen Functionality- Share yourLost Planet 2adventure with a friend locally with split-screen co-op play.RPG Elements- In addition to RPG elements like character customization, and experience points, the single player game evolves based on players decisions and actions.Deep Level of Character Customization- Players will have hundreds of different ways to customize their look to truly help them define their character on the battlefield both online and offline.

It was tantalizing, epic and intriguing, so upon release I purchased it to try it out.  Immediately, like so many critics and reviewers have pointed out before, I encountered the issue with non-sufficient save points.  I can't tell you how many times I played through the first \"chapters\" (if that's what they're called in the Missions) time and time again thinking I had finally hit that save point only to come back the next day and realize I had to start all over.  That major misstep aside, Lost Planet 2 is an overall great game.  The graphics are impressive and rich to say the least, although not as detail-oriented as, say, God of War 3.  The voice acting is topnotch and I thoroughly enjoyed the story and, personally, did not mind being an anonymous shooter in the game whose role kept changing with each Mission.  One problem, as noted by some critics, is the Akrid, while impressive and gigantic on all levels, do tend to keep knocking you off your feet before you can even get back from being hurled through the air, which proves problematic because you die tens of times sometimes before the monster is killed.  The AI in single player mode also proves troublesome as they tended to get in my way and follow me around, rather than actually assisting in taking out enemy or Akrid.  The fact you can see through objects also can be as distracting as it is helpful during huge battles.  Lost Planet 2 has much to offer, albeit to a very small group of players (my favorite parts being the battle in space and underwater scenes).  There are some obvious mishaps and missteps by the game developers/designers, most notorious of which is the save point issue mentioned above (although, let's get real, people who play this game usually will spend a couple hours straight so you'll hit a save point or two during that time), but it's a game that's worth getting for the price being offered.  Overall, a great title I highly recommend.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2010"}

The screen is to small, and this one can't be outsourced to a TV.  Some later ones had that ability.  I should've researched more.  I just assumed Sony would be smart enough to make that a feature.  I would've!  I now have Final Fantasy Crisis Core which is pretty fun, but the screen is still too small to see what's going on.  Castlevania Symphony of the Night looks and plays good on this system.  Pretty much the only game that does, though you still can't see things like numbers due to the small arse screen.  The internet feature on this also sucks being that most sites you go to look funny or the PSP doesn't have enough RAM to load things, saying stuff like, \"not enough memory... change your settings.\"  I already did!... damn thing.  Also, a Monster Hunter game was advertised as being really, really good.  It sucked!  I should've gotten my money back, but all I have is a game I'll never play.

S Thomas \"Jethro\"","summary":"One Of The Best FPS Adventure Games Out","reviewText":"At Games End Watch ALL the way to the end of the credits. A tidbit many may have missed, i just left the game on and was thinking it through when another thought provoking scene came up at the very end of the credits.Ok I do like Adventure Games, Fallout Series, Skyrim etc. which are excellent in their own right and immense games that can take months to finish but are pretty straight forward games. However, after I played Bioshock 1 I truly enjoyed that game and would always say I wished there would be another one like it....Well Bioshock Infinite is 99%+ there imo. Yeah Infinite it not as dark/scary as the original Bioshock but in many ways better.  This game has one thinking and gives you choices which do make somewhat of a difference as to how you reach the end.Lots to see and do, excellent graphics, voice acting, the sound track is increadible and the controls are tight and spot on.  I think this has replay all over it, kinda like watching that movie and you go back and see it again and say oh yeah thats why this or that happened, same thing here imo.  I did go for the season pass due to the replay value so the next time through I will get the extra bonus features as well as the DLC when it comes out and very much looking forward to how that is handled.This is not some boring mindless FPS that just wears your thumbs out, this one makes you think and has adventure and plot twists and amazing detail and voice acting and soundtrack brings the player into the game.  If your looking for more out of a game this one is for you, i waited since 2007 for a game that would come close to Bio1 and Infinity is the game that met and exceeded my expecations. If your into the genre or want to give it a try this one is for you, worth every penny imo.  I will say one last thing, i picked this up friday afternoon and was so absorbed into the game I finished it over this weekend which I never do with any game, amazing and thought provoking, Irrational Games Infinite has GOTY written all over it.  Now I will go back and check out things I may have missed, but in time...for now im satisfied.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2013"}
{"product_name":"B003O6EB70","description":"","reviewerName":"Sloopydrew","summary":"In the end, it's Just Another Shooter(TM)","reviewText":"Only a couple of hours into BioShock Infinite, I made a post saying the art design was second to none, the story was compelling, etc. After finishing the game I'd still stand by all of that (only not as enthusiastically). I'd also stand by my statement that caused so much controversy -- the gameplay in BioShock Infinite is mediocre.Here's why (if you haven't completed the game yet, you may want to scroll down to the \"END SPOILERS\" section to read the rest of the spoiler-free review):SPOILERS(including end battle spoilers)The gameplay is limited like an FPS from the early 90s or a generic military shooter (Call of Duty) from this century. There's nothing to do, gameplay-wise, but shoot. And shoot. And shoot some more. Yes, you get to combine vigor/plasmids/whatever-the-kids-are-calling-it-these-days, and that's fun for a couple of hours but you find the most powerful combo and basically upgrade it to full and stick with it. Same with the weapons.Then, after an incredibly awesome Shantytown section and revolution section the game stops even trying to be something more and becomes Just Another Shooter. Wave after wave of bad guys. Pretty much non-stop from the section where you have to find the 3 tears to the end. And then there's that end.Oh, that end ...Until the end section the game is INSANELY easy (on Medium settings, which is how I always play through a game the first time, as story is at least as important to me as the challenge -- which is why I save the hardest difficulties for last). Then the end puts you in that airship which is at first simply monotonous and then devolves into something awful. You finally get to the top deck (I laughed when -- after an hour of non-stop shooting, Elizabeth says, \"Only 3 more decks\") and everyone and their mother is shooting at the power core thing to take it down. It's total overkill.There's nearly as many bad guys to fight in the airship and around the airship than there was the rest of the game. Again, total overkill and all art goes out the window and a generic FPS takes its place. Sure, you can call in Big Bird, but Big Deal? No wonder Infinite didn't have multiplayer -- it didn't need it -- the last third of the game is nothing but multiplayer you play offline. Waves of enemies and shooting and swearing -- just without the fifteen-year-old boys swearing at their mommies over a headset.ENDSPOILERSAnyway, I'd still this game a 5 out of 10 for the art design. But gameplay wise? It's no better than a 3 out of 10 (and that's being generous). The much hyped skylines were a useless gimmick to stop people from noticing this was Just Another Shooter(TM).I have literally never been this disappointed with a game. I loved the first BioShock. I thought the second was decent (with FAR better gameplay mechanics and variety than Infinite). The third was pretty and had some compelling ideas that reminded me of debates I was involved in back in college. Nothing that thought-provoking, but despite what Ken Levine and eager-to-please critics claimed, this is just a game, after-all (too bad that I, like so many, wanted it to be something more).BioShock Infinite isn't revolutionary. The first half makes you think it MAY be, but in the end, it ends up being no more than a mediocre shooter that drags on at least two hours too long and runs out of ideas 2/3rds of the way through (if that). A game with the potential of being a game-changer (pun intended) ends up being nothing more than a bore. A shame.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2013"}

If you've ever played borderlands, you can tell that many of the systems are a direct copy. My friends ask me which is the more fun zombie game, Left 4 Dead or Dead Island, but they are truly two very different types of games. I will make many comparisons to Borderlands, since that's where most of the similarities crop up.Shooting- there's very little of it in Dead Island early on. In fact, in the first 4 hours of playing, I don't think I shot more than a few bullets. This game is all about the melee weapons, especially early on. This game runs on the found weapon system, where you are going to find weapons all over the map. Unlike borderlands, you are going to be replacing or repairing those weapons often. This means you can't just find the 1 weapon you like, you need a whole set. I find this enjoyable, but your mileage may vary.The skill system is almost a direct port from borderlands. 3 skill sets for each character, different specializations for each character, you have to unlock the top tiers in order to make your way down, and you get xp for each zombie killed. As far as I can tell, xp is not shared between co-op players, so a bit of sharing-is-caring is required.Co-op is highly suggested since it's easy to get overwhelmed if you're trying to solo the game. The game features a pretty intuitive system where you can join in with another player on xbox live if you are in the same area on the map, which makes a good way of finding people who are the same level as you, without needed to use a lobby.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000EGELP0","reviewerName":"T. Tom","summary":"Flawed implementation, problematic","reviewText":"Firstly, the interface is a bit flawed. On many many occaisions I would say the correct answer (the Nintendo DS/DS Lite has a mic that this game uses), and it wouldn't register my answer being correct even though I was speaking the correct term. So, actually I was correct but the game thought I was wrong and gave me a poor rating. This can be very frustrating and seems unfair when it displays the color Blue for example, and you clearly say \"blue\" and it doesn't even register.Secondly, it relies on how fast you can write with the stylus. A lot of people may be very quick to think the correct answer, but may not be that good writing on the screen with the stylus, which can be awkward since to play this game, you have to hold the DS or DS Lite turned on it's side like an open book. It will give you a bad score just based on this, even though you knew the answer.Thirdly, the sayings that are on the screen during game play are strange and condescending. I think they are supposed to make the doctor virtual character seem powerful and superior, but really a lot of what he says doesn't make much sense. There is no way to turn this off, which can be a bit annoying because you have to sit through or click throw his sayings each time you play.This game should not rely so much on stylus and voice input and it should be redesigned to use the buttons more. As it is designed, the buttons are virtually never even pressed!The game is more frustrating than fun not because I can't answer the exercises quickly and correctly most of the time, but because the game doesn't recongize my correct input as correct the majority of the time. What good is that?The premis of the game is empty-it's supposed to exercise your brain but in reality, playing Super Mario Brothers (or any other game) probably exercises your brain just as much and is a whole lot more fun.I give it a thumbs down.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2006"}

Basically, it made you feel like you were Batman. Not dissimilar from the Christopher Nolan Batman films, ARKHAM ASYLUM was an amazing first entry, and ARKHAM CITY was the ultimate Batman game. Now we have the prequel ARKHAM ORIGINS, which gives us a bit of a YEAR ONE approach to this franchise, and while it's not as good as ARKHAM CITY, it's still an incredibly well-done game.Now, a lot of the criticisms that are attributed to this game are very similar, and they seem to revolve around frame-rate speeds and sound and graphics glitches. That is not the experience I had while playing this game, so I don't know why people are complaining about that. The once complaint about this game that I do agree with, however, is that this game seems a little too familiar. It's an open world game much like ARKHAM CITY where you travel around Gotham, beating the snot out of criminals, and confronting big bosses, and you have your side-quests where you destroy drug shipments, stop huge criminal turf-wars as they break out, and search for Riddler clues. This is well-traveled territory. This game also suffers from the lack of one of the major improvements of ARKHAM CITY, which is the ability to play occasionally as a different character. The addition of Catwoman to the gameplay of ARKHAM CITY was very inspired and gave you some time to explore this open world as a different character. And while the pre-order bonus offered by every shop was &#34;Play as Deathstroke&#34;, it's, at this time, only in the challenge modes, where I was hoping that it would give you the opportunity to play as a villain, or at least as an antihero in the open city gameplay. It's unlikely that this will turn up as a DLC option in the future, but it would be a major step in the right direction.Another flaw is the endless &#34;Enigma&#34; collecting. This was something that was trying my patience in both of the other games, but at least there, there was some riddle-solving, but since this incarnation of The Riddler is before Edward Nashton officially becomes Edward Nygma, there aren't word-based riddles to solve; it's just collecting Enigma's data boxes. And to get completion of just once section of the datapacks... it's just too frustrating and too needless. They have so many characters to work with that a side-mission of this nature could have worked better doing something a little different that wasn't quite so infuriating.The one thing that I did find as a major improvement to the gameplay this time around were the various murders you actually get to solve in Batman's detective mode. Instead of simply using Detective Mode to see through walls and gauge where best to perform takedowns, you get an entire side-mission where you solve murders, just as Batman would. I found this to be incredibly refreshing because too often is Batman presented as a force of nature frightening the forces of evil, and not enough as one of the world's greatest detective. Of course the combat is fun, but also getting to solve crimes is a necessary step towards making Batman a more complete character in the game.And while they do use different voice actors for almost all of the roles, particularly that of Batman and The Joker (who for the two previous games were voiced by the great Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, respectively reprising their roles from BATMAN THE ANIMATED SERIES), at least Troy Baker, the new Joker, does a pretty remarkable job of giving The Joker life and something of a play on his origin. The mythology at work at the first meeting of these two characters is more haunting than anything in either of the previous games and I thought it was the highlight of the game. Also in regards to The Joker, you REALLY need to watch or listen to the entire credits. It's VERY creepy and VERY awesome.All in all, while Rocksteady Studios is absent from the creation of this game, it's absolutely a worthwhile addition to the ARKHAM franchise, even if it's not the perfection we're now expecting in a post-ARKHAM CITY world.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

A good shooter needs excellent graphics, well, thats a given here, and also smart monsters and a good choice of wheapons.  The choice of wheapons is the same as in Doom and Doom 2 but the  monsters are very intelligent(most of them) and are not easily fooled by repettively and dumbly shooting at them(as in the past 2 Doom games)  Thier are some things that need to be said here. People give this game five stars partly because of the hype(and fear of being flamed by others), but it is not a Perfect game.  Most of the ranged opponents(especially the Marine Zombies) will fire thier chain guns whether you are in the line of fire or not.  If you dodge into an ajacent corridor and are no longer in the same one they just keep dumbly firing.  I would hope this will be fixed in the patch.  Also some of the deamons are too over confident(I guess that's a deamon trait).  You don't **** with someone if they wield a rocket launcher.  They need to move and hide and attack from behind(they are supposed to be agile.) not come at you full force, they die every time.  I am impressed by them all the same.  Don't go melee with a deamon and use the shotgun whenever your in close quarters with one, no wheapon works better.  Of course zombies are supposed to be dumb and slow, but they are scary if the catch you by surprise and rise up in the shadows.  This is a horror gothic set in a futuristic setting very surreal monsters moaning in the back ground as high tech machinery whirrs and computers beep and cheerful promotional videos play on screen.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired.

It seems like Microsoft finally hired a bunch of designers that not only could make something aesthetically pleasing but something that will also enhance the systems performance.The very first Xbox, was a giant square. This was considered ugly to the japanese market, but frankly the original xbox was built like a tank. It was built right and solid.The 360 on the other hand... was designed clearly with a looks first, and get it to the market first mindset. I don't think I have to really mention here to anyone just how many Red Rings of Death really have popped up involving the first waves of 360s (failure rates as high as sixty percent in estimates) And the ultimately expensive steps microsoft took to ensure that the 360 wasn't going to Tank in sales. They backed it up with one hell of a repair gaurantee. One that I had to use three years ago on my 360 as it Ringed me. Out, and back in roughly one week the console performed flawlessly, until Tuesday night. Where I believe one of the patches I downloaded screwed up the OS of the 360 and left it a freezing mess. Unfortunately it seems we can no longer totally format the 360s OS leaving me with a broken console.I was well past warranty date at this point. I had been thinking about getting this 360 anyway so it was time to get a new one. I picked the 250gb slim. Just as further insurance I bought the extra protection plan at walmart (naturally. Been burned by consoles that die past the warranty date many times. With my 360, having the ocassional disc read error issues ((which I fixed myself after the warranty ran out)), and my ps2 before it out right suicided. (Third console was the charm there. Still have the thing three and a half years later fingers crossed)Onto the review.The Case design is nothing short of miraculous. It's design is such that the stupid tiny pin holes are gone. That's right they are gone. Those horrible pinholes which in no way possible could allow for a console to breath are now Gone. In their place, we have actual grills, on both sides, the top and bottom. The space between each grill fin, is substantial enough to actually allow air inside and out of the system, so now it can actually breathe, and not fry itself. So the single biggest contributor to the 360 overheating and cooking off is removed. Not only were actual grills put into place, the system is designed with some angles in mind, which while incredibly pleasing on the eye also has a nice bonus effect of some much needed noise cancellation, as the angles on the console make it resemble the inside of a chambered muffler system.There is now finally touch button activation on the system, which is really slick. My favorite part about this feature, is it will save tremendously on wear involving microswitches. Also I imagine it would make reassembly of the case easier as you don't have to make -perfectly sure- that the microswitch and it's contact point perfectly line up like on the old 360. The other two features of the touch activation, are more aesthetic and personal taste oriented, it gives the console a much sleeker look (like frenched in headlights on an old 30s car)and in the case of the tray opener actually chimes just before the tray slides out.The color choice is impeccable. Jet black, with subtle \"chrome\" accents. Much akin to the original PS3s color scheme, but imo much more classy. This thing makes me think less home appliance and more sleek and lean computer. (The original PS3 just seemed so utterly bulky, and so bland in shape... I felt it looked like an appliance.... but the color scheme was good... now if sony would just get smart and use the jet black of the original on their new slim 3.....)  Compared to the old 360, you can scarcely believe that they are from the same company, let alone packing alot of the same hardware. The old 360 I felt looked kind of... well I thought it looked like a Camry. White, Bland and dull as dishwater with only the barest hint of styling added to it. (and still managed to have an utter Failure as far as ventilation went)Onto some of the meat and bones, these two have gotten a massive overhaul compared to the original. The sliding tray seems much more stable and solid than the original line's. It doesn't seem nearly as prone to flopping around, it seems much better made on the sliders which again is going to save on wear and tear.The processor is of the much more sturdy and resilient Jasper model found on the newer Elites which is a Godsend to anyone that has ever had a Ring. And is also a Godsend to anyone thinking about a new console. The Ringing issues are going to be much less common now, meaning it's only going to happen on defects.  It's not something you should spend every waking moment fearing when you go to turn on your console.The harddrive is literally more than 10 times the capacity of the original 20 gig unit. Something which for me is a godsend because I really really didn't feel that 20 gigs was ever enough. It is also internal, so unfortunately there's no way to put your old HDD one the new one if you wanted to try and keep you old save files and just use the new hardware (like I wanted to do) But hey, it gives me an excuse to replay all of my favorite games I guess. And I do love my favorite games.There are more USB ports than there were before, so everyone can have a corded controller. (no more hunting for batteries! Or hoping the set you let your buddy borrow is fully charged)It also comes with a built in wireless. And here is one of my small complaints. It should have been a G card. Not an N. I do understand that Microsoft does infact have a budget with these things but it seems to me kind of odd that they chose to save a miniscule amount of money here given what they already saved with the smaller case, smaller power supply brick, and more uniform parts commonality between Elite and non Elite. But hey I didn't have to go fishing around for some wire to get onto xbox live and get all my dlc in a row... and I don't have yet another cord around my computer/entertainment desk.It also has a much improved quality of headset compared to the original 360. It's the spiffy one you could -buy- instead of that horribly uncomfortable one you could wear if you were too cheap to get the nice one.So why only 4 stars?For one it makes me somewhat sad to look at my older 360 (now deceased, and soon to be taken apart for every last bit of salvageable stuff like fans....) and think about what could have been from the start. Honestly if this 360 had been the one to come out ....five years ago? I don't think anyone would have had a leg to stand on in the so called Console War. the Xbox's reputation likely wouldn't have been tarnished (even if in the long run this sort of paid off for Microsoft. Now they learned the lesson, don't make it Cheap... make it Solid. It's not worth the multiple billions they are projected to lose to Rings....) as being unreliable. And frankly the styling would have face trounced the competition.This is the Xbox that should have been. Honestly, I almost feel as if -now- finally the original Xbox has gotten a worthy successor. This unit provides such a lovely nod to, and steller improvement in every way to the original that THIS should have been the original 360. I'd have waited an extra year for it.So who do I recommend this console to exactly?Anyone, that wants a very well rounded console with an incredible variety of games on it. If you're console shopping for the first time, this thing is definitely worth checking out and I would call this a First Buy, with the PS3 second. You're going to get a very enjoyable long term experience with the 360 (and the Ps3 too. I think you can guess which console -I- don't like) and this is definitely the one to get, the sheer amount of stuff you are essentially getting For Free make this easily the best buy of the trinity of consoles on the market.If you are thinking about upgrading your 360 two times (once for that Harddrive, and once for that wireless card) just get this instead, sure it's 100 dollars more, but you also get -yet another- controller (which is 50, so now you only have a 50 dollar disparity) and the peace of mind having the by far best designed console case this generation (just for sheer cooling and quietness value. Let alone the killer styling) This is something you could proudly place in plain view in my opinion as a focal point in a room it's that pretty to look at. And the other peace of mind knowing you now have the best designed processor the 360 comes with at this time. It's more stable, it's far less prone to heat failure and in my opinion seems slightly quicker than the original.If you've got a Ps3 or Wii and want a second console I'd get this one. Believe me when I say this, Xbox Live is easily worth the money, (40 for a full year) as it has the best matchmaking, the best chat setups, support and etc. If you're serious about multiplayer or want to get into it 360 is the way to go. Also, Ps3 guys you'll finally be able to experience some of the best games ever made if you do :P yes Mass Effect 1 and 2 really are that good. (also the controller design is better... you actually have a trigger guard for your shoulder buttons... Remember those?) and for the Wii guy that finally wants to step up into a less Party Game system, this thing's got a spectacular library of games, a brilliant controller and frankly one of the nicest looking consoles ever released. (Second in my opinion to the Original PS2)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2010"}

This was partly because I was not much of a gamer and partly because Naughty Dog intentionally made the game so hard that the gamer-controlled character is always on the edge of dying. I was totally terrified throughout much of the game. But I kept going back and muddled through because I was mesmerized by the story of Joel and Ellie. It is a zombie story with a soul, by which I mean the zombies (or the infected) are merely backdrop; the soul of the story is the relationship between Joel and Ellie evolved through the game, from reluctant strangers thrown together by circumstances to father/daughter with genuine love for each other. There is an undertone of sadness in the story - that people are trapped in a decaying world only to kill or to be killed.  The graphics is awesome and the voice acting is top-notched. The action is brutal and bloody and the language is laced with profanity and obscenity. So parents beware.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-23-2013"}

It feels like the culmination of years of work in the console life cycle, and the fit and finish really shine through in almost every moment in the game. Even within the first 15 minutes of playing the game I became more emotionally involved in the story than I have ever felt with any other game I've ever played (and I've played quite a few). This isn't going to be the generic war-shooter experience like Call of Duty or Battlefield, nor is it the overly dramatic sci-fi game like Mass Effect or Halo. The Last of Us strikes closer to home, and gives you a real and gritty look at what would happen if the world fell apart.I don't want to say much about the story, since frankly that's one of the best parts that you get to experience for yourself. I will say that after playing this game the bar will be raised in terms of story, characters, and immersion for every-game thereafter. This is the kind of game that pushes the entire genre and field of games forward, and the rave reviews by almost everyone is testament to that. I'm going to remember Joel and Ellie for many years to come, I know that much already. I will say that this game's combat isn't exactly really easy to master - but that's the point. You're not some super-soldier gunning down hundreds of bad guys, you're just someone who's been through a lot trying to make it in the world when everything is just in ruins. The fights all feel frantic and messy as you fight to survive. It's a tougher game than other ones, but that's part of what makes it so fun and realistic.The graphics in this game are phenomenal, looking like they're being run on the PS4 rather than the PS3. The only knock I have against this game is that because there's a lot of times where you want to sneak past enemies and you have other characters following you, they sometimes just run around and look like they would blow your cover but they don't. The reason the enemies don't respond to your friends running around is so you don't get yourself into a fight because of characters you can't control. I get why they did it, but it's something that breaks the immersion of a tense scene. I highly recommend that anyone who's in the right age group (NOT a Family game or one for kids) with a ps3 buy this game. You won't be sorry. Take it from someone that's bought a lot of games over the years, the Last of Us is the swan song for the Ps3 and one of the finest gaming experiences you'll find anywhere.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00149MEVY","reviewerName":"Ian","summary":"Go home and see the sights","reviewText":"The Silent Hill series has been around for years, and despite being a fan of supernatural/horror games, I never got around to picking it up, after hearing that it was more focused on the psychological horror aspect, rather then normal, \"I'm going to tear your face off\" horror aspect.  Yet, after seeing the film adaptation of the series, I decided to dive in and try out the Silent Hill series, and \"Homecoming\" was my first visit to the infamous town.\"Homecoming\" follows Alex Shepard, a young soldier heading home to be back with his family after a stay in a rather unsettling hospital.  But once he arrives home, Alex finds that his hometown is now shrouded in fog, the town's residents are all but missing, his brother is missing, and oh yeah, demonic beasties roam the streets.  Now Alex has to not only find his brother, but also discover exactly what's going on, and if he can stop it.Despite my initial hesitation about heavy psychological angst, \"Homecoming\" quickly drew me in with plenty of monsters to fight, lots of fog, dark caverns, and dilapidated buildings, which creates an excellent atmosphere that's a lot of fun to go through.  And to add icing to the atmosphere cake, \"Homecoming\" features a story that was genuinely interesting and kept my interest all the way through, including moments where you have to make some really personal choices that affect which of the five endings you'll get.  Fans of the film will be pleased to see a few elements make their way in, such as the nasty little bugs, the real time transitions between the real world and the bloody otherworld, and Pyramid Head himself; he doesn't show up often, but when he does, he easily steals the show.However, while \"Homecoming\" may offer a great atmosphere and compelling story, it falls short in the combat department.  While \"Homecoming\" makes it a large selling point, citing Alex's military experience, the combat system relies on precise timing of attacks, rather then just bashing away at enemies with whatever weapon you have on hand (Ironically, the knife based weapons are the best, as you can attack very quickly, making it difficult for enemies to attack you back).  While you do have a dodge button that you MUST master if you want to beat the game, it only works about half the time, and because of that, you'll die a lot...every time I died while playing \"Homecoming,\" I felt like the game had been cheating on me, which made things frustrating very quickly, especially with those damn nurses.Aside from the combat, there are a few other annoyances:  While Alex's brother, Josh, is a huge part of the story, he embraces the horror cliche of running away from you whenever you come across him, to the point where by the end, I wanted to shoot him in the legs just so the brat would stop running from me.  There's also a sewer stage that, despite the potential for a really creepy underground atmosphere, ends up being arguably the most tedious and boring sewer level I've ever played in a game, and I was very glad to see it end.Still, despite the frustrating combat and a few little annoyances, \"Homecoming\" does offer a great atmosphere and a genuinely compelling story, along with some really memorable choices that you have to make (and a gripping quicktime sequence in the third act that I won't spoil).  Overall, \"Homecoming\" is an average game that's definitely worth checking out at least once for fans of the franchise, and newcomers like me will find it enjoyable, but a little frustrating along the way.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2011"}

We have a pretty diverse collection of Sega games, but this one always seems to rise to the top.  As far as the 'fun factor' goes, I'd easily stack it up against a fair percentage of my PS2 library.  I don't know much about the ports, except to say that Sonic has been made available on the Playstation, the Xbox, and even made portable for the Game Boy Advance.  I haven't played any of these, but the reviews I have seen are fair, at best.  So, proceed with caution.Maybe its true that you can't improve upon perfection.  The cartoony goodness of the frenetic hedgehog brings a smile to my face without fail.  The way he zips along his path, snatching up rings is something straight out of a roadrunner cartoon.  And on those occasions where he gets zapped by an enemy or a set of spikes, he flails his limbs, but gets right back into the fray again.I have never completed Sonic, but that doesn't make the game any less addictive.  There's the constant quest to collect 100 rings in an attempt to extend game time.  There's the challenge to find all of the secret short cuts and bonuses.  And the boss battles with the evil Doctor Robotnik is just tons of fun.  Maddening at times.  But fun, none the less.  If you have this game tucked away somewhere, you owe it to yourself, to dust off the Genesis and have another go.  I promise you, its just as much fun the second, third, and fourth time around.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2006"}
{"product_name":"B001IK5TJI","reviewerName":"austin_Larry","summary":"Great in depth story, fun mechanics, overall must have but could have been better","reviewText":"Some of my favorite games on Xbox were Knights of the Old Republic games. Just the stories alone besides any game play were fantastic. Equal to a good Star Wars movie at the least. Bioware does not disappoint here with a tremendous amount of story and even more background then I remember for your party member characters. The graphics are good to very good. And it really is M light. I don't like gore and I was concerned about that but there really isn't much at all. It is M as in mild rather than M for mature.The concept of the origin stories is neat to a point. I am almost done with the second go around of playing but not because of the origin stories. Rather I wanted to explore a different class from the ground up. Of note though my first character was a human mage. On my second go around I a woodlant Elf rouge. The human mage origin story was WAY (many times) more involved than the Elf Rouge.The actual mechanics of gameplay are about as well thought out as possible using the PS3 controller. Battles are fun and enjoyable and depending on the game difficulty level sometimes take me more than a few times to survive with some pretty involved tatics and 'team-work' (pausing the game and switching characters) to get through.BUT Bioware stopped short of making this a great game as oppossed to a very good game. As many have mentioned this game clearly SCREAMS out for true multiplayer. It would be awesome to have a 4 member party made up of 4 people. And there would have been endless online modes they could have come up with as well. Second while the graphics are good SOMEONE needs to come up with a true 1080p mega release from the ground up. Perhaps that will be GOWIII. I am excited about the planned expansion. I am definitely glad I got it. And I hope for more Bioware PS3 releases in the future and that they include multiplayer for future Dragon Age and KOTOR released. That and 1080P and the always interesting depth of story will put their releases in the forefront of PS3 games for years to come.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2010"}

The levels you play in are simply huge- I never felt like I had seen everything in a level- so replay level is quite high.  Meanwhile, the background music is a lot of fun, good enough to put you in a good mood if the rest of the game doesn't.  And the story- without ruining anything- has to be the product of mixing drugs and alcohol.  The controls are quite simple, employing only the analog sticks and a couple shoulder buttons (although I never found much use for the shoulder buttons).

Berk","summary":"Killer playground","reviewText":"Entertaining from beginning to end Bulletstorm is a stylish shooter with a serious potty mouth from developers People Can Fly and Epic Games.  Clearly taking inspiration from classic arcade shooters Bulletstorm features a light, breezy plot heavy on gunplay, power ups, and colorful locations.  If you're looking for a game that emphasizes fun and a colorful art style over narrative and innovation than you've found your game.In Bulletstorm the player is let loose into a world where each kill earns them points (the more creative the kill the more points earned).  Did I mention that the world happens to be an abandoned amusement park located on an alien planet?  Sadly there's nothing truly spectacular about the game's gunplay.  Boss fights in particular are a frustrating disappointment.  The lasso (a beam of light you can grab and throw opponents with) is an outstanding idea which I had a lot of fun playing with, but there isn't enough to truly set Bulletstorm apart from other shooters.The bosses in Bulletstorm actually have giant glowing \"shoot here!\" spots, a trope I thought had disappeared from gaming years ago.  On top of that not a single one of them offers much of a challenge.  An arcade style shooter like this should have made its boss battles the highlight of the game, but all they amount to is a slight roadblock between levels.The story has some nice touches here and there, but ultimately isn't anything you'll be raving about.  Each character in Bulletstorm is a caricature acting more like a cartoons than actual human beings.  There is the grizzled, alcoholic leader, a tough as nails woman with an attitude,  and an all-business cyborg.  Those are the three characters most interacted with in Bulletstorm, and while they certainly sport some fun dialogue one never feels overly attached to them.  They, like the plot, lack true focus.  This prevents you, the gamer, from entering their world and as a result the world just isn't as magical as it should have been.Bulletstorm, like its setting, is an amusement park.  It's fun but ultimately lacks substance.  There's nothing innovative about the game play and the story won't engage a gamer on any emotional level.  Does that make it a bad game?  Not really.  It is a fun game from start to finish (grab a buddy for co-op!) and it certainly has a unique charm to it.  I'd recommend renting Bulletstorm, but if you see it for $10 or less I see no reason not to pick it up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2013"}

Now, I'm a fan of the franchise.  I own a lot of it.  All of it, actually, and twice on 360 and PS2 for the immediate predecessor of this installment.  So, hopefully you will trust me when I say that I am a fan of the gameplay and the franchise in general in this preface.It's kind of baffling what's happened with this game.  Neversoft has certainly recognized some of the shortcomings of its predecessor, but have somehow managed to not solve even one of those issues, and have, in fact, introduced new problems to be addressed.  I'll do this as a sort of point-by-point thing, to keep it organized:1.  Medium-to-Hard.  In Guitar Hero 2, the jump from Medium to Hard was only slightly more enjoyable than stepping in front of a speeding bus.  The main reason this was such a problem was that the game was very, very poorly designed for getting players over that average-to-hard hump.  For one thing, the initial two difficulty settings compel you to adapt your grip on the fretboard to leave your index finger on the green button, pinky on the blue button, and keep each assigned to its place.  With the introduction of the orange button, that's no longer really a viable strategy if you want to avoid crippling the weaker side of your hand.  Additionally, in 2, upon reaching hard difficulty, the speed of the notes down the fretboard doubled, the fifth button was introduced, and chords and note orders increased in complexity.  Those three things were enough to make hard a no-go for a lot of people in principle where a gentler slope would have taken care of that.In response, Neversoft has tried to reduce the impact of the change in difficulty by making the Medium notes move just about as fast as the Hard difficulty ones.  Unfortunately, instead of making the Medium to Hard transition easier (still very difficult because of the whole hand-training thing), it just makes the Easy to Medium transition much more jarring.  Hard is still so hard that I barely want to try it at all.2.  Uncomfortable Play - I swear, the designers have put some of these songs together specifically to be painful for me.  Seriously - playing Knights of Cydonia I thought I was going to cripple myself.  On Medium.  These guys really need to get some bad players into the office to see if they're not making something dangerous.  I should not find out that I'm bad at a game by giving myself a repetitive motion injury.3.  Guitar Battles - This is a new problem for the single player.  Guitar battles in multiplayer might be a good idea.  I don't honestly know.  Seems more interesting than a score-off to me.  Unfortunately, in single player, because of the way the attacks are set up, they're really just an exercise in coin flipping.  Some of the attacks are utterly crippling to the computer player while others, in addition to having a large delay before they become effective, essentially have no impact whatsoever.  If you get the good attacks while you're trying to play, you'll win.  If you don't, you lose.  Whether you're any good or not is really not of much relevance.  That's bad.  Guitar battles in single player, for me, tended toward exercises in frustration at the computer not giving me the tools I needed to succeed and not having any other recourse to win.  They need retooling.4.  Cooperative Campaign - This is a wonderful idea.  It really is.  But what half-brain decided that there should be exclusive tracks squirreled away in it that I cannot get to?  That's right - I am totally unable to unlock those tracks, because I cannot play the cooperative campaign online.  I'll confess - I'm old.  My friends are married and have families.  The only time I'm going to have somebody with another guitar at my house is if I throw a party, and I'm not really a party kind of guy.  That's not a good reason to keep me from playing frigging Sabotage if I want to.  I will grant that they have made the songs themselves available in online coop play, but nothing I do online seems to unlock anything for me to practice (and I SERIOUSLY need to practice Helicopter before I try THAT again).  Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but I'm going to assume I know what I'm doing.5.  Song List - Guitar Hero 2 was pretty good in this regard.  It had a good sampling from a broad spectrum of rock (maybe a little light on new stuff).  Guitar Hero 3 seems to be making a point of digging in the dustbins of rock history.  It's not that the songs are bad, but many of them are outside of my experience, and that puts me off.  I'm a child of the 90s.  This game seems to be a schizophrenic effort to appeal to younger people than me and to older people than me.  Some of the songs also puzzle me.  Kool Thing?  Really, guys?  I can't even tell what I'm supposed to be doing there.  It's barely a song.  There's better Sonic Youth.  There's a distressing number of songs where the lead guitar is nearly invisible, and that makes it kind of hard to play.  The number of master tracks is also disappointingly small, compared to its soon-to-be-released competitor, Rock Band.Don't get me wrong - the game is fun for what it is, but there's just so much here that could have been done better.  Should have, really.  I hope Neversoft takes some time on the next installment, puts in a fifth difficulty level (between Normal and Hard), and works out the kinks in their new stuff.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2007"}

Its time for Medusa to meet the power of light and only you can guide Pit to victory!The game comes packed with a black stand for use with your 3DS console.","reviewerName":"MisterMusicFan","summary":"Truly fantastic, and likely a classic in the making","reviewText":"In 1986, Nintendo released a (notoriously difficult) 2D platformer on the NES featuring a charming angel named Pit. Modeled closely after the mythological Cupid, he battled an array of devilish foes while wielding a bow and arrow, ultimately facing his nemesis, Medusa, AKA the \"Queen of Darkness.\" It was a nice concept and supposedly a nice game (I'd never played it myself), but one seemingly destined to be rather short-lived, as it saw no real sequel in a span of 26 years, unless of course you count the 1991 Game Boy follow-up, which didn't receive much attention.Fast forward to 2008 and Pit suddenly reappears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, among the most popular and widely known Nintendo franchises. This was surely hinting at a comeback of sorts, and sure enough we finally receive Kid Icarus: Uprising in 2012 (guess the Ice Climbers weren't as lucky).If you've been paying attention to any gaming magazines, sites or multimedia recently, chances are high you've come across some form of advertisement or promotional material for this game. Arguably one of the most heavily hyped Nintendo games in recent history, and surely the most hyped 3DS game, does Kid Icarus: Uprising live up to its vast array of promises? The short answer is yes, given that the game is undeniably fantastic and in fact arguably one of Nintendo's greatest triumphs ever. This shouldn't necessarily come as a surprise given that its chief developer is the creative mastermind Masahiro Sakurai, creator of iconic pink puffball Kirby and the Super Smash Bros. series. His games are most often innovative and colossally ambitious, but he may have just outdone himself with this one.Kid Icarus: Uprising offers an obscene amount of content (a trademark of Sakurai), ranging from an expansive 1-Player story mode to elaborate competitive online play, as well as a scattering of mini-games and other little goodies. The 1-Player mode is incredible, featuring stunning, colorful visuals and landscapes throughout a variety of storyline chapters (if you haven't been impressed yet by the 3D capabilities of the 3DS, I guarantee this game will bring you around). You begin each level soaring through the air via a predetermined route (the ascents and dives through gorgeous scenery make for intoxicating aesthetics-and fun), firing attacks at enemies while swerving around to avoid their own. Once again, Pit has teamed up with Lady Palutena, Goddess of Light and ruler of Angel Land (a Nintendo-ified Heaven, more or less. Appropriate, considering the quality of this game) to take on Medusa. The lovely green-haired deity will guide you through various stages and also engage in some entertaining banter with Pit; the dialogue is most often genuinely funny and serious when it needs to be without ever approaching levels of childishly obnoxious or cheesy depravity.Since Pit (for some unexplained reason) can't fly on his own, Palutena temporarily allows him the power of flight at the beginning of each stage, but once it runs out, you'll come crashing to the ground below. From here, the gameplay switches up and you'll be traversing through corridors and crevices while solving puzzles to reach new areas and battling enemies in the fray with both long range and melee attacks. There is a boss at the end of each stage, and similar to those you might fight in Zelda games, each one has individual weaknesses that may require use of specific techniques or strategies to defeat. You're free to adjust this mode's difficulty to your liking; the so-called \"Intensity\" scale, ranging between 1 and 10, determines how challenging things will be overall. The game's default is just above 2, and if you want much higher or lower than that you may have to spend hearts (the in-game currency, which can be won in various ways) to make large adjustments. To give you a better idea, extremely low Intensities make for absolute cakewalks, but go too high and I can pretty much guarantee you'll be destroyed in seconds, especially if you have yet to garner much experience. This is a nifty feature, as it allows swift interchange between veteran and newbie players. As you might expect, you'll unlock better goodies and win more hearts if you're daring enough to survive through higher Intensities.In both the single and multiplayer modes, you'll have a vast array of options to choose from as to which weapon(s) you'd like to duel with. Taking notes from many popular MMOs, Kid Icarus: Uprising offers a massive variety of weapon classes, each of which have individual strengths and weaknesses, some of which handle extremely differently between one another and can completely change gameplay mechanics. There are melee weapons that excel at taking down nearby opponents like Claws, Clubs and Blades, while long-range classes like Bows, Staffs and Cannons can snipe opponents from afar. You'll have the option of experimenting with the weapon of your choice before taking it out on the field, but you'll have to play through the game and win online matches to unlock the most powerful and diverse ones. This isn't to say that anyone will necessarily be at a huge disadvantage starting out, however, as it is possible to master most any weapon available upon practice and recognition of its best accompanying techniques. In addition to differences in power and range, different types of weapons can even have different effects on your opponent or yourself, such as increases in speed or defense or the capability to inflict status conditions such as poison or paralysis, which can further hinder oncoming enemies. The variety of options here is so vast it's staggering, but it's expansive features like this that give online play that huge replay factor.Speaking of the online play, it is expectedly one of the most appealing and highly addictive aspects of the game. The 3DS and in fact Nintendo in general has tended to downplay the relevance of online capabilities, which is truly unfortunate given that online play seems to be what offers most games their greatest replay value nowadays. Thankfully, the competitive online play in Kid Icarus: Uprising is raucous fun and an expertly executed feature. You can team up with (or duel against) friends or random opponents via either local wireless or online worldwide. The online multiplayer is split into two primary modes, Light VS. Dark and Free-for-All; as you might expect, the latter equates to a straightforward death match in which everyone is out for themselves, while Light VS. Dark is a unique team battle in which each team shares one collective health bar, which progressively depletes as teammates take damage. The player responsible for taking the blow that finishes off the team health transforms into that team's Angel; in this form, they take on the appearance of Pit and are equipped with a random (but usually more powerful) weapon. Once you become the Angel, your best bet is to flee or snipe from afar, because a team loses once their Angel is defeated.All multiplayer matches make for truly addictive fun, and the fact that there are so many weapon classes to select from can make for an invigoratingly different experience each time. You can win various goodies, such as new weapons, hearts and more, by performing well in online matches. Shockingly, lag is virtually non-existent and the gameplay is unexpectedly fluid amidst such frantic battling. Nitpicks may notice minor framerate changes in particularly chaotic moments, but experiencing a fluid online mode (in 3D) on a handheld console is sheer gaming bliss.In addition to choosing your diverse weaponry, you'll even have the option of equipping specific \"Powers\" to your character, or special abilities that can offer assistance to you or hinder enemies in both single and multiplayer modes; these Powers can be used at will but only for a limited number of times per match. You can do things like inflict paralysis or confusion, auto-target nearby foes, perform command jumps, veil your opponents' vision in darkness, create massive cyclones to send nearby foes skyward, and much more. Customizing these Powers to best enhance your strategy or weapon class can set up some devastating scenarios for your opponents. As if this isn't enough, there are also items you can snatch throughout matches and stages, whose effects vary from granting increased strength or abilities to initiating wild super-attacks.The much debated control scheme is arguably the only thing the average person might complain about in this game, but in all honesty it doesn't exactly deserve the atrocious rap some have given it. To control Pit or your online avatar, you use the Circle Pad to move, dash or sidestep, and the L Button to fire attacks. Pressing and holding L fires continuous shots (better at long range, obviously) while it can be mashed to perform melee combos up close. The stylus is used on the touch screen to dictate the crosshair and aim fire; you can also make quick swishes and sweeps to change the direction you're facing. This might sound wonky at first and yes, admittedly, it's unlikely anyone will be playing this game for long without some kind of solid surface beneath the console. Luckily, Kid Icarus: Uprising comes prepackaged with a free Nintendo 3DS stand, which allows you to prop the 3DS up at a certain height and maintain it at eye level. This not only makes playing the game much easier, but it also greatly decreases the likelihood of losing the top screen's 3D sweet spot. The stand is also frankly very likely to come in handy for other games that make heavy use of the stylus and touch screen. Players will also have the option of customizing various settings, including the control scheme, to their preferences (left-handed players can use buttons as a D-pad, etc.); there is also Circle Pad Pro compatibility. Although the controls will take some getting used to for most players, once you're accustomed you'll be zipping around while maintaining solid control over your character.It's quite rare that we come across a video game with passion; i.e. one you can tell the developers put a great deal of time, effort and diligent care into. Kid Icarus: Uprising is one such game. It is a beautiful game, plain and simple; with a startlingly impressive variety of modes, content, charming storyline, endearing characters, and that one little thing that tends to matter most-that desire to keep coming back to it again and again-it is an absolute must-have title, and could frankly easily go down as one of Nintendo's all-time classics (which is no small statement). If you own a 3DS and don't have this game, you really should stop reading this review and go experience one of the greatest games available right now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

When the first SIms was out, it was a groundbreaking genre. Totally open-ended and you control the lives of people called SIMS. With the updated graphics which are phenomenal and some tweakings but not much, the game still is one of my favorites that I still play today. Whenever I am playing it my fiance loves----wooohooo. Its hillarious and Im surprised no attention was put on this aspect. Instead more attention was on the cheat code that takes the block off the naked blur. geez cant people find something else to wine about. The sims parts are not even represented (yeah Im guilty of using the code lol).I own all of the expansions (except university, glamour and family fun pack). I just preordered the SIMS2: Pets and I plan on buying university. If you like to have total control, open ended gameplay, I highly recommend this game. I was disapointed with the sims having lifespans but that can be turned off so you can play your sim for a while. I found out the hard way after a few hours my sim died of old age.it would be nice if you can actually drive a car and go to the job your sim works at. A little more animation on your block and neighborhood would be nice. Computers are a lot powerful now than when the SIMS2 came out. I highly recomend a CORE2 duo processor. I just built mine and wow what a difference playing the SIMS2 than on a P4.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2006"}

Garrelts","summary":"An Average FPS with Mild RPG Elements","reviewText":"When I first heard of the concept behind Borderlands I immediately got excited about the prospect of playing a cooperative Role-Playing-Game online with a good friend. In the gaming press more than one passing comparison was made between Borderlands and Diablo, \"Diablo with guns!\" was one term used. Being a huge fan of Diablo my anticipation for Borderlands only grew.As soon as the game was released a good friend and I purchased our copies and jumped online for some co-op goodness. For the first 4-6 hours I loved Borderlands but after that the shortcomings started becoming more and more apparent.I guess the most major issue I have with this game is that there is a paper-thin story. This is something that may not bother some but being a fan of RPGs it most definitely bothered me. You'll find yourself in the role of one of four selectable mercenaries on a remote planet called Pandora. Pandora in essence is a horrible place to live and was only colonized in order to mine mineral deposits. It's soon discovered that there's very little of value on the planet and most settlers with the means to do so simply leave the planet. Those that are left eek out a living Mad Max style. Bandits run amok in the Wasteland as do feral creatures known as Skaggs and a few more enemy types.There are some alien ruins which rumor has it hold some sort of incredible power. That's why you find yourself on Pandora, investigating those alien ruins. Each of the four characters specializes in different things. Mordocai is a \"hunter\" class character who specializes in sniper rifles and best suited to engaging enemies from afar. Brick is a \"berserker\" and serves as the games tank character specializing in close range combat. Lilith is a \"siren\" and the games only female character. Her specialty is small arms and speed. Finally, Roland is the games \"soldier\" class specializing in machine guns. Each character also features a special ability - Mordecai for example can use his pet eagle, Bloodwing to attack enemies. Roland can deploy a shielded sentry turret for taking down swarms of bad guys. Each character features their own skill trees and as you level up you can assign points in the skill tree to increase damage, accuracy, gain new abilities and inflict elemental damage. The upgrade system is pretty generic stuff that has been done in games before. The main problem with the characters and leveling system is that eventually every character feels exactly the same outside of their respective special attacks. So while you may start out playing Mordecai as a sniper, you'll eventually discover that he's just as good using a machine gun, rocket launcher or revolver.That leads to other problems with the game. Because every class is a jack of all trades, playing online devolves into mindless shoot everything as fast as you can matches. Also because Borderlands doesn't feature much of a storyline and relies heavily on sidequests much of the game becomes a mindless shooting gallery. Go to town `X', speak with character `Y', go to location `Z' and retrieve `item q'. Rinse and repeat over and over and over again. It's mindless and while initially fun it gets old quick.There are boss battles in the game which could've been so much more. The boss battles are ultimately mindless, run backward while blasting away affairs. It's funny that a gameplay mechanic perfected in Doom so many years ago is still being used in modern games like Borderlands.The other much touted element of Borderlands that was much touted before release is the looting. Spread everywhere throughout the game is chests containing various types of guns and modifiers for your guns. The problem is that 99% of the stuff you find is garbage that's only purpose is to be sold in towns for money. Much of the game is simply spent running from chest to chest looting what you can carry, tossing less valuable items and moving to a town to sell those items. Occasionally you'll stumble on a rare item which is actually worth equipping. Again, the entire system is dull, monotonous and repetitive.There are a few things about Borderlands that merits praise. The graphics art style is cell-shaded which I'm a fan of. The game is colorful and bright. The environments are significantly varies while maintaining a central theme. Gearbox did a fantastic job rendering the world of Pandora. If only they had made it an interesting place.The online co-op is definitely the games saving grace. It's always fun to play online with a good friend, cracking jokes - even if it is at the games expense.Technically there are some glitches in the game. There are some well publicized trophy issues - mainly the game not awarding trophies when it should. Additionally there are display glitches with the game where parts of the sky start to flash big blocky pixels of various colors. Another big issue was that that the game was resetting a characters stat level mid-way through after saving. So for example if I were playing as Mordecai and my sniper rifle level was mid-way through level 15 and I saved and quit the game. The next time I started a session my sniper rifle level would be reset to the beginning of level 15, wiping out a lot of progress. Problems like these are extremely frustrating particularly the leveling glitch.All in all Borderlands will be loved by those that can overlook the games many, many problems and focus solely on the fun of the co-op element. To others I would strongly recommend buying Fallout 3 instead or getting a real RPG or just regular FPS. Borderlands is a rental at best.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2010"}

It might have seemed even longer to me, because when I got it on the 24th of March PSN also released a Systems Update. So I had to wait for that to download/install. I started the game. RB6V2 had a patch (1.10). So I had to wait for that to download/install (this one was short). After that the game had to install itself. This took about as long as the Sys Update. It was just kind of ironic since I was anxious to get started.RB6V2 is a good sequel. I had tried out the first, and it was just ok. The sequel is more enjoyable in my opinion. The ranking system and the new ACES system that allows for you to gain XP and weapons based on your style of play is a nice / welcome touch.Within a couple of levels I noticed my \"Marksman\" and \"CQB\" XP rose very quickly as opposed to my \"Assault\" XP. So it depends on your personal style of play. Tag a headshot on a guy through a window while repelling will earn you points toward Marksman, while chucking a grenade into a room will get you well on your way towards the next Assault tier. And every other level rewards you with another weapon; while the Ranking system (total XP) seems to be more geared towards personalizing your character.I especially liked this feature, and am looking forward to unlocking some features later in the game. Just remember that while outfitting your character, certain camo-styles are NOT appropriate for all terrain/situations!(Kinda like Corky Romano, Brick: \"Nice tie.\" Corky: \"Thanks!\" Brick: \"It should give some lucky sniper a nice target to aim for.\")I also like how you can play through Single-Player (or Co-Op) to gain XP, which can be used Online as well. CoD4 had a similar system, but XP was only gained for ranks, and could only be gained online.Heh... speaking of which, unfortunately it took me a second or two to get used to the controls after playing CoD4, the L1 is now \"Cover\" as opposed to the Weapon Scope, which is R3. Made for a couple \"interesting\" firefights when I first started.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2008"}

It was a completely new style of art for the game, and being the die hard FF VI fan I was it was unacceptable... but then I actually played the game. I was very upset when FF IX took a drastic step backwards in it's visual presentation. I'd grown fond of the more realistic art found in VIII.Lately Square's efforts have been less than stellar. The Bouncer was a joke, and Driving Type Emotion-S will dissapear into the world of games so bad you shouldn't lay them sober. FF IX left me with little hope for the series. FF X, however has revived it.This game may not be \"filmed\" as well as Metal Gear Solid, but it is still the work of artistic genious. While it is not the graphical marvel I had hoped for, it is still a visual treat considering the limitations of the PS2. The graphics rotate from FMV, to great to medicore depending on the character, the amount of characters on screen, etc. Many of the less important characters have a low polygon count and are not textured very well, but then you have characters like Auron who are so incredably detailed it almost makes you froget that there are two drastically more powerful systems out there.Square has ended the endless reading that their games are known for, opting for voice acting instead, and while the voice actors are mediocre at best this was probably the best thing about this game. The voices and facial animations made the characters more real and it became easier to see these charcters as people, rather than just polygons.The music in this game is slightly better than FF IX, but still leaves something to be desired, FFD  VI and VIII had the best soundtracks of the series, and Umeatsu and his co-writers didn't seem quite up to the task of outdoing his previous works.The story is the games best feature. The story can come off as being somewhat anti-religious at points, but really isn't. Like Xenogears before it it carries an important message about being careful about what we believe, and how we let other people control us through questionable traditions and the threat of damnation (or in this case Sin.) Despite this theme, the game is far from anti-religious. It's ending is (as with tradition) somewhat of a heart wrencher, yet it keeps a positive spin on things. My only complaint is that it would have been nice if the love story aspects of the game were better thought out. I don't know how or why Tidus and Yuna got together, they just kind of did... Not like Rinoa and Squall who had quite the love story.Gameplay, FF X is the most fun of the series to play. There's so many new gameplay elements. Everything that was tidious about past instalments is gone. Switching characters at a save spots to keep everone built up? Gone. Switching out any time duriing a battle! Why didn't they think of that sooner? The traditional leveling up system is gone, in it's place an innovative sphere grid that takes some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it? This is hands down the best system for an RPG ever. Without a doubt FF X is inarguably the best of the series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2002"}

No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives.

James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit.

But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"\"ryan_the_fps_ruler\"","summary":"THE game that spawned the console shooter legacy","reviewText":"My N64, it acts like a rock sitting right there under my tv.

{"product_name":"B000034DMG","reviewerName":"T. Jones","summary":"May Perfection be Realized!","reviewText":"How many words can be used to sum up this game? How about AWESOME!Okay, it's dated. The graphics aren't sharp and the voice acting is sub par. Their mouths don't move and the characters look like they were made out of melted lego blocks. But Kids, this was an era where every other game was either side-scrolling or full of platforms. This game was a welcome change to the monotiny of racing games, platform games, and horror games that did not scare us anymore.The story? Well, it's science gone awry of course! A scientist does not want his experiment stolen, so he releases it onto himself and kills his attackers, then the experiment is released accidently as rats drink up the remains of a broken vial. As rats tend to do, they spead the disease and the city is covered in zombies. A girl named Clare (who is dressed inappropirately for a zombie outbreak, but well enough for a frat party) comes into town searching for her brother. Leon arrives too, a rookie cop eager to start his new profession, only to find his fellow officerse are now shambling through the streets killing anything that moves and breaths. Sure, you could find a similar plot in a Scy-Fy channel budget movie, but this game executes the story so well! There are zombies, mutant monsters, and a Frankenstein Monster-like monster called Mr. X. That big Trench Coat Guy was so menacing... my mother was watching me play one day and the big guy exploded out of a wall, surprising my mother, and forever more he would be called Mr. OH S***! Ah... fond memories...Characters? Well, I will not lie, Clare is a tom-boy in tight cut-off shorts. Leon is a whiny looser who suffers from some sort of inferiority complex. The Police Chief is a nut. The scientist who caused the outbreak is one fry short of a whole happy meal. The little girl side-kick is unnecessary but a nice addition. And Ada, the asian spy, is completely dull. Each character, due to the limitations of the system, can only move their arms and bodies to convey emotion, as the faces are merely plastered on a square head. Often they will move thier hands as they talk to convey apathy, disgust, horror, or anger. This is well done in the game, but the limitations of the technologies of the time show like a festering pimple. Still, it holds up.Zapping? Well... that's what they call it anyway. It just means that at two points scenarios affect each other. See, there are four scenarios. Leon A, Clare B, Clare A, Leon B. Bounus modes are unlocked by beating the game with a high score (ie, not using your first aid or finishing within a certain ammount of time). The scenarios of the two characters interesct at two pivotal points (An item pick-up and a puzzle choice) and that's it. Don't get me wrong, the gimmic is okay, but it is barely \"zapping.\"The Music? Well, aside from the credit music, there isn't really a soundtrack. But the background music is subperb! Really, the subtle music cues are exactly what the game needs to convey emotion, urgency, peace, and outright chaos! If you do not run near the end when the sirens are going off with the threat of a facility explosion (only to realized you can take your time) then you are clearly taking riddiline!The gameplay? The characters control like forklifts. They are stiff, responsive to a degree, and varied. The enemies attack in various ways, mostly clinging to you and taking a bite out of your collar bone, and your only defense is the weapons scattered through the area and the meager munitions availble in the infested police station. To flesh out the game there are many puzzles. You will run back and forth, checking the map, and looking at odd ends of puzzle parts (Fuzes, tiles, cables, ect.) and trying to figure out where to shove what. That and avoiding getting your last ounce of life taken from you makes for an intense experience.The game is intense! Oh yes! You would not think so when you see the start screen and a giant crocodile is staring at you with a bloodshot eye, but from the very first moment of gameplay you are thrust into a world of zombies. The stiff controls, narrow corridors, ambient music, and the shambling groaning enemies make for a sharp gameplay experience. Many times you will find yourself cornered with barely enough ammo to escape and the prospect of a boss after finishing the many smaller enemies.Replay? As previously stated, the game has four scenarios not including bounus modes. Each scenario takes around two hours to complete. So, in a FAST play through there is eight hours of gameplay. In a regular session you could expect to take anywhere from six days to half a month finishing the two stories. Basically, there are TWO GAMES with this one game. You can start as Leon and finish as Clare, or Start as Claire and end as Leon. The stories change with both tellings and it is worth playing through both! Moreover, the bousus modes are decent. There are alternate costumes, a time attack mode, a Toffu Time attack mode (Where you play as a giant block of Tuffu), and Arrange Mode (Should you get the Dual Shock version). Arrange mode is basically a mode where they hold your hand for you. They give you a gun with infinite ammunition and let you go.If you have a Playstaion system, any of them, then get a copy of this game. In fact, if you have a Gamecube then buy the version released for that system. If you have PSN, then buy it there if they have it. It is worth every penny.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2011"}

Rhodes","summary":"Too Much of the Same Thing","reviewText":"Nintendo's Animal Crossing series began with a good set of wings.  It was originally released for the Gamecube in 2002 and recently, just a couple of years ago, it came to the DS.  Animal Crossing City Folk brings the franchise to the Wii.  Unfortunately, there's really nothing here that separates it from the pack.  It was new and exciting on the Gamecube so there were few complaints.  The DS brought it to the handheld was far superior.  But City Folk has the hitch of being the third game.  The series isn't new anymore and by the time you get to the third game it's time to start upgrading things or doing them differently.  Especially when you're coming into a New Generation.Animal Crossing: City Folk is much like the previous outings.  You can transfer some of your data from the DS over, but it'll mostly be the things you've collected.  It won't be your home and everything else.  This sounds appealing but in truth, you're still going to have to build your way up.There are a lot of things to do in City Folk.  You can go fishing, pick vegetables, mingle with neighbors, decorate your home and go visit other towns that people are in.  You can interact with the denizens in Animal Crossing though it certainly isn't as fun or as interacting with friends via Wii Speak.  That's not all the Wii makes use out of.  You can use motion sensor controls to do such things as moving your character by pointing and clicking or by swinging the Wii remote to cast your fishing rod or swing your net.  This is well and good, but the motion sensor controls here feel like an after thought.For the most part you'll be shopping in Animal Crossing.  It's a simulation of real life.  You'll find that each and every day there's something new to do.  Animal Crossing, however, isn't one of those games that's really made for you to spend hours on at a time.  In fact, there will be times you'll find yourself simply spending a couple of minutes.  Maybe someone will ask you to get something for them or perhaps you can check out the store and see what there is to buy, but you'll find that for much of what it's worth, there's nothing to do in City Folk.  This was exactly why the game worked better on a handheld rather than the console.  Certainly there's a lot you can do in one day but there's very little that keeps you coming back to the game after you've already explored what there is.  And this is mainly because there's not much added to the game that you couldn't do in the DS or Gamecube games.  Even some of the dialog spoken by the characters is the exact same as before.  So if you've already got the Gamecube version or (even better) the DS version there's no real incentive to pick up City Folk.Obviously, the city is the big new addition.  It serves as mainly another shopping center to buy several things at.  It would've been nice to be able to live in the city or get into city life.  You can get into city life... to a certain extent by visiting places like the auction house or the comedy club but there's nothing too exciting about it.  In fact, the most fun you'll find yourself having in the game is outside the city or visiting friends.  It's a shame the city isn't more enticing or more alive.Animal Crossing has never been the greatest looking game.  In 2002 when it came to the Gamecube, it was revealed the game was originally in development for the Nintendo 64.  Those visuals haven't changed too much.  You'll find a couple of smoother textures but the point is, it looks almost exactly like the Gamecube game in 2002 and the DS game released in 2005.  So there hasn't even been a visual upgrade over the years.Arguably a game that uses many of the same trends tends to be a good thing.  It means it was doing something right before.  Animal Crossing certainly was.  However, there is such a thing as too much of the same thing.  There's so little new content in City Folk that the list price is asking for a bit too much and Wii Speak alone isn't worth picking it up for.  If you have played either Animal Crossing game before, the Wii game isn't going to give you too much more than what you've already got.  It might be enticing if you've never played Animal Crossing, but even then, Wild World on the DS is a better choice.  If Nintendo had added a lot more to City Folk or at least hammered down the list price it might've been more worthwhile.  City Folk certainly isn't bad, there's just not much point to picking it up if you've got the original Gamecube game or Wild World on the DS.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2008"}
